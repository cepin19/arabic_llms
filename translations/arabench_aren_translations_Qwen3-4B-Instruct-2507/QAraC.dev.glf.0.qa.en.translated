Oh Asya, heal her
I am trying to learn it
You're saying that because we've been friends so much, we won't ever part ways
Say the truth, brother, just go and get married.
I say what is true, but I do not say anything true about her brother, and she would be embarrassed.
The conversations are hollow; lately, every day I tell you, "Sayed, do you want to be with her?" And today, this is about his brother.

Sure, here is the translation: And Allah knows, I am with Salem Rafi in the job.
Chaja
Line 1: I want, I want
The phone sometimes causes problems at home.
Sometimes when you say "what made you leave, meaning your friend, why didn't you stay with us, the rule with you?"
It means, by God, sometimes sometimes I can reach God's help to get me out of this.
And it will drive you away after
You're the first one to release
Lala la ma ma7dar ykhay
Beat my mother in her grave
Mom advised me to
She told me not to release
Lala, it's impossible
I don't know what you mean
Lala kh kh kh khelk khelk
Look, you're not supposed to be natural
We did not bring you, O Ya'k
Tell me what that means, because my father doesn't understand it.

Salem himself considers among the best young people in the area.

He says to me: "I divorced, finally, finally, means, stay, I released them."

God gives you, guide you, gives you
Hala la la wala shi wala shi
This is me with her
So we can meet in the morning with the female delegation that we're going to meet
Female delegation
Heal me, heal me, I'm tired today
Al Wasseel
I'm your brother Khemis
No, and by God, I spoke with him, by God.
Hey Joe
I'll change my name so they don't ban you
Ashlon means to erase your name
The only one who can erase your name is Minister Saeed, and that's it.
Hey brother, this is a ministry meeting
Official social meeting
Who is making a fuss about it?
Salem Salem Salem
My statement is the truth
Who were you arguing with, and you were behind the tank?
Salem Salem, Allah and Salem
As long as you're arguing with Salem
You're saying and what about them?
Ali I am
O Ali, I am indeed, O Khamsa
Means the man who says the "saj" here
No, and why should I go on?
Vini, yahook, I need only me
Ashhaleesha returned
The one who converted you, Salam, please call
The one who converted you so I can give alms
Ahoh the one who told you to call
You are the owner of the job
I won't get involved in things that don't concern you, and you know what I'm doing with you after all.
Complained about you
Wa hi anta
You're alive and only one of the long-lasting ones
Let's start the meeting now
You've lived a long life, good, you'll be safe this Friday
Alright, let's start by discussing the property's budget first.
They agreed
Say "God willing, I'll see you again."
I tell you right away when I see women, I'm afraid.
Lift on you the full responsibility and you are here now
Oh my God, oh my God, the group is waiting for you in the meeting room.
How long can I stay with the women?
O Khemis, why are you so ignorant?
I'm afraid you'll contact
You're just doubting me, man, you don't understand me
Icon Erin and Machelle after she left the house
Your wife Di won't contact you except during this hour
Of course, you are a bigger company.
This project your company is carrying out for our ministry
One of the largest projects in the history of the Ministry
O my friends, the table is shaking
You won't live long enough to enjoy this table, I'm telling you.
Wait for my reply
Who's with me
Syrian man, student
Telefonica for the EU
Moment by moment I'm saying
Actually, he fainted because he was afraid to go back to their house.
My God, his brother
He said to me: "If you die, don't leave this work with the women, don't leave the house."
So that's why the minister submitted a speech so they can take it from our section
With his own eyes he told me that the minister agreed to it, meaning he agreed to whatever you wanted after that.
Hey brother, what's going on here?
This is January
I'll tell you, Khumis Asolf, with whom?
I tell you, my master
Now you're doing something your wife isn't doing, and the kids are coming really mad.
And as for me, I am not sure.
And you carried out her request, why didn't you just let me go back home and see your family?
So she can officially confirm it
Anzin gave him the papers
This one I made, I gave it to my brother, he gave it to his brother.
So she can see the minister's signature and make sure
God willing, if we meet, God willing tonight we can go back home, God willing.
My brother, and the minister's signature
After hesitation
Tomorrow the new section will continue.
It means leaving the office early and taking up something else than what was there.
Any path of this section, God will Islam you
Oh God, protect him, and this is the minister's authorization
Neither that nor that is under your right hand
Ain na, ain na, Allah islam
This is this ready-to-use toolkit
And Saad and Abdulqader and Mushaallah, meaning the chief office, yes.
With Salamah
Do you need to request a transfer?
By God, all of them are women.
The lady says
No one else can take a second decision except the Minister himself.
You are under pressure to follow the Minister's instructions, which originate from there.
Hey, you agreed with your colleague?
And you called them by the name of Riaiel so your wife wouldn't recognize you
And I left the committee with two extra days for the dedicated employee.
The female employee is the female employee
From the minister's office, converted 1000 riyals to aidaom with us
From Sajjāt
And shape it for you, on that imagine a real spy between five female relatives, shaped by him.
But they say to her husband, "You're attracted to someone else, who is it?"
ghar eh omiye
Poor fellow in his condition
But he asked us, if his wife calls, to say that we didn't speak and stayed quiet.
Ahmed Abdul Qader, the one with you in the office
This is what happens to me, you're in her, and that's all
And I called my mother to say that I had gone to the office.
Ishq eed a tawsi
Roh Sida, first right door
This is the Care Office
With five women's oboes
These are the staff members
He is present, I assure you, he is continuous.
No, not on this front
This is my life, I want it for myself.
I'm nice
Now Allah guides you, O Sultan
We just want people to know where we've arrived
Uncle, the thing is that me and my brother Sakr were at the bank yesterday.
See that what is in this area is legitimate
Hello to you all
Bro, I have an important meeting at work.
Oh my God, my kitchen spirit has returned, hurry up, oh my God
Now I'm wearing it to come out
Actually, the intended one should be a kitchen mix
What we have is a haram, I won't obey the rajjail, Allah's sake.
And the scorpion, if it becomes angry, Allah's punishment would be sufficient for its sting.
Hah this is the real rain, essential, see see
Show uncle
Aisha and the one who Islamed contacted the secretary and informed the staff
He says to them that Aminir left the meeting today early in the morning.
Best God willing
Aipsdron for these commands
Oh well, if we hadn't carried it out
The duty is clear, you know, it's a major responsibility.
And the connections and responsibilities
They only have one maid.
I haven't seen anyone in my life look down on people like them.
For now we are living in this first era
Don't go up, I won't let you leave the kitchen and tidy up the house.
The services and amenities
The second one was scattered, and it became a week for her.
Even the servants have not escaped their insults.
With them, they have the right to go ahead
Allah ayeinj
The notes from the bank were simple.
The Jay
Uncle, what do you mean by that? What are you talking about?
Actually, Malah's villa complex has no garden
Inzen the garden sometimes
I told him before we didn't go with that proposal
My love Fathoma, I have to go late to work
Azin Yalhah tell me, "Oshendj ha"
Are you saying that and then I go?
And the class at school
Returned to the Women's Union Committee of the Union
The school chose me for playing and not for the selection team.
Anti-Minoneh
Now you're telling me you're going to the national team?
Darin if you think, you'll say truth, my uncles and aunts, these Hajjis, they resemble in appearance.
You're blaming yourself alone
This is us warning you
Ain't you telling me what you said about her, treating her with peace? I've been waiting for you since the day I first met you, Yebah.
Ainbo seneh seneh magofk
Your husband and the rest after that
By God, guide me
From a person who takes one, has no knowledge, no certificate, and knows nothing about God, I guide you.
Lala la, what's wrong with the real if he's not a student?
After that, this Thursday is the day of the lizards.
His bite held him
What is there that does not take except what is at its level
Like a scorpion
Allah ayeinj
Sheswai ya 'Aishah
The minister traveled, and all transactions are now handled by me.
And saying the truth, Mustafa, head of the Resources Department, said, "We are facing a crisis."
But look, the ministers have arrived today.
The program you have
Now I turn to you, O Ayaish.
Ha Maryam
Azzin Yalalah Ya'ih Ya'ih now Yalalah

Moulay Hiba, we need masks so he doesn't blow up.
We warned them and said: "Do not say to them."
She said to them, "Let them go and let them leave."
Would you tell them that I hate it?
John, what's your time zone?
You play AFL football
The guy broke his neck
Tell me from aiklajm
The Cucurbita vine
The big one
Anyway, uncle, I didn't escape Sultan, only he escaped.
O words
I chose economics and political sciences.
Honestly, I chose graphics because in recent times this specialization is in demand.
Architectural geometry
Your turn
You took your chance
Ambition is not my father and I am not your father
Tamer Yalqarab
Break them, shatter them, break their bones, dislocate them
Guide me to it
Kahi machtoweh handi ahni amsh
You are dismissing the missions
And watchtwin specialize in architectural engineering
Take it as a challenge
so you'll get angry
Sultan and Hawkeye, hear me out
They have no obstacle in Isoguncker Amirah.
I followed after
No Thursday born child deserves it
They will meet you at the agreed time and inform you, Allah willing.
Recommendation from the delegation's majority
I'm able to afford it
But Atta gave me a chance to join
I'm saying it frankly
Are you interested in Jiggy Wade
And appointing from above
Is he right?
Brothers, and I know them
It's impossible for them to agree.
I'm astonished by them
Their salary deductions for expenses
And I'm the one who spends on the house
No, don't leave me after you say "travel" and leave me
We're definitely planning to marry her this week.
You guys say that you do
Khamis al-Ahbal who doesn't even have a secondary school certificate
Married him and traveled with him
O science, Allah!
And indeed, Allah has forbidden them what they associate with Him.
If you protect them, they will slaughter them.
O Yabeh, it's like a lie they told you
And whatever I leave behind
From Bajir from Bajir, Allah willing
And you have no protection from the scorpion, son of scorpions.
Even if my brother is not in the situation
I didn't marry on Thursday
My kitchen soul
And let them stay in the Salah
Night match between Real Madrid and Barcelona
God willing, we won't be left out in Valencia
I eat from reliable sources
Loyal and devoted to their work
It means the partners in the current situation
We confused ourselves
We are overwhelmed by it.

Thank you, may it last forever

What do you mean by taking his minister?
God willing, peace be upon you
Yes, auntie
The spirit in it is Wos and only one second
Actor Connections
I came back earlier, I didn't tell you my feelings yet.
Shaqulah after
It's forbidden for you to take on the role of a novice; it's never suitable for personal feelings.
Noof, whose age is six years
And emotions that swirl around you mean twenties
Inzen Leish won't take Mary's role
This fits better
Role of Noor Thirty
You took from us what we had from the committee
This is a problem, I'm not sure if it's a bug.
And he will show us the unit
He appeals to you about art, family values, and meaningful, materially grounded art.
This is what they put in front of us in the committee
The minister is the one who caused the committee's problem
Me and you and Hamad can do it, but this one.
Lala la impossible
Actually, there's nothing that proves it's mine or even hers, Allah knows best.
Even if he visits the economy and asks
After we met with Asamina
I entrusted the company to you yesterday, registered it under my wife's name, Hamid.
From this area, I do not have any information.
Later, he assured the committee head that I am not.
It means the last word will be the key one.
Lala will be everything perfect for you, for you
Tony took their side and agreed with them on everything
Hello to you all
Peace be upon you. Hello, Professor Rashid, may I ask you something?
And just as you know, you know that society has a specific rule regarding consent in the case of a rape series.
And that is from the production of the Contemporary Arts Institute.
A sweet, strange, bold action series
I'm with Hamid
The plot of the series is quite good
I'm with you, Hamid
What impressed me most was when the mother took the pistol and shot two neighbors.
Why are you afraid of the pistol that's in the car?
Do you know this car and its offspring are action every day, searching for the condition?

And it is nice that a local company has advanced to this level of work.
We have to encourage them and take their hands.
But brother Rashid, we haven't heard your opinion.
You made therein a brother named Rashid.
With my respect for your opinions and impressions about this series, called "The Rape of Zmier"
And violation of human values
Surprises hit us
Admi and notes in each episode
The text is the truth of the part that follows
A written series without social awareness
Her message has no purpose to improve society.
Adomoo atahthel means you have to show the scene
Rashid, if you don't mind
You said your opinion on what the teacher Rashid said, I said my opinion, after that I said my view.
And make it clear from the Ilishe
It means I'm just standing here smelling the smell of an agreement between you.
Organize the matters
In some people they understand it, and that's their specialty, while in others they have no connection with it.
I'm watching this series
I'm afraid we'll get into trouble and cause problems for ourselves.
What is due to you from it?
I can't do it, my dad can't do anything either.
I'm walking my path
Jan gives me the clay and says "This is from Mama Samirah."
I came back not knowing what happened
You don't believe me, do you, Nasser?
Ahoh the series that I watched the whole time with my brother on the internet
I know they raped their daughter
From the most good that we have seen behind him
First of all, obviously this nice seal that's on the ID card
I say they are going to do it
In the name of my wife Hamed who you took to the ring
And as for her husband, naturally his role was to manage matters and issues.
He has five percent of the work.
Role of sweetness
Tony Imahel played the role of a guy who was not found in the series "Mansoor's Rape", which was very good.
On the idea
A rape a rape what O Lord
Every violation of dreams
Why are all these fatty acids similar?
For example, back then, most series were all about girls.

I know that Rashed is going to meet the minister.
Are you saying you stayed with him for one hour?
He said this, "By the one you have been entrusted with."
I tell you, if you complain to us, say to me Zain.
The current situation is that the Minister's office is in contact with me to say they're asking me.
And I feared after the minister had confirmed it.
The minister is with me
Yani Real reaches his point of view in the series
No more
This is true, may your life be long
But first of all, Minister, I wanted to clarify a point—this is not something natural about me to talk about a fellow artist with me, who is not even here.
Allah, protect him, a wise man, everyone knows this feature in him.
Hates everyone around him
All material interests
But he's an expert
But your luck, God willing, means nothing to everyone, and you should change things in the technical aspects.
especially television work
A series about the rape of Zemir, Allah preserve him, the one we're currently working on
Carried out a bold move
On the Gulf level, Allah Islam will give us a media advantage.
and widespread proliferation
Of course, this is your specialty and you know it better than I do.
Condition of hollow series of Eibaz Weyh
and we raise our names above
But the one who wrote it, the journalist Abdulhameed, listen, listen, listen
But one of the actors commented saying
The series contains calls that are unethical.
He laments the decline in ethical and artistic taste in work.
And by God, it's bold speech and strong criticism.
Betbeldoun your group if they expose the journalist Abdulhameed
And when their words reach the officials
These people are smart, they know how to spot them.
By his staff
We want us to build a website between us
We put the company's all activities therein
The company asked me what my name is
Today and you're the media advisor
And the "Zamir Rape" series, produced by the company Artarad for artistic production, is considered.
A unique leap in Arab drama
What noble thoughts and values it carries
It is a series aimed at developing society.
The journalist Abdulhameed himself who criticizes them from the beginning
Came with reasonable, transferred the latitude and eighty degrees
Shawn this Abd al-Hamid is accepting himself in this way
The journalist Abdulhamid Waskhalah
Please reassure, Professor Hamid
I said my co-stars in the series, the show is reaching national level in the Arab world.
Allah hears from you
Hey my artistic community, I'm telling you our series is amazing.
This is what we don't know where he is
And this is how he carries his bag, he goes
Start I encourage
You are all just making up fictional stories that you see in TV series, things that never happen in our lives or have we ever heard of them.

Bain on him is peace and blessings
And we, our standard is on bad series
No one can understand it and catch it on the first try
In hidden threads and dimensions, it has a focus so that one can grasp what it's trying to say about this work.
On the political thought of this work
It is forbidden for them to narrate it to people.
Heal us

Yesterday, Morocco, me and Ali were standing at the market.
and sitting in a coffee shop
What did you give me and why
Nan Nasser, you are part of the discussion, if the minister is upset, this is not a big problem.
Within a week, we will all be back at our homes.
Allah and the series "Adal" made them all people who heard about it say it's a failure.
I hear that Rashed Nawai is going to him
Yeah, he tells him that the series is a failure, boring, and has no action.
See, it's affecting the fourth
Let's go out together
And in Jovon Naser Ashbiswi
Mean it, Eli?
From today, no one will post anything on your page criticizing the series.
Eli Ragai
I gave the job offer a few days ago, there was no cash for working there, a reason for working
Please don't let me get angry with you
Put it on him
But yesterday I had an opportunity
I would never say something like this if I weren't forced to.
But honestly, after all that, I don't have any message to thank you for the series.
Sho sho el yajah min qat7 al-nazir

The appropriation of the director's vision in television productions
You've lived a long life, this journalist, we agree on that.
Listen to the second newspaper, Ashkatabin
After that they will agree with people, read, read on the reading page
and my heart stood still
Why don't they tell me?
O you who are behind, the minister Razā, may you prosper over them.
And by God, I'm telling you the truth, Nasser.

God willing, long live
What they said about the sorcerer is just a sorcerer
With your permission, the rape of al-Zamir, Part Two
See you, you were standing there, Minister, at the beginning of the event.
After TV festivals, we disagreed, meaning
Listen, he says to them: "Get ready afterwards in part two"
The same thing
The dirty ones enter them banks to wash them and then they become clean
Those series that are weak, feeble, insignificant, and contemptible
They will enter them Gulf and Arab festivals
So they wash it, they clean it, they give it prizes and sophisticated series become popular among people. They clean it.
What reasonable excuse is there for something that's not reasonable?
As long as the same judging committees are the ones producing the series
Hello to you all
And upon you peace and blessings. Praise be to God, you have arrived.
They want to lower the price, even though we're currently negotiating with them.

"Ashfeha" means if a certain number of employees from the company go on strike.
You have four employees in the company, right? And on him, I'll take the responsibility.
Ten players are considered the main players
And above them, after that, there are four backup and two administrative staff, just for the office, and on top of that, seven more.
The spokesperson for the team
I will put this suffix on that prefix
But I'm walking the path of development, as fans, meaning the audience, consider the most important player on the field, the player number twenty-two.

Now he is the one day when my father said "worship him, he is the first one I disliked"
Oah heard your speech and obeyed you
Nothing else
Now because he wants to have more employees and sent them out to play games, have fun with them, and relax, he's making them work for him.
What is assigned to him will not take employees.
Even if you have a quarter of their employees, you still won't have one.
The key bakers
Why has Allah guided you to take the important bakers after they have become established?
Second time if you take employees, tell me
This transaction is unfair, Hamdi, it's making me suffer from it.
Hamdi is in the hospital
Why doesn't anyone live as long as you?

But in the final, he played in a five-five-three-two formation.
And as a big coach, you know that changing the plan confuses players. But your team of bakers remained calm and delivered a great performance.

Come, I'll tell you, dad, there are four flaws in the team's equipment, excluding the one with four flaws that's already in hand.
Come on, what's so strange about this? It's giving you a bill and a rental fee. All of this is hidden.

Listen listen Mitsu says I'm tired
And he knows that the fighter Kafachin Sillolotikawa was born in the Jazā'ah area, as Ahmed al-Tayeb said, and he knows where the center is located.
Mehdī bī Yawūr Rāsīk
Stay away from me, you bastard
And I know how to act with that coach
Why did the team retreat?
The thing that's currently happening is making the international bakery center's coach think that they will change the half of the match venue.
Because players are not playing from their positions
And the player Takoulamakakokolalalalalo, this is his natural place, he must move to the place where he always plays.
The coach's correct statement: Igher al

Now everyone is just staring, everyone is just gaping, and the thing is the camera.
The ball is in play, the fourth goal for the successful team.
He scores the fourth goal and that's today's match star.
The coach is riding his head
He said, "Salah, my brother Bounacer, won't let his team's coach be a problem for him."
And you, what's up?
I'm watching the match on TV, and you're in the reserve, the one I'm talking about, soh.
O my son, I won't spoil your spirit, it's too beautiful to be corrupted.
Now we have a match, we'll play without a coach.

Yemah yemah, tara jazi ma bikufi aflusna kall shi arqee wa ahsan wa tammim tara haa kulle ikhlafl aflus
Everyone is doing it
Scott and the one who Islamed you
What's up?
What's bothering you, Hedi?
Hedy Safinah Noah
For you two, I found the ancestors, but the ship of Noah is worth more than twenty thousand.
No, and as God Almighty forgives me, I say, the Farah, and the best of hands.
Stop, brother, my boat is Noah's
These are the weddings and their costs, and look, we are considering average people here.
It means we need fifty thousand and fifty thousand for the one you booked at the Royal Palace according to your statement
What we said about him is that he's a magician, but the first one is better, and the second one is worse than the first one.
Muharram's signs, the ones that are beneficial, are the owners of wedding venues.
The ones who know that everyone wants to stand out exploit us and take advantage of us.
And by God, I know one of my relatives who says his brother has a wedding hall.
Does the Koshie say it costs one hundred euros?
I don't believe in them, I never believed in God, my father, may He be blessed.
Sum up the situation
Like the young people before you, they married and behaved thus.
Hello, Sister, may your life be long.
What's up?
I know you like to stand out
And that's why we do this
For the first time, you're visiting Qatar designed by the global artist Peter Salomos
His formation is related to the nine planets
From the solar family
With Noah's ark coming out, something very good is happening
Armone Mavi, none of us has ever been the first one to use the nine planets
Sum up calf
Ameih and fifty thousand at that time
What's up
God keep you safe
You honor Eyneck
She is Wid's expenses and I am your brother.
To the general, I ask, what did you manage to do with all the eighties?
Everyone who managed to get sixty thousand to twenty-six thousand take them from my brothers.
What has shortened has shortened, and indeed, by God, O Fehd!
Hey Fahd, did you forget? Throughout all the time we've been proud and showing off at the wedding, we were in a seventy-day period.
Without appearance, without pretense
Sure you'll get the cards that show them
If God wills, we will start with the cards
If our wedding isn't better than theirs
Yemeh Goveh the cards that were linked by the wedding ceremony
This one is alive and well
People nowadays travel to countries just to get wedding cards
No, Aminah's house, they're going to Italy, they'll design the cards and print them, and then to Aminirah's house
They went to France, even people who don't have flu went to Lebanon, went to Lebanon, they showed their tickets.
After the country, we realized that we were wrong.
Why are you from a country where you plan to travel, Allah willing?
It means our WID cards are great.
She is expensive but
But excellent and no one else was better than us before
Zari la mo helo
I say go better shine
O xai, dam en he ma yaqdr 3ala maseerat al-3arz
Healing from the root himself
And Ibn Turek left us these extravagances and excesses at the wedding and the festivities that bring us no benefit.
Who else benefits from our psychological services besides these hotels and wedding venues?
I'm going to be poor
Let me go deliver it, it might be dangerous, we might encounter someone who knows about it.
Welcome with your arrival
What have you limited yourself to, Nasser?
O people of the bride, after what is ordained, stop supporting you.
But I just once, once
I mean, there's no need for a huge hotel lobby.
And we saw our daughter in the street and elsewhere, not better than that.
This problem, everyone is talking about everyone
And who told you that I married?
At least some people have this kind of arrogance.
All of it is a simple party with expenses based on the situation.
After that, come on, Rayal, these days people are hosting wedding parties on Facebook.
Cheapest and lowest cost
It means you're not married to your relatives.
Forgot to mention this
Arawig Cade
If he doesn't fulfill his promise for the wedding and Abdullah is Arwooshed, then Nawal.
She looks better than me
I say my love
Madam Woldj had a number of Arwisch; we gave it to her, and then we told her.
Summary my love, don't worry, by God, with peace
We agreed on DJ's list, not on this one.
And Am Nsour looks better than me
Didn't you forget who I am and who we are?
The least of us are better than us.
The situation is getting worse, my brother Salih Kassar Khattari, and we won't press on it.
Wade broke a deadlock
Hello, peace be with you
The hospital is our hospital and no other hospital
Madri hit us in the face
I heard that statement, John, we were told.
He has no experience, and after you've prepared everything, people are saying he has no wedding.
Why fail us
Ha ashqal Dr.
We can't let it happen, sister, the wedding can't be cancelled.
God willing, nothing bad will happen.
Do not burn her heart
Yah meh, you're real and you're the one who took the money
Spirit spirit wind her heart
And by God, if you said that, Joseph would stop his heart.
Do you know, Minister, why I'm keeping Boysoph for now?
He is retired from thinking about the idea for three or four years.
There's nothing in it that helps me
No way, you're not my guy.
You understand now that I'm young from now on.
And let him take the papers and statements, what you're going to get the money back?
This is Ismonah Tajil Tبريد mablagh
Jan ma tklat, ana madi li3 li3, meaning ant khayf.
There's nothing in it, and in the end I'll get my money back.
Do you know, Shishmoni, do you know Shishmoni?
The engaged, the orderly
Uncle, uncle, I tried but there's no other way
Youth and Jowwa after audit funds
And their condition is with Allah; scrutiny is not equal to haste, haste, haste.
Absera3a al-habba al-habba al-habba
The seed, all of it, all of it
Lala, Allah willing, at 7:30 we'll be in the hall to receive the guests.
Lala, surely you're there?
Make a real wedding, and my life will be like the latest Doha one.
Surprise
Inzen my love Fatima I want to eat this
Worried about you, my son, if they envy you when you show them your wealth.
Ha yameh tawilah zain al-basht

O Allah, make him good.
Six conditions for you, people, I will give you
O you who are upright, I place my trust in God regarding you.
Your marriage is due
Couple's cage, bendash, prison cage
They found the papers that I hoped for the Salaf; may Allah have cursed them, now they've struck me on the head and attacked me.
And why are you making a big deal out of nothing?
You hear a bigger blow than this

I'm with you, Othman, it's not worth it, but there's no way around it.
Forbidden: he has seven dependents and no legal guardian.
Life step by step, current job, where is Abraas, where is he going?
You saw what happened
The lady employee whose eyes the minister saw
The office of Uthman, where he stayed, and Uthman, a poor man, would take his pleasures and was forbidden. She said to him, "Rouh, I will not allow you to take your pleasures with the bed."
And now it is him
The scales have turned, O Umar.

We aren't taking it to the truth to blame him for it.
So that my parents can cooperate with me
Even if you doubted
I was informed throughout
Harameh and Ayya Harameh, and our women, of course, are not burdened with extra responsibilities.
Noorah, if you didn't take a bribe today, you'll go to the government and then you'll go back home.
Allah Almighty, Allah Almighty, what a shame! This is what you all are doing, everyone! I'm not doing it, but you all are doing it, just like your fathers are doing it.
May God bless Vieg

And I said: "He is a witness."

And at the same time, a decline in the dollar index for the US dollar
Al-Lazi takes over as the sole pricing entity for oil.

For our viewers who wish to participate, they can contact us on the program's phone numbers and lines.
Mr. Deputy's hours, hello to you
I would like to start with you on the unprecedented prices that oil has reached.
Where can prices go?
Of course, where can prices go from here? This is a confusing question.
or what is known as market force
Is not OPEC
and the producing countries
It is not the producing countries, and OPEC does not have a relationship with oil pricing.
Is it just the relationship between price, supply, and demand?
Not even now does the appearance or the request have significant impact.
What are the factors then?
Other factors, besides cost and demand
Which benefits investors
They felt intense pressure and turned to oil and gold, or what is known as commodity marketing.
Investors have lost confidence in stock markets
And gold as well
We have seen gold rise from $350 per ounce in recent years to reach $97 now.
He is still as I mentioned, about 50 and nine dollars
But all of it increased, yet the decline was slight.
Maybe I should remind you that in the first quarter of this year
The second quarter is when prices should drop due to reduced demand for oil.
But we noticed the market in a fascinating and unexpectedly changing state.
In the second quarter and at the beginning of spring, it rises above one hundred dollars.
But that means the previous factors that determined price increases relative to winter and consumption have changed, and new factors now exist.
and economic growth
At the same time, we see that oil prices are rising to this extent.
She spoke about political factors and stated that political tensions play a role in disrupting the matter.
In Iran, do you expect Valon's resignation under the current political complexities?
Her companion, and today most American and international news outlets are reporting on her, can affect oil prices.
Bey be the money today? Ai ai today? Ai
Today we are in the age of the global world, where influence comes very quickly.
Fake factors can affect
And they create a kind of disturbance in the market
Waiza created a political rumor.
He said there is no plan, but he did not rule out other options that could also be applied to Iran.
The stock market always reacts together with the markets.
Of course, currently there is no certainty that the United States is at war with Iran.
And I am one of those people who doesn't mean to see this scenario.
What will be the future? We have not seen it, what will it be like?
But we, the ones who work in the corrupt sector.
We see all these political tensions
Oil supplies in the world
On the contrary, there are very comfortable supplies.
What does it indicate that there is oil going into storage?
There has never been any shortage of oil supplies at all.
Perhaps prepared for the next war
Under this reassuring picture it presents regarding supply, stating that there are no obstacles to supply.
In case the American President Bush and the United States decide to implement their plan
This is something else
Prices rise to levels reaching record highs
The oil price may reach
From the world's oil reserves
You are here, this is here today, the Gulf represents the most important
In addition to Iraq, Iran and other Gulf countries
They represent more than sixty percent of oil reserves, therefore it's certain that
You are today
If it were a very simple accident
Therefore, it indicates
That means that in the event of any war against Iran, oil prices cannot be guaranteed to reach any level.
Allah knows, and today we reached here, we have arrived without
Wars to a million, seven dollars, a million and ten dollars, and possibly to a million and ten. God knows best.
Today oil is living under psychological and political tensions, just as you said.
And the Yawm and al-Mazariyn overcame these tensions
Only an oil investor
Or, what is commonly called a "speculative investment," obviously, is not a real investment but rather a future purchase or viral marketing.
It is called nafti paper
All of these are gambling on oil stocks.
All of his output is approximately three million barrels or less.
Perhaps this will lead to further purchases, and then to further increases in
I hope April lied to April
I hope there is not going to be
Jenny came to the area, and it is said that this is on his main schedule.
Jeli is the owner of this project, as many politicians and journalists have said.
I didn't know what was in my younger sister's bag.
And I can't imagine what it will mean.
Will he start a war?
The USA is in a transitional phase
And why doesn't the son do something else?
Let's see what happens if April comes soon, April is very close, just a few weeks, and we will enter April.
And the world may pay
And America is a major consumer country.
In Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the tough number.
You can't enter this number
His production costs are cheap.
Comparison with West African countries that mostly rely on
The Gulf cannot be achieved by any other country in the world.
We have been hearing this from the West and the United States for years and years.
The use of assistance
Until the end and the Battle of the Sea of Qazvin, the story is remembered and
No matter what these dreams may be
When you sit with relatives in a closed circle
You hear them speaking in a different way
They say maza
Regarding supplies, the importance of the region, and the importance of precautions
When I asked one of the European officials a question, he said: "You're strange, you talk among yourselves in closed rooms about Hajj."
In a way different from what you speak when addressing them
Or the media said no, for political reasons.
And of course there's something called the "DPR standard" or "meaning, two times"
The person whose concern they know is the role of the Gulf countries
It has importance today, for example Saudi Arabia.
The largest producer and supplier of oil in the world
and entering into
Despite all this
Head of the Central District
Bashen war on Iran
Even by a aerial attack or a bombing as is said
and the supplies
Daa entawa mesh metsakirin da entawa krama qada
I didn't agree with you, we're not in
Nor do we deal with the Westerners
With America, we deal
And the good prices
Looking beyond his nationality, this market
Nasal means non-renewable energy
For the sake of kindness
Arab Generosity
I agreed to give you
Observers say the real price of oil
and the reason for the rise in oil
You, Gulf, OPEC, and the countries
Fantom is very red with the Americans who insist on holding onto their currency
You said the oil price should be two dollars.
The true price, in relation to the dollar's decline, is sixty-seven to seventy.
Ok now the price is my
The dollar dropped from 100 to 63.
Now above the dollar
If we take proportion and ratio
No one can deny that
One of the main reasons for
Comparison with dollar decline
If we take if we take the
If we take this comparison
Oil prices
as the United States of America
Of course, is it in their interest at the current time for the dollar to weaken?
Weakness or stagnation in the American economy cannot enable the United States to establish a list for it.
Therefore, therefore, what happened during this economic slump and stagnation?
You too have become
The United States is cutting dollar interest rates
Why do you insist on linking oil prices to the dollar?
Why do we talk about linking oil prices to the dollar?
The first one above the meh is sneh
First, as the first barrel of oil was exported from the United States of America
And the dollar has risen
And since the beginning of the twentieth century until today
Pricing of oil in dollars
Historically, it became
And since 2000, the world at large has been reacting and pricing.
And Norway is currently the third oil-producing country.
Its oil source
Russia is the second largest oil-producing country.
and production of the North Sea field in Europe
Priced in dollars, not priced in
Everything is changing in the world. There are other sources and information pointing to something else besides this.
You are the Gulf countries.
There are secret agreements between you and the Americans.
And oil has become the real shield
Shah is correct about this statement and there is none
and these agreements
It is based on the idea that oil remains the cover for the dollar, rather than the United States taking steps to protect this system.
This is not correct and there are no secret agreements
Today let's take the OPEC organization.
You have sixty-six, and the deputy has sixty.
From the ten countries
From 85%, 40% of the OPEC share per barrel
There are many countries, some of which are very large, in oil production.
Outside the OPEC
What are the barriers that prevent pricing in another currency?
Check because the price is doing something else
Not even the elders agree when they decide
You are Saudi and the countries of the Al-Kabba
Today, the OPEC session as a whole
There are sixty percent
Even if their organization wanted to do so
There is an agreement among all oil-producing countries to
Is there an intention or desire for change?
And the attempt of the one who tries
But currently these countries are not capable of changing the pricing currency.
But if there is an agreement between
What is the effect of delay?
Let me clarify, I'm talking now about the Europeans
Why don't they export their waste?
From the North Sea, either Russia or Norway, in Euros or Rubles
Because it is in their interest that their currency be high, high, and elevated.
On the contrary, not on the contrary
Here is their loss
One euro imports a barrel and a half
You are not the losers; you are losing because your investment is linked to the dollar.
And he also suffered a great loss of his own wealth.
Currency links here to the Gulf have a historical connection
You remember in the 1970s, the dollar was the strongest currency in the world.
And now, when you talk about separation
This is like marriage when you get married.
And you are bringing divorce—divorce is not easy.
Lā hānā
And you are working with zawaq kasoliqi with the dollar
You must study the costs in a way
To study professionally and to study with
And Kuwait also fixed 25.5 fils of its currency to the dollar.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, UAE, Qatar
Its exchange rate may be adjusted.
We're distancing ourselves from the topic, but that means you don't have the intention to study the subject or think about it.
The study naturally differs, Minister, the Prime Minister stated.
Waleh stated that the Qatari currency is less than its true value by 20 percent.
So enter from this study
No, there's no indication that you alone have taken the initiative on this issue.
Kuwait has distinguished itself in what they do, without taking a single step.
Economists say the gain for countries and their peoples is greater than the loss.
but we
Not anything else
For these four Gulf countries to announce
All means believer
And I mean people who personally support him
It will support it
It should be noted from this study.
By itself
Created what created, either one state or two states.
Until the time comes to work
We won't quarrel over the issue at hand.
This of course will be studied by specialists here.
And they will be their companions.
They are not experts, they want a political decision
Let's neither wait nor rush. See what's happening today.
People started to mean
Of course in a compromising situation
The deputy's statement means that inflation in Qatar reached 4.6% in 2017 and will increase to 5.1% in the coming year.
Eat people's salaries and devour people's salaries here, workers' salaries here
Qatari residents' salaries have been eaten away by inflation at a rate of 50 to 40 percent.
We return to you after a short break to tell you about the size of the salary increases that will take place.
Qatari employees, stay with us in the coming period
Hello again, without boundaries in this episode, where we host the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Energy
Qatari industrialist Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attah is speaking about the significant price increases.
Oil, which generated billions of dollars for Gulf countries and producing nations
For oil, and my question is about the expected increase in employee salaries. But before that increase, I would like to provide you with some important information.
UAE is 798 of 10 billion reserves and selects 26 of 10
Only a ton, and Kuwait Times reported economic revenue from Gulf countries as the largest
Saudi Arabia's expected revenues for the 2019 fiscal year amount to 190 billion.
and was
Last year, the UAE's economy was 76, this year it is expected to be 75.
Kuwait sixty-eight and sixty-four
One quarter and twenty six billion barrels of oil, not fifty-six billion barrels
From the rumors as other reports say: "O Allah, no envy, meaning, don't let your son be envious of him, O your deputy."
Iraq 47 billion
One and a half trillion
Areas of Al-Nafaqah amounted to one and a half trillion dollars.
Gulf countries imported $10 billion, meaning one trillion
Dollar was multiple imports
Estimar the United States expenditure of one billion
and nine-tenths of a billion
There were three in the Bahrain in the month
In the year 1976, Oman had seven and a half, and Zaid reached seven. In Qatar, there were ten and forty-five miles, rising to fifty-seven miles.
It means those living in Qatar are facing higher prices for goods and services and a worse lifestyle.
Lives are being lost and prices have risen significantly, and even more in Qatar
We feel empathy towards all.
The two treatments must be
And dealing means aiming at controlling inflation.
It means they increased salaries by fifty percent.
I don't say you're against salary increases
This is not correct and in muj
The ministers are not against his salaries.
There is a problem, and the solution should be the best possible one.
Not even a solution to the problem
Well, there's a balance between the molars.
And this will be his
The important thing is managing the swelling
And here in Qatar in the committee
His Highness Prince Mohammed bin Fahd has issued the formation of it.
and it will be visible
Lah wa taz3aana yaqūdīn
Strong for solving the problem and controlling inflation
The important thing is to first control inflation.
The inflation
Indeed, if you do not control him
Be the effort of the deputy now
Market expert and published in late February last month
Among them, about entering in
Now you're obsessed with inflation, and inflation is devouring these people's incomes.
Many of them are now
Access to other countries
Zaid increased our salaries and then father is stuck with inflation and lowered them again
I'm saying the issue people are talking about is parallelism, the topic.
but now
And it is not being addressed at this time.
The problem worsens even more.
Therefore, here
From the limit to the limit of expansion
The sorrow will always be
The increase was huge compared to the previous year in the past year, yes.
The second point The second point
And Zayn also works with the government, unlike those who work with the private sector.
The private area is completely neglected.
Then, the issue of the increase must also be examined in the same way.
I don't know where you got these comments or how you got them
We are living in Qatar, the deputy's efforts are not making us live in Germany.
I'm telling you the opposite today the private sector seems to be driving it.
Most of
Many Qatari government employees have moved to the private sector.
Due to the high salaries
He is facing a problem
It moves to the private sector as the private sector is vital and dynamic.
And he provides good salaries
We are linked to what is known as market forces
or by market force
They do not come, and they are people with very high specialized qualifications.
They are not coming to Qatar because Qatar has lower salaries, meaning lower wages or lower costs.
or by expenses they come
Well, with our full understanding
I do not anticipate events, nor do I say there will be an increase in salaries.
Also, there's no hope at all.
To control this expansion
We will not give in at this time.
Having control over this inflation
And if Allah wills, this is what the report says: Qatar is in the year two hundred and eight.
May it be God's will, meaning I say that I do
We believe these figures will be verified.
Corrupt the people a bit
It's a process, meaning we are a professional process.
Of course with professionalism and everything else but
From inflation
because of expenditure
Experienced in various projects
Let me ask the viewers' questions, and I kindly ask each to put them forward directly. Abdulaziz Mohamed from Morocco, your question, brother Abdulaziz.
This is based on the fact that Gulf ruling families.
There is no justification for the fact that the lack of agreement among the OPEC means something.
Secondly, all oil revenues go directly to the ruler.
Then for the household expenses, and the rest is allocated to development.
Under the circumstances, and given the absence of accounting, the matter remains as it is.
Peace and blessings of Allah upon him
May God bless you, brother Ahmed
Bro, I won't take long on this. I mentioned the brother regarding the systems of governance, and the linking of the dollar to the rial or the rial or Gulf currencies to the dollar, but
The United States wants to hegemonize the world under its banner.
The U.S. trade deficit with China reached 82 billion dollars.
And with him, the European Union reached 86 billion dollars.
This means that all global policy directions are geared towards strengthening the US dollar.
And we are bearing the consequences of this as Arab countries and Gulf oil-producing nations.
It could end in a clash between America
Among the advanced countries such as China, Russia, and others, the issue may become a matter of concern.
Purely military
The explosions of Chinese bombs, Russian bombs, Japanese bombs, as well as American bombs
Thank you very much for this clarification and information.
Your question, Muhammad
Hello, your question
You can lower the TV volume and ask your question.
Medicine your question
What I see is that the deputy's effort is deliberately designed to avoid cooperation.
Topic of dollar disconnection because the dollar is declining
And may God bring it down to the shore, if He will.
And it is a pleasant taste.
It is not advisable to follow the style of the Arab brothers.
Thank you, brother Mohamed. Thank you. Thank you. This is Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. Your question, Ahmed.
God will bring you good.
Thank you, and did not limit himself to the sweet greeting.
Increase in salary, God willing, things will improve. What do you mean by that?
We are facing problems at our universities, not from salaries, but from something else.
Salaries, God willing, the matters
Medicine answers your question quickly
I'll ask you a question about the line you have.
All of them are imported goods, all imported, all at high prices
From European countries, right now
Well, we have all of the Arab world's factories and workshops in our videos.
Thank you, Ahmed, thank you for sparing your time.
Now, the issue of price inflation is a significant issue.
The case of Wouf with the Ghalabah, stay with the Ghalabah, his efforts the deputy
The thing is, there's no billion here, just two.
Here it means we are for the brothers, of course.
The ones who don't know about Qatar
This regarding Qatar is not correct.
Today, whoever comes to Qatar, sees what the key indicators are.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar, and how?
The fastest-growing economies in the world
What's the point of the Suroh? Where are you going to take it? What are you going to do with it?
What is in the Italian response to it?
It's when he talks about his brother from Morocco, he talks in a way that isn't real and isn't true.
The person who does not see with his own eyes
If the person who means it comes and sees what's happening in that area, the developments are very significant.
Growing significantly, yes you are asking
And every one of them has the right
And you, the people, have done that by capturing people from there.
Actually, does that mean that surplus molasses will be imported from China? Molasses
We won't be able to attend, God willing.
The state is based on a plan and on
With full independence of these funds coming from oil and gas, everyone knows that oil and gas will eventually run out.
To be a state, Qatar
It is considered one of the greatest historical achievements for the Arab world.
Today still is the
The focus on
And what will be its effect
The major in oil and gas later on
It means you're not spending in Dubai buying
Every country, every country, every country has its own characteristics, every country has its own characteristics.
We in the state of Qatar have focused on education.
The foundations of the foundations of the foundations
Here here is a medical city with people, you can stay here
It will be a media city hosting
Of course, he is the world today. Today we must build.
We build a picture
On what comes after oil and gas
There were errors that killed him.
Unfortunately, we did not take advantage of this breakthrough as we were unexpectedly confronted with it.
But we were not ready for it, neither humanly, nor technologically, nor educationally.
Today it has changed after thirty years
What's most important
Today here, in here imagine

Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy. Also, thank you, our dear viewers.
Thank you for your continued interest; we hope you have found our offering useful.
Qatar's foreign policy appears vague to many observers.
Qatar enjoys distinguished relations
And during the period when Qatar maintained relations with Israel, and still does
The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas
Qatar submitted
but she began
Largest Arab country
Which angered the Egyptian regime
Out of anger, it reached the point of accusing it of collusion with Egypt.
Qatar was not far from important issues.
Like Darfur in Sudan, the Houthis in Yemen, and even the Israeli soldier prisoner
Qal'at Sholit extended its hand to the Qatar's foreign policy in a way that angered the major Arab countries.
And what power places it in this place?
From these achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabr al-Thani
Or they write to us through our website www.aljazira.net z
Excellency Sheikh, nice to meet you
From September 22, 2007 to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
The visit marked a turning point in bilateral relations at least in recent years.
Redrawing of borders
Wash what remained
This is what I mentioned
Magazine or journal Al-Haqaq
Which you held with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, through which relations were established and the Saudi ambassador returned.
To Doha
The introduction you provided was too long and required many answers without your final question.
I think her campaign
In particular in the Saudi procedure
What is flour?
The Arab Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in terms of Qatar, is an important country.
Existing between the two countries
I spoke about Al-Jazira's silence
I spoke about a coup movement
I believe these matters have become evident from both sides.
And we warned you earlier
In his country Qatar
Dispute with Saudi Arabia
He was always confined within a narrow scope
Views
Praise be to God, and may the leaders be wise.
King Abdullah and His Highness the Amir
To a large extent, the Gulf
More than a hundred years
He was always a bright and reliable figure, and a trusted relationship.
I want to pinpoint it as a miscommunication between the two parties.
This document was prepared and no conditions existed.
To resolve any issue
But there was an understanding, and genuine intentions from both sides.
To resolve this stuck issue
And it is not seasonal, but a strategic relationship.
We hope for her not just to last, but to grow.
Beautiful diplomatic talk
Until Saudi Arabia withdraws its ambassador from Qatar
I no longer speak diplomatically, otherwise I would have avoided many problems.
I always said what I believed in
Saudi, therefore, she is not diplomatic but she is faith.
Al-Jazira's report falls under the category of media reporting.
Between the two sides, and in many countries, they entered the market.
In her view, it might be possible to gain advantages or it might take points from other countries.
or on behalf of Qatar
or on behalf of Saudi Arabia
Is the dispute from the concealment of the House of the Khaliji?
It means the opposite of what was previously the case.
Said a political agreement
No, no, there was no agreement; there was only an agreement of goodwill and a mutually beneficial agreement.
But anything that contradicts this document, you should ask the Ajira administration whether they have developed a health strategy.
Keep between you and Saudi Arabia until what happened before is avoided
The relationship was inherently based on a close strategy.
We can split it into one, two, three, four.
There must be unity.
And I built the disputes on this basis
Between the Arab countries, we work to resolve other disputes
Indeed, if we observe the disagreements in the Arab world, they are differences of opinion.
When we have an opinion on a certain policy regarding a specific action in a particular country, and another country has a different opinion.
This represents two viewpoints
It means that the monitors' observations show that you take pleasure in criticizing Saudi Arabia.
By directing criticism at her
Have you exhausted yourselves and decided to turn in a different direction, only to end up in a larger country, Egypt?
It means the same idea.
Lala first, we don't enjoy and we are not extravagant.
We will deal with any other party in this manner.
It means the reasons for the dispute with Saudi Arabia have ended.
Among them, and I know there is an agreement.
Very big and you know we founded it
There would be a kind of model
but Saudi Arabia, but but Saudi Arabia
Let me put this under two lines
We started talks with Egypt's Al-Ahram newspaper on April 10th last week.
The Egyptian Official Newspaper
This in a comprehensive investigation said that the extensive investigations
On Hezbollah's network, an explosive plan was revealed.
Egypt aims for three countries to participate: Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
and Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
And with a well-known media figure associated with the Tamari period
Qatar is the smallest of the Arab countries.
They are plotting against Egypt
We respect
And struggle over the years
I am not saying this to provoke emotions.
Ni aklim le ma kamlat
We can
and the Egyptian president
Cautious
On Arab relations
First point
Gaza incident
As they say, and as we admit
Qatar is a country
Its size is small
Can you participate in a plan of this kind?
Because we have suffered from foreign interventions at times, and I will not go back on this.
Some countries' interventions in the Qatar issue
Therefore, the policy of the government of His Highness
Now, when they discovered what they're saying about their plots, it means.
Waiza zegh ism, means we, I want to say to the house, God protect Syria and Iran, they defend us, I will not defend them.
Stability in Egypt
And why does Qatar want to change or intervene in a matter of this kind?
And the pyramids do not speak of desire.
Qatar said it sought to undermine Egypt's role and its relations with Turkey and the European Union.
My scope extends to organizing a parallel summit to the Arab Summit, minimizing the diversion of attention.
And you are using a media outlet called "Waqa' al-Imani", which is the Al-Qazir channel.
Oh, please do
with Hezbollah
And we're not comfortable with it, meaning
I can tell you confidently.
We are
We are not willing to intervene under such circumstances.
The brotherhood of our brothers in Egypt, and this is what we mourn the Egyptian officials.
The conflict or sensitivity existing among the Egyptian government officials
But with the sensitivity of their responsible officials
What's up?
I'm going to check the ad
Days of Faweh al-Salam and Waqih al-Salam and if we
and it was held previously in Egypt
And afterwards it was held among us
for Israel
We have a dispute regarding it.
Do you have a dispute with Israel?
And now, since the conference, from that day on
Which Islamic conference is an Arab conference that has sensitivity?
Why is this sensitivity?
Sit with them and
Let me finish for you
And we always appreciate it better.
This sensor we discovered
Or or three means
Gaza conference that took place
Egypt doesn't want to hold it in Qatar
Not Arabice
In Qatar, and even more so in Kuwait, they said to them: "O group!"
The Palestinian people are moving forward.
More than two weeks
But we agreed beforehand, before the organized Kuwait conference, that we were the first to ban the conference.
People kill and kill
and by it, [it] means delay
The dispute began
And no small state stood against this battle.
Of course, I know that among the government there are brothers who have harmed Egypt, and this harm is not directed at anyone else but Egypt.
When they said, "After"
Well, you guys in the Gulf
And the Israelis have been informed that earlier today, a meeting will be held to halt the fighting before any speech or any other action.
What is it
O brother, take medicine and food during the time they are cleaning their brothers.
Every time they say the gate is narrow
What trucks entered
Every time they tell us that, by God, in the second clause of the agreement, we must agree.
Now isn't the time for us to give Fatah or give Hamas.
I don't care about opening or enthusiasm, what mattered to us was one million and sixty thousand that are currently working.
And they have no medicine
When we were going to talk about this topic and talk at the Gaza conference
And Qatar's involvement in the matter causes sensitivity among the Egyptian establishment in Egypt.
He's not going to get involved
We didn't discuss how Egypt is handling the situation because that is Egypt's responsibility.
One of the officials said: "We discovered the plot against Akebir and the uprising."
Yet they haven't told us what the plot is
We mean this responsible person
Is Egypt saying to us that it has a greater right?
Well, brother, we understand that Egypt is a major Arab country, and we always say Egypt is a major country.
Therefore, we always ask the major powers for many things.
Because Egypt, from our point of view
And you were our call to another conference which was intended to provoke them.
What brought us to the conference
Ages of Gaza
And we coordinated; our position was unified.
People are suffering in Gaza
Forbidden means I know that Turkey entered things through Israel.
I would be happy if I could see her entering through our brothers in Egypt
From us to us
And if Egypt wins or carries out a good political action
This we believe is in our interest in Qatar and in the interest of the Arab world.
Egypt's stability is important to us.
If she does a good job, that's important to us.
Let me finish your question and introduction, you said they were quarter of an hour.
The Qa'atih, the one you are now, has made me suffer but
I am not this, I am this, I am now, meaning from anger
From whom did the Egyptian officials get angry with you?
We are the ones who failed Doha's peak
The second point is their failure to hold the Doha conference.
King Abdullah had wisdom, he was eager
Wired works for its interests
And thus, the nations' strength lies in what they prohibit.
That's what I said to my brother in Saudi Arabia because we
We do not have a disagreement with Saudi Arabia even on this point.
The limit is because of what is apparent in internal forms
Or someone with officials among them
By the highest officials
One big country, with one responsible entity, can manage small countries that work on the tasks.
It means that there was you, you
It is that it is performing any role
Darfur is part of Egypt's national security and Sudan's
They reviewed the five major countries and
If any country other than Qatar had been possible
But allergies cause the situation to worsen; what makes you put your nose into your own nose? Everything about you is suspicious.
We want to resolve the allergy, so we take antihistamine medication. They tell us what is this allergy?
Why hypersensitivity
And in the brotherhood's view of the government
Iridon has internal problems
Iridon directs attention to a plot in Gaza, a coup.
It means like the English say "a British man with Italian blood"
Everything is easy
Receiver for the instructions for the analytics
Tell me what happened, because we don't know
Al-Qa'eh must be treated locally.
Don't treat it
No way, Lord, my priority is my own country.
My priority is to first look at the issues that matter in my country.
And then check if I have enough time available.
Consider issues that concern the Arab people
And if Qatar had tried to resolve it
And any idea in every Arabic context, you can contribute to it as much as possible with our participation.
Why is it provocative? Why don't you take it with good intentions?
I can't help you
I can express my opinion
What are you throwing at me?
And we, we, we in our opinion
The origin comes from his heart
Let me finish for you
When the peace initiative was announced and the leaders met, we in Kuwait were delighted, and I expressed my welcome to this statement.
In the guidelines
Of course, the Egyptian official who bragged about his achievements
In his article in MQ, I thought it was a TV interview or something, I won't reply to it.
I have a reply for each point
But I am preserving the minimum level of relations that connect us and link our Arab interests.
Waiza responded to the call mentioned by His Majesty King of the Two Holy Mosques
But all I advise him is that and others
And whoever tries to make amends for their errors, whether internal or external.
In politics or economy or anything else, just as we have mistakes in political and economic matters, no one is completely free from error.
Because they have built their homes in Qatar, they are accusing them of false charges.
You are denying Qatar's relationship with anything related to Hezbollah's faction.
This is your joke script
To damage Egypt's relationships, undermine its role and connections with Turkey and the European Union
Look, we first, we are few in number.
If we are capable of taking on this role
This is incorrect speech
There are accusations against you personally.
To pay money to shareholders so that they can inflate the value of Shaleet and inflate her value and increase the Egyptian share in the matter
They always accuse us of paying money first. We have not paid any money, and we have not spoken to anyone about paying money.
But this is the story
We support Egypt achieving what we have supported Egypt to achieve, and we will continue to support it as it resolves the issue among the Palestinians.
Indeed, Allah has decreed that the Palestinian president will remain until this issue is resolved.
We were present and among the first to receive state recognition from Qatar
But power will remain with the Palestinian institutions until the dispute is resolved.
And we said: "Here it is."
And the Arab University is what I say, because we went through it, because we don't believe that some people want this document.
but we passed them off wisely
Does that mean he is addressing his boss?
His prime minister
Hey, I don't know about him, what's the problem?
From them, I don't know
They decided last April 10 in the newspaper Al-Sharq to exclusively report the news.
The Egyptian political leadership has decided to launch a space-based news outlet to counter the media propaganda known as Al-Jazira channel and to end it.
All of it are days, and matters end and are put away.
But if you fear her, the island will become something of the past.
It means now that a political youth is living.
As you yielded to Saudi Arabia, the Qatari emir sat down with the Saudi king.
We did not yield, and they did not yield to us.
We treated them as brothers.
A small state yielded to the great state of Egypt.
Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia at a key point highlighted it
Qatar's relations with Saudi Arabia differ
That means, and then we talk about it.
Qatar's relations with Egypt
And we place great trust in it.
Let me be honest with you, is the Khal?
Or, in the main political aspect
Joe Lan: We don't have a personal conflict. I respect the Egyptian people.
If you ask me now to deal with the two problems, Gaza and the other one?
And this story has deeply affected us.
I want to address this from a psychological perspective, meaning I need to resolve this issue.
Post in the Bajraidee group
Minister of Foreign Affairs
Profile of Prince Saud Al-Faisal
We talked about everything
But it was clear that the issues were escalating and not resolving.
Laa laa kan faa fi laa shof
It means I can't tell you about our relations with Egypt.
They have a leader, and it is our duty towards them as brothers.
And we have a duty towards them as younger brothers.
In the case of major powers, we don't need to compare ourselves with any other major power.
It means Egypt is bigger than the desert
I am not referring to the matter of life and death, but that the solution comes from heaven.
For us, regarding us, there's a limit that we're waiting for it to be revealed.
Who is waiting for a style?
Qatar has
It deals with agreements without proper dealings and brotherly conduct.
As a major country, yes, we are proud of Egypt as a major country.
But if there is a limit that misleads a limit
This means I know that Israel is following us.
And the former American policy under the previous administration, together with mine or his.
But I think they don't want to isolate Israel or the United States in this situation.
Then they mean that if we adopt any policies, they will be pressured by external agencies.
In several cases, MM M, keep me informed so I can complete it for you.
What do we understand and know is that after the regulations come, even for the major countries
Clothing influences your policy
We don't have any movement, just one movement from us.
Qatar's internal affairs this is internal affairs
And in which field can we help the Arab world, we will help in that field
What are the sources of strength of Al-Qanat Al-Jajir and the Al-Manyad base?
You can say this isn't strong.
Faith in God and confidence in ourselves
or view His Highness the Amir
I don't want any shocks, please.
Let me finish for you, don't worry. If you want, I can make something up.
And I do not wish to compete with anyone.
Say what they say, whether it's the biggest of the Qatari or otherwise
But we have our own perspective
First we dismissed the Israeli office, we closed it.
Glory be to God, they used to say, "We drank the office, we drank the office, they got angry and left. They would say to the Americans, 'Look at this humiliation.'"
They went to line up with the ones they call the Devil's team
What are they saying?
For the Americans and Europeans, these are our true friends, and we know how to deal with them.
The whispers
who has worked
It means a flaw that we've reached the end stage, what now?
Oli the An
What are your views on solving the problem with Egypt? One or two points?
And on the basis that Egypt has a major role in the Arab world
We believe it is important to get familiar with it.
And I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak is eager about this.
but by the strength of the team
He needs to leave
Occupying Egypt's public or governmental or other official positions with trivialities
and focusing on Egyptian and Arab interests
Are there any steps?
We are not their leaders, nor are we their rulers, because they are a major power.
The near term
And by God, I mean I think this document, I can't imagine how this document will turn out.
And I know that Bégi has time for the mind
And we have time for either of them
If I am I
or from among them
They are united by major Arab interests.
We will someday find that this situation
The world still hasn't reached far yet.
It means we don't use the Egyptian style you have.
If someone extends their hand to us, let us stretch our arms to match it.
Now, His Excellency Sheikh
It means that we, as a generation, have never gotten used to being awake.
But on solid grounds, we are ready to support Egypt.
Stand down with Egypt
Now there are many rumors spreading about Egyptian workers in Qatar being affected by this issue.
And there are contracts for Egyptians working in jobs, either in collective or large-scale positions.
You are aware of this situation first of all, it's not from Qatar's policy of canceling jobs and canceling
Because these people have gotten involved in what is happening.
This is a market where demand changes, with some canceling it while others are adopting it.
He is a rare and sought-after, and in other nationalities, he is rare in some nationalities that have increased.
Well, a quick answer
The office existed
We're worried about the office, meaning make him leave now
We have been tormented for the days when they were negligent in handling the negotiations, causing every loss we suffered in talks with Israel due to this office.
This is where we closed it, let them settle the issue with Netanyahu.
He was Zayf
And it was among them that we established the practice of deciding on all accredited ambassadors in any foreign country.
His official call to service was not Akram Khalil Shil.
No way, no way, we wouldn't have treated them before as they say now, we would have treated them well, it's just hard now.
There is no reason to make you reopen the office during this period.
The office will be open if the reasons disappear.
You're the one who's big-headed
To be the size of Egypt means
Egypt is the one that imposed this.
Our relationship with America is a strategic one. Let me be clear with you.
In the matter of things, this is it.
What are the most important things?
On matters regarding our area's treatment of the Qa'aya, we differed with the previous administration.
Now, honestly, we really have a lot of hope in the administration, especially regarding the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe there is a great potential in this administration
A road toward moving the peace process forward, a road toward solving the Palestinian issue
All our friends, and this is what we deny
What is happening in Iran, what impact does it have on the Gulf, and on you?
This is how Iranian AI researchers solve their problems
Among them
In their usual way, and I'm certain their importance surpasses this crisis.
Iran's stability is as mentioned by His Highness the Amir.
It's important for our region, the Gulf region, that we share a common border with Iran.
Of course, we have excellent relations with all our neighbors, especially Iran.
Because we are a country, we desire peace and stability for this region.
And we would intervene whenever any party wanted to change or alter the Doha agreement.
And he affirmed that Saad Hariri said
Now it's over, what remains is the strategic talk between the president
Among the Lebanese groups
how to see
Regarding Yemen, is it not your role, or have the Yemenis taken a stance against you?
See first, we are known for supporting the unity when almost the entire Arab world supported the Yemeni unity.
We are one Arab state, standing with the Yemeni unity.
And regarding the southern issue, we have discussed it with Yemen, and I have been sent twice by His Highness the Amir to meet with the esteemed Yemeni President.
And we have stated that our goal is stability in Yemen, because Yemen is an important country in the Arab world.
This agreement is not respected, and I don't want to say what each party has done.
But the truth is, I'm really upset inside myself.
Qatar's stance in this matter, accusing it of funding the Houthis and senior officials
Yemenis, we don't intervene in these matters.
And he who stands with the unity does not stand by its safety.
and for another purpose beneficial to Yemen, whether political, economic, or otherwise
This is a procedure, we don't have any objections, but honestly, I was really shocked.
Because I have gone more than ten times during the fighting, I was sent by His Excellency the Amir to Yemen among the Yemenis.
I'm sorry, this accusation is strange.
Time has expired, but briefly, will your policies change in response to the issues you have sensed in your efforts to resolve them? Will your intervention in other Arab issues alter your policies?
And by God, if the Amir's honor hears my words, it is true that I believe there is no need to do so.
And they showed us once a large amount.
More than five billion dollars at this time means that if we invested it, it would become fifty billion, better than headache.
But I'm saying this because I believe it, as the current time in the Arab world means it.
What allows this under these circumstances
Thank you, Qazila, Excellency Sheikh
And perhaps even the exceptional case with Sheikh Hamad's country
What happened as a result of the Doha agreement
How did the miracle of Doha happen?
On neglecting the committee and giving it all the support
In the Lebanese situation following Israel's aggression in Lebanon
When it was a consensus among Arabs
And we went to New York, and we managed to make the decision somewhat balanced.
And we have noticed this in Doha that both sides were careful.
We tried as much as possible to not listen to them or to not be affected by them, there.
Because we knew the committee, we knew
Observe the reality and we will know what the problem is after we spent hours talking with the Lebanese.
And I believe it is a shared success.
But there was a determination there
I believe Lebanon's problems are directly affected by the regional atmosphere.
Whether Salmah or not Salmah
Lebanon has rated this site
Will be like that
And unfortunately
Foreign policy repercussions
I can say that the problem among the Lebanese goes beyond just the first issue, even if there is a problem.
The Sheikh's state medicine, I know perhaps the time isn't quite ripe yet to talk about the behind-the-scenes, but
What happened? Why did you come here?
We were stopped if the expression "confrontation on the ground" is accurate
You never missed a single moment, meaning
What exactly was happening? I know well about the upcoming Lebanese symbols; at that time, the Lebanese people were telling me what had happened.
I was from the beginning
When I spoke with the owner of the honor
Fight him if we have come to Linan
I'm proposing this idea as His Highness the Amir has supported and backed it.
Icons present all the Lebanese leaders
Because you're here in Beirut, you're looking at everyone in your area
And you are both present at the same hotel and in the same place
And at the same time, they met and talked.
We created this atmosphere, but from the beginning we had thought about it.
And this was the most important decision, its importance.
Of course in can
And this I felt at the Arab University
We will be fair and impartial mediators.
And, Allah knows, I believe this has proven to all that Qatar has made great efforts.
On both sides
To reach a mutually satisfactory solution for both parties
And in any case, there will be no single loser.
Before you took that step
It was discussed at the Arab University, and we found support.
What we did there
And I spoke to him, and we were there
If we succeed in Lebanon in transferring them to Doha
And my instruction was that
Give them sugar and take away their mobile phones
We managed to get them there. As for the Brotherhood in Syria, they were supporters of that stance.
And I want to say at the beginning that without Arab support, the committee could not have done anything.
They wanted to know why they wanted the solution
I think the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that's happening
and this tension
There is tension in Somalia, there is tension in Sudan
In this regard, the surrounding area is within the Arab world.
And everything we extinguished the fire
It is beneficial for the Arab world regarding foreign interventions and...
and if possible, try to be in
Forces send
Even militarily
In such a case, I think it's a mistake.
At the point of state of the Sheikh
He always said solving the Lebanese issue and the Lebanese matter
Saudi-Syrian agreement
B qaf qaf, if it's correct or qaf arabic meaning Qatar and the Arab University
Could what happened in Lebanon lead to a serious reconciliation between the Arab Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Syria?
In the Arab world, we need self-reflection.
Because of Arab disputes
And an agreement between two Arab countries
And this we have tried it
in the seventy-three war
When Arabs agree to resolve a matter
I think this is beneficial.
Saudi Arabia and Syria have an important role in Lebanon.
The two sides
They prevail in wisdom
Arab relations are on the right path
Because we in the Arab world are facing immense and great challenges.
Everyone plays in our arena
And we have neither power nor strength.
And how can we stop playing in the Arab countries' arena?
Arabs who are at the lowest level of agreement on the minimum consensus
Unfortunately, we are complaining
and we are watching
Our lack of agreement in Arabic and our lack of trust in Arabic—trust is missing between Arab countries.
And then the Arab countries
It's not about defamation, but rather a kind of
Jalsi what is Jalsi
This qazih needs a pause from all of you, I think.
Do you really want this wish? Will you actually ask for an Arabic flag?
We mourn when he mourns and we rejoice when he rejoices.
I mean, it came with the talk
Can you take on the role of mediating the situation between Damascus and Riyadh, even if indirectly?
Means being eager to find solutions and being certain that it's due to their capabilities.
They may reach an agreement.
Among them are many disputes
And it was in harmony with policy, and I am certain that surely this will happen.
Relations improve
Both parties need to take a step forward.
But I can't be sure that this is what is happening right now.
I'm not sure if Arabs will focus on resolving disputes between Arab countries and the problems of Arab countries that I mentioned.
Now is the time of optimism, and the mood of pride among citizens that there is a general awakening of the Arab language.
But I can't connect what happened in Lebanon.
It can be translated as "on the ground, meaning there is an Israeli-Palestinian escalation."
There could be a escalation, perhaps American, perhaps Iranian, perhaps others too.
Won't you still fear her in the coming months?
We are Arabs
What we can ask for is food and medicine delivery only
and electricity for people
We in Qatar are ready, Your Highness is always ready.
More than one million and a half Palestinians are besieged.
We do not want them to have weapons, nor do we want their victory, nor do we want...
They are doing all of this
and Kehfaba
And if God wills, we will give him to the Red Cross so that he can reach the Palestinians.
And with the Palestinians, they are only given food and medicine.
And our disagreement will continue with them
And I hope that the Palestinians on both sides will prevail over national interest.
and leave the illusions behind
This Palestinian divide means a major wound now.
On the solution
and yet they did not abide by it
This is a dangerous procedure which must be followed in accordance with Makkah.
And they should request that even if they go back once again to Mecca or to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
And let this dispute be settled
They will not benefit.
No return from either side
I hope it can be solved but
Our position is well known in this matter, and the amount to all concerned parties, that we
We will not be involved and will not accept being involved in any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with her.
But our main goal is an independent state, and that is the goal of all independent states.
Kellen sees the interests, but these interests will not see them or see us.
We are convinced that the Gulf's fate lies in a clear agreement among the members of the Cooperation Council.
And Iran is ready for cooperation and coexistence in peace.
But when he says that the country is not a party to Qatar
Is there any elaboration or explanation?
Just a mention
I will never
Well, I would like to go back if you allow me for the Lebanese file
Honestly, the Sheikh's country meant we were facing a major blockage; lately, in the last hours, we've reached a solution.
There are those who have linked what happened to what was announced.
Perhaps it's scattered information with no connection to most, but what actually happened?
Until you reached this result
What happened in Istanbul, I know there were specific dates beforehand
Ah, were you aware of the job postings?
Continuously in the process of solving
And without any doubt, the Kingdom's support is very important.
And a change in negotiation tactics
Regarding the discussions, it led
A positive result that we have brought together so many parties from so many sides
And we began to talk
This reflects an Arab and Qatari orientation through this document
Tell me what's wrong with this page
And we began to talk in the first one over the second
And the last moment to overcome the obstacle remained at the end.
But the prince passed by the edges
And removed this obstacle
And there was a solution in it
We heard the words of Qatar's Amir during the opening session in Doha.
It means not to consider that your role now
See, the most important thing is to remove this document from the display
We do not have any regional ambitions.
And by God, we would have control over the country or something because we are the country.
We are proud of ourselves, believing that we are capable of contributing to solving issues together with our brothers and others.
But the Arab world is very important
in countries of the world
We want her to do this, and this is very important.
Allow small states to undertake and support this role.
It means that in the quality of things, it is excellent, good, and less than good.
Last question from the Sheikh
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority?
Amineh Ihsan al-Dira' al-Bayn
What is the situation facing Israel?
We've stopped playing on the Arabic field
We will resolve the Arab countries' issues among us.
He is an active member in Iraq
To give him the tools
Regionally and internationally
But if we place our Russian rose in the context of
It means there is no victory for our leader, or any hope at all.
Thank you, Your Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabr Al-Thani, for this meeting.
And the international efforts made to put an end to the war on Gaza
And we begin with your request for a meeting of the Arab University Council at the level of
Ministry and indeed you have diverted your attention
Regarding the request for an urgent Arabic agreement
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. At the beginning, I'm happy brother Hassan that I'm in this program.
Even if the circumstances
The humanity that our brothers in Gaza advocate for
Conditions call upon us to do a lot of work.
Qatar has not diverted its attention from the Arab summit.
Actually, when we went with the idea of the Arab summit before
Unity is not a decision of the Security Council but also through
It is not always respected and is often disregarded.
And let me put it in another way
and we are preparing
The public can no longer bear it if Arab officials bear it.
Is not liable
When we were in Cairo
There were ten to fifteen copies, including handwritten ones.
We could have held the meeting if they had spoken up.
We will hold it to the extent that it is in line with Arab consensus.
And I'm saying that what they see as a problem is not really an issue for them.
How can he solve the problem?
Because she will dissolve
This is the important document
Because our goal is not preaching or advertising; our goal is to create.
It means they did not turn their gaze away from the peak
Among them, ourselves we ask
I'm going so we can press on the poor other end
The previous and the subsequent, the Security Council's decision, but we will remain focused solely on the issue of the Arab summit, the main Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad.
It is clear that the situation may call for an Arab summit attended by those present.
We found the majority of the Brotherhood supporters support the summit agreement.
By whom is it prohibited?
And I don't know what balance they mean here
It means we are the only nation.
Only the Arab world, meaning if we go to any other nations in Asia, Latin America, etc.
and without a solution
those classified as middle-power countries
And what is balance in our view?
Will we give up the Palestinian cause?
because what pleases us
Should we intervene in the Palestinian issue in a way?
It means that my mother doesn't allow entry for the good or the bad.
The guy is saying Hamas and Hezbollah don't know what they're doing, they're going to create a second party.
Is she a student?
And can we be considered just a part of the Arab body?
It means we had a plan to enter into an internal Arab conflict.
Well, let's go to the Security Council
There is no decision by the Security Council
I hope that after Israel has fulfilled its mission
Well, the second Arab ministerial meeting that you invited us to
which was dominated by debates, disagreements, and sharp confrontations
He is at a key point.
This is not the case, what's important is this.
If we have done a social
From border crossings
Peace is no longer in Qazih.
Are the ministers ready for that?
Because on one side I'm telling you we have to wait
Well, we are part of the Arab initiative
And peace talks with Israel collapsed.
We are saying that we are on one side saying that we are Ibn Khusr in this document
In losing more than what we're losing right now, well, we are always respectful, disciplined, and committed to the decisions from the days of the peace process.
Saudah Sheikh says that the disputes are not important.
Tasmeen who wishes he had the passion and so on
This means it is an expression of a political stance rather than a dispute between two ministers or anything else.
Unfortunately, this situation occurred.
But not everyone
We do not wish to speak on behalf of others.
It is very important that we be men of ourselves, men of our countries.
We are carrying out our nation's policy
Who represents her on matters of this kind?
I think, means
I think they don't respect us anymore.
Yes, is there anyone who is running for the West seat?
I swear by Allah, I have not accused anyone, and I don't want to accuse anyone in this document.
After the Security Council's decision
What will his schedule be?
The situation appeared to be a decision in the Arab effort
And here lies the dispute if Israel implements the resolution immediately
We can say in the decision
But Israel did not implement this decision
Now, are we ready to go and ask for Chapter Seven? I know it's obviously difficult.
Not questioned by the international community, and if questioned
with hesitation
The job position
They believe that their main achievement was doing harm to the Jews or Israelis.
So that they may take their rights
This current Arabic context
If the Arabs had not gone to the Security Council
And they agree on a summit and take difficult decisions
And the Western countries will strive against us
Because we are deep in the Arab world, in the global context, in humanity, and you're seeing the Arab street moving in this situation.
But this decision is important
Baqzih estdawal ra'isana wadha wa ra2i al-thalith
Means okay, and finally they said, "By God, he came out with nothing and even without a single thing."
Well, if now we're like Germany or others, will we demand?
They don't have to pay compensation for those who carried out the attack, meaning every time you provide false information.
and thousands are killed
This is because Lanc Lanc is a weak Arabic side.
We are Arabs, by our nature.
It is celebrated in how
Extracting the document
By treaty, and as a matter of justice and measure.
If the Arab people said, "If you are sending troops to Darfur, then we too will send troops to Darfur."
The Arabs considered Othman one of those who considered the decision of the eightieth and sixty.
And the group witnessed the adoption of the decision
What came out of the Security Council
I don't want to say that God is victory or isn't victory
Matters as they end up
Let us not boast of our victory
What are we doing?
We are making a decision on what we are committed to.
But I want to confirm you, we are committed to the decision.
Unfortunately, you will have to comply with it, but it is supposed that you should not comply with the decision.
Even if after Israel's refusal Israel returns and accepts
It means we
Will you have an alternative, or are you indeed those who call for a ministerial meeting?
I don't think the Arab world
The current situation is ready for no alternative
And I do not think the Arab community is ready.
In carrying out the blockade of Gaza
Other political objectives
To dominate one faction over another in Palestine, instead of settling who is right among them in Palestine.
We began to try to plan
Once again, he gathers intelligence without mentioning any names, neither Arab nor European.
And then they did it, meaning we're currently sharing together.
in implementation
What is expected of us from the West?
But if we go
This means I want there to be a sorting in it.
I mean, of course, I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about
This project started two years ago in Gaza and is not ongoing now.
It will be discussed about the topic two years ago but specifically regarding the decision
Do you have any objections to its terms?
Issued and implemented
As long as we allow
They may believe that we have a different point of view.
What was required was that everyone should have one common perspective facing him.
It's not necessary that we all stand in one perspective, but I believe those who have taken initiative have done so.
And we thank them for that.
Regarding what is happening in Gaza for two years now, and I said that parties
A faction overpowering another faction participated in the issue of the blockade of Gaza.
Indeed, accept the statements, hints, or accusations that have come from here and there.
About a real Arab consensus on everything currently happening in Gaza
It means we're keeping an eye on the parts.
From the situation, let me tell you, and we're not keeping track of everything.
but I know
The Palestinian Palestinian dispute
Be Arabically and internationally recognized
And if they had not differed, their dispute would have been over this difference alone.
and after the elections that took place
And Hamas' power

They insulted them and took away their opportunity and showed them disrespect.
Iridon, fix am hem am hem nas till now revolutionaries, meaning revolution, what they know is only the Bandar and fighting.
But today's weather is
Arabically, we believe that this radical movement should not reach power.
Now they say about them that there is aggression in their actions
Previously, Hamas broke the ceasefire or the truce that the Palestinians from Gaza had agreed to.
Al-Hadhanah
The people of Palestinian Gaza will remain for two years together.
This isn't mine
For Israeli security reasons
And make it clear to them, this decision does not concern me, I am in Qatar.
But what's the fault of the remaining people?
What is it and then who decides?
And these or these countries do not have full sovereignty in choosing
Governments
It is the root of the problem.
But I'm not sure if it's possible to treat it.
If we witnessed, we witnessed that we have differences.
But it was clear that if we were required to defeat one faction over another because of this faction
Group we consider them terrorist or the ones we consider them
What happened here all of this led to
And even the promises they made, the party experiencing them are appropriate.
What did they do for him?
We return to the international and Arab efforts made to put an end to what is happening, as you mentioned.
There is a UN Security Council resolution that Israel has still rejected.
And there is the Egyptian initiative that
Egyptian in Cairo
On those Egyptian efforts
Actually, it's not wrapping
They are required to play an important role.
And also Egypt shares its borders with Israel's borders and Palestine's borders.
And we
And now, O Prophet, cease the disputes.
In Gaza and Annapolis, people are stopping the violence in Gaza because
This is not the way to peace
There must be something
And therefore, we always request a greater role from them.
What they announced about it
It means that the initiative cannot be evaluated now.
Or give me the opportunity to succeed or study
I think the chances of success are
If the brothers in Egypt could
Engage Palestinian viewpoints
And those who discussed the initiative are making the hesitant side in Gaza appear foolish.
Because the one who touches might say yes or might say no
And this is an important point.
When the decision No. 86 was issued
We have an Arab Palestinian problem here.
We don't want to hear one side.
But I would have liked it if the Palestinian delegation had left when they did.
And when they went to the university, they asked for a companion from Gaza to join them.
Even today the Israelis say that this is our brother, we are one with them.
This is an important point.
We do not grant power
It is our goal, our priority, our commitment, and our responsibility to build our policy
Power is on survival.
The Sheikh Al-An
It means I don't know if it's possible to discuss the Egyptian initiative since you haven't reviewed its terms, but
From a fundamental standpoint, do you think it is suitable to serve as the executor of the international decision on the implementation of the United Nations and the 1991 resolution as some have stated?
Balanced role
Now it's not before or after because
Every day he washes himself
In the blood of our brothers there is spilling
As soon as we want to escalate or the Israelis escalate this situation, as soon as they stop the operation, we will start proposing this initiative.
And I'm sure the brothers in Egypt know about this and are careful about it.
And this is what I want to explain: everything I am saying
Now it's necessary to dissolve the document
And it's not like what you want Israel
It is noteworthy Turkey's role since the beginning of the crisis
It means, is it an expression?
About a Arabic void
And there was no doubt that the position was striking.
And it has a deep Arab essence.
Her entry is in an Arab deficiency in an Arab deficiency
We know that there is an Arab deficiency
Partly due to disagreements
Partly because of each person's own beliefs; I believe my own perspective is the best.
And so-and-so believes his point of view is better.
And in consensus, how do we make people respect us and know that there is an Arab decision?
And we shall not be divided among ourselves.
One says, "We won't give them three extra days so we can call them and respond to the group so they become equal and the job gets dissolved."
We must rise above this and not accept this.
They might have mistakes too; we will hold Hamas accountable.
Arabic Arabic
but now
Indeed, I will inform them of the truth.
Within the context of the position, Qatar is also required to comply, as we hear, we will return to this point, but
Meanwhile, you also heard
Khalid Meshal yesterday was the political office head of the Hamas movement.
First of all, it's not necessary that every statement made by Brother Khalid al-Masal is accepted, despite my respect and appreciation for him.
Why don't we sit down with Khalid al-Masal and talk to him as Arabs?
I will deliver it to the Arab University and announce it.
This is important talk
From Hamas
Israel's conditions also include conditions
Let them be the ones to set conditions, meaning it's forbidden for them to set conditions, and Israel will set conditions.
First of all, what do you think about this Arab popular gift?
If the masses or the people, we don't need to hear their words, they keep saying to us, "What did you hear?"
It's completely different, he says first, "free your country"
With allies and without allies, liberated the country from Nazi occupation
Now it's us who were talking about it.
The Arab insult is that we are insulting
The leaders represent the views of their peoples
Arab peoples in all those demonstrations we have witnessed
It can be met from these rows of demands.
Also, many who criticize Qatar in this stance are calling for
Given what is happening, the office and the representative office remain open.
What are they talking about with the same logic?
By cutting ties, we walk with every Arab country.
To sever all relations, even if there is a treaty between them
Iridon Qatar only at night
And we
And this is more important than the relationship
Not just in this decision, but in other tougher decisions too.
From this decision
It means that we must have a unified Arab stance.
For others
No one sells anything for a price, because no spiritual or material benefits can be derived from it, or it is claimed that they can.
Yes, it means that before we close this file on this issue, there are also countries that have taken individual steps.
Good, Chavez's situation differs; Chavez has a conflict with America.
Our people don't need us to call them.
Five permanent ambassadors and the arguments have arrived these films
We've passed that street, which is now smarter than that.
At the top of the roof, the happiness of the Sheikh
He calls on resistance forces in Lebanon to confront the Israeli aggression and so on.
Do you think that if this issue were addressed within a single Arab framework, it could succeed?
But we call for an Arab stance that respects us through it.
What I thought the Arab countries were ready for fighting
Nor are we motivated
How did we hide Syria, rescue Lebanon, and rescue the second countries, and in Arab countries that do not speak with us?
What's the point of being there?
He is of a special kind in Arab relations
This means this is the current policy among Arab countries.
List but I think my permissions have expired
In the objectives
The important issue
and we know how his Lebanese background
Lebanon, there is no doubt that
He gave an example saying, "If you return to them."
The situation in Gaza differs from the situation in Gaza; they have still not changed.
Surrounded from all sides
and this blockade
It has a nature that differs
Yes, I mean here the objectives with regard to Israel, meaning the objectives of the operation with regard to Israel.
A day when Flan is punished, a day when Flan is punished, a day like that, a day when Flan is given a reward
And therefore, the example of those who have moved to Lebanon is not a good one for them.
The model of solution achieved in Lebanon
He considers it acceptable.
al Gaza
See the problem in Gaza or among the Palestinians—他们的 solution is easier than the solution in Lebanon.
Different opinions as to whether we should return to our current situation or return to the past
My disputes over power
On the distribution of power
This is different because their fabric is closer to b'ecz.
From the intellectual fabric in Lebanon
Therefore, the solution is easier.
And here is the problem
Sheikh Saadah
It means we don't have much time left if we extend this topic any further.
And diplomat means
How can this process end?
For the Palestinians in Gaza
Let me tell you
or he might be watching
and we will help
The ones who didn't come with us
Failure will be ours, we are Arabic.
From a strategic point of view
But the Palestinian side
There were some efforts, but we did not witness a comprehensive initiative.
No precedent before or now, why?
He's not the one who started it, we're aware of that.
The one handling the matter, we help without mentioning Qatar's name since it might be sensitive to others hearing "Qatar"
And our goal is not to meet at a summit, because we already have a summit in three months.
Would we be better than our brothers if we took the initiative? I don't think so.
And we will not oppress them
History will not forgive us if we oppressed them
It means we are part of this initiative; we saw all the parties present at the Thursday meeting, and the discussion was postponed due to going to the Security Council.
We hope that, Allah willing, we will succeed. We wish our Arab brothers to support us as much as possible in this project.
We regret to withdraw from the competition.
Arabic Arabic
In its rift with the Sudanese government at times
And this is also our problem, meaning okay, we fight among ourselves, we differ among ourselves.
What do I want to include in this document?
In Kuwait, on the 19th of this month, as I believe, the Arab situation is as follows
As you know, as I mentioned and elaborated on your capabilities
Does the Arab world as a whole help the first economic summit?
His Highness
And of course, at any summit with any Arab brother, we always prohibit.
And what we always have is that it prevents attendance at any meeting.
But he does not fear that it may turn into a political peak.
Of course, given that time imposes itself
It's too late, even if it means after ten years
We talk about Palestinians after they have eaten for twenty-five days.
It means it would be
It is not said that the Arabs were not able to achieve socialization.
This we have said
This we have said
Respectfully, this meeting is scheduled and we are committed to it.
It means I think we
The Arab street is upon us

And therefore it means I
and we submit
And just what are you saying, this is final?
On this meeting
Thank you our viewers for watching.
And until we meet, continuous coverage of the ongoing war on Gaza. Until we meet.
A few days ago, the celebration of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities took place.

By contributing to the drafting of the private law draft
As well, his membership in various local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
As well as delivering more than seventy lectures, papers, presentations, and published articles in Arabic and international journals.
Let's start by agreeing on the term currently in use.
Regarding people with disabilities—do you mean people with special needs or people with disabilities as I mentioned?
Now the first, good evening
Because people with disabilities have taken the human rights approach or the human rights culture.
Because she treated people with disabilities as people first.
Human
And then his disability arose from his attempt to adapt to society.
Then the medical concept was to overpower.
Then the concept moved towards a concept of
Private education and private tutoring emerged
This group has become
We began calling them people with special needs.
and these are the standard rules from which it was derived
The role of the Special Rapporteur concerned with monitoring the implementation of this instrument
Then the pace accelerated until the international agreement emerged, which became legally binding and distinguished itself from the rules in this regard.
And established a basic condition or fundamental rule for this term
The one who treats these people as humans, as people, as individuals
With the change of terms as you preferred, is there a change in the view of this social group?
Yes, and it is measured in a way
Varying from region to region
but the particular thing about this document
The Arab world stood out or differed
However, the human rights legal approach contains a human rights culture, for example in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons might be due to financial resource shortages, not necessarily.
Of course, this is what I wanted to say: culture exists, but there is sometimes a lack of resources, and sometimes a lack of political will.
Sometimes legislation, but
But unfortunately, awareness of human rights and cultural rights is lacking.
10 percent of the world's population has disabilities
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities are in Namibian working age populations
and they are suffering from idleness
It means through my visit to Darfur
He and with the mines and weapons
Males have a slightly lower threshold.
The disabled will be located in remote areas, in distant regions.
Therefore, there are many trends among the clusters operating in this field, which are trying to raise
Awareness to achieve justice through education
Instead of creating many religious centers, if that expression is correct.
It aims to establish rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
And this is the only thing among the matters that Allah's praise for which we have worked in the office.
I tried to work with the organizations present in his country, Qatar
Formed working group
or ensure that the work agendas of these humanitarian organizations include those centers
In light of the declining situation of disabled people around the world
I can't release it or agree with you that there is a decline.
If it is declining, then the Arab region due to the lack of obstacles
The social context, the political context, the economic context— we cannot expect people with disabilities to be in a good situation.
And they are from the marginalized groups
And in a country like such, a region like Gaza, like Darfur
On the contrary, I cannot absolutely say that there is no improvement in the situation.
And indeed, for example, I translated on the spot, like if I could, give me an example.
Like the Qatar Red Crescent
We agreed that you enter the projects
For people with disabilities in the health aspect, this strategy has been adopted, and there are other projects as well.
We tried to include it as well.

Good evening, Salim Quro
Suleiman Krou, forgive me, Suleiman
Dear greetings to you and to the respected lady Hafsa.
First, is there a cognitive barrier embedded in United Nations laws?
Cognitive impairment means a person who was healthy before became impaired due to pressure, and thus did not suffer cognitive impairment.
The disability resulted from torture and imprisonment, which caused mental disabilities until now, it is being treated for six years.
I know, I know, about forty people, some children, some disabled adults, due to prisons.
Is there a law in the United States?
Truth means me
Knowing means being aware, those who know, as they know their children
And every intention means intention without without without without making themselves labels
There are values in the West
Agreed upon but people
From those who have misunderstood or strayed from Islam, no wisdom is taken.
Thank you very much, Naveed Al-Saadi, for informing us from Kuwait
I return to our guest to comment on what was said in
Communications Salim questioned whether there is a mental barrier.
Yes, the classification was secured.
The Global Disability includes cognitive and mental disabilities as well as referred to.
She has identified these disabilities as sensory disabilities, meaning visual or hearing disabilities, or physical disabilities.
Of course, as you mentioned, the disability is
Action and reaction occur within a particular social context.
in the Arab world or in any other regions
It is certain that combating disability has taken a long phase.
and even at the level of the United States
For example, during my experience and work as a special advisor, one of the issues I was trying to address and work on was...
Meaning of truth for all
so that he may prepare for them
The different arrangements to ensure their admission to schools as well as organized work.
Work on vocational training for people with disabilities
I entered with praise for the improvements.
especially after the reform
In general, it exists in this international body.
I also mean as a special advisor
It's a practical truth, and this has been positive for me, albeit not directly related.
and supported this position
He has been involved in many meetings, for example the international agreement
Rights of Persons with Disabilities
It means its deficiency due to these limitations or shortcomings.
For example, regarding legal principles
And this is one of the basic points in the world of disabilities that no
The United States regretfully notes that the item was omitted during preparation and drafting.
Regarding organizations and agencies
For example, and so on
The world, governments, and non-governmental organizations of the major countries of the United States
We conducted a latest survey
For United Nations organizations and their regional agencies
We want to know up to what extent disability programs are included in their agendas.
If budgets are balanced, if there is participation of people with disabilities
Human rights
It is not only the stimulation of growth.
Well, we're now receiving more communications with us. Messari Najib from Algeria, please, Najib.
And upon you peace
I wanted to ask my sister from Algeria, when exactly.
I would like to ask, am I allowed to pray while I have a physical disability?
Well, we'll ask her this question, Nageh Msri, we talked to you from Algeria, thank you very much, Ahmed
Al-Hilali from Greece prefers Ahmed
Good evening, madam. Good evening, to your guest.
Healthy housing, seasonal clothing, so you can take them on seasonal trips—this is what happens in Europe
And does a psychiatric patient count as a disabled person?
especially perhaps causing harm to others or to themselves
Everything we discuss here is irrelevant and unproductive. Thank you.
The woman mentioned the financial liability.
The poor countries themselves in Africa and Latin America, and I am demanding from them
Establishing the International Disability Support Fund and allocating one percent of each global institution's net profit.
And this will be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
It will cause great suffering and hardship for many disabled people and war victims, etc.
Thank you very much, Ibrahim Abdullah, for sharing with us from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Mashri asks and presents his problem: he is disabled.
At the local or national level, it means through Algeria
The needs of the local community must be met by this community.
They are the same rights that any other person should enjoy.
In truth, life first, then truth in residence, truth in health, truth in education.
Therefore, I truly call upon governments, and Arab governments in particular, from this platform.
For the benefit of this citizen and this individual
In order to ensure
Those needs and rights have been embedded in the existing agendas already.
No no there's no need to create any devices
A new initiative to meet the needs of the disabled person or there is no need if the country does so
It is capable of it, and in fact, it must necessarily fulfill it.
I first advise him to return and go back to the relevant government authorities if possible.
Because that would restrict the national scope, this scope must be restricted.
You mentioned the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; many countries have ratified it, but do not comply.
Here we raise a question from one of the participants who said why are there no laws here?
It's true, we are a human society, meaning there are many mistakes and many correct things within it.
Sure, many agreements and certainly many treaties do not contain any literal obligation.
Or the commitment of many countries has led to a lot like Sida and others
But there are violations and breaches, and we know that.
But the problem is to adopt an agreement and regulate it accordingly.
First, we will ensure at least that there is awareness.
This awareness starts from the top of this pyramid, which is the decision-makers.
And the officials, then it gradually extends until it reaches the community as a whole
We also commit ourselves to preparing reports, which will be sent to the United Nations.
The problem of knowledge and understanding and the enhancement of awareness and consciousness
For the reports, did you work as a representative at the United Nations?
Yes, what I saw and what I recorded there shows interest.
Therefore, there is a relative margin of appreciation for the agreement on the rights of persons with disabilities.
Therefore, I advise, encourage, and urge.
It also means that people with disabilities should be involved.
And we will hear what Ali A'abid al-Sanari, head of the Qatar Society for the Deaf, has to say to us.
Bakam talks about him, Sayed Naji Sargan, welcome, Sayed Naji and Sayed Ali too.

And the international agreement you are talking about now is a real thing.
It is a great benefit for all people with special needs around the world.
and especially in the Arab world
And we, and I wish for peace
In order for these countries to implement this international agreement
Which involves serving people with special needs, and it is essential that

Our dear viewers, welcome back to us for today's episode, the esteemed Sheikh Haseeb bint Khalifa Al-Thani.
For the disability, an international fund for support
The obstacle, and it would be obligatory for all countries to provide funds. What do you think about this proposal?
The United States has a fund known as the Disability Status Fund.
And unfortunately, those contributions are very weak.
The purpose of monitoring is to apply standard rules
When she worked for these years, there was hardly any support at all.
But from China and Austria
And this always means I thank this country for this support.
The main supporting country is my Qatar
The one who established the office through which we were able to implement many activities and projects, Allah's praise and thanks.
Yes, this lack of support indicates what?
It means just like we mentioned at the beginning, and this point is always raised.
With ordinary people
And how can we care about disabled people or show concern for the disabled?
It means that there is a real, genuine, and serious commitment.
In all its aspects, across all categories
The disabled child, the refugee, the displaced youth
All of them will indeed reach a level referred to as
Opportunity equality, participation and equality
And there are those voices that always demand, never tire, and never cease.
Why doesn't the Islamic region and the Arab region allocate a part, excuse me?
For the benefit of these programs and projects
Like what Qaradawy presented, and I thank him from this platform.
Islamic Bank for Development
From those who have taken over the budget he allocates
This non-compliance that I mentioned regarding the payment of financial obligations and
Funds for assisting people with disabilities: Does it only include Danish and Arab countries or also others?
Even advanced countries do not offer
Means the person before me, who was Swedish, yes.
Ways to strengthen the countries of the European Union
And definitely, there are many countries, especially in the Arab region, that haven't been
You are also known for the existence of this special course
And in my case, I mean the thing that happened
and Sweden and China
And unfortunately, the Arab region also had many promises, but unfortunately, only one country fulfilled them.
We will talk about the Arab region but
We have more communications Hamid Al-Marri from Qatar prefers Hamid
Hello to you all

Dr. Hello, Sister Haseh
Almost ten years
This girl, now we notice that her psychological issues are hindering her.
What is your role, in terms of the girl, like this one, she is suffering
She is with her colleagues
Sometimes it means even if we stay
What is your role regarding Qatarite girls in terms of children?
Thank you very much, Hamed Al-Marri from Qatar, Kuroan Bahjat from Kuwait, welcome to us
Just like they say to him, "Old man, your share"
Why don't you just pour our oil into a crack?
The Arab owners of the needs can count them.
They could help them
We have substantial financial resources.
We can break down the psychological barrier between us and them.
By reviving the individual's spiritual essence
And she is sought for this noble purpose.
Then indeed, if we truly believe
Thanks and appreciation to Sister Haseh for her dedication and for all she has done during her tenure as the Special Coordinator
With our sincere thanks and appreciation, and gratitude to the State of Qatar for all it has done for persons with special needs.
Thank you very much, A'isha Mohamed, for sharing with us from Qatar
Hello, Professor and Sir
And upon you peace
On the honor of your esteemed side
Husseinah Sheikhah Haseh
My question is about prevention
As they say, prevention is better than cure.
There is another level of disability ignoring wars and traffic accidents.
At the genetic level, it might be due to shortening by families, namely marrying relatives.
I think this is a big advantage.
Results in disability
Thank you very much, Colonel Sherif, who shared with us from Tunisia. Welcome back, our guest.
First connected Hamd Al-Marri asked about
Here he is taking a girl with a disability, a psychological disability.
And he wonders where it is heading
in every country
Definitely, there are services provided for all types of disabilities in the country Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether mental disabilities as we mentioned or any psychological disabilities
Regarding this for schools
Previously, there was
No, private education. I mean the Ministry of Education and Training, which has now become the Higher Council.
The brigade commander Sherif from Tunisia highlighted a very important point.
and scientific papers, etc.
But among programs for organizations working exclusively with people with disabilities, yet even the campaigns that
The programs related to girls
All of these have directed numerous campaigns and reproductive health programs even
I spoke about this aspect
Adopt healthy strategies
Carry out awareness-raising
The risks of marrying cousins
and genetic factors
And I believe that in his country Qatar
And by customs and traditions, but they take a definite amount of time
Especially in tribal societies
But over time there will be a response to it, but it is necessary that there be a legal obligation, in other words
Yes, Krawan raised a question and proposed that one percent of the Arab countries' budget be allocated.
To assist people with disabilities, please let me know first.
Yes, there is the statistical estimate that the World Health Organization applied to the entire world.
There are forty or approximately forty million disabled people.
Half of them are women.
But these numbers are multiplying.
For example, there is a study in South Africa that found and proved it.
It is certain that the statistics that emerged about the war in Iraq about the war in Gaza
Every dead person is followed by three accusers.
And since our Arab region means that our area has become a contested region without dispute.
even the proposal put forward by Bahjat Krouan
One percent will not be enough
To assist people with disabilities in the Arab region if possible
The issue of descent relates to people with disabilities or other marginalized groups.
Honestly and sincerely, I don't think they agree.
that addresses their problems and needs
I emphasized that people with disabilities are the most neglected.
The surveys carried out by governments usually do not include people with disabilities.
True, Waiza is related to his culture and society, and sometimes to constraints.
The community, meaning when the population is counted by
The concerned devices
Regarding the presence of a person with a disability in the house or home
There was only one question: Is there a disabled person or not?
The department responsible for this document and the individuals involved therein
We collaborated on preparing a form
We advised that more details be provided
First, indicate the gender of this person with a disability, if any.
And will his assistant cooperate or not?
Actually, even the number itself, as you know, we haven't reached the precise result.
Interest is also shown in Fatima al-Dosri's progress with us from Qatar, welcome Fatima.
And peace be upon you
I am a Qatari citizen and have a child with disabilities.
I would like to express my gratitude to the ruler of the country, His Excellency Hamad.

May God bless you, honestly, I have a comment.
First of all, I am a hearing specialist and I worked in Qatar for approximately four years.
and our month was dedicated to awareness of hearing and speech problems and
We were conducting workshops, debates, and awareness campaigns for the hearing impaired.
Now I'll talk about Jordan. I've been living in Jordan for approximately three years.
Indeed, it offers new and excellent services.
Indeed, we are offering new services, either in the physical, non-physical, or spiritual aspects.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education and Higher Education visited the sources.
The following is under the Ministry of Education in government schools
Similarly, we are private institutions
We receive wonderful and beautiful support
Okay, Karem, do you have a direct question only due to time constraints? Sorry for that.
Do you have a direct question?
In her country Qatar, in the UAE, Jordan, the services are excellent and in my opinion they are very good.
Commenting on what came up in the viewers' calls

And now you wish it to come true
Of course, I hope from either side.
I hope this study or this survey serves as a benchmark and that more high-quality research is conducted in this field.
Also, let me know from this experience
Experience of six years
And coordination among Arab countries as well
They also have a role that is not merely a matter of rights; they are the recipients of rights.
Mrs. Haseeb bint Khalifa al-Thani, the former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Disability, thank you.
We welcome the stylish presenter on the league and cup channel, good morning, good morning

I'll leave you all the space to congratulate each other, everyone will congratulate us at their own pace.
I had an open studio for five hours and then I had two hours but not today
We hope the Qatari government continues to lead the people it serves to achieve this global achievement.
I'm so glad I got this opportunity to be here and I congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
He is the crown prince Sheikh Tamim
Yes, of course. You are one of those from the mathematical field, and someone working in this area and familiar with these lines and this domain in general.
so even we
Between us and America, we deserve it because when we took the five votes, four went to Qatar and one to America.
Not from the night, because our file is rich and comprehensive and supported by many ambassadors, highly supported, let us take control of the stadiums.
It means that in some countries, people were afraid, maybe there could be something like in America.
And perhaps in the host countries, these matters are already ready, so they don't need to build stadiums or undertake all the projects related to this event.
Lan Orydi important ready
But they were afraid of this point.
Captain Ali, I expect this to be a very important achievement for athletes.
I expect it will enter the political economy arena.
But Bedouins
What does this quantum achievement mean?
Of course, a great achievement, especially for us Rajaeys, even for those who are not Rajaeys, their joy is evident.
God willing, I was informed about that moment of announcement.
And by God, I was excited from the workout, and we used to listen to the radio.

Sweina's journey began from the beginning
Alhamdulillah, it wasn't a very special day. I expect, and perhaps all the channels might have focused heavily on this event.
Lana, you're sure you're included in this topic?
And especially the private sports channels
How did they celebrate this occasion and what was their reaction?
There were media outlets from over a hundred channels worldwide.
A leading teacher has become clearly well-known across Qatar.
Definitely, also means that the player's presence in the team is very important.
And I expect this responsibility to be heavily on his shoulders.
What's your opinion on this point specifically?
Well, captain Ali, what are the qualities this player entering this national team must have?
Now more than once, Riad is going to the market.
And now we need a strong new generation
It means it has basic rules and carefully developed mathematical techniques in football.
What are the rules and fundamentals that must be present in this player?
I believe professionalism ensures everything.
The practice of exercises is the discipline of exercises.
All of these are basic things to help the player to put everything he has during matches or training sessions.
Each stage has its own characteristic, meaning you don't say it has a special trait.
She has so many flaws and shortcomings.
From various different programs, sports, and what I think is best for you—what do you feel about it yourself?
And by God, it's delicious
Let me actually keep you in good health, you should know that exercising is the most important way I can maintain my health.
Later, you have a hatred for the foot, your favorite, the fans are watching, everyone is angry with you when you leave the field, you want to say you love her.
What confines the journalist to one side of us
What confines you like this, puts you in a certain side
I don't care as long as you hate football
No, sports medicine isn't good sports.
Ali also means that in his various jobs, it's important that we talk about them.
I didn't want you to go back that way to be ten years younger so you could reach two thousand twenty-one
What I wished for was this job
Of course, everyone definitely wishes for this, especially when it comes to the World Cup, meaning that at any given moment, any player would want it.
It means that if he only watches the World Cup match, he becomes excited and happy, then why should he play in the World Cup?
I hope they remain in good faith, Allah willing, and this is their opportunity, Allah willing.
What word do you want to say from a professional player? What word do you want to say from your heart to them?
Half the time and our love, that you be with us
And by God, it's just what's currently happening, leave it at that.
He returned to the championships after a ten-year absence from his Gulf Cup title.
I was sure, may God be with you, that you'd have a beautiful signature from Qatar TV and sweet memories.
Maybe it means Qatar TV has become like a university, graduating a large number of media professionals.
Our team is a strong team, God willing, will win many different awards.
Let's talk about my job with the Am Asalal club mission
What's going on there? What did you tell me there? Hopefully, you're fine.
Of course, praise be to God, honest, am amlal.
Yesterday, of course, he was with us in the studio, and we talked a lot about the players.
I expect that the young people currently following us to feel that you are one of them.
Meltoob
It means a natural scene in the professional African league and player participation.
I have gotten my chance in am salal regarding ancestry or lineage.
I'm glad I was able to take Asia Cup spot with the team, Allah's pleasure.
I thank God I'm good with the team
Sport: How can we make it a social activity?
And how is it possible for Qatar to allow sports for women, children, and youth?
Linking them together means everything complements sports.
You have even different women's sports fields, each with its own role.
Physical activity awareness is spreading throughout society, from the young to the old.
We need almost a decade to reach this occasion. I think that's enough time.
Because the new generations are not looking at the details
In the current generation, parents are getting older, but in the next generation, we also need to start educating children about physical activity from a young age.
About Asbair, Asbair said that he is not denying it. The senior founder stated.
For me, one number for the new generation of athletes
What we need to do is lower our aspirations and start again.
They especially love football.
I want to engage the audience so they stay connected throughout all the different matches, even between clubs.
And by God, my friend, the real problem we have in the Qatari league is the lack of fans.
But we have this problem: attendance, and until now, the Qatar Union has not found a solution to attract the audience.
What style do we need to attract them to follow these matches?
The person themselves mean by their respect what they themselves dislike being prohibited from the field.
Media plays a key role in shaping public opinion.
And now they are working on a ticket system and a points accumulation system.
Lala is the union, meaning he has a plan with several steps to attract the public.
In front of the Andeh, there are ways like Rayaan that attract the public, of course Rayaan is rich, meaning he doesn't need public support.
For the Andalusian region, it is necessary that the Andalusian authorities carry out activities and initiatives.
The public's right to be informed, the public's right to be informed, I think these are the means we have
Al-3aibah means the new generation
Their love for the job, their faith, and their abilities—what's more important than material support? Spiritual support benefits much more.
We're definitely meaning to thank you for this nice meeting, God willing.
We love to take from you the latest words, in celebration of this wonderful victory, of course Qatar winning the 2022 World Cup, we are happy to begin.
I return to you that Qatar did not insist; on the contrary, it gave up and left, and has always been in violation of its promises.
With God's permission, I, Captain Ali, would like to deliver the final message I wish to convey in this meeting.
And I say to them: Congratulations, may Allah grant it to the Imam, may Allah grant it.
Thank you, Captain and player Qasim, we wish you all the best in your sporting journey and in your life, God willing. May God guide you, O Lord.
And let us prefer the Rida more and more
Topic of the youth's talents episode
Many young people believe that these songs are only visible now, but they have a deep and very significant history.
A group of young people singing Arabic or English lyrics
Today we're going to discuss this topic with a group of hip-hop enthusiasts.
And we'll get to know them better through the live interview that will bring us together with them.
Hello and welcome, our viewers, wherever you may be
A new style of singing has been spreading across the Arab and Gulf regions for years and h
Coming from the West and specifically from America, and it's rap singing
And before delving into the topic of rap singing
There are people who use any word without any hesitation.
Can anyone sing rap?
Regarding his book of songs
Most rap artists write their lyrics themselves.
Generally, all these details are quite numerous and important, and we will learn about them through two experts in the field.
They worked a sweet group
Welcome to Yusuf Al-Na'im and Salman Abdullah Yusuf, good morning
Hello and welcome, Salman, good morning.
Morning of light, hello
I'm really happy to have found you all with us through this program.
And also through the obvious topic of rap singing
What do you guys have to do with this issue Yusuf?
We saw that it means that hip-hop art was not meant to be present in the region.
With the best of luck
By the voice of the citizen
From it, there is the poetic, there is the melancholy, there are the topics related to politics.
Yes, I am in the loop about the link
And these songs are a form of art among the arts, just as visual art has the painter draw a picture, the poet writes a poem.
The singer can sing, the musician can play any instrument.
He feels accepted by the Qatari society from the Gulf society for this type of songs
One hundred and ten
There's a sense that people now love buying vinyl records for hip-hop songs.
Different ages
And in it there are elements, and by that meaning people have become more heard than before.
And there was a website like this
And how many of you are in this group until now?
It means anyone can say words, write poetry, and rap them in a hip-hop style.
The rapper and God are like what you say, you can say that he is the one who sings himself.
He who sometimes plays and he who touches the words
Ah oki
Hear him and with God, and God, I have registered this song here.
Well, all these songs I produced, from Salman, from Youssef, from whom? From any person from the same group?
What did you think she would be a simple certain brand available in the markets
But you know that when you're acting like a person, it means I'm going to create the album and put it on the market, which involves a business registration and procedures, meaning it's complicated.
Well, why didn't you think about the fact that you have twenty-five people, so only one hand can clap?
You need to have twenty-seven hands, may God protect you all, both young and old.
Work on this CD; this CD can be promoted through multiple internet sites.
You have Facebook, you have YouTube, you also have through local newspapers.
There are ten songs in it, as I think.
Registration is done at the same time
Shawy Ghadiem bas enha kan ya7ni wa7id ḥa7a
Quality is bad, but it's the same time, just clear
And it's a fifty CD surprise
It means that I can't say it's not there because some young people might have known this art for ten years.
I'm not sure about the registration, but I expect distribution in this current period, different.
And especially, it has a large collection of music, a large variety of techno music.
This is youth or these artists who produce a large number of sweet songs
Also, we talk about the parties they attended.
And Allah, the one who hosted the event, means in Doha, we participated in the event alone.
Of course, Al-Sadd club organized it for us, meaning they didn't join us.
Anthal engjof the public
You never expected a number like this
What surprised us was that family issues were more prominent.
Families are more than youth
From to and was an organization meant to mean excellence
We were all confused, meaning the first time in Dubai.
It means our expectation is no interest.
But the audience's reaction was amazing.
It was a long period full of song benefits, meaning
Alright, let's hear something or some words from one of the songs that went viral, something that came out to the public and gained popularity especially among the youth.
For example, let's hear the words clearly, even if we repeat them for the audience.
And we can hear it on the radio
At your convenience, please feel free to.
Salem agreed
The problem is that some words mean something else.
Let's hear it.
Madrid
With us now is the Doha Morning Program
I wake up every morning with a clear and open mind.
Salman was like a mountain, he had a period of five years of hardship.
One until he doesn't accept, he would be poor
I got Waid Nas on their group
Need to remove the words
Well, the songs you all sang, for example, give me a sentence from one of the sentences someone said, for example
He's a sho fi, not random songs, meaning the one who said it now, their name in English is Free Style
It means the same weight
But when we sing a song, the words get stuck in our heads.
Thank you, let's keep following it.
We can say good morning, my country, good morning, Qatar, with the Doha Morning program
You're all present, actively watching live, directly addressing the viewers.
I see one, one to one, one chess, they are expanding from the arts
With us, Doha Morning Program
Of course the beautiful song you saw
I insist right now that youth be present online and present everywhere.
Really, when did you register them?
She was a subscriber, she was a subscriber
Each one between us and them, each one a thousand times, will assert his own rights.
I feel that Yusuf won't be able to accept my words, either take them or even follow them.
Each one takes words
We're sure, I mean, I expect every artist, every painter, and every poet to always be...
Also, it's possible to write about love for the desert.
In love with the nation itself
Sure, you participated in the National Day through the march.
Through the beautiful songs of "You are Qatari youth, representing Qatar as well."
Doha is being decorated to welcome the Asian Cup, and there will be a large parade along the Corniche.
To welcome this event
And sitting here, we're bringing you these clips to welcome naturally
Doha welcomes Asia Cup
From Doha Airport to the city center
And we'll follow these live clips together
For the sake of our children, students, and this gathering of people, we must exist.
And I arrived at Doha Airport early this morning to continue
Preparations for hosting the major regional event
We're coming back again to our Youssef and Salim's studio visit.
Wa amah farqah farqah al rab al khaleej al qatari? صح
We can say about you, juzi
And by God, I mean we currently mean
Anar anertab hak el hafel bas mb akid
But now you're working on a specific event, and hopefully Yusuf will announce it soon.
God willing, I mean, not sure, because at the beginning, the journey is sometimes uncertain.
At the beginning of our journey, we wish you all the best and we are confident that our program, Allah willing, will become the greatest supporter, Allah willing, with all our hearts.
Salam Wanin also means that they meet as a group of young people, five and twenty persons.
And we will gather ideas, we will write them down together with the elders.
Definitely need to be in shared songs
It's not necessary that, for example, one person like Salman or Yusuf or any one of them, sings an entire song.
It's necessary that you all be in harmony and come together whenever you come together.
And by God, gathering all of them together once in twenty-five years is difficult.
Then I spoke to Yusuf, I spoke to Aflan, and I spoke to them so that today we can gather at a place.
So that I can think of the song and the words
And then, in its second phase, after
I register the one on it
He's got it, and he's finishing it.
This is how you'll get it, Joseph, just write, wire, wire, write, for failure.
See the experiences available here
Take them, meaning acquire the works of great artists
Take from them experience, meaning learn their techniques.
Hey for sure we always mean it
Artists who have gained experience and recognition in this field or have expertise and established presence in this field
One hears them, sees their methods, their approaches; if someone tries to copy their style, it means he doesn't imitate it.
It means that if I adopt his style, his tone, and the same word level.
I'm just following, I don't bring anything new, I don't have anything unique here.
It means we rely upon them more.
Yes, I also expect there to be a large group of young Gulf residents within the Gulf itself.
In a simple way, let's follow this report together, benefit from it, enjoy it, and also see with the expert what this report has to offer.
The gifted remains surrounded by the aura of those people.
Using very primitive means
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah al-Da'il
that is far from the Saudi capital, Riyadh
Five hundred and fifty kilometers
He possesses exceptional ability and extensive experience.
The disclosure of surface groundwater locations
Deep within, exceeding a hundred meters
Do you know that drilling wells is expensive?
But with the expert, he can determine the appropriate location for drilling the well.
Of course, the way to discover or
Determine the location of water
She has been so since ancient times.
They were our fathers and our ancient grandparents.
They use information to locate the wells
For drilling
Methods of Abu Ibrahim for discovering water
Not a modern device
or a soil analysis in scientific laboratories
But his work depends on the grace of God.
and its underground channels beneath the surface
They are either the seeds of the pomegranate.
A branch of raisin or a branch of fig
Now we are practically implementing the water flow detection process.
Now start going back, stand at the end of the channel
Go back once again
Go back go back
This origin goes back to here, if from here the sign originates.
And thus the water course comes to an end.
It requires a great deal of experience and patience.
So that the operator can access the sensor's tool movement
I went to more than one area
It means 59 out of 100.
Of course, this is the method and the way to use copper plates.
And of course, there is no precise scientific explanation
For this method
It is astonishing that people engaged in this primitive profession should achieve such success.
95.5 percent
The discovery of surface groundwater sources
Glory be to God, He has taught humanity what they had not known. This is a report, naturally, which we have taken naturally from the Kingdom of the Arab Saudi State.
They worked hard, established a special branch, and ended up with more than one CD.
Means whether it's announced or just told to them, the phone
And sometimes competitions arise among Gulf countries, between Qatar and Bahrain, between Qatar and Kuwait, between Qatar and

About a problem about about means until the end no witnesses and
Follow it or if I'm like my upper self, meaning if I'm empty, meaning there's nothing in me.
God willing
Waiza ibn al-fasih, at the same time a prophet, takes such and such.
It means a large set of songs
Let us try our best to bring it forth
We will keep in touch with you between periods along the way like this.
Even we know what the latest news is for this period
But I need the group's name

We're definitely with you live through the direct link we're currently streaming for our viewers.

I'm sure we are proud of them and proud of the different arts.
And it addresses many social and psychological issues among youth.

Sure they'll complete the twenty-five
We welcome you again, Abi Yusuf and Salman, and may God greet you once again.
Please stop the subscription
Well, if we try to reach the company without knowing the company and where we're supposed to contact them

On behalf of the branch
We're online, we're always available.
You are doing it just as we saw with B'azza, with Allah's permission, what you have done.
They are singing these songs, leave them on a group of pictures your pictures, you are the personality
He and they download them to YouTube and to websites where videos might be available and someone might follow them.
And indeed, We revealed it before us.
And in Wade's songs means
The obstacles they're currently facing is that there's no website they need a company to take them forward.
Indeed, you need a place where you can all gather together, you are a group.
May your wishes come true and actually reach the high level you all dream of achieving.
It means we stuck to it, finally.
You say to us, "Allah, we're coming back to you, organizing it for you, delivering the boom to you."
Icon means something means something official
Because it means a five-year period now
Means Huawei, no more than that
Yeah, sure, we joined programs, we joined shows.
I wish for Icon to evolve into
If it means something, it means it supports us all the way because we're with them.
Yes, Waiza, prophet, we know your wishes, Salman, not Yusuf's wishes. What can you possibly say?
The single security measures surprise the music video
If God wills, we hope for all the best through this lesson.
Tayebah, and we hope Allah will always keep your songs present in the Arab world in the world.
Indeed, this is a refined art, a highly auditory art.
Among them are messages similar to what they mentioned.
We will always be with you, Allah willing, and we wish you all the best, Allah willing.
Salmoli on al qurub kullah, wa al-tawfiq bi-iddin Allah

There is a supermarket or a grocery store here
Put there any person who shops at the supermarket or elsewhere
Why are you putting them in the truck? What do you want to buy?
It shows a big screen showing the components of this product
This idea was also great and feasible.
It means just a barakut housing unit operating in the area reveals this product.
And it is made easy for the buyer regarding the purchased item.
It takes full details on a dedicated screen
I expect Icon to be like that in a healthier mind.
When Icon is on your device with the same network

And what are the dangers and risks associated with them?
There will be full details in it, meaning
He has ambitions, for example, in a number of projects, four or five.

They solved traffic congestion and other parking issues, and were also very creative and effective, meaning that
God willing, the Children's Cultural Center
Let's, Professor Abdullah, also talk about the different activities we're expected to see hopefully in the coming days.
Yes, and Allah knows, there are obviously surprises, but just a quick pass by.
Ideas, if you like, mention them from the projects you've seen or heard about
For example, this is movement under the roof. The main smart or creative idea behind it is that
Whenever someone leaves his house, it means a shift.
White gather at a certain point
Of course, all these pictures are the scenes you're following; I expect they'll enjoy them.
Innovations of Children
Exactly yes, for example in the same cash machine
For women, for example, I have a card
Insert this card. For example, I need a black t-shirt.
For example, right now I'm either complaining about stores or, for instance, I'm complaining about missing items, like my house—my key, I don't know what it is.
For example, office keys, office keys,
Of course, our main goal is aimed at the noble vision of Sheikha Moze.
The Honourable Amir's Court
In the early stage, this has paramount importance in project design.
A number of them were selected from three hundred children.
Then also among us are the reliable orators during Ramadan.
Yes, she who organized the closing ceremony was a broadcaster.
Indeed, it means that we love to open our hearts and doors to all children who want to submit their programs.
Then they launch themselves forward.
And our need for support on this issue is also high, and their presence is at the top of our priorities.
These projects and programs serve this main idea.
With children's diverse and varied skills
To promote self-development
Well, how much cooperation do you have with the different youth groups in Qatar?
Yes, there is a medical school in Qatar.
Of course, all of our programs are built on partnerships.
It means all our programs are specialized partnerships
With a set of specialized social service institutions focused on developing these skills
He is partnering with all institutions interested in the field.
The Society of Photography
The Women's Innovation Center, the General Secretary of the Council of Ministers, also played a very significant role.
Yes, he played a major role in explaining Qatar's vision
Training children on them
And attracting them and encouraging them for children, all of our programs are based on institutional partnerships.
According to the specialization of these projects and institutions
What's wrong with you guys?
Of course, our presence in Katar is a strong boost and means significant support.
and faster shape
Now, naturally, there are several projects being developed in partnership with Katar. We are currently reviewing them for launch, hopefully within the next two months.
Of course, there is cooperation in many programs.
Specifically regarding reading

And by building a promising scientific future for all children, future generations, and the coming youth, if God wills.
The message intended for parents, youth who follow us, and children who want to be present through the center
What we are giving out now
Our children have ideas that we should not underestimate nor minimize.
We must give it our attention whatever these ideas may be.
Indeed, if someone thinks about this idea, their interest in it will develop this idea at least into a deeper love for children leading to thinking.
This is very important for me to pay attention.
I communicate with him spiritually. I communicate with him now. Our major issue is that most fathers
He is given support
He is given encouragement by parents and educators.
Today, children are given greater attention by their imaginations. They are our future. They are the origin of this future.
It really means we've lived through this vision, walking among their projects.
To live in a dream
It means in a dream, all ideas are very wide imagination.
Now, the dream means for sure that many dreams have come true and have become reality.
Praise be to God. We hope, Allah willing, success for our children who were present.

I reached seventy projects
Projects are implemented with leadership and innovation.
To speak more about this hadith
The National and the Center for Children's Culture as well
Professor Abdullah explained at the beginning in brief about the Al-Ma'arif.
What lies within it brings together a great many activities. What, in brief, can we say about this hadith?
It became a new style of expression, children expressing their love, loyalty, and sense of belonging to their homeland.
Of course, it came under the supervision of the Minister of Education and Training, the Minister of Education and Higher Education.
In his journey, this prophet came
He grows up until he reaches twenty thirty
Of course, we began training children to see Qatar's twenty-three areas through its five axes.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, and environmental development
First, he knows now that Qatar is in twenty-three, and it will reach
Then he begins to think about how his thinking process works.
How does one innovate? How can one become creative and generate innovative ideas?
I expect that much, meaning his field is wide, may Allah bless him and make it broad.
But when we give him certain symbols and assist him
I expect his thinking to grow bigger and more extensive.
Professor launched the Al-Ma'ariz under the slogan "Dreams of Generations, Facts of the Future"
It is the logo of today's generations' dreams
He will be part of tomorrow's future Qatar, future Qatar
And indeed we noticed this, as we walk around with the children when the child says, "Truth, the minister is happy."
I would like you to open my project. I invite you to visit my project in twenty thirty.
The child thinks after twenty years
It expresses his love for his country and conveys what he truly loves about the field.
Definitely accompanied by various activities, competition events
Among them, the winner of the award was Star of Sciences.
And also among the first prize winners of the Arab States University
Of course, all the children

Also think about twenty-one and twenty-two
How can Isaahm the child contribute to a creative project idea for twenty-one and ten?
The main idea is that it should be in an existing slice of the sphere.

For example, if you go to a match, it means everyone is watching the game through
He movements on the field and all that changes through this electronic screen
The one that would be present in the ball
Ideas, of course, creative, of course, the main idea. Many people will be surprised, will ask us.
And these projects
We always say that we haven't reached the children yet.
At this stage, how to develop or cultivate these skills by broadening their horizons
Who gave them the idea of expressing love for their country through these projects?
Who gave them confidence in presenting their project, facing the public, and explaining their idea?
In the field of his interests, in the area of Shi, he considers this all to be a achievement an achievement for
And I offered support, which meant I appreciated and thanked him for it.
Now enter development stages and
Support from so many officials, support from the committee, and expected support from the public as well

And obviously his family to the
Well, who talks about a tourist city underwater?
Who speaks about the city of butterflies?
Who speaks of a forest above the lands?
Who talks a lot about travel ideas
It means exciting
Perhaps this is a matter of children's minds nowadays, perhaps around the 20s and 30s and 50s?
And in the future, perhaps these things will actually come true.
It means in three projects
The Scientific Club has adopted these projects. I need them now. I want to work on them.
For example, the project is about air conditioning water systems
I wonder now the Arab newspaper

We were the majority of children present at the center and we greeted them with the best wishes.
This center entered through an existing member present via this center
And we get to know her intelligence and level, naturally, through her entry into this center.
Of course the year
Irkz focuses on work and after Arman.
But this obviously discredits the actions of others and attributes them to someone else's actions always.
And among people, those who became accustomed to watching television only through Arman.
And he oversees television and the monthly religious calendar for the people through television.
Khf khaf fawa khaf fawa serials khaf fawa khalih yena7al bil as-sa2in ma a7sir
Of course
If Allah will accept us in Ramadan
But hopefully, I'll send you all my best wishes.
and if God wills
And also the plays that
Of course, from the art of drama to the art of fashion
A cultural festival was held in Doha showcasing fashion.
Definitely continuing with you all with love and sincerity
And it develops children's abilities and skills to a greater extent.
Deviate from the different schools existing in this generous land
We have a clear model; we've talked to our guests who were with us.
Now with us is Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Abdul-Salam, welcome and good morning.
How are you, Aminah?
Praise be to God
Bay saff currently
Professor Ibrahim, at the beginning, let us first get to know the subjects that are being delivered through this center.
And as an example, let us take Amineh.
We will also mention with her the method or approach that the professor mentioned about.
You feel there's a difference in his mind.
Feel that these skills and these methods
Things changed regarding his skills, intelligence, and even his educational level.
Scientific methods
From this, I started by conducting a global test called the Tony Test for children before beginning any other activity in the program.
I'm starting to work on the second part of the Tony test as well.
Benedar through which we measure the level or levels of the student's difference.
It will now start with something like a quick math test or questions.
Amenah will check and reply via WhatsApp throughout
Of course, Aminah has no knowledge at all about these questions.
We are among them regarding this issue
Of course, I had one more question to start with.
We would like to ask you about your participation in the second edition this year
What's your opinion about her?
Of course, after we presented a single series of classifications
Of course, thanks to God, God has guided me through several stages.
Dr. Ghani
The roles are distributed naturally with the director, implemented Ashraf Shakhat, and with the esteemed professor.
Of course, the opportunity from TAR Company for artistic production
The right of youth to freedom
Professor Ghany, of course the year nominated me, right?
Of course, each episode is different.
I have in that episode, I'll make characters there
On the contrary, this experience is nice, of course, in work.
Pyramid of Kuwait, Professor Saad Al-Faraj
With us Bahraini artists Abdullah Malik Ali Al-Ghareer
We have a Ali Mirza like Ali Mirza.
You guys are also a group of young people Abdullah Adham
Well, we have here from the youth Abdullah Al-Asim
This has become the year and the year, we work on two jobs this year.
Maybe this is the reason Apple asked you about your experience from the 70s and 80s
But what made you think that it would come true or that your dreams would be realized through art?
Thanks to God for everything
You are right, art is a study, and the rest is just nonsense.
He doesn't have that talent, I tell you.
I naturally have talent in the arts, the kind that shaped me from the beginning. The artist Abdulaziz Jassim, naturally.
Among artists who see me as a person like their own son.
I have something for you
Of course, all the series, we're with them
We pulled out and took our chances, and praise be to God.
Now, if it weren't for Taira, a great thanks to Professor Abulrahman Al-Saleh, a great thanks, a great thanks to Professor Abulrahman.
You're saying we're like Kuwait in Kuwait during the 1990s, when there were only ten representatives? Why?
With them
For sure, thanking you means giving opportunities.
But let's go ahead
We're talking about the serial Sani, classifications of our stories, we took the idea from it.
The deadly feeling too
And also the foot of a man
With us is a clear model, with us the lecturer Abdulaziz Al-Ma'awwi Al-Tamimi.
So that this process can be broadcast live
And let's see how a person can deal with their personality, for example, first of all, let me become like Professor Sabahi Abdullah, may God bless him.
Hello and welcome. Peace be upon you and Allah's mercy.
If we start together, teacher, would you please forgive me?
With God's permission
In the name of God, of course.
Hold on the hand
I'm losing my mind
It was a drawing or message from Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala, revealing all the parts of your body.
From inside, what are her problems?
Eike Dokuh sometimes
The head and his brother
Relax, calm your nerves, it's okay, yes.
So, Professor Abdulaziz, you'll discover a certain condition through his hand that he's suffering from a certain illness.
The left side has a simple middle ear inflammation.
In the message, dear Professor Abdulaziz, what does this mean?
Yes, you have a problem with your ear.
Who created me from being small?
Here you get the man too
The nasal sinuses
Salem, F. Al-Khosh, Ijik, headache here
I have a headache right now.
He has a problem with his nasal sinuses.
It is the cause of a headache between the eyes.
Weight gain without eating
It means that the Daraqutti has more laziness and apathy always, a heaviness in the body.
More sleeping
Oh, your body always feels heavy due to excessive sleep or laziness.
Throat inflammation always
In it, Shoufi al-Ra'esh, I noticed Ra'esh
He has stress, and of course you never walk barefoot, right?
The man from Tunisia
May God bless you, you have brought us work about his majesty and
Does this supplement also benefit children?
The pain is true. O Allah, how vast is the belly, which has grown like the child's hand.
Most of our children are not aware of this.
When Asher says he doesn't like sheep, people think he loves sheep. Actually, he has gas in his stomach. God bless you.
Just as the mother explains it, expand the index finger.
Icon of the child's hand on the belly
The child's icon hands facing each other
Let's just see, even a mother can learn this movement.
Yeb tibdi tazghat kuzha eyman easar eyman easar
This is his job with the child, about the child, about the child, about the child, how nice it is.
Well, regarding discoveries, you have specific discoveries, especially for women.
It means just as we said about every ninety homes, may Allah protect them from women.
First of all, and the first warning: equal ceramic and tile flooring
When we walk barefoot on ceramic, obviously that's our problem. But why should we always walk barefoot unless the surface is even? That's a danger.
Walk barefoot, or the evidence shows that the use of ceramic tiles in homes has increased health problems.
Lan arz barde va metsaviye
When Farsi was facing problems with asthma
Increased more
Teenagers strive to focus on walking barefoot on the heel.
Now the heel area, the heel part from the back of the foot.
From here, this heel part is below the ball of the foot.
This is the first discovery, the second discovery on the way to facilitating childbirth.
Just focus on me
in the seventh or ninth month
Just as the month of boys generally enters
It means that what they did in the eighth eighth is a danger, and the worst thing is that she walks beside it.
A pregnant woman walks barefoot.
If you enter the time of youth
I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan. Behold, He is causing the date palm to wither, and dampness from a jinn is falling upon you.
We know that Mary, peace be upon her, was provided with her sustenance by Allah.
Shawfi even reached the level of debating scholars of knowledge and they said to me, "Why has the interpretation of Ibn Kathir changed?"
Qat ana la ana a7tikum al-fikra li Allah hataha fi hādhihi al-ilm wal-hamni 3āya.
Show you the date palm trunk when you shake the date palm, of course, how did it come?
It's like the analogy I told you, it's like nails or screws
When the date palm shook, it issued orders to the wombs that had previously decreased in number here in the text.
What is the uterus giving us orders to facilitate childbirth to modify the fetus?
Fetal head growth or increase in size is a normal and expected development.
Glory be to God, this fruit has many benefits.
Hold the hand, begin and guide it
Among them are those who have adopted it as a habit, and among them are those who know that it is indeed knowledge.
So they fear, saying to you what you do not believe in them.
Yes, Professor Abdulaziz, thank God your discoveries are important.
But I wanted to know the last question, meaning the time, may Allah speed it up.
One person wants to contact you; if any person wants to contact you via a specific email, are you?
Summary: The mobile phone is located in the control room, where he communicates with Professor Abdulaziz and will call us after the program.
Of course, TV channel numbers in Qatar so we can contact you. Take this number.
I created only to serve people.
If we believe this, may God bless your work and keep people.
Repent as people do, and do everything that comes to mind of a normal person.
But we aspire for good more than
Always think of good.
Our viewers, may Allah grant them pleasure, also enjoyed this segment through reflexology and hand massage.
Waijia through foot
And we witnessed a live example on air, when the person with us discovered what the issues were present in it.
And what if we ask you for information, and someone who definitely wants to stay in touch might also find out about it through the internet.
How can it be implemented in the coming days and years, if it includes more schools?
Dawn of Light
How can you enable this experience?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
The truth is that obesity in Gulf countries has become a major problem.
We feared that Qatar would join the fifth country with them.
And this program means it is obvious that the first lady in New York
Zait visited Doha and they had a program for this
They presented it to us, and we accepted it for ourselves—no problem.
It means our students with students from New York with students from Spain with students from England
They are falling even among our brothers, our students in Qatar—how are their standards compared to those of the rest of the world, and this is something we must address in the future.
Because we encourage eating fruit, meaning among the students.
Then he stops playing sports
Of course, Friday dinner with the family.
Of course these are two birds with stones
Of course, Week Six says, "What did we learn from this experience? Today, thanks to God, we conclude."
We are happy in the student life
Know them; they were three independent boys' schools, Abu Ubaidah's.
Independent girl Rakiya
Our morale is high
It means the family, being aware of their brothers, got excited at home and started eating this food just like them.
It has become a corrupt relationship between students, and this corruption has even reached his home to his family.
They're saying that I'm going to be taught or instructed like this.
The training staff or whoever provided this information to the students
How did you choose him? How was communication with the students established through whom?
Yes, we are, and Allah will reward them with better things, meaning in terms of various aspects, we are pleased.
And we have brothers in their field at Diet Center, their expertise is in healthy eating as well.
And you learned with sister Aasah al-Tamimi the etiquette of eating.
How do they organize? How do they eat? How do they arrange things? What are their priorities?
To teach cooking, sports, or nutrition awareness for healthy eating
It was in the form of separate lessons and not curricula or programs and not
How were these ideas conveyed to the students?
In various ways, some of them took place inside the school.
We were at the beginning of the program in the Aspire Zone, where we gathered all the students, boys and girls.
Because this issue doesn't belong to a specific person; it concerns us all, as it affects our children.
Show students how their work began
That means your results were satisfactory
But will three schools or specific classes within these schools be enough?
Well, obviously, this is our first experience in the world. When we first start things, they don't immediately scale widely.
Starts off reasonably well with all traits being present: independent boys, girls, and children.
Because it doesn't align with, for example, our culture, our environment, and family conditions. For instance, families accept things for their children that they wouldn't accept.
Fibonacci actually participates in it, and it's truly important.
It means that a student at the age of twenty-eight or twenty-three years is at the right age to know about his health.
It means this hardship is that many people, and Allah is their strength, will be weak, but they imagine it's impossible.
Some of the heroes we see in movies with weak bodies, people say this means it's something supernatural.
We explained in detail, but unfortunately, we didn't realize that they would cover it for so many weeks.
We can also go through the Doha morning to remind them there.
And the fruits that contain vitamin B, meaning the ones you can get from fruits or vegetables
Man knows the benefits of fruits and knows that if he eats them, his health begins to improve, thus giving him motivation.
Here in the Fakah area, they used to go to the supermarket and choose their fruits.
For example, at that point
It means that naturally, they competed, with each school showcasing innovative ideas from its teachers.
The spirit of competition, the spirit of
We gave them the general template and each one innovates.
The teachers here who train the students, and there is no specific team available with you.
We train them, we train them
But what it means is that the teachers would add, for example, some schools like Abu 'Ubaidah said, "Saturday is the day for student activities."
For example, on a day outside school hours, they decided to establish an advanced school and said that they would take charge of the initiative.
We had a healthy cooking day with the girls, okay, we didn't make the boys take part in cooking themselves, because girls have more experience in this matter.
Of course, thanks to Al-Riyah water, which provided full water to schools free of charge. Al-Riyah water in this matter.
Of course, it means healthier water, because the body needs to be purified from all the harmful substances that enter it daily through water.
This week we said third
It means his body is now moving.
He might play football and basketball, but he doesn't know that sports are what I really love.
Correct, correct, exactly. Some of them may prefer other games, while some may prefer team games.
How on live stream
Dr. Abdulaziz Al-Jaber, founder and director of the Qatar Association of Patients with Spinal Stenosis, welcome to you.
And of course, to the extent possible, we're trying to focus on most of the important topics.
We hope that you get to know and understand what brain stiffening disease is, our dear viewers.
Because this term might also seem a bit strange to us, we prefer...
The number of affected women is greater than the number of affected men.
All the treatments currently available are preventive treatments.
The white blood cells supposed to protect us start to attack us.
They fight us with the spinal cord strike
The easiest one for the public is about an electrical cable.
Covered with a layer called the softener to remove it, a layer of nylon
Obviously, it generally leads to imbalance, duality, and foggy perception.
Leads to respiratory and digestive problems
Leads to madness in some cases, leading to quadriplegia or hemiplegia.
Of course, the treatments
The most important functions in the human body might be severely disrupted.
Or from this disease a disease named spinal cord sclerosis
Theories say that it is a viral transition.
It is a non-contagious illness.
and it does not spread to children
Some of them consider it a disease depending on the region.
But for example, the equator was completely removed from this disease.
Currently, we have cases on the equator suffering from this disease.
This disease at times has a known cause and therefore has a treatment since its cause is unknown.
Until now, scientists are not able to determine the cause of the disease in order to find a cure for it.
The current process is a reverse process.
They are trying to avoid the effect of the disease itself on the human body.
They are trying to start from the back, in other words.
And perhaps we're a bit afraid of this topic, which means we could say perhaps this illness will come suddenly.
There is a specific group that is particularly affected by this disease, meaning it spreads within a specific age range.
Ahwa was a global figure classified among twenty to forty years old.
Currently, the international organization for the same disease has lowered the age from twenty to fifteen years.
Because he killed the old herder who was forty years old
but it does not heal man
Of course, we can link up; we are open even to alternative medicine and prophetic medicine.
Yes, if it means through the Qatar link for spinal patients
What is the reason for the existence of this society?
Indeed, it's a large group, so they thought there would be a connection to this topic.
Of course, I'll give you some rough numbers.
In Kuwait, it is said that there are 100,000 infected cases.
F is injured
The remaining Gulf countries have cases ranging from hundreds to three hundred.
I was a person before six years ago
My number was sixty-four or forty-six.
Are there any symptoms that indicate a person actually has this illness?
And we can't confirm that it's a virus because we don't want to adopt a specific theory at this point.
The second point: how do I know if I'm suffering or not?
This is very difficult
I'm trying, sir Abdulaziz, through an attempt to find a specific point.
