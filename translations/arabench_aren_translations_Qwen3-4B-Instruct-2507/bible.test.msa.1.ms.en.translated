The Greatest in the Kingdom of the Heavens
At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked: "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Then Jesus called to him his children and placed him among them.
I tell you the truth: unless you return and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
From whom he has set himself like this boy, he is the Greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.
And before a son like this, by my name, he accepted me.
And if any of these young believers has found me, it would be better for him to tie a stone of the rach to his neck and drown in the depths of the sea.
Woe to the world because of its calamities! Calamities must come, but woe to the man who experiences them!
If your hand or foot is discovered to be sinful, cut it off and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter life as a cripple or with one limb than to enter the eternal fire with two hands or two legs.
And if your eyes happen to discover it, cast it out and discard it from you. It is better for you to enter life blind than to encounter fire in Hell with two eyes. Like a straying goat.
"Look, do not despise any of these little ones, for I tell you that the angels in heaven constantly look upon the face of my Father in heaven."
Because the Son of Man came to save what had perished.
What do you think? If a man has a hundred goats, and one of them strays, won't he leave the other ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the lost one?
And if he finds it, verily, I say to you: he will be more joyful about it than the ninety-nine who have not strayed.
Thus, Allah, who is in the heavens, has no intention to destroy any of these little ones. Your brother has erred against you.
"And if your brother sins against you, go and confront him privately between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have won your brother."
And if he does not hear, take with him one or two others, so that every statement may be established on the testimony of two or three.
And if you do not hear from them, say to the Church. And if you do not hear from the Church, let them be as the Gentiles and the Pagans.
Verily, I say to you: whatever you tie on earth will be tied in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
And I say to you also: If two of you agree on the earth about anything they ask for, it will be granted them from My Lord who is in the heavens.
For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them. Like the servant who does not forgive
At that time Peter approached him and said: "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother if he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus said to him: "I am not saying to you seven times, but seventy-seven times."
Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wished to assess his servants.
When the accounting began, one person came to him with a debt of ten thousand zīnāt.
And since he has nothing to fulfill his master's obligations—neither himself, nor his wife, nor his children, nor all his possessions—nor to pay his debts.
The servant was proud and prostrated himself, saying: O Lord, delay for me, so that I may fulfill your command.
He freed that slave and set him free, and left him the religion.
And when that slave went out, he found one of his slaves in debt to him for one hundred dinars, so he seized him and held him by the neck, saying: "Pay me what is due to me."
The servant honored his companion on his knees and asked him saying: "Wait for me, so that I may fulfill all your requests."
He did not respond, but went on and cast him into prison until he fulfilled his religion.
When the slaves saw their companions in such a state, they were deeply saddened. They came to their master and related to him everything that had happened.
Then his master called him and said to him: "O evil servant, I have left all this religion to you because you asked for it."
Shall I not also pity my servant, my companion, as I have pitied you?
And her anger and her sorrow reached the sufferers until she fulfilled all that was upon her.
So your Lord, the Most High, will deal with you if you do not remove from your hearts every trace of enmity towards your brother.
Marriage and Divorce
And when Jesus had finished this saying, he departed from Galilee and came to the region of Judea across the Jordan.
And a large crowd followed them, and there they healed them.
The Friscians came to him to test him, saying to him: "Is it permissible for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
And he replied and said to them: "Have you not read that He who created at the beginning created them male and female?"
He said: "For this reason a man leaves his father and mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one flesh."
If they are not two but one single body, then He who joined them together will not separate them.
They said to him: "Why did Moses command that a divorce document be given so that a wife may be divorced?"
He said to them: "Moses, due to the hardness of your hearts, was granted permission to allow you to release your wives. But this was not the case from the beginning."
I tell you: Whoever divorces his wife except for adultery and then takes another wife commits adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
His students said to him: "If a man is treated this way by a woman, then it is unacceptable for him to marry!"
He said to them: "Not all accept this teaching, but those who have been given,
For there are prophets who have been born of their mothers in this way, and there are prophets who are sent by men, and there are prophets who have set themselves apart for the kingdom of heaven. "Let anyone who can take, take." Jesus blesses the children.
At that time, his sons came to him so that he might place his hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.
But Jesus said: "Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
He placed his hands on them and left from there. The wealthy young man
And one came forward and said to him: "O righteous teacher, what kind of righteousness should I practice in order to attain eternal life?"
He said to him: "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God. But if you want to enter life, keep the commandments."
He said to him, "What are the commandments?" And Jesus replied, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
Honor your father and mother, and love your near relative as yourself.
The young man said to him: "I have preserved all of this since my youth. What do I still lack?"
Jesus said to him, "If you want to be complete, go, sell your possessions, give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
So when the young man heard the word, he went away sad, because he was a man of great wealth.
Jesus said to his disciples: "Truly I tell you, it is difficult for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven!"
And I tell you plainly: It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God!
When his disciples heard this, they separated and said: "Who then can be saved?"
Then Jesus looked at them and said to them: "This is impossible for men, but with God all things are possible."
And at that time Peter answered and said to him: "We have left everything to follow you. What then shall we have?"
Then Jesus said to them: "Truly I tell you, you who have followed me will be given a place in the renewal. When the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
And whoever gives up a house or brother or sister or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my sake, will receive a hundredfold and inherit eternal life.
But many who were first become last, and many who were last become first.
Like the action in generosity
For the kingdom of heaven is like a man of noble character who, at dawn, goes out to hire workers for his vineyard.
Then agree with the party on a dinar per day, and send them to Karamah.
Then he went towards the third hour and saw others standing in the market, weary.
He said to them: "Go too to Al-Karm, and they will give you what is due to you." So they departed.
He also left around the sixth and ninth hours and did the same.
Then, at about twelve o'clock, he went out and found others standing there praying, and he said to them: "Why have you been standing here all day long in prayer?"
They said to him: "No one has hired us." He said to them: "Go too to Al-Karm and take what is due to you."
At evening, the generous man said to his agent: "Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last and ending with the first."
The owners of the eleventh hour came and took a dinar at a time.
When the first group came, they thought they would take more. So they took one dinar at a time as well.
And while they are complaining against the Lord of the house
They said: "These others worked for one hour, while we, who bore the weight of the entire day and the heat, have been treated equally!"
So he replied and said to one of them: "O owner, have you wronged me? Didn't we agree upon a dinar?"
The one that is yours, take it and go; I want to give this last one to you as well.
Or is it that I am deprived of doing what I wish because of what I have? Or is your eye evil because I am righteous?
Thus the latter will be first, and the first will be last, because many will call and few will be chosen." Jesus announces His death and resurrection
And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside on the way and said to them:
"Behold, we are ascending to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the rulers, the scribes, and the elders, who will condemn him to death."
And they deliver him over to the nations, so that they may mock him, flog him, and crucify him; and on the third day he will rise again." The request of Am, son of Zabdi.
At that time, the mother of Zabdi's sons came forward with her sons, prostrated herself, and asked him for something.
He said to her: "What do you want?" She replied: "Say to him that my two sons shall sit, one on your right and the other on your left, in his kingdom."
Then Jesus answered and said to them, "Do you truly understand what you are asking? Can you drink the cup that I am to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am to be baptized with?" They said to him, "We can."
He said to them: "As for my cup, you will drink from it, and you will anoint yourselves with the dye with which I have anointed myself. As for sitting on my right and on my left, I will not give them to anyone except those whom my father has prepared for them."
When the ten heard, they were envious of the two brothers.
Then Jesus called them and said: "You know that the rulers of the nations dominate them, and the powerful rule over them.
Nor will it be so among you. But whoever desires to be great among you, let him be your servant.
And whoever wishes to be first among you, let him be your servant.
As Jesus said, "The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." Healing of the blind in Jericho
And as they were leaving Acre, a large crowd followed them.
And if blind men were sitting by the road, when they heard Jesus passing by, they cried out, saying: "Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!"
The crowd rebuked them so they would not silence, and they shouted even more, saying: "Have mercy upon us, O Lord, O son of David!"
Then Jesus stood up and called them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
They said to him: "O Lord, open our eyes!"
Jesus opened their eyes, and immediately they saw and followed him.
Entering Jerusalem
And as they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples:
Saying to them: "Go to the village in front of you; you will find there a woman bound and a donkey with her. Unbind her and bring them to me."
And if anyone tells you both something, say: "The Lord needs them." And He will send them at the appropriate time.
All of this was to fulfill what the Prophet said:
Say to the daughter of Sheba: "Behold, your king comes to you in peace, riding on a donkey and on a colt, the offspring of a donkey."
Then the two disciples went and did exactly as Jesus had instructed them.
And they brought the two camels and the wild ass, and placed their garments upon them, and sat upon them.
And the majority of them spread out their garments on the road. Others cut a branch from a tree and spread it on the road.
And the ones who came before and those who followed were shouting, saying: "We have warned son of David! Blessed is the one coming in the name of the Lord! We have warned in the upper places!"
And when He entered Jerusalem, the whole city was agitated, saying: "Who is this?"
The crowd said, "This is Jesus, the Prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." The purification of the Temple
And Jesus went into the temple of God and drove out all those who were buying and selling in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.
He said to them: "It is written: 'My house is a house of prayer, and you have turned it into a den of thieves!'"
And my uncle and my cousin went to the Temple, and they were healed.
When the priests and the scribes saw the wonders that he had done, and the children crying in the temple and saying, "Hear us, son of David!" they were angry.
They said to him, "Do you hear what they are saying?" Jesus replied to them, "Yes! Didn't you read before: 'From the lips of infants and nursing babies, praise is born'?"
Then he left them and went outside the city to the house of Cain, and stayed there. The date palm withers.
And in the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry.
The fig tree looked upon the path, and someone came to it and found nothing but leaves. It said to it: "You will never bear fruit forever!" And the fig tree withered in despair.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and said: "How can the grain be dried under these circumstances?"
Then Jesus answered them and said: "Truly I tell you, if you had faith and did not doubt, you would not only do the act of the two, but if you said to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' it would happen."
And whatever you ask for in prayer as believers, you will receive. The question about Jesus' authority
And when he came to the Temple, the high priests and elders of the people approached him, saying to him, "By what authority are you doing this? And who gave you this authority?"
Then Jesus replied and said to them: "I will also ask you one thing. If you tell me about it, I will tell you by what authority I do this:"
John's baptism: From where was it? From heaven or from men? So they thought among themselves and said: "If we say it came from heaven, then why did you not believe it?"
And if we say: "From among men, we fear the people, because John is like a prophet among all."
And they answered Jesus and said: "We do not know." Then He said to them also: "Nor do I tell you by what authority I do this. It is like the two sons..."
"What do you think? A man had two sons. He came to the first and said: 'My son, go today and work in my vineyard.'"
And he replied, "I don't want to." But eventually he regretted it and went away.
It came to the second, and he said the same. So he replied, "Here I am, O Lord." And it had not passed.
And what day did the father's will do? They said to him, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the ten virgins and the five wise women will precede you into the kingdom of God."
For John came to you in the way of truth, and you did not believe in him; but the ten thousand and the multitudes believed in him. And when you saw it, you did not finally repent to believe in him. It is like the sycamores.
Listen to another example: A man owned a house and planted a garden around it, surrounded it with a fence, dug a cistern, built a tower, and entrusted it to caretakers before traveling away.
And when the time of harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the rich men to take his harvest.
So the Karamun took his servants, flogged some, killed some, and threw some into the fire.
Then he also sent other servants, more than the first ones, and treated them in the same way.
And finally he sent his son to them saying: "They fear my son!"
As for the Karamun, when they saw the son, they said among themselves: "This is the heir! Come, let us kill him and take his inheritance!"
So they took him, expelled him from the kindness, and killed him.
When the Lord of Kindness comes, what will He do to those who are kind?
They said to him: "Those who are arrogant will be destroyed by a humiliating downfall, and dignity will be passed on to others who will give it at the proper time."
Jesus said to them, "Did you not read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone'? This is from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes!"
Therefore I tell you: the kingdom of God will take from you and give to a people who produce its fruits.
Whoever falls on this stone will be crushed, and whoever falls on him will crush him!
And when the leaders of the scribes and the Pharisees heard him speak thus, they understood that he was speaking against them.
And when they sought to seize him, they feared the crowd, for he was like a prophet among them.
Like the wedding of the king's son
And Jesus also spoke to them in parables, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who hosted a wedding for his son,
And he sent his servants to invite the invited ones to the wedding, but they would not come.
He also sent other servants saying: "Say to the invited guests: 'Here is my prepared meal. My sheep and my goats have been sacrificed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding!' "
But they became negligent and went on, one to his field, and another to his trade.
And those who remained seized their slaves, insulted them, and killed them.
When the king heard this, he was angry, sent his soldiers, killed those fighters, and burned their city.
Then he said to his servants: "The wedding is ready, but the invited guests are not worthy."
Go to the roadsides, and whenever you find anyone, call him to the wedding.
Those slaves went out onto the streets and gathered all those they found wicked and righteous. The wedding was filled with recliners.
When the king entered to look at the reclining ones, he saw a man who was not wearing the wedding garments.
He said to him: "O master, how did you enter here without wedding garments?" And he remained silent.
At that time the king said to the servants: "Bind his hands and feet, take him and cast him into the outer darkness. There the weeping and gnashing of teeth will be."
Because many call out and few elect. Paying the jizya to Caesar
At that time, the Frisians went and consulted among themselves how to catch him with a word.
So they sent to him some of their disciples along with Herodians, saying: "Teacher, we know that you are honest and that you teach the way of God with truth, and you do not care about anyone, because you do not look at people's faces."
Say to us: What do you think? Is it permissible to pay tribute to Caesar or not?
Jesus knew their hearts and said: "Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?"
Tell me about the jizya tax. So they presented him with a dinar.
He said to them: "Whose image and inscription is this?"
They said to him: "To Caesar." He replied to them: "Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God."
When they heard this, they were amazed, left it, and went away. The question of the resurrection of the dead
On that day, some of the Sadiqun came to him, saying, "There will be no resurrection," and they asked him:
They said: "O teacher, Moses said: 'If a man dies without children, his brother shall marry his wife and bear offspring for him.'"
We had seven brothers; the first one married and died without children, and thus left his wife to his brother.
And the second, and the third, until the seventh.
And finally, the woman also died.
At the Resurrection, who among the Seven will have a wife? For she will be for all of them!"
And Jesus answered them and said: "You are mistaken, for you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God."
For they will neither marry nor be married on the Day of Resurrection, but they will be like the angels of God in the heavens.
As for the resurrection of the dead, have you not heard what Allah, the One who said:
Am I God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob? Certainly not. The Lord is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
And when the multitudes heard about his teaching, the great commandment.
As for the Friscians, when they heard that the Sadoqis had gathered together,
And one of them, Namusy, asked him to try it, saying:
"O teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the Law?"
Then Jesus said to him, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind."
This is the first and greatest commandment.
And the second is similar to it: you love your near relative as yourself.
The two commandments concern the entire Law and the Prophets. Christ and David
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them:
Saying to them: "What do you think about Jesus? Who is His son?" They said to him: "The son of David."
He said to them: "How could David call him 'my Lord' by the Spirit, saying:"
He said to His Lord: "Sit at My right hand until I place your enemies as a footing beneath your feet."
If David called him Lord, how could he be his son?"
No one could answer him with a word. And since then, no one has dared to ask him even a single question.
Warning against bookkeepers and friars
Then Jesus addressed the crowd and his disciples.
saying: "The scribes and Pharisees sat on Moses' seat,"
Whatever they tell you to keep and do, keep and do it, but do not act upon their deeds, for they speak but do not act.
And they bear heavy burdens, causing hardship in carrying them, and place them upon the shoulders of people, while they themselves do not wish to move them with their fingertips.
And all their actions are performed so that people may see them: they display their hardships and magnify the adornments of their garments.
They love the first seat in the rows, and the first benches in the mosques,
And greetings in the markets, and people calling them: Master, Master!
And as for you, do not say "Master," for your teacher is one Christ, and you are all brothers.
Do not say to them, "Our father on earth," for your father is one who is in the heavens.
Do not call teachers, for your teacher is one Christ.
The greatest among you shall be your servant.
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted. Woe to the scribes and the Pharisees.
"But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you close the kingdom of heaven before men; neither do you enter yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to enter."
And behold, O you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you eat the houses of the widows, and yet prolong your prayers. Therefore you will receive the greatest condemnation.
And indeed, O you who write and the hypocrites! For you sail the sea and land in order to gain a single profit; but when it comes to you, you will build for Hell more than you, multiplied.
O you blind leaders! Those who say: "One who swears by the Temple is nothing, but one who swears by the Temple's gold is bound."
O the ignorant and the blind! Which is greater: gold, or the sanctuary that sanctifies gold?
And whoever swears by the altar is not binding, but whoever swears by the sacrifice upon which he is bound is binding.
O the ignorant and the blind! Which is greater: the sacrifice or the altar that sanctifies the sacrifice?
He who swears by the altar has sworn by it and by everything upon it!
And whoever swears by the House has sworn by those who dwell therein.
And whoever swears by the heavens has sworn by Allah's throne and by the One who sits upon it.
And you, O scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you keep the commandments of the scribes and the Pharisees, but you discard the heavier commandments: justice, mercy, and faith. You should have done these, and not left those.
O blind leaders! Who describe the mosquito and drink from camels.
And behold, O you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of theft and greed.
O blind Frezzi! Purify first the cup and the page so that their outside may also be pure.
And behold, O you scribes and Pharisees who polish yourselves! For you are like white tombs appearing outside beautiful, yet filled within with the bones of the dead and all filth.
Thus you are also: you appear to people as righteous, but within yourselves you are filled with vanity and sin.
And behold, O you scribes and Pharisees who polish your outer garments! For you build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the friends.
And you say: "If we had been in the days of our ancestors, we would not have participated in the blood of the prophets."
And you bear witness against yourselves that you are the offspring of those who killed the prophets.
So fill them with the measures of your fathers.
O you children of serpents! How do you escape the punishment of Hell?
Therefore, I have sent to you prophets and wise men and scriptures; from among them you kill and crucify, and you flog in your prisons, and you expel from city to city.
So that every drop of pure blood shed on earth—from the blood of Habil, the friend, to the blood of Zakaria, son of Berakhia, whom you killed between the Temple and the Altar—may come upon you.
Verily, I tell you: all of this will come to pass in this generation! Jesus laments over Jerusalem
"O Jerusalem, O Jerusalem! You who killed the prophets and stoned those sent to you—how many times did I long to gather your children, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you would not!"
Behold, your house leaves you with ruin.
For I tell you, you will not see me until you say: "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!"
Signs of the End of Times
Then Jesus went out and left the temple. His disciples approached to see the temple buildings.
Then Jesus said to them, "Look at all these things! Truly I tell you, not one stone will be left here upon another that will not be thrown down!"
And while He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately and said: "Tell us, when will this happen? And what are the signs of your coming and the end of the age?"
And Jesus answered them and said: "Look! None will deceive you."
Many will come to me saying: "I am the Messiah!" and they will mislead many.
And you will hear of wars and news of wars. Look, do not be alarmed. For surely all these things must come to pass, but the end has not yet come.
For a nation stands upon a nation and a kingdom upon a kingdom, and famines, plagues, and earthquakes will occur in various places.
But all of this is just the beginning of the pain.
At that time they will deliver you over to hardship and kill you, and you will be hated by all peoples for my sake.
And at that time many will stumble, embracing one another and hating one another.
False prophets abound and mislead many.
But because of the great sin, the love of many cools down.
But he who perseveres until the end—this one will be saved.
And this kingdom proclamation will be a witness to all nations. Then comes the end.
When you look at "The Ruin," which the Prophet Daniel mentioned, standing in the Holy Place—so that the reader may understand—
Then the Jews went into the mountains.
And the one on the surface does not come down to take anything from his house,
And what is in the field will not return to it to take its garments.
And a warning for the weak and the nursing mothers on those days!
Come, so that you may not flee in winter or in summer.
For it would then be an immense narrowness, unlike any that has existed since the beginning of the world and will never exist again.
If those days had not been shortened, the body would not have been purified. But those days are shortened for the chosen ones.
At that time, if anyone should say to you: "This is Jesus here!" or "There!" do not believe them.
For indeed false messiahs and false prophets will appear, and they will give great signs and wonders, so as to deceive even the elect, if possible.
Well, I already told you.
If they say to you: "He is in the wilderness!" Do not go out. "He is in the deception!" Do not believe it.
For just as lightning emerges from the east and appears in the west, so too does the coming of the son of man occur.
For wherever the body is, there the ravens gather.
And in those days, when time has passed, the sun will grow dark, the moon will not give light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will tremble.
And at that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. And at that time, all tribes of the earth will turn away, and they will see the Son of Man coming upon the clouds of the sky with great power and glory.
His angels send out a mighty trumpet call, gathering his chosen ones from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.
From the date palm, we learned a lesson: when its branches become loose and it unfolds its leaves, you know that summer is near.
So it is with you too; when you see all this, know that it is near at hand.
Verily, I say to you: this age will not pass away until all of this comes to pass.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. Constant preparation
And as for this day and this hour, no one knows them, neither the angels of heaven, except my father alone.
As were the days of Noah, so will also come the sons of man.
For just as they did in the days before the flood, eating, drinking, marrying and being married, until the day Noah entered the ark,
And they did not know until the flood came and took them all; likewise, the coming of the children of man will also occur.
At that time, the two are in the field; one is taken and the other left.
Two grind on the ridge; one is taken, the other is left.
Wake up, for you do not know at what hour your Lord will come.
And know this: if the Lord of the house knew in which house the thief would come, he would stay awake and would not let his house be ransacked.
Therefore, also be prepared, for at a time you do not expect, the son of man will come. Like a faithful servant.
Who is the trustworthy, wise servant whom his master placed in charge of his servants to give them their food at the proper time?
O how blessed is that servant who, when his master comes, finds him doing thus!
Verily, I tell you: he will spend it on all his wealth.
But if that servant, in his heart, said: "My Lord, He is delaying His coming."
Then the slaves begin to drink with the drunkard, eating and drinking with him.
That slave will come on a day he does not expect and at a moment he does not know.
He will cut it and divide his share among the women. There, there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.
Like the ten virgins
At that time, the kingdom of heaven resembles ten virgins, who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
And five of them were wise, and five were ignorant.
As for the ignorant people, they took their lamps but did not bring with them any oil.
As for the wise women, they took oil in their vessels along with their lamps.
And as the groom moved slowly, we all relaxed and enjoyed.
At half the night, there was a cry: "Here comes the bridegroom, coming! Let us go meet him!"
All those young girls raised their lamps and purified them.
The ignorant said to the wise: Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.
Then the wise women replied: "Perhaps it is not enough for us. But go instead to the merchants and buy it."
While they were going out to buy, the groom came, and the preparations entered with him to the wedding, and they closed the door.
Finally, the remaining virgins also came and said: Our Lord, our Lord, open for us!
So he replied and said: "Indeed, I say this, but: I don't know you."
Be alert, for you do not know either the day or the hour when the son of man will come. Like the weights.
As if a traveling man had called his servants and entrusted them with his wealth,
So one received five measures, another two measures, and another one measure. Each according to his ability. And they set out at that time.
Then the one who took the fifth and traded with it, gained another five measures.
And he who took the two scales also won two other scales.
And he who took the scale went away and dug in the earth, hiding his master's silver.
After a long time, the masters of those slaves came and examined them.
Then came the one who had taken the five measures and brought five more, saying: "O master, I have delivered five measures. Here are five more that I have gained over them."
Then his master said to him: "Well, O faithful and trustworthy servant! You were trustworthy with a little, so we will place you in charge of much. Go into the joy of your master."
Then came the one who took the two scales and said: "O Lord, I have delivered the two scales. Here are two more scales that I have gained over them."
His mistress said to him: "Well, O faithful and trustworthy servant! You were trustworthy in a little, so now I place you in charge of much. Enter into the joy of your master."
Then came also the one who took the single measure and said: "O Lord, I know that you are a strict judge, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered."
I feared and fled, and concealed your weight on earth. Here is what is yours.
So his master replied to him and said: "You wicked and lazy servant, you know that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered."
It should have been that you placed my share at the scales; when I came, I took what was due to me along with interest.
Take from it the measure and give it to him who has the tenth share and its measure.
Because whoever has will be given more, and whoever has nothing will lose what he has.
And the valiant servant cast him into the external darkness, there weeping and gnashing teeth. The rhinoceros and the bull.
And when the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on his throne.
And all peoples will gather before him, distinguishing one from another as a shepherd distinguishes sheep from goats.
The ox is placed on his right and the bull on his left.
Then the king says to those on his right: "Come, blessed ones of my father, mourn the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world."
For I was hungry and you fed me; I was thirsty and you gave me drink; I was a stranger and you took me in.
Naked, I was brought in. Sick, I was brought in. Imprisoned, I was brought here.
The pious will reply at that time saying: "O Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and quench Your thirst?"
And when you see you are strange, do you welcome me, or when you see me naked, do you cover me?
And when you saw us sick or imprisoned, why did you not come to us?
The king replies and says to them: "Verily, I tell you this: since you have done this to one of my brothers, you have done it to me."
Then He also says to those on the left: "Go away, O devils, to the eternal fire prepared for Iblis and his angels,"
For I am hungry and you have not fed me. I am thirsty and you have not given me drink.
I was strange, and you did not take me in. Naked, and you did not cover me. Sick and imprisoned, and you did not visit me.
At that time they will also reply, "O Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or stranger or naked or sick or imprisoned, and yet not served You?"
They reply, "Indeed, I tell you: if you did not do this to any of these little ones, neither have I done it."
These will go to eternal punishment, and the pious to eternal life.
The plot to kill Jesus
And when Jesus had finished saying all these things, He said to His disciples:
"Learn that after two days the Fasch will come, and the son of man will hand over to be crucified."
At that time, the heads of the priests and scribes and the elders of the people gathered at the house of the head priest, whose name was Qeifa.
And they consulted together to seize Jesus by treachery and kill him.
But they said: "There is no festival so that there may be no commotion among the people." Ananias poured oil on Jesus
And Jesus was in the house of Caiaphas in the house of Simon the Leper,
A woman approached him with a costly bottle, and poured its contents over his head while he was reclining.
When his disciples saw this, they were indignant and said: "Why is this destruction happening?"
Because this charity could have been sold and given to the poor.
And Jesus said to them, "Why do you disturb this woman? For she has done a good deed to me!"
For the poor are with you at all times, but as for me, I am not with you at all times.
And when she poured this kindness upon my body, she did so only to comfort me.
Verily, I say to you: wherever this Gospel is preached throughout the world, it will also proclaim what I have done, as a reminder of it. Judas' betrayal
At that time one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the priests
He said, "What do you want me to give you and you give me?" So they gave him thirty dirhams.
At that time, he was seeking an opportunity to deliver it. Dinner with the students
At the beginning of the feast, the disciples approached Jesus and said to him: "Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
He said: "Go to the city, to so-and-so, and say to him: 'The teacher says: My time is near. You will make the farsi with my students.'"
The disciples did what Jesus had commanded them and prepared the leaven.
And when the evening came, you lay down with the twelve.
And as they were eating, he said: "Verily, I say to you, one of you will deny me."
They were very sad, and each of them began to say to himself: "Am I He, O Lord?"
Then he replied, "The one who dips his hand with me in the scroll is the one who will accept me!"
The son of man is coming as it is written about him; but woe to that man who will be saved through the son of man! It would have been better for him if he had never been born!»
Then Judah answered his plea and said, "Are you referring to me, sir?" He replied, "You said that." The Lord's Supper
While they were eating, Jesus took the bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying: "Take and eat; this is my body."
And he took the cup, thanked them, and said to them: "Drink from it, all of you,"
For this is my blood, which according to the new covenant is shed for many to forgive sins.
And I say to you: From now on I will not drink of the fruit of this vine until that day when I drink with you in my Father's kingdom.
Then they prayed and went out to Mount Zayton. Jesus foretells Peter's denial of him.
At that time Jesus said to them: "All of you will betray me this night, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'"
But after I had gone ahead of you to Galilee.
And Peter replied to him, "If all of you doubt in me, I never doubt at all."
Jesus said to him, "Truly I tell you, you will deny me three times this night before the rooster crows."
Peter said to him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you!" So also said all the disciples. On the Mount of Olives
At that time Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, "Sit here while I go and pray there."
Then he took with him Peter and his sons Zebedee, and began to grieve and sorrow.
He said to them: "My soul is very sorrowful even unto death. Stay here with me and keep watch."
Then he stepped forward a little and leaned on his face, praying: "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he came to his disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "Surely you have not stayed awake with me for one hour?"
Be alert and pray so that you may not enter into trial. The spirit is active, but the body is weak.
He also passed a second time and prayed, saying: "O my father, if I cannot pass this cup without drinking it, then let your will be done."
Then he came and found them also asleep, their eyes heavy.
And he left them and went on, praying the third one, saying that very words.
Then he went to his disciples and said to them: "Sleep now and rest! Lo, the hour has drawn near, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners."
Get up, let's go! Here comes the one who has delivered me! The arrest of Jesus
And as he is speaking, Judah, one of the twelve, comes forward with a large group of men, carrying swords and staffs from the leaders of the priests and the elders of the people.
And he who delivered them gave them a sign saying: "The one who approaches is he. Take hold of him."
And at that time he approached Jesus and said: "Peace be with you!" And before him.
Jesus said to him, "Master, why have you come?" At that moment they came forward, laid their hands on Jesus, and took hold of him.
And if one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, only his ear was cut off.
Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place, for all who take a sword will die by it!"
Do you think I cannot now ask my father to send me more than twelve armies of angels?
How then can the books complete themselves: that they should be like this?
At that hour Jesus said to the crowd: "Are you coming out with swords and clubs to take me? Every day I have been sitting with you in the temple, and you have not laid a hand on me."
And all of this was for you to complete the books of the prophets." At that time, all the disciples left and fled. Before the Jewish council
And those who had taken Jesus led him away to Qumran, the high priest's residence, where the scribes and elders were gathered.
And Peter followed him from a distance to the house of the high priest, entered inside, and sat among the servants to watch the end.
The priests, the elders, and the whole council were seeking false testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death.
They found none. Although many false witnesses came, they found none. But eventually, a false witness appeared.
They said: "This man said: 'I can destroy God's structure, and in three days I will rebuild it.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to him, "Do you not respond at all? What testimony do these two bear against you?"
And Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to him, "I swear to you by God the living: Are you the Messiah, the Son of God?"
Jesus said to him, "You said that! And I tell you now: from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, coming in the clouds of heaven."
At that time, the high priest tore his garments and said: "Have they gone mad! What do we need with witnesses anymore? Have you not heard him blaspheme!"
What do you think? They replied: "It is ordained to die."
At that time, they spat upon him and struck him, while others beat him gently.
Saying: "Inform us, O Jesus, of the one who will strike you." Peter's denial
And Peter was sitting outside the house, when a servant came to him and said: "You were with Jesus of Galilee!"
Then he denied in front of everyone, saying: "I don't know what you are saying!"
Then when he appeared again in the courtyard, she said to those present: "This was with Jesus the Nazarene!"
And he also denied, by my oath: "I do not know this man!"
And shortly afterwards came the questioning, and they said to Peter: "Indeed, you are also one of them, for your speech reveals you!"
At that moment he began to curse and swear: "I don't know the man!" The dice then rolled.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times." So he went outside and wept bitterly.
Judah hangs himself
And as morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people gathered together to plot how they might kill Jesus.
So they buried him and left him, delivering him to Pilate the governor.
At that time, when Judah saw that he had been delivered over, he repented and went back to the priests and the elders on the thirtieth day of the silver month.
Saying: "I may have erred in delivering innocent blood." They replied: "What is our responsibility? You are the one who sees clearly!"
He placed the silver in the temple and withdrew, then went away and hanged himself.
Then the chief priests took the silver and said: "We cannot put it into the treasury, for it is the price of blood."
Consult and buy from al-Fakhri the field, a cemetery for strangers.
For this reason this field is called "the Field of Blood" until this day.
At that time, what was said about Jeremiah, the prophet, who said: "They took thirty shekels of silver, the price of the ransom they paid from the children of Israel,"
And give them from the field of al-Fakari, as God commanded me." Before Pilate
Then Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus replied, "You say that."
While the priests' heads and elders complained about it, they took no action.
Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many testify against you?"
He said nothing nor uttered a single word, until the governor was very pleased.
And the governor used to release one slave for the crowd on Eid, whom they wished.
At that time they had a famous prisoner named Barabas.
While they were gathered together, Pilate said to them: "Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas or Jesus, whom you call the Messiah?"
Because he knew they delivered him over out of envy.
And as he was sitting on the throne, his wife sent to him and said: "O noble one, I have suffered greatly today due to a dream I had."
But the chief priests and the elders incited the crowd to demand Barabas and to have Jesus crucified.
Then the governor replied to them: "Which of the two do you want me to set free?" They said: "Barabas!"
Pilate asked them, "What shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ?" They all said, "Crucify him!"
The governor said: "What evil deed has been committed?" And they increased their shouting, saying: "Let them be crucified!"
When Pilate saw that it was of no use, but rather that unrest would ensue, he took some water, washed his hands before the crowd, and said: "I am innocent of the blood of this man! See to it, you!"
So the entire people replied, "His blood is on us and on our children."
At that time, Barabbas was released, and Jesus was flogged and handed over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked him.
Then the governor's army took Jesus to the governor's house and gathered all the troops together.
He dressed him and put on him a crimson robe.
They placed a garland of thorns on his head and a staff in his right hand. They prostrated themselves before him and mocked him, saying: "Peace, O King of the Jews!"
They spat upon him, took the city, and struck him on the head.
And after mocking him, they took off his robe and put on his clothes, and led him to crucifixion. Crucifixion
While they were outside, they found a man named Simon, and they sent him to carry his cross.
And when they arrived at a place called Jaljalah, which is known as "the place of the jawbone"
Gave him a mixture of wine mixed with bitterness to drink. And when he tasted it, he refused to drink it.
And when they crucified him, they divided his garments by casting lots, in order to fulfill what was said about the Prophet: "Divide my garments among them, and cast lots for my robe."
Then they sat down to guard him there.
And they put a crown of thorns on his head, writing upon it: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
At that time, he placed with him a scribe, one from the right and one from the left.
And those who passed by were swimming on it, shaking their heads.
Saying: "O one who destroyed the temple and built it in three days, prove yourself! If you are the Son of God, descend from the cross!"
Similarly, the priests too, who mock the scribes and the elders, said:
Others have already finished, but as for himself, how can he possibly finish it! If he is the king of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him!
He claimed to be the son of God; let him be saved now if he wishes! For he said: "I am the son of God!"
And thus also the two angels, who were firm with him, inflicted upon him. Death
From the sixth hour darkness was upon the whole earth until the ninth hour.
About nine o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
Some of those standing there, when they heard it, said: "It is Elijah calling."
For the time, one of them ran, took a sponge, filled it with water, placed it on a stool, and poured water over it.
As for the remaining ones, they said: "Leave it. Let us see whether Elijah will come and deliver him!"
And Jesus also cried out in a loud voice, and yielded the spirit.
And the heavenly veil had split into two, from top to bottom. The earth trembled, and the rocks cracked.
And the veil was torn, and many of the bodies of the saints who were lying down rose up.
And they emerged from the tomb after its rising, entered the Holy City, and appeared to many.
As for the leader of the hundred and those with him who were guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and what had happened, they were terrified and said: "Truly this is the Son of God!"
There were many women who watched from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee and had served him.
Between them is Mary of Nain, Mary mother of Jacob and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons. The burial.
And as it was evening, a rich man from Ramah named Joseph came, who was also a disciple of Jesus.
And this man went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Then Pilate ordered that the body be given.
Then Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean cloth,
And he placed it in his new tomb, which he had carved out of the rock, then rolled a large stone over the tomb's entrance and left.
And Mary of Magdala and Mary the other sat beside the tomb. The guards at the tomb
And at the time following the preparation, the high priests and the Pharisees met with Pilate.
They said: "O Lord, remind us of that deceiver who said while he was alive: 'I will rise again after three days.'"
And he passed by the tomb, checking it every day for three days, so that his disciples would not come at night and carry him away, and say to the people: "He rose from the dead," and thus the final error would be worse than the first!
Pilate said to them, "You have guards. Go and take them as you know how."
So they proceeded and secured the grave with guards and sealed the stone.
The Resurrection
And on the first day of the week, after the Sabbath, Mary of Magdala and Mary the other came to see the tomb.
And if a great earthquake occurred, because the angels of God descended from heaven, came, and pushed the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing was white as snow.
So, out of fear, the guards became still and were like the dead.
Then the angel replied and said to the two women: "Do not fear, for I know that you are looking for Jesus the crucified."
It is not so here, for He has done as He said! Look at the place where Allah was prostrating.
And go quickly, saying to your disciples: "Indeed, He has risen from the dead. Look, He is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I have told you."
They quickly exited the tomb, filled with great fear and joy, running to inform their disciples.
And as they were going out to tell their disciples, Jesus met them and said to them, "Peace be with you." They came forward, took hold of his feet, and bowed down to him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." The guards' words
And as they were going, a group of guards came to the city and informed the priests' leaders of everything that had happened.
They gathered with the elders, consulted together, and gave the army a great amount of silver.
They said: "Say that their students came to us at night and stole it, while we were asleep."
And if the Governor hears this, we will appeal to him, and make you reassured.
So they took the silver and did what they had been taught; this saying has spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus appears to his disciples
As for the eleven disciples, they set out to the Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had directed them.
And when they saw him, they prostrated themselves to him, but some of them complained.
Then Jesus and they said: "Give to us all power in heaven and on earth,"
Go then, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
And teach them to preserve all that I have instructed you to preserve. And behold, I am with you all the days until the end of the age. Amen.
John the Baptist prepares the way
The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
As it is written in the Prophets: "Behold, I send before you My angel, who will prepare your way before you."
A loud voice in the wilderness: "Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths straight."
John was preaching in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem came out to him and trusted in him at the River Jordan, acknowledging their sins.
John was dressed in camel hair garments, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
And he would protest, saying: "After me will come one stronger than I, to whom I shall not be able to bow down or unroll the straps of his sandals."
I will send you water, but what he will send you is the Holy Spirit." Baptism of Jesus Christ and his experience
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And at that time, rising from the water, he saw the heavens have parted, and the spirit like a duck descending upon it.
A voice from the heavens said: "You are my beloved son, in whom I have rejoiced."
And at that time He expelled the spirit into the wilderness,
There were forty days in the wilderness where Satan tested them. Beasts were with him, and the angels served him. The call of the first disciples
And after John was imprisoned, Jesus came to Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God.
He says: "The time has fulfilled and the kingdom of God is near; turn to God and believe in the Gospel."
And as he was walking by the sea of Galilee, Simon and Andrew his brother saw them casting a net into the sea, and they were fishermen.
Then Jesus said to them, "Come and follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
They left their windows open and followed him.
Then he passed a little further and saw Jacob son of Zabdi and John, his brother, on the boat repairing the nets.
Call them to the time. So they left their father Zabdi in the ship with the wages and went after him. The impure spirit was cast out.
Then they entered Kfar Nahum, and at that time the congregation entered on Saturday and became known.
For he taught them as one having authority, not as the scribes.
And among them there was a man with an unclean spirit, who cried out
Saying, "Ah! What have we here, you, Jesus of Nazareth? You have come to destroy us! I know who you are: the Holy One of God!"
Jesus rebuked him and said, "Get out! And go from me!"
The impure spirit seized him and cried out with a loud voice, then came out of him.
Awaken them all; some asked others, saying: "What is this? What is this new teaching? For it has power that commands even unclean spirits to obey it!"
He sent news to the surrounding areas of Galilee. Healing of Shmuel Hama'ata and others
And when they had left the assembly, they went to the house of Simon and Andrew, with Jacob and John,
Hama was smitten and devastated, so at that time they informed him about it.
She advanced and placed it in Maska's hand; thus, she left the fever behind and began to serve them.
And when evening came, as the sun set, they all brought to him the sick and the blind.
The whole city was gathered at the door.
Many were healed of various diseases, and many demons were cast out; the demons no longer spoke because they knew him. The preaching in Galilee
Early in the morning he got up, went out, and proceeded to a place of prayer.
Then Samson and the men with him followed.
And when they found him, they said to him: "The whole crowd is looking for you."
He said to them: "Let us go to the neighboring villages to gather there too, for that is why I left."
And he disputed in the synagogues throughout Galilee, and cast out demons. Healing of the blind man
Then Abras came to him, seeking Jathia and saying to him: "If you wish, you can make me pure."
Jesus opened his hands and touched him, saying to him, "I desire, be healed!"
And at that time, when he was speaking, the fever left him and he was healed.
Frightened him and sent him to the time.
He said to him: "Look, do not say a word to anyone, but go alone to the priest and present to him what Moses commanded regarding your purification, a testimony for them."
As for him, he went out and began to call loudly and spread the news until he could no longer enter the city openly, but was instead outside in secluded places, and people came to him from all directions.
Healing the disabled
Then after a few days, Kfar Nahum also entered, and he heard that he was in the house.
And at that time, many gathered until there was no room neither inside nor outside the door. So he would address them with words.
They came to him, preceded by a disheveled man carried by four.
And since they could not approach him for the gathering, they uncovered the ceiling where he was. After they had searched, they revealed the bed on which the injured one was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
There were some of the Bookkeepers there sitting, thinking within their hearts:
"Why does he speak like this with exaggerations? Who besides God can forgive sins?"
At that moment Jesus, in his spirit, perceived that they were thinking thus in their hearts, and he said to them: "Why are you thinking this in your hearts?"
Either it is easier to say to the madman: "Your sins are forgiven," or to say: "Get up and carry your bed and walk?"
But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." He said to the paralytic:
"Listen, I say to you: Get up, take your bed, and go to your house!"
He rose at once, took the bed, and went forth before all, until everyone was astonished and glorified God, saying: "We have never seen anything like this!" The call of Nahor
Then he also went out to the sea. And he came to them all and taught them.
And when he was passing by, he saw Lawi ibn Halifa sitting at the place of the ghabaia, and he said to him: "Follow me." So he rose and followed him.
While he was reclining in his house, many of the ten lepers and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, because they were numerous and followed him.
As for the Kathires and the Pharisaeans, when they saw him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they said to their disciples: "How can he be eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them: "The healthy do not need a physician, but the sick do. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." The Question of Fasting
The disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting; and they came and said to him: "Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but yours do not fast?"
Then Jesus said to them: "Can the sons of the wedding be fasting while the bridegroom is with them? As long as the bridegroom is with them, they cannot fast."
But there will come a time when the bridegroom will lift himself up from them, and then they will fast on those days.
No one weaves a new piece onto an old garment, otherwise the new would take from the old and the tear would become worse.
No one pours new wine into old wineskins, lest the new wine should burst the old skins; instead, they pour new wine into new wineskins. On the Sabbath day.
And on Saturday, he passed between the rows, and his students began harvesting the sheaves while walking.
Then the Pharisees said to him, "Look! Why do they do on the Sabbath what is not permitted?"
He said to them: "Did you ever read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and those with him?"
How did he enter the house of God during the days of Abiathar, the high priest, and eat the showbread, which is forbidden for anyone except the priests, and give it to those who were with him?
Then he said to them: "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
If the son of man is also the Lord of the Sabbath.
Healing on Saturday
Then he also entered the assembly, and there was a man with a dry hand.
They began to watch him: Will he heal him on Saturday? So that they might complain about him.
He said to the man who had the withered hand: "Stand in the middle!"
Then he said to them: "Is it permissible on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil? To save a life or to take a life?" And they remained silent.
He looked around at them angrily, grieved by the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and his hand was restored as before.
The Pharisees went out with the Herodians and consulted together on how to destroy Him. The crowd followed Jesus
Then Jesus and his disciples went to the sea, and a large crowd from Galilee and from Judea followed him.
From Jerusalem, and from Edom, and from across the Jordan. And those around Phero and Sida gathered in great numbers, hearing how much they had done to him.
He told his disciples to follow him on a small boat for the purpose of gathering, so as not to crowd them.
For he had healed many, so that all who had the disease came to touch him.
And the impure spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him and cried out, saying: "You are the Son of God!"
And they frequently advised them not to show it. The Choice of the Twelve Apostles

And he established twelve to be with him, and to send them out to preach.
They will have authority over curing diseases and expelling demons.

As for the scribes who came from Jerusalem, they said: "With him is Belzulubal! And he is the leader of the devils, sending out the devils."
Then he called them and said to them with an example: "How can a demon cast out another demon?"

And if a house divides upon itself, that house cannot stand.
