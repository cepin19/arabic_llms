The greatest in the kingdom of heaven
At that hour the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus then called a child to him and placed him in the midst of them.
And he said, "I tell you the truth, unless you turn around and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
Whoever humbles himself like this child is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And if a child like this is accepted in my name, then him also God has accepted.
And if one of these little believers stumbles in me, it is better for him that a millstone be hung around his neck and he be drowned in the depths of the sea.
Woe unto the world for its stumbling blocks! For they must come, but woe to that man by whom they come!
If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it from you. It is better for you to enter life lame or missing a hand or a foot than to be thrown into the eternal fire with two hands or two feet.
And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hellfire. Like the lost sheep.
Look, do not despise any of these little ones, for I tell you, their angels in heaven are always watching the face of my Father in heaven.
For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go to seek the one that is lost?
If indeed he finds it, I tell you, he will be happier than ninety-nine who have not strayed.
Thus it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish. If your brother has sinned against you
If your brother sins against you, go and rebuke him between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
If he does not hear, take one or two more with you, so that every word may be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
If they do not listen to them, tell the church. If the church does not listen, treat them as pagans and tax collectors.
Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
And I say unto you, If two of you shall agree on earth concerning any thing they shall ask, it shall be done for them by my Father which is in heaven.
"For wherever two or three are gathered in my name, there I am among them." - Like the servant who does not forgive.
Then Peter came to him and said, "Lord, how many times shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?"
Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times."
Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves.
When he began to settle the accounts, one who owed ten thousand weight was brought to him.
And since he had nothing to fulfill his master's command to sell himself, his wife, his children, and all that he had, and to pay the debt.
The servant's pride, prostrating himself, said: "O Master, give me time, for I will pay you all."
The master of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him and left him his debt.
And when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred dinars. So he seized him and took him by the neck, saying, "Repay what you owe me."
The servant's pride was on his feet, and he asked his companion, saying, "Take your time, for I will pay you all in full."
He did not reply, but left and threw him in prison until he paid the debt.
When the slaves saw what their companions had done, they were very sad. They came and told their master everything that had happened.
Then his master called him and said, "O wicked slave, because you asked, I forgave you all that debt."
Shouldn't you also have shown mercy to your fellow servant as I have shown mercy to you?
And his master, angry, delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all that was owed to him.
Thus does my heavenly Father do to you, if you do not forgive each other's sins from your hearts."
Marriage and divorce
And when Jesus had finished saying these things, he departed from Galilee and came to the borders of Judea across the Jordan.
And a great multitude followed him, and he healed them there.
And the Pharisees came to him and tempted him, saying, "Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for any cause?"
He answered and said to them, "Have you not read that He who created from the beginning, created them [both] male and female?"
And he said, For this reason a man leaves his father and his mother, and attaches himself to his wife, and they become one flesh.
"If they are no longer two but one body, then God who united them will not separate them."
They said to him, "Why did Moses command that a book of divorce be given to her so that she might be set free?"
He said to them, "Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to put away your wives. But from the beginning it was not so.
And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery."
His disciples said to him, "If this is how a man treats a woman, then he should not marry!"
He said to them, "Not everyone accepts this teaching, but only those who have been given it.
For there are eunuchs who were born so from their mothers' wombs, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever is able to accept this, let him do so." Jesus blessed the children.
Then some children came to him, that he might lay his hands on them and pray; but the disciples rebuked them.
But Jesus said, "Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
He then laid his hands on them and left. The rich young man
And if someone comes to him and says, "Teacher, what good work shall I do to have eternal life?"
Then he said to him, "Why do you call me good? Only one is good, and that is God. But if you want to enter life, keep the commandments."
He said to him, "Which commandment?" Jesus answered, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
"Honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself."
The young man said to him, "I have memorized all this since my youth. What more do I need?"
Jesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come and follow me."
When the young man heard the word, he went away sorrowful, for he had great wealth.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven.
And I say unto you also, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
When his disciples heard this, they were amazed, saying, "Who then can be saved?"
Then Jesus looked at them and said, "With people it is impossible, but not with God; for with God all things are possible."
Then Peter answered and said to him, "Lo, we have left all, and followed thee: what shall we have?"
Then Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, those who have followed me in my renewal, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you too will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
And whosoever shall leave house or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and others who are last will be first.
Like acts of generosity.
For the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He agreed with the workers for a denar per day, and sent them to his vineyard.
Then around 3 o'clock, he saw others standing in the market place jobless,
He said to them, "Go also to the feast, and you will receive your share." So they went.
He also left around 6 and 9 o'clock and did the same.
Then about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and he said to them, "Why have you been standing here all day idle?"
They said to him, "Because no one has hired us." He said to them, "Go you also to the vineyard, and whatever is right, take for yourselves."
When evening came, the host said to his manager: "Call the workers and give them their wages, beginning with the last and ending with the first."
Then at eleven o'clock the tax-collectors came and took a denarius from each one.
When the first ones came, they thought they would get more. So they also took a denarius at a time.
And as they were taking, they complained about the Lord of the House.
Saying, "These last have worked but an hour, and thou hast made them equal to us who have borne the weight of the day and the heat!"
Then he answered and said to one of them, "My friend, I have not wronged you! Didn't we agree on a dinar?"
Take what is yours and go, for I want to give this last one to you as well.
Or what right have I to do what I will with what is mine? Is your eye evil because I am good?
Thus it is that the last shall be first and the first last, for many are called but few are chosen." Jesus prophesies his death and resurrection.
And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside on the road and said to them:
Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of the chief priests and scribes; and they will condemn him to death.
And they shall deliver him to the nations to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify; and on the third day he shall rise." And the mother of Zebedee's son came to him.
Then his mother and her children came to him; and they bowed down and asked him for something.
Then he said to her, "What do you want?" She said, "Say that my two sons will sit, one on your right and the other on your left, in your kingdom."
Then Jesus answered and said, "You do not know what you ask. Can you drink the cup that I am going to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?" They said to him, "We can."
He said to them, "Drink my cup, and be dyed with the dye that I am dyed with. As for sitting at my right hand or my left, I have no right to give it except to those for whom my Father has prepared it."
When the ten heard about the brothers, they were angry.
Then Jesus called them and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles dominate over them, and their great ones exercise power over them.
Let not your hearts be like this. But whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant.
And whoever wishes to be first among you must be your servant.
"For the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." Healing of the blind in Jericho
And as they were going out from Jericho, a great multitude followed them.
And if two blind men sat by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, saying, "Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!"
The crowd rebuked them to be silent, but they only cried out more, saying, "Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!"
Jesus stood up and called them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
They said to him, "O Lord, open our eyes!"
Jesus opened their eyes, and immediately they could see and followed him.
Entering Jerusalem
And when they were near Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at the mountain of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples.
Saying to them, "Go into the village before you, and immediately you will find an ass tied, and a colt with her; loose them, and bring them to me."
And if anyone says to you, "Tell them this," you shall say, "The Lord needs them, and He will send them immediately."
So all this was to fulfill what the prophet said:
Tell the daughter of Zion: Behold, your King comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
And the two disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them.
And they brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their clothes on them, and sat on them.
Most spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
And those who went before and those who followed cried out, saying, "Command us, Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Command us from on high!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, saying, "Who is this?"
And the crowd said, This is the prophet Jesus, of Nazareth in Galilee. Cleansing the temple
And Jesus entered the temple of God, and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of the pigeon sellers.
And he said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be a house of prayer.' But you have made it a den of thieves!"
And my father and I, with our crutches, approached him in the temple, and he healed us.
When the chief priests and scribes saw the wonders he was doing and heard the children in the temple shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" they became angry.
And they said unto him, "Do you hear what these are saying?" And Jesus said to them, "Yes! Have you never read: 'Out of the mouths of babes and infants you have perfected praise'?"
Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he stayed overnight. The fig tree withered.
And in the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry.
And he saw a fig tree by the way, and came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves only. And he said unto it, 'Let no fruit grow on thee henceforth forever!' And immediately the fig tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they marveled, saying, "How did the fig tree wither at once?"
Then Jesus answered and said to them, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you can do this: command the mountain, 'Move from here and go into the sea,' and it will happen."
"And whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive." - Question about Jesus' authority
And when he came to the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people approached him, knowing him, and said, "By what authority do you do this? And who has given you this authority?"
Then Jesus answered and said to them, "I ask you one thing, and if you tell me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things."
John's baptism: where did it come from? From heaven or from men?" And they thought among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
And if we say, 'Of the people, we fear the people, for John is like a prophet to all,'
Then they answered Jesus, saying, "We do not know." He said to them also, "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things." As the sons of God, he said.
What do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, "My son, go today and work in my vineyard."
He answered and said, "What I want." But he repented later and left.
And he came to the second and said the same. He answered and said, Behold, I am here, O master. And he did not pass by.
"Which of the two did the will of the Father?" They answered, "The first." Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, tax collectors and prostitutes will enter the Kingdom of God before you."
Because John came in the way of righteousness to you, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him. And when you saw this, you did not repent at last to believe him, like the noblemen.
Hear another parable: A man who was a householder planted a vineyard, and surrounded it with a fence, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower, and left it in the hands of vine-growers and went abroad.
And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the vinedarers to take the fruit.
Then the Karamen took their slaves, and some they beat, some they killed, and some they stoned.
Then he also sent other slaves, more than the first ones, and they did the same to them.
Finally, he sent his son to them, saying, "They are afraid of my son!"
And when the brothers saw the son, they said to one another, "This is the heir! Come, let us kill him and take his inheritance!"
They took him and led him outside the vineyard and killed him.
Then when comes the owner of generosity, what will he do to those generous ones?"
They said to him, "Those wicked ones will be destroyed with a wicked destruction, and the grace will be given to other faithful ones who will give the fruits in their season."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone which the builders rejected is now the cornerstone'? The Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes."
Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation that bears fruit.
"And whoever falls on this stone will be crushed, and whoever it falls on will be broken!"
And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard him speak like this, they knew that he had spoken against them.
And when they sought to seize him, they feared the crowd, for they regarded him as a prophet.
Like the wedding of the king's son.
And Jesus also spoke to them in parables, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.
And he sent his servants to call the invited ones to the wedding, but they did not want to come.
So he sent out other slaves as well, saying, "Tell those invited, 'Behold, I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and fatted cattle are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding.'"
But they relaxed and went their ways, one to his field, and another to his business.
The remaining ones seized their slaves, insulted them, and killed them.
When the king heard this, he was angry, and sent his soldiers, who destroyed those murderers and burned their city.
Then he said to his servants, "The wedding is ready, but the invited guests were not worthy."
So go to the crossroads, and whoever you meet, invite him to the wedding.
And those slaves went out into the ways, and gathered all they found, evil and good. And the wedding was filled with those reclining.
When the king came in to see those reclining, he saw a man who was not dressed for the wedding.
He said to him, "My friend, how did you enter here without wedding attire?" He remained silent.
Then the king said to the servants, Bind his hands and feet, and take him away and cast him into the outer darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
"Because many claim, but few are chosen." Pay tribute to Caesar.
Then the Pharisees went and conspired together to catch him with words.
So they sent to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, "Master, we know that you are truthful, and teach the way of God with truth, and you do not care for anyone, for you do not regard the appearance of men."
So he said to them, "Tell me, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
Then Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?"
Show me the tax treatment. They gave him a dinar.
Then he said to them, "Whose image and writing is this?"
They said to him, "Caesar." And he said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
When they heard this, they were astonished and left him and went away. The question of the resurrection of the dead.
In that day, Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him.
Saying, "Teacher, Moses said: If a man dies without children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise offspring for his brother."
We had seven brothers. The first one got married and died, leaving no children, so he left his wife to his brother.
And the second and third to seven.
And at the end, the woman also died.
So, at the Resurrection, to whom of the seven will she be a wife? For she was to all!"
Then Jesus answered and said to them, "You are in error, for you do not know the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels of God in heaven.
As for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God said to you before:
Am I God for Abraham, God for Isaac, and God for Jacob? God is not a God of the dead, but of the living."
When the crowd heard him, they were amazed at his teaching. The Great Commandment
But when the Pharisees heard that he had made the Sadducees dumb, they gathered together.
And one of them, a Levite, asked him to test him, saying:
"O teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the law?"
Then Jesus said to him, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind."
This is the first and greatest commandment.
And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself.
"These two commandments are the whole law and the prophets." - Christ and David
And while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them.
Saying, "What do you think about Christ? Son of who is he?" They said to him, "Son of David."
He said to them, "How can David call him Lord by the Spirit? Saying:
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."
If David calls him Lord, how can he be his son?
No one could answer him a word. And from that day on, no one dared to ask him anything.
Warning against the scribes and Pharisees
Then Jesus spoke to the crowd and his disciples.
Saying, "The scribes and the Pharisees sat on Moses' seat."
So whatever they tell you to keep, keep and do, but according to their works do not act, for they say and do not act.
They load heavy, difficult-to-carry burdens on people's shoulders, and they do not want to move them with their fingers.
All their works they do to be seen by men: they make their fillets and enlarge the borders of their garments.
They love the first cushion at feasts, and the first seats in assemblies.
Greetings in the markets, and let people call him: My Lord, My Lord!
And you, do not call your master, for you have one Teacher, the Christ, and you are all brothers.
And do not call anyone on earth your father, for your Father in heaven is one.
Do not call anyone your teacher, for you have one Teacher, the Christ.
And the greatest among you will be your servant.
For he who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted. Woe to the scribes and Pharisees!
But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; for neither do you enter yourselves, nor do you allow those who would enter to go in.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye devour the houses of widows, and for a pretense make long prayers: therefore ye shall receive greater damnation.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye traverse sea and land to win one proselyte, and when he is won, ye make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.
Woe unto you, blind leaders! Saying, Who swore by the temple, and by no means! But who swore by the treasure of the temple, he is bound by his oath.
O you ignorant and blind ones! Which is greater: the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
And he who has sworn by the altar, he is not to be feared; but he who has sworn by the sacrifice upon it, he is to be feared.
O ignorant and blind ones! Which is greater: the sacrifice or the altar that sanctifies the sacrifice?
For he who has sworn by the altar, has sworn by it and by all that is upon it!
And whoever swears by the temple has sworn by both the temple and him who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the heavens has sworn by God's throne and by Him who sits upon it.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithes of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law: justice, and mercy, and faith: which are the main things that ought to be kept.
O blind leaders! Who strain at a gnat and swallow a camel.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and the plate, but within they are full of extortion and self-indulgence.
Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, so that the outside may also be clean.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye are like whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and all uncleanness.
That is how you are also: from outside you appear righteous to people, but within you are full of hypocrisy and sin.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous.
And you say, "If we had been in our fathers' days, we would not have shared in the blood of the prophets."
You are testifying that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
Fill ye also your vessels as your fathers did.
O you offspring of vipers, how can you escape the judgment of hell?
Therefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes; and of them ye shall kill and crucify, and of them ye shall stone, and shall persecute from city to city.
So that every drop of righteous blood that has been shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel, the friend, to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you killed between the temple and the altar, may come upon you.
Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation! Jesus wept over Jerusalem.
"Jerusalem, Jerusalem! You who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how many times have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you would not!"
Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
For I say unto you, ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord!
Signs of the end of time
Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple. And his disciples came to him, to show him the buildings of the temple.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do you not see all these? Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; all will be thrown down."
And while he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him in private, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming and the end of the age?"
Then Jesus answered and said to them, "See, let no one deceive you.
For many will come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and they will deceive many.
You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. Look, do not be alarmed. For these things must happen, but the end is not yet.
For nation rises against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places.
But these are but the beginning of sorrows.
Then they will deliver you to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name.
And then many will stumble and betray one another, hating each other.
Many false prophets will arise and lead many astray.
For the abundance of sin, love grows cold among many.
But he who endures to the end will be saved.
The preachers of the Kingdom's good news throughout all the earth are a testimony to all nations. Then comes the end.
And when you see the 'abomination of desolation' standing where it ought not, according to the prophet Daniel, let the reader understand.
And then those in Judea will flee to the mountains.
And he who is on the roof, let him not come down to take anything from his house.
And whoever is in the field, let him not turn back to take his cloak.
Woe to the pregnant and nursing women in those days!
They came so that their flight would not be in winter or on the Sabbath.
For then there will be a great tribulation such as has not been since the beginning of the world until now, and never will be again.
Even if those days had not been shortened, the body would not have been purified. But for the sake of the chosen ones, those days have been shortened.
If anyone says to you, "Behold, here is Christ!" or "Behold, there he is!" do not believe it.
For false messiahs and false prophets will arise, and they will give great signs and wonders, to deceive, if possible, even the chosen ones.
I told you so.
If they say to you, "Behold, it is in the wilderness!" do not go out. If they say to you, "Behold, it is in the secret places!" do not believe it.
For just as lightning comes from the east and appears in the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man.
For where the carcass is, there the vultures will be gathered.
And after those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.
And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. And then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.
He sends his angels with a mighty sound of a trumpet, and they gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
From the fig tree learn its lesson: when its branch becomes tender and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
So you also, when you see all these things, know that he is near at the doors.
Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened.
The sky and the earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. Always prepared.
No one knows the day or the hour, not even the angels in heaven, but my Father alone.
For as in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the coming of the Son of Man.
For they were as in the days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark.
And they did not know until the flood came and took them all, so will be also the coming of the Son of Man.
Then there will be two in the field; one will be taken and the other left.
Two grind at the mill, one is taken and the other left.
Keep watch, for you do not know on what hour your Lord will come.
And know this: if the master of the house knew at what hour the thief would come, he would stay awake and not leave his house vulnerable.
Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of man cometh. Like a faithful servant.
Then who is the faithful, wise servant whom his master has placed over his household to provide them with food at the proper time?
Blessed is the servant who, when his master comes, finds him doing so!
Verily, I say unto you, he will render account for all his possessions.
But if the servant within himself says, "My lord is delaying his coming,"
He begins to strike his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with the drunkards.
The master of that servant will come on a day that he does not expect and at an hour that he does not know.
He cuts it up and shares it with the hypocrites. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Like the ten virgins
At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
And of them were five wise, and five foolish.
But the foolish took their lamps without oil.
And the wise women took oil in their vessels, with their torches.
And as the bridegroom tarried, they all fell asleep.
In the middle of the night there was shouting: Behold, the bridegroom is coming, so go out to meet him!
Then all those virgins got up and trimmed their lamps.
The ignorant women said to the wise: "Give us of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
Then the wise women answered, It may not be enough for us, but go to the merchants and buy for yourselves.
And while they were going to buy, the groom came, and the bridesmaids went in with him to the wedding, and the door was closed.
Finally, the rest of the virgins also came and said, "Sir, sir, open to us!"
Then he answered and said, "Truly, I tell you, I do not know you."
Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know the day or the hour when the Son of Man is coming, like a thief in the night.
As if a traveler had called his slaves and entrusted them with his wealth.
So he gave one five talents, another two talents, and to another one talent, according to each one's ability. And he departed.
And he who took the five talents went and traded with them, and gained five more talents.
And so he who took two measures, also gained two more.
And he who had taken the weight went and dug in the earth, and hid his lord's silver.
And after a long time, the master of those slaves came and held them accountable.
Then he who had taken the five talents came and brought five other talents, saying, "Master, I have brought you five talents." Behold, I have gained five more talents besides them.
Then his master said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with little, I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master."
Then he who had taken the two talents came and said, "Master, I have delivered two talents which were entrusted to me." Behold, I have gained two more.
His master said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful in little, I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master."
Then came also he that had received one talent, and said, Lord, I know that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strewed.
I was afraid and went away, and hid my face in the earth. Behold, this is yours.
Then his master answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not sow.
So I should have deposited my silver with the moneylenders, and when I came, I would take what was mine with interest.
Take from him the weight and give it to him who has the ten weights.
For to everyone who has, more will be given, but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
The idle servant was cast into the outer darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. The sheep and the goats.
And when the Son of Man comes in his glory, accompanied by all the holy angels, then he will sit on his glorious throne.
And all the nations shall be gathered before him, and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He places the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right: "Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."
Because I was hungry, you fed me. Because I was thirsty, you gave me drink. Because I was a stranger, you welcomed me.
You undressed me when I was naked. You visited me when I was sick. You came to me when I was imprisoned.
Then the righteous will answer, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?"
And when we saw you as a stranger, we sheltered you, or when you were naked, we covered you.
And when we saw you sick or in prison, did we not come to you?
The king will answer and say to them, "Truly I tell you, whatever you did to one of these little ones, you did to me."
He also says to those on his left: "Go away from me, cursed ones, to the eternal fire prepared for Satan and his angels."
Because I was hungry, you did not feed me. Because I was thirsty, you did not give me a drink.
You were a stranger and I did not welcome you. Naked and you did not clothe me. Sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.
Then they will answer, "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?"
He will answer them, "Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of these least ones, you did not do for me."
"These go to eternal punishment, but the righteous go to eternal life."
Conspiracy to kill Jesus
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples:
You know that after two days it is Passover, and the Son of Man is delivered up to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people assembled in the house of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas.
They consulted together how they might take Jesus by guile and kill him.
But they said, "It is not appropriate during the feast, lest there be a riot among the people." They anointed Jesus with perfume.
And while Jesus was in Bethany, in Simon the Leper's house,
A woman came to him with an expensive perfume bottle, and she poured it over his head as he reclined.
When his disciples saw this, they were indignant and said, "Why this waste?"
Because this good could have been sold for much more and given to the poor.
Then Jesus said to them, "Why do you disturb the woman? For she has done a good deed."
For the poor are always with you, but I am not always with you.
For when she poured this oil on my body, she did so for my healing.
Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached in all the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her." The betrayal of Judas
Then one of the twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
And he said, "What do you want to give me, and I will deliver it to you?" And they gave him thirty pieces of silver.
And from that time he sought an opportunity to deliver him. The Easter supper with the disciples.
And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
He said, "Go into the city to So-and-so and say to him: 'The Teacher says, 'My time is near. I am making the Passover with my disciples.'"
The disciples did as Jesus commanded and prepared the Passover.
And when evening had come, he reclined at table with the twelve.
While they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
And they were very sorrowful, and each one began to say to him, "Am I, Lord?"
Then he answered and said, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, he is betraying me!"
The Son of Man is going as it is written about him, but woe to the man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It would have been better for that man if he had not been born!
Then Judas, having received the bribe, answered and said, "Master, is it I?" He said to him, "You have said it." Lord's Supper
While they were eating, Jesus took the bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
And he took the cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, "Drink all of you from it."
Because this is my blood, the new covenant, shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.
And I say unto you, I will drink no more of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.
Then they went down to the Sea of Galilee and got into a boat. Jesus announced that Peter would deny him three times.
Then Jesus said to them, "This night you will all fall away, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'"
But after I have gone before you into Galilee."
Then Peter answered and said to him, "Even if everyone doubts you, I never will."
Jesus said to him, "Truly I tell you, this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
Peter said to him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you!" So said all the disciples. In Gethsemane.
Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, "Sit here, and I will go over there to pray."
Then he took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him, and began to be sorrowful and distressed.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with me."
Then he went a little forward and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt."
Then he came to his disciples, and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
"Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
And he went away a second time and prayed, saying, "Father, if it is not possible for me to pass this cup, but I must drink it, then let your will be done."
Then he came and found them also asleep, for their eyes were heavy.
And he left them and went away, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
Then he came to his disciples and said to them, "Sleep now and rest! Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners."
Let's go! Behold, he who delivers me is near! "The Arrest of Jesus
And as he spoke, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
And he who delivered him said to them, "He whom you welcome is he. Seize him."
Then he came up to Jesus at once and said, "Greetings, Master!" and kissed him.
Then Jesus said to him, "My good man, why have you come?" At that moment they came up and laid hold of Jesus, and took him away.
And one of those who were with Jesus, reaching out, drew his sword and cut off the servant of the high priest's ear.
Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword!"
Do you think I can't ask my father to give me more than twelve legions of angels now?
How then do books complete: "Is it thus that it should be?"
At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, "Isn't it written: 'The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy'? I have been with you daily in the temple, teaching, and you did not seize me.
And all this was to fulfill the writings of the prophets. Then all his disciples left him and fled. Before the Jewish council.
And those who seized Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and elders had gathered.
Peter followed him from afar to the house of the high priest, and went inside and sat down among the servants to see the outcome.
And the chief priests and the elders and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death.
They did not find it. Although many false witnesses came, they did not find it. But finally, a false witness stepped forward.
And they said, "He said, 'I am able to destroy the house of God, and in three days I will rebuild it.'"
Then the chief priest arose and said to him, "Do you not have anything to say? What do these witnesses testify about you?"
But Jesus was silent. The high priest answered and said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God."
Jesus said to him, "You have said it! And I also tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of power, coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest, tearing his clothes, said, "He has blasphemed! We have no further need of witnesses. You have heard his blasphemy!"
"What do you see?" They answered, "He deserves death."
They then spat in his face and punched him, while others slapped him.
Saying, "Tell us, Christ, who is it that struck you?" Peter's denial
But Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a maid came to him and said, "You were with Jesus of Galilee!"
Then he denied before them all, saying, "I do not know what you are talking about!"
Then, as he came out into the vestibule, she saw him again and said to those who were there, "Behold, this is he who was with Jesus of Nazareth!"
He also denied with an oath: "I do not know the man!"
And after a little while, the dawn came, and they said to Peter, "Truly you also are one of them, for your speech betrays you!"
Then he began to curse and swear, "I don't know the man!" And at once you shouted.
Peter remembered Jesus' words to him, "Before the cock crows, you will disown me three times." So he went out and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
And when the morning was come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to kill him.
They bound him, led him away, and handed him over to the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate.
Then Judas, who had betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repented, and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
Saying, "I erred in giving up innocent blood." They said, "What does that concern us? You are the one who can see!"
He threw a coin into the structure and left, then went away and killed himself.
Then the chief priests took the silver and said, "It is not lawful to put it into the treasury, for it is the price of blood."
Consult one another and buy it; a field with a clay pit, a burial place for strangers.
That is why that field is called "Field of Blood" to this day.
At that time it was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that they had valued, whom the children of Israel had valued;
And they gave her up to be crucified, as the Lord commanded me." Before Pilate
Then Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "You say it is."
And while the priests' and elders' heads were laid against him, he answered nothing.
Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many witness against you?"
He did not answer him, not even a single word, which made the governor very surprised.
And the governor used to free one prisoner for the feast, whoever the people asked for.
And at that time they had a famous prisoner named Barabbas.
While they were assembled, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Because he knew they had betrayed him out of envy.
And while he sat on the throne, his wife sent to him, saying, "Keep away from that man, for I have suffered greatly in a dream because of him today."
But the chief priests and elders stirred up the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
Then the governor answered and said to them, "Which of the two do you wish me to release for you?" And they said, "Barabbas!"
Pilate said to them, "What shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ?" And they all said, "Let him be crucified!"
Then the governor said, "What evil have you done?" And they cried out even more, saying, "Crucify him!"
When Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man! See for yourselves!"
Then all the people answered and said, "Let his blood be on us and on our children."
Then they released Barabbas to them, but Jesus they scourged and handed over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked him.
Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus away to the governor's palace, and they gathered the whole cohort around him.
They shaved him and dressed him in a red robe.
They wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They spat on him, took the reed and struck him on the head.
And after they had mocked him, they stripped him of his garments and put a purple robe on him, and led him away to be crucified. Crucifixion
And as they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon, whom they compelled to carry his cross.
And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means "Place of the Skull"
He was given a bitter drink to sip, and when he tasted it, he did not want to drink it.
And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, as it is written in the prophet: "Let his garments be divided among them, and for his vesture let them cast lots."
Then they sat there guarding him.
And they set over his head a sign that said: "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews."
Then two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
And the passersby were rowing him while shaking their heads.
Saying, "You who tear down the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"
And the chief priests, scoffing with the scribes and elders, said:
He saved others; himself, he cannot save! If he is the King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, then we will believe in him!
He may trust in God, let God deliver him now if he will! For he said, I am the Son of God!
And so also the two criminals who were crucified with him were mocking him. Death
And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
About the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? which is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
A group of those standing there, when they heard it, said, "He is calling Elijah."
And at once one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink.
And the rest said, "Let him go. Let's see if Elijah will come to deliver him!"
Jesus also cried out with a loud voice, and breathed his last.
And if the veil of the temple was rent in two, from top to bottom, and the earth shook, and the rocks were split.
The graves opened, and many of the bodies of the saints who had lain down rose.
And they came forth out of the graves after his resurrection, and entered into the holy city, and appeared unto many.
But the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and what happened, were filled with awe and said, "Truly this is the Son of God!"
And many women were looking from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.
And Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the Zebedee brothers. burial
And when evening was come, a rich man of Ramah, named Joseph, came; he also was a disciple of Jesus.
Then he went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. And Pilate commanded that it be given to him.
Then Joseph took the body and wrapped it in clean linen.
and laid him in his new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock, and rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and went away.
And Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb
And on the morrow, after preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled with Pilate.
Saying, "Lord, remember that the deceiver said while he was alive: After three days I will rise."
So on the third day, seal the tomb, lest his disciples come at night and steal it, and say to the people, 'He has risen from the dead.' Thus the last deception will be worse than the first!
Then Pilate said to them, "You have guards. Go, take him and keep him as you know."
They left and sealed the tomb with the guards and stamped the stone.
The Apocalypse
And after the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the tomb.
And if a great earthquake occurs, for the angel of the Lord will descend from heaven and roll away the stone from the door, and sit on it.
And his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
From his fear, the guards trembled and became like dead men.
Then the angel answered and said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
He is not here, for he did as he said! Come, let us look at the place where the Lord lay.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him. I have told you this.'"
And they went out quickly from the tomb with great fear and joy, running to tell his disciples.
And they went forth and told his disciples, saying, "We have seen the Lord; and he has spoken to us, saying, 'Peace be with you.'" So they came and held his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go, tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." The sentinels' report
And as they were going, behold, a company of the guard came into the city: and they told the chief priests all that had happened.
They gathered with the elders, consulted, and gave the soldiers a great deal of silver.
Saying, "Say that his disciples came by night and stole it while we were sleeping."
And if they hear it from the Wali, we will intercede for you, and make you feel at ease."
So they took the silver and did as they were taught, and this saying has been among the Jews to this day. Jesus appeared to the disciples.
And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain, where Jesus had commanded them.
And when they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted.
Then Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
And teach them to keep all that I have commanded you. Behold, I am with you every day until the end of the age." Amen.
John the Baptist is preparing the way.
The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
As it is written in the Prophets: "Behold, I send My angel before your face, who shall prepare your way before you.
A loud voice in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
John was baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the region of the Jews and the people of Jerusalem came to him, and they were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
And John was clothed with camel's hair, and had a leather belt about his loins, and ate locusts and wild honey.
And he was preaching, saying, "After me comes one mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to untie the latches of his shoes."
"I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." - The Baptism and Experience of Jesus Christ
And in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And as he came up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him.
And a voice from the heavens said, "You are my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased."
And at once the Spirit sent him into the wilderness.
And in the wilderness he was with the beasts for forty days, tempted of the devil. And the angels ministered unto him. The call of the first disciples
And after John had been baptized, Jesus came up from Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God.
And he says, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the gospel."
And as he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
Then Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men."
For the moment, they left their nets and followed him.
Then he passed by a little farther and saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were mending their nets in a ship.
So they delayed him no longer. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the crew and followed him. And a wicked spirit was cast out.
Then they entered Capernaum, and at once on the Sabbath day he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
They were astounded by his teaching, for he taught them as one with authority, not like the scribes.
And there was in their congregation a man possessed with a foul spirit, who cried out.
Saying, "Ah! What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? You have come to destroy us! I know who you are: the Holy One of God!"
Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent! And come out of him!"
The evil spirit seized him, and he cried out with a loud voice, and the spirit departed from him.
They were all amazed, and they asked each other, saying, "What is this? What is this new teaching? For he commands even unclean spirits, and they obey him!"
And his fame spread throughout all the region of Galilee. The healing of Simon's mother and others.
And when they had gone out of the council, they came immediately to the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
And Simon's mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and at once they told him of it.
Then he stepped forward and held her by the hand, and immediately the fever left her, and she began to serve them.
And when evening came, after the sun had set, all the sick and the possessed came to him.
And all the city was gathered at the gate.
He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons, and did not allow the demons to speak because they knew him. Preaching in Galilee
And very early in the morning he arose and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there he prayed.
So Simon and those with him followed him.
And when they found him, they said to him, "Everyone is looking for you."
Then he said to them, "Let us go to the neighboring villages as well, so that I may preach there also, for that is why I have come out."
He was preaching in their synagogues throughout Galilee, and casting out demons. Healing the leper.
Then a leper came to him, begging him on his knees, and said, "If you choose, you can cleanse me."
Jesus, moved with compassion, stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I do will it, be made clean!"
As he spoke, leprosy left him and he was cleansed.
He rebuked him and sent him away for a while.
And he said to him, "Look, do not tell anyone anything. Go, present yourself to the priest, and offer for your purification what Moses commanded, a testimony for them."
But he went out and began to cry out and proclaim the news, so that he could no longer enter a city openly, but was always in desolate places, and people came to him from everywhere.
Curing paralysis
Then he also went to Capernaum after some days, and heard that he was in the house.
And at that time, many had gathered so that there was no room left, neither outside the door. And he was speaking to them with that word.
And they came to him, carrying a paralytic on a stretcher, supported by four men.
Since they could not come near him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was. And after they had dug through it, they let down the stretcher on which the paralytic lay.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
And there were certain scribes sitting there in their hearts pondering.
Why does he speak like this with paradoxes? Who can forgive sins except God alone?
At that very moment, Jesus perceived that they were thinking this in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?"
Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your bed, and walk'?
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." He said to the paralytic,
I say to you: Get up and carry your bed and go to your house!
And he arose at once, took up the child, and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!" (Luke 2:22, New International Version)
Then he went out to the sea again. And all the crowd came to him, and he taught them.
And as he was passing by, he saw Levi ben Chalphi sitting at the tax collection place, and said to him, "Follow me." So he got up and followed him.
And while he was reclining at home, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for they were numerous and followed him.
But the scribes and Pharisees, when they saw him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, said to his disciples, "Why does he eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard it, he said to them, "The well do not need a physician, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." (On fasting)
And John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting; and they came and said unto him, Why do John's disciples and the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
Then Jesus said to them, "Can the children of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as the bridegroom is with them, they cannot fast."
But there will come days when the groom will be taken from them, and then they will fast in those days.
No one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment, or else the new will take away from the old, and the patch will become worse.
And no one pours new wine into old wineskins, lest the new wine burst the wineskins, and both the new and the old be ruined. But new wine must be poured into new wineskins." (Mark 2:22, New International Version)
And as he passed by the fields on Saturday, his disciples began to pluck the ears of grain as they walked.
Then the Pharisees said to him, "Look! Why do they do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"
And he said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he was in need, and he and those with him were hungry?"
How did the house of God enter in the days of Abiathar, the high priest, and eat the bread of the offering, which is not lawful for any but the priests, and give also to them that were with him?"
Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
"If the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath."
Healing on Saturday
Then he also entered the assembly, and there was a man with a withered hand.
So they watched him, wondering if he would heal on the Sabbath, in order to accuse him.
Then he said to the man with the withered hand, "Come forward!"
Then he said to them, "Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil? To save a life, or to kill?" And they remained silent.
He looked at them in anger, sorrowful at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and his hand was healed, like the other.
Then the Pharisees went out and conferred with the Herodians, how they might destroy Jesus. The crowd followed Jesus.
Then Jesus departed with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee and Judea followed him.
And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan. And those around Tire and Sidon, a great multitude, having heard how great things he did, came to him.
And he said to his disciples, "Let a small boat follow me for the sake of the crowd, so they do not overwhelm me."
Because he had healed many, everyone who had any kind of disease was coming to him to touch him.
And when the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, saying, "You are the Son of God!"
And I charged them greatly not to make it known. Selection of the Twelve Apostles
Then he went up to the mountain and called those he wanted, and they came to him.
And he appointed twelve to be with him, and to send them forth to preach.
And they will have authority over healing diseases and casting out demons.
He gave Simon the name Peter.
James the son of Zebedee and John, the brother of James, he called them Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder.
Andrews, Phillips, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Canaanite,
Judas the traitor who betrayed him. Then they came to a house. Jesus and Beelzebul
They also gathered in such numbers that they could not even eat bread.
And when his kinsmen heard this, they went out to seize him, for they said, "He is mad!"
And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "Behold, he casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, and by the chief of the demons he drives out demons."
Then he called them and said to them in parables: "How can Satan cast out Satan?
And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
And if a house is divided against itself, it cannot stand.
