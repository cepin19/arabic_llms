The Origin of Jesus Christ (Luke 3:23-38)
This is the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:
Ibrahim gave birth to Isaac. Isaac gave birth to Jacob. Jacob gave birth to Judah and his brothers.
Judah went to Tamar and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him. Then Peresh went to Cushan, and Cushan begot Aram.
And Aram went to Emim, and Emim went to Elah, and Elah went to Salem.
And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed, and Obed begat Jesse.
And after King David, Solomon his son reigned. Solomon had taken for a wife the woman who was formerly Uriah's wife.
Solomon succeeded Rehavam. Rehavam succeeded Abijah. Abijah succeeded Asa.
And Asa went into Yohashafat. And Yohashafat went into Joram. And Joram went into Azariah.
And Hezekiah had Joahaz. Joahaz had Ahaz. And Ahaz had Hezekiah.
Hezekiah removed Manasseh. Manasseh removed Amon. Amon removed Josiah.
And Josiah went to Jerusalem and to the Jews that were in exile in Babylon.
And after the time of their banishment in Babylon, Yehenia brought Shealtiel, and Shealtiel brought Zerubbabel.
Zebulun begat Issachar. Issachar begat Jacob. Jacob begat Joseph.
And Ezra went to Zadok. Zadok went to Achim. Achim went to Eliud.
And Eliud went to Eliezer. And Eliezer went to Manasseh. And Manasseh went to Jacob.
Jacob took Joseph to Mary, who gave birth to Jesus, whom they call Christ.
Thus we find forty generations from Abraham to David, and forty generations from David to the exile of the Jews in Babylon, and forty generations from the exile in Babylon until the coming of the Messiah. The birth of Jesus Christ (Luke 2:1-7)
And how Jesus Christ was born: When Mary, his mother, was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit.
My brother Yusuf decided to end his engagement to her without exposing her, because he was a man who feared God.
While he was still pondering the matter, an angel from my Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "O Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to marry Mary. She is pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit."
"And you shall bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."
And all this happened so that the speech that my Lord said through the prophet who said:
# Isaiah 7:14 The young women shall conceive and bear children; and they shall call them 'Emmanuel,' which means 'God with us.'
And when Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel had commanded him from his Lord, and went with his wife to his house.
But he did not lay down with her until she gave birth, and he named the child Jesus.
The wisdom of the judges
When Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in the region of Judea, during the reign of King Herod, a group of wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
And they said, "Where is the king of the Jews who was born? For we have seen his star appear in the east; come, let us worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
And the chief priests and scribes sought to kill Jesus, because he had spoken against them. They asked him where the Christ was to be born.
Answer: "In Bethlehem, which is in the region of Judah, for thus it is written by the prophet:
# Micah 5:2 And thou, Bethlehem, which art little to be among the cities of Judah, out of thee shall come a ruler, who shall shepherd my people Israel.
Herod inquired of the wise men without revealing his purpose, and asked them to stand by until the star appeared.
And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and find the child, and when you have found him, come back and tell me, so that I too may go and worship him."
After hearing the king's words, they went. And as they were on their way, the star they had seen in the east went before them until it came to a halt above the place where the child was.
And when they saw the star, they rejoiced greatly.
And they entered the house and found the child with Mary's mother. So they bowed down and prostrated themselves, and they untied their donkeys, and they brought forth gold, incense, and myrrh.
And our Lord guided them (in their dream) not to return to Herod, so they took a different route and returned to their land. Flight to Egypt.
And when the wise men had departed, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said: "Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child to kill him."
My brother Joseph shook the child and his mother at night and went to Egypt.
# He was 11:1; and he dwelt there until Herod's death, that the word of the Lord by the prophet might be fulfilled: "Out of Egypt have I called my son." The children were killed in Bethlehem.
And when Herod saw that the magi had mocked him, he was enraged, and ordered the killing of all the children in Bethlehem and its surroundings, from two years old and under, according to the time specified by the magi.
Brother, what the prophet Jeremiah said has come to pass.
# Gen 31:15 "In Ramah they heard a cry, a wail, and mourning; Rachel was wailing for her children, and she refused to be comforted, for they were no more." Returning from Egypt to Nazareth.
And when Herod was dead, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph, while he was in Egypt,
And they said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and return to the land of Israel, for those who sought to kill him are dead."
My brother stood up, shook the child, and returned to the land of Israel.
As he heard that Archelaus had become king over Judea in the place of Herod, he was afraid to go there. Then God spoke to him in a dream, and he went to the region of Galilee.
He went to a city called Nazareth and lived there, fulfilling what the prophets had said: "That he should be called a Nazorean."
The Baptism of Jesus (Mark 1:1-8; Luke 3:1-18; John 1:19-28)
And in those days John the Baptist came into the wilderness of Judea preaching.
And he says, "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!"
# Isaiah 40:3 And this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, who said: "A voice cries out: 'Prepare the way for the Lord, Make his paths straight!'"
And John was clothed in clothing made of camel's hair, and had a belt of skin around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
And people were walking from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from the regions around the Jordan.
They confess their sins and immerse themselves in the Jordan River.
And when he saw some Pharisees and Sadducees coming to be baptized, he said to them, "You offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath of God?"
Do things that challenge you and help you grow.
Don't say in your hearts, "We are the children of Abraham." I am telling you, God is able to make these stones children of Abraham.
The weak branches are cut off the trees, and the trees that do not bear good fruit are cut down and thrown into the fire.
Anna pours water on you for repentance, but he who comes after me is stronger than I am, and I am not worthy to untie his shoelaces. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
He shakes the sieve of the floor in his hand, sifts the grain in the barn, but the chaff they burn with fire that does not go out." John baptizes Jesus (Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21-22)
Jesus came from the region of Galilee to Jordan to be baptized by John.
But John did not leave him and said, "I am the one who needs to be baptized by you, how can you come to me?"
But Jesus answered them, "Let this thing be done now, for this is why we are here to fulfill all righteousness." John agreed.
And when Jesus was crucified, there came a sudden bright light, and the sky was rent asunder. And my brother saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon him.
And the voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
Please try Jesus (Mark 1:12-13; Luke 4:1-13).
And the Spirit of God led Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
My brother fasted for forty days and forty nights until he became weak from hunger.
Look at him, they said, to test him. And they said, "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread."
# 8:3 Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"
Shake the walls of the holy city, and stand on the edge of the temple's roof.
# Mark 9:11-12 And they said, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written in the Scriptures, 'He will command his angels over you, and they will support you.' But he answered, 'It is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
# Matthew 6:16 Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
The trembling of hell increased, and it was lifted up onto a high mountain, behind which were all the kingdoms of the world and the glory that was in them.
And they said: "We will give you all this, if you bow down and prostrate yourself."
# Matthew 6:13; Mark 8:33 Jesus answered the devil, "Be gone from me, for it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and him alone shall you serve.'"
And he was driven out into the wilderness, and the angels came and served him. Jesus began his ministry in Galilee (Mark 1:14-15; Luke 4:14-15)
As Jesus heard that John was baptizing, he returned to Galilee.
And Malnasra went out, and walked, and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet Isaiah.
# 9:1-2 The land of Naphtali and the land of Zebulun, by the sea, by the way of the Jordan, Galilee, the land of the other peoples!
The people who sat in darkness saw a great light; those who dwelt in the shadow of death were illuminated.
And at that time Jesus began to preach and say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus called his disciples (Mark 1:16-20; Luke 5:1-11).
And as Jesus walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who was called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting their nets into the lake; for they were fishermen.
And he said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
And when they had made their nets empty, they followed him.
As he was walking, he saw two other brothers: Jacob, son of Zebedee, and his brother John, in a boat with their father Zebedee mending their nets, and he called them.
And when they had filled the boat, they followed him. Jesus taught, preached, and healed the sick (Luke 6:17-19).
And Jesus traveled throughout the whole region of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom of God, and healing every disease and every affliction among the people.
And he spread his news throughout all of Syria. He healed the sick, from all kinds of ailments and misfortunes, the possessed, the epileptics, and the paralyzed. Brother, heal them.
And many people from Galilee and the region known as the Ten Cities, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and the region across the Jordan followed him.
The Sermon on the Mount (Luke 6:20-23)
And Jesus, having seen the people, went up into the mountain, and sat down; and his disciples came to him.
And he began to teach them, saying:
"May their souls rest in peace! They are entering the Kingdom of Heaven."
Health to the sad! They are about to be comforted.
Health to the good ones! They are the earth's inheritance.
Health to the hungry and thirsty for justice! They are about to be satisfied.
May their health be to those who pity them! They are on the verge of being pitied.
"Purity of heart is for those whose intentions are for God! They are on the path of God."
Their health is for them who reconcile people! They are God's children to be named.
Health to those who suffer for the sake of the truth! The Kingdom of Heaven awaits them.
Stay strong when people judge you, torture you, and say bad things about you. It's all for my sake!
Rejoice and leap for joy, for your reward is great in heaven. This is how they tormented the prophets before you." (Salt and Light, Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34-35)
You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, how can you restore its taste? It is no good for anything, it is trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. There is no city built on a mountain that can be seen,
And there is no one who lights a lantern and puts it under a basket, but rather puts it in a high place and lights up the whole house.
Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven." - The Law
"It's not that I came to abolish the law and the prophets, but rather that I came to fulfill them."
We bring you the truth: the sky and the earth will not rest until every letter and every dot of the law is fulfilled, until everything is complete.
Whoever does not obey even one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called small in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever obeys them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
"If you do not become more righteous than the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven."
# Gen 20:13; Deut 5:17; 16:18 "You heard the command given to your fathers: 'Do not kill, and whoever does kill must be put to death.'"
But I tell you: whoever insults his brother will be subject to judgment by the court; and whoever says to his brother, 'You fool,' will be subject to the Sanhedrin; and whoever calls his brother a 'brute' will be in danger of hellfire.
If only you would sacrifice your pride on the altar and remember that you have a problem with your brother.
Leave your offering before the altar, and first go and be reconciled with your brother, then come and offer your offering.
And if someone complains about you, you should settle with them as soon as possible, even if it means going to court, so they don't complain about you to the judge, and the judge talks about you to the officer, and you end up in jail.
You have the right to leave only when you have paid the last cent." (Adultery)
# Ex 20:14; Deut 5:18 "You heard the words said to your fathers: 'You shall not make for yourself an idol.' "
Whether you tell it to anyone who looks at a woman and desires her, he has already committed adultery in his heart.
If an eye makes you sin, pluck it out and throw it away; it is better for you that you lose one part of your body than that your whole body be thrown into hell.
If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to lose a part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell." (Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11-12; Luke 16:18)
# Tith 24:1-4 "And it shall be said, If any man put away his wife, he shall give her a bill of divorce."
"What I tell you: He who divorces his wife for a reason other than adultery makes her commit adultery, and he who marries a divorced woman will surely commit adultery." (Oath)
# Do not 19:12; Keep 30:2; Remember 23:21 "You heard what was said to your fathers: 'Do not swear falsely, but keep the promise of your God.'"
But Anna told us not to swear by anything, not even by the sky, for God's throne.
# Isaiah 66:1; Psalm 7:49; Psalm 48:2 Not on account of its size will the land be valued, nor because of Jerusalem, the city of the great King.
And don't swear by your head, because you can't possibly bring back even a single white or black hair.
Let your 'yes' be 'yes' and your 'no', 'no', for anything beyond that is of the evil one." (Luke 6:29-30)
# Exod 21:24; Lev 24:20; Deut 19:21 "You shall not take vengeance, nor bear a grudge against any of your kin.
But I tell you: do not resist when someone does you wrong. If someone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek as well.
If he loves to argue with you just to get his way, let him take your coat as well.
If someone forces you to go one kilometer with them, go two.
"Give to him who asks from you, and do not refuse him who wants to borrow from you." (Luke 6:27-28, 32-36)
You have heard it said: "Love your neighbor and hate your enemy."
But I say to you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.
That you may be the children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the good and the evil, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
What kind of pay do you deserve if you love those who love you? Brother, isn't it those who collect taxes who should do this?
And what do those who have gone before you say, if you do not believe, then it will be upon your sisters? Is it not those who do not know God who do such a thing with their own hands?
"You must be complete, as your Father in heaven is complete."
Charity
"Do good works before people so they may see you, but have no reward from your Father in heaven."
When you do a good deed for someone, don't blow a horn as the hypocrites do in assemblies and on the streets, so that people will praise them. I tell you the truth: they have received their reward.
But as for you, when you give, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
"So that your charity may be in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you." (Luke 11:2-4)
"When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who like to pray in the synagogues and on the streets so that people may see them. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward."
As for you, when you pray, go into your inner room, close the door, and pray to your God who is unseen. And pray in secret, for He will reward you in secret.
And as they pray, they shouldn't keep repeating empty talk like other peoples who only think of God to hear them say a few words.
Don't be like them, because your heart knows what you need before you ask for it.
Pray thus: Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Let your kingdom come, let your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who wrong us.
We didn't get involved, and we escaped from evil.
And if you forgive people for their mistakes, how much more will your Father in heaven forgive you your sins.
"If you do not forgive people for their mistakes, even your Lord in heaven will not forgive your sins." (Fasting)
And when you fast, do not show sorrow on your faces like the hypocrites, but conceal your sadness so that people may believe that you are fasting. I tell you the truth: they have already received their reward.
But you, when you fast, comb your hair and wash your face.
"So that your fasting may not be seen by men, but by your Father who sees in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you." (Luke 12:33-34)
Do not let your hearts be attached to treasures on earth, which are corrupt by worms and rust, and which thieves break into and steal.
But in your hearts store up treasures that will not be destroyed, where neither moth nor rust corrupts, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
"Where is your treasure? Where is your heart?" (Luke 11:34-36)
The eye is the lantern of the body. If your eye is healthy, then your whole body will be full of light.
"But if your eye is sick, your whole body will be dark. If there is darkness within you, how great will that darkness be!" (Luke 12:22-31; 16:13)
You cannot serve two masters, for either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.
If only you thought about your lives, what you eat and what you drink, and what you wear, brother. Isn't life better than food, and the body better than clothing?
Look at the birds of the sky; they neither sow nor reap nor store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Who among you thinks that someone can add an hour to their life?
And why do you think about clothes? Look at the stripes of a ram's wool: it doesn't tire or spin.
But I tell you: Even King Solomon in all his glory did not have one like it!
If God were to clothe cannabis in such a way, then even if cannabis grows today and is thrown into the fireplace tomorrow, how much more should you clothe yourselves with what your faith is weak!
That's why you shouldn't think and say: "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?"
People who are not believers use all these things, and your Lord knows what you need.
But you are seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and these things will add to your downfall.
That's why you shouldn't worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow he will worry about himself. Every day is enough for the evil it holds."
Do not judge others (Luke 6:37-38, 41-42)
Do not judge others, or they will judge you.
The rule they rule by over people will be ruled by them over you, and the measure they measure with will be measured to them as well.
Why do you see the straw in your brother's eye, and do not perceive the beam in your own?
And how can you tell your brother, "Let me show you the straw in your eye," when your own eye is a painting?
You hypocrite! First, remove the plank from your own eye, and then you can see the splinter in your brother's eye.
"Do not give the sacred things to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them underfoot and turn against you." (Luke 11:9-13)
Ask and you will receive, seek and you will find, knock and the door will be opened to you.
He who seeks will find, and he who knocks will be opened.
Who among you would ask for your child's bread and give them a stone?
Wouldn't a fish ask for a shark to give it?
If you, wicked ones, know how to give your children good things, then how much more should your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask for them?
"If you want people to do for you what you would have them do for you, then that is what the law and the prophets have taught." (Luke 13:24)
Enter through the narrow door. For the door to destruction is wide and easy, and many enter through it.
"How narrow and difficult is the path that leads to life, and few find it." (Luke 6:43-44)
"Repel the false prophets who come to you dressed as nobles, but within they are devils that should not be pitied."
The fruit you bear is what defines you. Brother, thorns do not bear grapes, nor do brambles bear cranberries.
Every beautiful tree bears beautiful fruit, and every unfruitful tree bears unfruitful fruit.
A flourishing tree does not bear poor fruit, nor does a barren tree bear flourishing fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
"But know them by their fruits." (Luke 13:25-27)
"Do not think that everyone who says, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven."
On the Day of Judgment, some people will say: "O Lord, O Lord, didn't you promise us in your name? Didn't we drive out demons in your name? And didn't we perform great miracles in your name?"
And I will say to them, 'I have never known you. Depart from me, you workers of evil!' (Luke 6:47-49)
He who hears these words and acts upon them will be like a wise man who built his house on a rock.
It rained heavily, floods occurred, and the wind blew strongly against that house, but it did not fall, because its foundation was built of stone.
And he who hears my words and does not act on them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
"It rained heavily, floods occurred, and the wind blew hard against the house. That's when it collapsed, leaving nothing but ruins."
And as Jesus finished saying these things, the people were amazed at his teaching.
In his mind, he knew how one with authority was different from their books.
The leper is cleansed (Mark 1:40-45; Luke 5:12-16)
When Jesus had finished speaking, he descended from the mountain, and great crowds followed him.
A leper came near me and prostrated himself, saying, "My lord, if you love me, you can heal me."
And he stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I will, be made whole!" And at that very moment the leprosy was cleansed.
# Mark 14:2 And they said to Jesus, "Why do you remain silent? If you have anything to say, say it. Go to the priest and have him examine you. And if it is as you claim, your testimony will stand." The servant of the temple guard was healed (Luke 7:1-10; John 4:43-54)
And Jesus entered Capernaum, and a centurion came to him, asking for help, saying:
My lord, my slave is lying paralyzed at home and suffering greatly, and cannot move.
And Jesus said, "I am come to save and to heal."
The leader of the water carriers answered: "My lord, I do not deserve for you to come and enter under the roof of my house. But if you say a word, my servant will be healed."
I am a man who rules over others; I have soldiers who obey me. I tell one, "Go!" and he goes. I tell another, "Come!" and he comes. To my slave, I say, "Do this!" and he does it. »
When they heard Jesus speak, they were amazed, and said to those who followed him, "Truly, I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith."
Your translation in English would be: "We bring together a few people from the East and the West to sit at the table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven."
"But the children of the kingdom will be left outside in the darkness, and the coming will be tears and the roars of ages."
And Jesus said to the centurion, "Go, and let it be done to you as you have believed." And at that very hour his servant was healed. Peter's companion was healed (Mark 1:29-34; Luke 4:38-41).
When Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Touching it with her hand, the warmth spread over it. She stood up and started serving him.
In the evening, as the sun set, a group of people with supernatural powers descended upon the village, and with a single word, they summoned the spirits and healed all the sick.
# Isaiah 53:4 And he took our infirmities and bore our diseases. Jesus, and he was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities. And the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his stripes we are healed. (Luke 9:57-62)
And when Jesus saw that there was a great crowd about him, he commanded his disciples to go over to the other side.
And there was one of the scribes who heard them arguing and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
And Jesus said, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
And another of the disciples said, "Master, let us go first and bury our father."
But Jesus said, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead!" Jesus calms the storm (Mark 4:35-41; Luke 8:22-25)
When Jesus stepped out of the boat, his disciples were confused.
A strong wind blew on the lake, so much so that the waves covered the boat. But Jesus was asleep.
And his disciples, seeing it, marveled, and praised God, saying, "O Lord, protect us, for we are perishing!"
And Jesus said to them, "Why are you so afraid? Do you have little faith?" And rising, he rebuked the wind and the sea, and the sea became still.
And the people marveled, saying, "Who is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?" Expelling demons and calming storms (Mark 5:1-20; Luke 8:26-39)
And when Jesus came to the other side of the sea, into the region of the Gerasenes, two men possessed by demons met him, coming out of the tomb, and they were so violent that no one could pass that way.
And they cried out: "What have you done to us, Son of God? Brother, did you come here to torment us before our time?"
And they were there, making vows to graze in a distant place.
The demons begged and said, "If we come out, we will send them to the allies!"
He told them, "Go!" So they went and entered the caves, and all of them descended from the edge of the mountain to the sea, and they were drowned in the water.
They escaped and entered the city, telling everything and what had happened to the two men who lived in the shadows.
All the people in the city went out to meet Jesus, and they begged him to leave their area.
Jesus heals a paralyzed man (Mark 2:1-12; Luke 5:17-26)
And Jesus got into the boat, and crossed over, and came to his city.
And Jesus, seeing a man lying on his bed, a paralytic, and knowing their faith, said to the paralytic, "Take heart, my son, for your sins are forgiven."
There is a group of Jewish scribes who say in their hearts, "This man is blaspheming!"
Did Jesus know what they were thinking? He said to them, "Why do you read the scripture in an evil way in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven," than to say, "Get up and walk"?
"But to know that I, the Son of Man, have authority on earth to forgive sins." And he said to the paralytic, "Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house."
Bro, get up and go home.
When the people saw what had happened, they were filled with fear and praised God for giving such power to humans. Jesus said, "At that time, they were amazed and said, 'Who is this man? He commands even the winds and the sea, and they obey him!'" (Mark 2:13-17; Luke 5:27-32)
And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. And he said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
When Jesus was reclining at table with Matthew in his house, some people came, bringing the tax collectors and sinners, and they sat down with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
But when Jesus heard this, he said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
# At 6:6, they walked and learned what this verse means: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." And I came to call the sinners, not the righteous." (Matthew 9:13 - 17; Mark 2:18-22; Luke 5:33-39)
The students of John came to Jesus and said, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your students do not fast?"
Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is with them? But the time will come when the bridegroom is taken from them, and then they will fast."
There's no one who patches an old garment with new fabric, because the new fabric will absorb and consume the old garment's essence, and the stitches will only make it worse.
And there is not even one person who puts new wine in an old wine skin; otherwise, the wine will burst the skin, and the wine will be spilled, and the skin will be ruined. But new wine must be put in new wine skins, and so they both are preserved." The little girl lives, and the woman who was bleeding stopped (Mark 5:21-43; Luke 8:40-56).
When Jesus was speaking to them, one of the chief priests came forward and bowed down before him, saying, "My daughter has just died. Come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
And Jesus arose and followed him, and his disciples.
And there was a woman who had been suffering from bleeding for two years, which came from her fingers and reached the edge of her skin.
Because of it, she said to herself, "We should have taken a break to heal."
Jesus and his disciples said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace." And immediately she was made well.
When Jesus arrived at the house of the Jewish high priest, he saw the crowd singing hymns and shouting.
He said: "Back off! The girl isn't dead, she's just sleeping."
When the people left, he entered and grabbed the woman by the hand, and she fainted.
And the news of this event spread throughout the region. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus passed by, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Son of David, have mercy on us!"
When Jesus entered the house, two blind men followed him. He asked them, "What do you want me to do for you?" They said, "Lord, we want to see."
Jesus turned away from them and said, "Let it be done to you according to your faith."
And their eyes were opened. And Jesus said to them, "Behold, don't tell anyone!"
But they went out and spread the news in that whole region. Jesus healed a man with leprosy.
When the two blind men were leaving, a group of people came and grabbed one, a devilish creature.
Jesus cast out the devil and the unclean spirit, and it departed, speaking. And they were amazed, saying, "We have never seen anything like this in Israel!"
The Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the chief of demons." Jesus had compassion on the people.
And Jesus traveled through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom of God, and healing every disease and every affliction among the people.
When I saw the people showing compassion to them because they were anxious and tired, like sheep without a shepherd.
And he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
"If you need, ask the owner of the shop to send a worker for his shop."
The Seven Messengers (Mark 3:13-19; Luke 6:12-16)
He called for three disciples and gave them authority over the spirits of disease to cast them out and to heal people of all kinds of ailments and afflictions.
And these are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon, whom they call Peter, and his brother Andrew; James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
And Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew who levy taxes, James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus.
Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who was to betray Jesus. Jesus sent out the seventy (Mark 6:7-13; Luke 9:1-6).
Jesus sent the seventy-two and said to them, "Do not go into any house of the Gentiles, or enter any city of the Samaritans.
Shall we go and seek the lost sheep of the house of Israel?
And ye are machines that bear human form, go forth and say unto the kingdom of heaven, it is at hand.
Heal the sick, evaluate the dead, heal lepers, cast out demons. You received free of charge, give free of charge.
Shake not your garments for gold, nor for silver, nor for brass in your belts.
No need for a bag, or two outfits, or sandals, or a stick, because the servant deserves what you eat.
And in any city or village that you enter, find out who is worthy in it to enter their house and stay with them until you leave.
As they entered the house, they greeted the people inside.
And if this house's aspirations are worth it, let your greetings reach them, but if they are not worth it, your greetings will return to you.
And if anyone does not accept you or does not listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or that city.
"Truly I tell you, the day of judgment will be better for the city of Sodom and Gomorrah than for you!" (Mark 13:9-13; Luke 21:12-17)
We send you like sheep in the midst of wolves, but be alert like owls, and wise like snakes.
They are doing this because of their intention to hand you over to the Jewish council, and to scourge you in their synagogues.
And tremble before rulers and kings for my sake, that you may bear witness before them and before other peoples.
When they hand you over, don't think about how to speak or what to say, for you are at that precise moment when your words will be cut off.
Because it's not you who are speaking, but rather your book speaking in your place.
A father who hands over his son to death, and a son who kills his parents,
And all people will hate you because of my name. But he who endures will be saved.
And when you are persecuted in one city, flee to another; for I tell you, you will not finish going through all the cities of Israel before I, the Son of Man, come.
The student is not greater than his teacher, and the servant is not greater than his master.
"It is enough for the student to be like his teacher and the servant like his master. If the master of the house is called Belzebul, then what will his family be called?" (Luke 12:2-7)
Don't be afraid of them. There's nothing hidden that won't be revealed, and nothing secret that won't be known.
And we will tell you in the darkness, say it in the light. And if it is whispered in your ears, call it out from the rooftops.
And do not fear when they kill the body, but do not grieve, for he is able to destroy both body and soul in hell.
How come two birds can't be bought for a franc? And even if they did fall to the ground, you wouldn't know about it if you didn't have eyes in the sky.
Every strand of your hair is counted.
Don't be afraid, you are better than a bunch of birds!
If people acknowledge me, we acknowledge the Father in heaven.
"But those who deny me in public, I will deny before the Father in heaven." (Jesus and the World, Luke 12:51-53; 14:26-27)
What you have in mind is not what I came to bring, not to bring peace but a sword.
To distinguish between a son and his father, a daughter and her mother, a daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law.
And enemies are the possessions of man so that they may be his desires.
Whoever loves their father or mother more than me doesn't deserve me. Whoever loves their son or daughter more than me doesn't deserve me.
And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
"He who gains his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it." (Mark 9:36-41)
He who accepts you accepts me, and he who accepts me accepts him who sent me.
He who accepts a prophet in the spirit of a prophet will receive a prophet's reward. And he who accepts a righteous man in the spirit of a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward.
And he who gives even a little to his student, like a cold glass of water, is doing the right thing; for his reward will not be lost."
John the Baptist's disciples (Luke 7:18-35)
And when Jesus had finished giving his final instructions to his twelve disciples, he set out for that place in order to teach and preach in the towns of that region.
John, while in prison, heard about the works of Christ. He said to his brother, "Send him with his disciples."
They said: "Are you the one coming, or shall we wait for another?"
Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you have seen and heard."
# Isaiah 35:5-6; 61:1; Luke 4:18-19 The blind shall see, and the lame shall walk; the lepers shall be cleansed, and the deaf shall hear; the dead shall be raised, and the poor shall hear the gospel.
And health to those who don't doubt!"
When his disciples had gone away, Jesus began to speak to the people about John, saying, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A man dressed in loose clothing? For I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John the Baptist."
So, what exactly did you go out to see? To see a man wearing expensive clothes? Those wearing expensive clothes are in the palaces of kings!
So, what exactly did you go out to see? To see a prophet? Yes, and I tell you, he is greater than a prophet.
# Malachi 3:1; Matthew 1:2 This is what is written in the Scriptures: "Behold, I send my messenger before you, who will prepare your way."
You have brought forth a great one, but not one greater than John the Baptist. For he is the least in the kingdom of heaven.
From the days of John the Baptist to this day, the kingdom of heaven is advancing with power, and the strong are taking hold of it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John the Baptist came.
And if you love to believe, it is Elijah who will come.
He who has two ears, let him hear!
How do we compare to this generation? They're like children, standing in the market and shouting at each other:
We sang for you and didn't wander, and we cried for you and didn't grieve.
In John, he neither eats nor drinks, you said, "He is possessed by a demon."
"See, I am sending you out like sheep in the midst of wolves. 'You will have no sign to rely on except the word that is on your lips. 'They will hand you over to councils and beat you in their synagogues; and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles. And when they hand you over, do not worry about how or what to say; for it will be given you in that hour what to say.'" (Luke 10:13-15)
And Jesus began to rebuke the cities where most of his great miracles had been done, but they repented not.
And he said, "Woe to you, Korzin! Woe to you, Sidon! If the great miracles that are done among you were done in Tyre and Sidon, then they would have repented long ago and worn sackcloth and sat on ashes."
But I tell you: The condition of the cities of Tyre and Sidon will be better for you on the Day of Judgment.
And you, Capernaum! Will you ascend to heaven? You will descend to the depths. For if great wonders had been done in you, as were done in Sodom, they would have persisted to this day.
But I tell you: the day of judgment will be worse for Sodom than for you." (Luke 10:21-22)
Jesus spoke at that time and said, "Thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for concealing these things from the wise and understanding and revealing them to the little children."
Yes, Father, that's how it was meant to be.
Father gave me everything. Even one who doesn't know the son, the son was there, and even one who doesn't know the son, the son chose him to show him.
I understand you are tired and burdened, and I am here to help you.
Shake my hand and learn from me that I am kind and my heart is humble, and then you will find peace in your hearts.
"My balance isn't stable and my load is light."
Saturday (Mark 2:23-28; Luke 6:1-5)
At that time, Jesus went through the wheatfields on the Sabbath day, and his disciples were hungry. Seeing this, they began to pluck the ears of wheat and eat them.
When they saw the Pharisees doing that, they said, "Look! Your disciples are doing something that is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
# I Samuel 21:1-6; 2 Samuel 24:9 Then Jesus said to them, "Have you never read what David did? He was hungry, and those who were with him, and he went to the house of God. He ate the bread of the Presence, which is not allowed, except for the priests."
How did he enter his Lord's house, and eat the bread of the offering, when what he ate was not lawful for him or for those with him? Was it lawful for the priests to eat it?
# 28:9-10 Brother, haven't you read in the law how the priests in the temple break the Sabbath commandment on Saturday and no one blames them?
As for our transport: there is one here with a greater structure.
# It is 6:6; Mat 9:13 If you had understood the meaning of this verse: "Love is mercy, not sacrifice." Then you would not have judged those who are not to be judged.
"Ranani ana ibn al-insan huwa Rab al-Sabt." "The man with a paralyzed hand is healed" (Mark 3:1-6; Luke 6:6-11).
And Jesus went into the place, and entered their synagogue.
And there was a man there with a paralyzed leg. The people asked him, "Is it permissible for someone to be healed on the Sabbath day?" in order to find something to accuse him of.
Jesus said to them, "Which of you, if his child or his ox falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, would not lift him out and take him out of the pit?"
And how much more valuable is a human being than his own self! That's why it's permissible to do good on Saturday."
And Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand!" And he stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other hand.
Did the Pharisees go out and plot how to kill Jesus? Jesus is the servant whom God has chosen.
Jesus knew this, and he left that place. And many people followed him, and he healed them all.
And ordered them not to tell anyone about it.
And this happened to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah said:
# Isaiah 42:1-4 How my chosen servant, my beloved in whom my soul delights, will bring forth the fruits of the spirit, to declare justice to the nations.
Neither snarles nor barks, and even if someone were on the street, they wouldn't hear his voice.
A strong spirit cannot be broken, and a burning desire cannot be extinguished. Even if it's gentle, it will prevail.
And the people, if they have hope in his name, Jesus, and Beelzebul (Mark 3:20-30; Luke 11:14-23; 12:10).
And at that time, he brought a man blind and lame, who was possessed by a devil. And Jesus, touching his eyes, made him see and speak.
And all the people were amazed and said, "Is this the son of David?"
But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be destroyed, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil casts out the devil, how can his kingdom stand?
And if Anna goes out to the beaches in Baalzebul, who will your students go out with? That's why they are the ones who will judge you.
But if Anna goes out into the world in the spirit of God, then the kingdom of God will take hold of you.
How can someone enter a strong man's house and steal his belongings, unless they first gain the trust of the strong man, and then they might be able to steal what's in his house?
He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.
That's why I tell you, the sins of people and their unbelief, all of it so that it may be forgiven them, but unbelief in the Holy Spirit is not to be forgiven.
"And whoever says a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever says a word against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come." (Luke 6:43-45)
Either make the tree beautiful and its fruit beautiful, or make the tree unsuccessful and its fruit unsuccessful. The tree is known by its fruit.
Oh sons of the devil, how can you say beautiful words while you are evil? For the tongue speaks what is in the heart.
The beautiful person brings forth beautiful things from their beautiful heart, but the failed person brings forth failed things from their failed heart.
Translation: They tell you: Every empty word people say will be held accountable for on the Day of Judgment.
"By your words, you will be acquitted, and by your words, you will be condemned." (The Pharisees ask for a sign, Mark 8:11-12, Luke 11:29-32)
At that time, some scribes from the Jewish and Pharisee groups came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
Their answer was: "A wicked, sinful generation that perverts a miracle; not even a miracle can be distorted, like the miracle of the Prophet Jonah."
# Matthew 1:17 Just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
# Jonah 3:5 The people of Nineveh will stand up with this generation on the day of judgment and judge it, for they repented at the warning of Jonah, and who is greater than Jonah?
# I 10:1-10; II 9:1-12 And the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the generations of this age and condemn them, for she came from the end of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, there is one greater than Solomon! (Luke 11:24-26)
When the cursed soul leaves the body of a human, it roams to places devoid of water, seeking rest, but finds none.
Time says, "To return to the home I left." And he finds it empty, swept, and organized.
Jesus walked and seven other spirits, more wicked than he, entered and took possession of the man, making his condition worse than before. And thus it is that he increases the wickedness of this evil generation." (Mark 3:31-35; Luke 8:19-21)
And when Jesus was still speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers arrived, and standing outside, they wanted to speak to him.
One said: "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to talk to you."
"But what is the answer the man gave: 'Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?'"
And stretching out his hand towards his students, he said, "These are my mother and brothers."
"Whoever does the will of God in heaven is my brother, my sister, and my mother."
Like the farmer (Mark 4:1-9; Luke 8:4-8)
And Jesus, being a rich man, went out by himself one day, and sat down by the lake.
And a number of people gathered around him, even when he got into a boat, and everyone stood on the shore.
He told them a few things by way of example: "The farmer went out to sow."
And when he was sowing, a seed fell into a crevice, and the birds came and ate it.
There's another seed that fell on ground that had no soil, just rocks. Brother, it grew over time because its soil wasn't much.
When the sun rose, her skin burned and dried up because she had no veins.
Another seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it.
And there was another seed that fell on good soil and sprouted, some brought forth thirtyfold, some sixtyfold, and some a hundredfold.
"He who has ears, let him hear!" Why does Jesus speak in parables? (Mark 4:10-12; Luke 8:9-10)
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
Answer them: "Your delay is to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but they do not delay."
Go get what you have, so you can waste it and have none left. But for those who don't have anything, not even what they have will last.
That's why I speak to them in parables, because they look but do not see, and hear but do not understand.
# Isaiah 6:9-10; Mark 8:18; John 12:39-41; Acts 28:26-27 Fulfilled in them the prophecy of Isaiah, which says: "You will hear but never understand, and you will look but never see."
This people's hearts have become hard, and they have stopped listening and have closed their eyes, so that they do not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their hearts, and they return to me that I may heal them.
Are your eyes open because they see, and your ears open because they hear?
"You have received the truth: Some prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see and hear what you hear, but they did not see or hear." (Interpretation of the Parable of the Sower, Mark 4:13-20; Luke 8:11-15)
Listen then to what is meant by a simile like the farmer:
When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom of God and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart, for what is sown in the thorns is snatched away.
But those who are planted on rocky soil are the ones who hear the word, and as soon as they hear it, they accept it with joy.
He doesn't have veins inside, just wait a little, and when the difficult time or persecution comes because of the word, it will pass with time.
And he who plants himself amidst thorns, he is he who hears the word, but the worries of this world and the love of wealth choke the word, and he leaves without a trace.
"But those who are sown on fertile soil, hear the word, understand it, and bear fruit, some a little, others much: some yield thirtyfold, others sixty, and others a hundredfold." (Parable of the Weeds)
And Jesus said to them a parable again: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed a fine seed in his field.
When people are sleeping, the enemy comes, sows weeds among the wheat, and goes away.
And when the seed sprouted and grew into wheat, the weeds grew with it.
The servants of the lord of the land came and said, "O our lord, brother, have you not sown a fine seed in your land? Then, where did the weeds come from?"
He said to them: "One of my enemies did this." The servants said: "Then don't you want us to go and sweep the dust?"
He said, "No, don't harvest the wheat until you've gathered the wild grass."
Let the wheat and the tares grow together until the harvest, and at that time we shall say, 'Gather the tares first and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.'" » Like the mustard seed and the leaven (Mark 4:30-32; Luke 13:18-19)
And He gave them another parable, and said, "The kingdom of heaven is like the seed of a mustard plant, which a man took and sowed in his field.
She is the smallest of all the plants, but when she grows up, she becomes the largest of all the greenery, and even a tree, to the point that the sky's birds come and nest in her.»
And another said, "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until it had made all the dough leavened."
Jesus spoke to the people in parables. He never taught them anything without using a parable.
# 78:2 This is what the Prophet said would happen: "So that my mouth speaks in parables, and I declare hidden things, the mysteries of creation." Interpretation of the parable of the mustard seed.
Then Jesus made his disciples go into the house, and he entered and sat down. And his disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds."
Answer them: "He who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man."
And the field is the world, and the good seed are the children of the Kingdom of God, and the tares are the children of the wicked one.
The enemy who sowed them is Satan, the harvest is the end of time, and the reapers are the angels.
And just as grass withers and is burned by fire, so it will be in the last days.
"Anna, the Son of Man, shall send my angels, who shall gather the wicked and do evil in my kingdom."
They throw them into the fire, where there will be wailing and the cries of ages.
"And at that time, the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their dreams. He who has ears, let him hear!" Like a treasure, a diamond, and a net.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and, in his joy, he went and sold all that he had and bought the field.
The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine jewels.
If he found a valuable piece of gold, he sold everything he had and bought it.
The kingdom of the heavens is like a net that they cast into the sea, and it catches all kinds of fish.
When they were full, they went out to sea as fishermen, sat down, and placed the beautiful fish in boxes, but the ugly one they threw away.
And thus it shall be in the last days: the angels shall come and separate the wicked from among the righteous.
They throw them into the fire, and the next will be the crying of the ages." The new and the old.
And Jesus said to his disciples, "Do you understand all these things?" And they said, "Yes."
And He said to them, "That is why every scribe who is trained in the kingdom of heaven is like a household manager who brings out new and old things from his treasury."
And when Jesus had finished this parable, he went away from that place.
And when his country began to teach them in their assemblies, they were amazed and said, "From where did this man come with such wisdom and miracles?"
Brother, isn't he the carpenter's son? Brother, isn't his mother's name Mary? And his brothers aren't Jacob, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
"And where are all his daughter's wives? How did this man get all this?"
And thus they were doubting him. But Jesus said to them: "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own house."
And no miracles will work for them because they do not believe in them.
The death of John the Baptist (Mark 6:14-29; Luke 9:7-9)
At that time, King Herod heard the reports about Jesus.
And he said to his disciples: "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and that is why he is performing miracles."
Before Herod, John was arrested and imprisoned because of Herodias, Philip's step-mother.
Because of John, they said, "You must not take it."
And they wanted to kill him, but they feared for the people, for they thought John was a prophet.
When Herod's birthday feast was held, Herodias' daughter danced at the party, and pleased Herod so much that he promised her anything she wanted.
That's why he promised her and swore to give her anything she asks for.
As her mother's counsel, she said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter!"
And the king was grieved, for he had made a vow to do what she desired, because of the oath he had taken and the guests.
And sent a messenger, and had John's head brought to him in prison.
They put their heads on a plate and gave it to the girl, man, they shook their mother's.
The disciples of John saw and they shook the dead body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed five thousand men (Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-14).
When Jesus heard this, he left that place in a boat and went to a deserted place by himself. But when the people heard about him, they followed him, walking from the towns.
When the ship docked, he saw some people, so he went to them and healed their sick.
In the evening, his disciples came to him and said, "The day is over, and this place is deserted. Send people to go into the villages and buy something to eat."
Jesus said, "They don't need to walk. Give them something to eat."
They said: "We had five loaves of bread and two fish."
Jesus said, "Bring them here to me."
And he commanded the people to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples, who in turn gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. And they shook the basket, which was full to the brim.
And the number of those who ate was about five thousand men, not including women and children. Jesus walked on water (Mark 6:45-52; John 6:15-21).
And then he ordered his students to get on the boat and row to the opposite side of the lake, while he himself sent people to go.
And after the people left, he went up alone to the mountain to pray. And after the sun set, he was returning alone.
At that time, the boat was far out at sea, struggling against the waves, because the wind was blowing against it.
And before dawn, Jesus came to them, walking on the water.
But the disciples were afraid when they saw him walking on the water, and said, "This is a ghost!" and began to cry out in fear.
Jesus spoke to them at that time, saying, "Be of good cheer. I am he; do not be afraid!"
Peter answered, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water, following Jesus.
As the wind grew stronger, he was afraid, his brother began to sink, and he cried out: "Oh Lord, save me!"
As the time was drawing near, Jesus stretched out his hand and said, "Whoever has faith, let them say, 'My faith is weak; why have I doubted?'"
As they set sail on these boats, the wind died down.
But while he was in the boat, they prostrated themselves and said, "You are the Son of God!" Jesus healed many who had various diseases (Mark 6:53-56).
Jesus and his disciples went to that place in the region of Gennesaret.
And when my hopes for this land were fulfilled, they came to know Jesus, and they spread the news about him throughout this region, bringing all the sick people to him.
They asked me to let them stay until the end of their shift, and I did. They all left satisfied.
The Legacy of the Ancestors (Mark 7:1-13)
The Pharisees and the scribes from Jerusalem came to Jesus, and said:
Why don't your students respect the customs of the elders? And don't wash their hands when they eat?
Answer them: "Why don't you obey God's command and stick to your traditions?"
# Gen 20:12; Deut 5:16; Gen 21:17; Lev 20:9 God said, "Honor your father and your mother, and whoever curses his father or his mother shall surely die."
What you're saying is, if someone says to their parent or grandparent, "I used to help you, but now I've given it to God," they don't feel the need to honor their parents.
Thus you make the word of God of no effect by your traditions.
O hypocrites, the words of Isaiah have been fulfilled in you, as he prophesied against you:
# Isaiah 29:13 This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
"It is in vain that they worship me, teaching the commandments of men. For they do not honor me, but only teach for the sake of men's precepts." (Mark 7:14-23)
And Jesus called the people to him and said to them, "Listen and understand."
"The mouse that enters the mouth defiles a person, but it is the one that comes out of the mouth that defiles a person."
Then his disciples came and said, "Master, do you know that the Pharisees are taking offense at these words?"
Answer them: "Every tree that has not its roots in the sky will be uprooted."
Get away from them! They're driving blind, and if a blind man is driving another blind man, they'll both fall into a pit."
Then Peter said, "Explain this parable to us."
And Jesus said, "Brothers, do you not yet understand?"
Brother, whenever anything goes into the mouth, it goes to the stomach, and whatever comes out of the body, it's waste.
Is it not the need to speak from the mouth that comes from the heart, and this is what defiles man?
The heart is where evil thoughts, murder, adultery, corruption, theft, perjury, and apostasy come from.
These are the things that defile a person. It is not the food that enters one's mouth but the spirit that defiles." (Mark 7:24-30, Faith of the Canaanite Woman)
And Jesus went through the region, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every affliction among the people.
And a woman from that place, a Canaanite, came up to him and said, "Lord, son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is possessed by a demon, and it torments her severely."
But he didn't answer her a single word. His students came and begged him, saying: "Give her to whoever she wants, just get her away from us, she's following us and screaming!"
Jesus answered, "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
And she came and alighted before him, and said, "O my lord, help me!"
Answer: "It's not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
She said: "Yes, sir! Even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table."
Jesus answered her, "Woman, your faith is great! Let it be done to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed at that very moment. Jesus healed many people.
And Jesus walked on the sea, and passed by on the shore of the lake of Galilee. And he got into the boat, and sat down, and taught the people from the boat.
Some people came with them bringing along the disabled, the blind, the deaf, the mute, and others, and they placed them before his feet, and he healed them.
And the people were amazed, as they saw the blind receiving their sight, the lame walking, the paralyzed rising, and the mute speaking. And they glorified God in Israel. Jesus fed four thousand men (Mark 8:1-10).
And Jesus called his disciples and said to them, "Behold, the people are with me now for three days without food, and I am not willing to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."
And the disciples said, "Where shall we get bread in this desert to satisfy all these people?"
And Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven loaves and a few small fish."
And Jesus commanded the people to sit on the ground.
Take the seven loaves and the fish, give thanks, and distribute them to the disciples; and the disciples shall give them to the people.
They all ate until they were full, and shook off the remaining seven large, full baskets.
The ones who fought were four thousand men, excluding women and children.
And after the people had sent away the spirit, they went up into the boat and sailed to the region of Magdala.
The signs of the times (Mark 8:11-13; Luke 12:54-56)
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, and they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
Jesus answered them, "When evening comes, you will say, 'It is fine weather because the sky is red.'"
In the morning, you say, "It's going to rain today, because the sky is a dark red." You know how to interpret the state of the sky, but you don't know how to interpret the signs of time.
A wicked and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign shall be given them, not even a sign of Jonah." And he left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees (Mark 8:14-21)
As they reached the opposite shore, they forgot to bring bread with them.
Jesus said to them, "Wake up, and take heed to yourselves from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students discussed among themselves and said, "That's because we have no bread."
Did Jesus know this and say, "If your faith is weak, why do you argue among yourselves and say, 'We have no bread'?
Bro, didn't you understand? Bro, don't you remember the five loaves that were shared among the five thousand, and how much of a big basket was left over after everyone had their fill?
And what about the seven loaves of the four thousand? How much of a large basket did you fill?
How can you not understand that I'm not talking about bread? Answer with the amount of yeast from the Pharisees and Sadducees!
At that time, they understood that he was telling them not to follow the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees, but to avoid the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter testified that Jesus is the Christ (Mark 8:27-30; Luke 9:18-21).
When Jesus came to Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "What do people say about the Son of Man?"
They answered: "Some say you are John the Baptist, others say you are Elijah, and still others say you are Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
He said to them, "Who are you saying I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
And Jesus said, "Well done, Simon, son of Jonah! It is not flesh and blood that has revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
And I tell you: You are Peter, which means a large stone, and on this stone I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
"To give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and that whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
At that time, Jesus instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus revealed for the first time his death and resurrection (Mark 8:31; 9:1; Luke 9:22-27).
And at that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer at the hands of the elders, the priests, and the scribes of the Jews, and be killed, and on the third day rise again.
Peter shook Jesus by the side and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far be it from you, Lord! Such a thing cannot happen to you at all!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, because you are thinking not as God thinks, but as humans do."
At that time, Jesus said to his disciples: "If anyone wishes to follow me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me.
He who wants to save his life will lose it, but he who loses his life for my sake will gain it.
What is the benefit to man if he gains the whole world but loses his life? What is it that man would give up his life for?
I, Anna, the human, will live with my angels in the glory of my Father's house, and that is when every person will be judged for what they have done.
They have been told the truth: Those who are standing here are not about to see death before they see me, the Son of Man, coming into my kingdom."
Jesus shows his glory to his disciples (Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36)
And after six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
And they turned before them, and the light shone like the sun, and they became dusted and turned white like light.
And Moses and Elijah appeared to them, speaking of Jesus.
And Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, how beautiful this place is! If you wish, I can set up three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And as he was still speaking, a dark cloud covered them, and the voice of the cloud said, "This is my beloved son, whom I love, and I am glad because of him. Hear his words!"
As they heard this, the students fell to their faces and were a little afraid.
Jesus came to them and said, "Rise up, do not be afraid."
And when they opened their eyes, they saw Jesus alone.
And when they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, "Do not tell anyone about what you have seen until the Son of Man rises from the dead."
The students asked him: "Why does the Jewish book say that Elijah must come first?"
Answer them: "Indeed, Elijah will come and restore everything."
But if we bring you to Elijah, and they do not recognize him, will they do to him as they pleased? And I, the Son of Man, have come to be their suffering."
At that time, the disciples understood what he had been telling them about John the Baptist. Jesus healed a boy possessed by a demon (Mark 9:14-29; Luke 9:37-43).
And when Jesus and his disciples came to the people, a man came up and knelt before him, saying:
Oh Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is tormented and suffers greatly, always falling into fire and water.
"And when you bring them to your students, they won't be able to heal it."
Jesus answered and said, "You corrupt generation, seeking for a sign! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here!"
Jesus cast out the demon, and it departed from him. And the boy was healed at that very hour.
At that time, Jesus' disciples came to him privately and asked, "Why can't we bring him out?"
He said to them, "Because of your little faith! If you had faith as small as a mustard seed, you would say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it would move; and nothing would be impossible for you."
# 17:21 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: "This kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting." Jesus speaks again about death and resurrection (Mark 9:30-32; Luke 9:43-45).
When the disciples were gathered together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men."
"They're trying to kill me, and we'll rise on the third day." "Bro, don't worry too much. Jesus is paying the temple taxes."
As they were going to Capernaum, they came upon collectors of the temple tax. They asked Jesus, "Shouldn't our teacher pay the temple tax?"
Answer: "Yes." And when he came to the house, Jesus went before him and said, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do kings of the earth collect toll and taxes? From their own children or from foreigners?"
Peter said, "I am from Galilee." Jesus replied, "So are all true sons of the land free.
"But we don't want to cause them any trouble, so go to the lake and cast your line. Catch whatever comes first, and when you open its mouth, you'll find a good amount of silver coins, enough to pay for both you and me, take it and settle our taxes."
