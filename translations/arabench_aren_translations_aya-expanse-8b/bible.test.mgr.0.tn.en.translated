Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? (Mark 9:33-37; Luke 9:46-48)
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
And Jesus called a little child to him, and set him in the midst of them.
And He said: "You shall not enter the Kingdom of Heaven unless you attend to the little ones, just as you would to your own children."
Whoever humbles himself and becomes like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
A small child accepts me like this because my name accepts me.
But what could be a stumbling block for someone from these troubled times, if a large millstone were to fall on his neck and he were thrown into the heart of the sea?
Oh, Willow, what strange things make people commit sins! It's these things that have to come, but oh, woe to the human who brings the things that make people sin!
And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away; for it is better for you to enter into eternal life with one hand or one foot missing than to have both your hands and feet and be thrown into eternal fire.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away; it is better for you to enter eternal life without one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell. (Luke 15:3-7)
"Respond with kindness, do not belittle anyone from these children. We tell you: the angels are always watching their father in the sky."
# 18:11 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: "Behold, I, the Son of Man, have come to save the lost."
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them gets lost, won't he leave the ninety-nine on the mountain and go look for the one that is lost?
You will be amply rewarded, if you find it, more than ninety-nine who have not lost it.
"If you do not forgive others, your Father in heaven will not forgive you either." (Matthew 6:14)
If your brother wrongs you, walk away and tell him his mistake between you, and if he listens to you, you will have won your brother.
If he does not hear your words, shake one or two others with you, so that every word spoken is witnessed by two or three witnesses.
If someone doesn't want to listen to their words, tell the church, and if they still don't want to listen to the church's words, then consider how someone who is not a believer or a follower might act.
We give you the truth: what you tie to the earth will be tied in the sky, and what you untie on earth will be untied in the sky.
Put it simply: If any of you agree on something they want from the earth, God in heaven will make it happen for them.
"When two or three gather in my name, there I am among them." Like a servant who does not forgive.
At that time, Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Seven times?"
Jesus said, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven."
That's why the Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who accounts for his servants.
They are accountable among them, but he just takes money without accounting for it.
As their time was up, Sirou was ordered to sell himself, his wife, his children, and all his possessions to pay off his debts.
Oh brother, the servant slipped on his own feet and said: "Sir, sir, be patient with me and I will serve you in everything!"
He laughed at Sidu and Sibu and forgave them for their faith.
But that servant, seeing another servant, asked him for a little money. The other servant, choking with anger, said, "Get me out of this debt!"
My brother, the other servant fell on his knees and begged, saying, "Be patient with me, and I will free you."
And he refused and walked away, and they put him in prison until he could settle his debt.
They told the other servants what had happened, they were a bit worried and went to inform their master of everything.
At that time, the master called him and said, "O evil slave! I have forgiven you all this debt because you have humbled yourself."
"And you are not entitled to show mercy to your servant like I have shown mercy to you?"
And Sidu schemed, and he surrendered to the responsible authority until he paid off all his debts.
Thus said the Father in heaven, so that he may work with each of you, if he does not forgive his brother from his heart.
Marriage and Divorce (Mark 10:1-12)
As Jesus finished speaking, he left Galilee and entered Judea by way of the Jordan.
And a number of people followed him, and they were healed on their way.
A group of Pharisees came and tested him, saying, "Teacher, is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Answer them: "Brother, didn't you read that the One who created them in the first place created them as female and male."
# Gen 1:27; 2:24; Matt 5:31; Gal 6:16 He said, "Why should a man leave his father and mother and be united to his wife as one flesh?"
"If they are not two, but one body, then what God unites, man does not separate."
# Matt 24:1-4 The Pharisees said, "Why did Moses command that a man should give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus said to them, "Moses allowed you to put away your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not so from the beginning."
And we tell you: whoever divorces his wife for a reason other than adultery and then marries another woman, he is committing adultery."
The students said, "If this is how the man treats his wife, it would be better if he never got married."
He said to them, "Not all people will accept this speech, but only those whom God wishes to guide will accept it."
There are some who cannot get married when they are born, and there are some whose parents have done something to prevent them from marrying, and there are some who do not want to marry because of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can do this, let them do it." (Jesus blessing the little children, Mark 10:13-16; Luke 18:15-17)
They brought little children to Jesus, that he might lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked those who brought them.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
And he put his hand on them and passed by. The rich man (Mark 10:17-31; Luke 18:18-30)
There was one who asked: "Teacher, what are the most important things I need to do to obtain eternal life?"
Jesus said, "Why do you ask me about the hard things? Is there one hard thing? If you want to enter eternal life, keep the commandments."
# Ex 20:12-16; Deut 5:16-20 They said, "Have these things been taught to us?" Jesus replied, "Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness,
# Do 19:18 Honor your father and your mother, and love your neighbor as yourself. »
The boy said, "I can do all of these things, what else do I need?"
Jesus said, "If you want to be perfect, go sell all that you have and give it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me!"
As the boy heard this, he walked sadly, having a lot on his mind.
And Jesus said to his disciples, "It is harder for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle!"
And I tell you again: it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
As the disciples heard this, they were amazed and said, "Then who can be saved?"
But Jesus, looking at them, said, "For humans, this is impossible, but for God, all things are possible."
At that time Peter answered, "We have left everything and followed you. What shall we receive?"
Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth: whoever receives me will receive glory, and will sit on a throne, as I myself received glory to sit on the throne of my Father in the world to come. You, however, will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
And whoever is alone, without brothers or sisters, or father or mother, or children, or property, for the sake of my name, will receive a hundredfold in return, and inherit eternal life.
"A few people at the beginning so that they become at the end, and those at the end so that they become at the beginning."
Like the servants of a vineyard
The way to the Kingdom of Heaven is like a master who early in the morning goes out to his vineyard to set his servants to work.
He agreed with the servants on a fair price for the silverware in the morning and sent them with a basket of grapes.
And he left with the nine, my brother, he saw another group standing in the market, unemployed.
And he said to them: "You go and tread the grapevines, and you will receive your wages; go, my friends."
And he went out again about noon, and separated from the three companions of the evening, and did the same.
And he left with the five for the evening meal, and he met other people sitting, and he said to them, "Why are you sitting here doing nothing all day?"
They said: "Not one of you stopped us from working." He told them: "You go and work in the vineyard."
As evening fell, the steward of the grapes said to the one who was idly watching the servants: Call the servants and set them free, bring the last two until they reach the governor.
The group that started working with the five from the evening each received a small amount of silver.
When the new rulers arrived, they had it in mind to take more than the others, but each of them took a moderate amount of silver.
And when they finish, they will cover the grapevines.
And they said, "These two here worked for just one hour, while we worked the whole day in the heat!"
One of them replied: "My friend, I haven't wronged you. Didn't we agree on a fair price for that silver?"
Take what's yours and leave. I loved to give the other person this, just as I give you.
"Brother, do I not have the right to spend my money however I please? Are you jealous because I'm generous?"
And Jesus said, "Shall not the last be first, and the first last?" For three times Jesus spoke of his death and resurrection (Mark 10:32-34; Luke 18:31-34).
As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the two disciples aside and said to them on the way,
Hannah is going up to Jerusalem, and I, the Son of Man, am being delivered into the hands of the chief priests and scribes of the Jews, so that they may sentence me to death.
They handed me over to the other nations, so they could mock me, whip me, and crucify me; and on the third day I will rise." This is what Jacob and John asked for (Mark 10:35-45).
And she came to him with her children, and she prostrated herself before him and asked him for something.
And Jesus said to her, "What do you wish?" She said, "I wish that my two sons would sit, one on your right and the other on your left, in your kingdom."
Jesus answered, "Do you not understand what you are asking? Can you drink from my cup, and I will drink from yours?" They said, "Yes."
He told them: "You are the ones who will drink from my cup, but I am not the one who decides who sits to my right and left. It is the host who has invited these people to this place."
And when the ten other disciples heard this, they were ashamed of the two brothers.
But Jesus called them and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles rule over them, and their great ones exercise power over them.
You don't need that thing between you. If anyone among you wants to be great, let them be a servant to you.
And whoever loves to be first among you, let him be a servant to all.
"Even I, the Son of Man, did not come to be served, but to serve and to give my life as a ransom for many." Jesus heals two blind men (Mark 10:46-52; Luke 18:35-43)
And when Jesus and his disciples had left Jericho, a great crowd followed them.
There were two blind men sitting by the road, and when they heard Jesus passing by, they began to cry out, saying, "Master, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
The people shouted at them to be quiet. But they shouted even more: "O our Lord, son of David, have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood up and called them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
They said: "O our Lord, we would love to come back and see!"
Jesus had compassion on them, and he touched their eyes, and immediately they could see and followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem (Mark 11:1-11; Luke 19:28-40; John 12:12-19)
As Jesus and his disciples neared Jerusalem, they arrived at the village of Bethphage, which is near the Mount of Olives. At that time, Jesus sent two disciples ahead.
And he said to them: "Go to the village opposite you, and you will find a beast tied up, with a donkey beside it; untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says something to you, answer: "The Lord has their request." And then send them away with time.
This happened so that what the Prophet said would come to pass.
# Isaiah 62:11; Zakariah 9:9 "Tell the daughter of Zion: 'Behold, your king comes to you, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'"
The two disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them.
They led the donkey and the colt to him, laid their cloaks on them, and Jesus mounted.
Most people had spread straw on the road, while others had cut branches and laid them across the path.
# Psalm 118:26; Luke 2:14; Matthew 21:15; 23:39 and the people who went before him and followed after him cried out: "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"
As Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city asked, "Who is this?"
And the people said, "Behold, this is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus drove out the money changers from the temple (Mark 11:15-19; Luke 19:45-48; John 2:13-22).
And Jesus entered the Temple of God, and drove out all who sold and bought in the Temple, turning over the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.
# Isaiah 56:7; 7:11 And he said unto them, "It is written in the Scriptures: 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of thieves!"
The blind and the lame came to him, and he healed them.
Did the priests and scribes of the Jews deny what they saw Jesus do, the miracles, and how the little children in the temple cried out, "Hosanna to the Son of David!"
# Mat 8:2 And they said unto him, "Tell us, do you hear what they are saying?" And Jesus said to them, "Yes, have you never read the scripture, 'Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have established praise for yourself?'"
And he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there. Jesus cursed the fig tree (Mark 11:12-14, 20-24)
And as he was returning to the city in the morning, Jesus was hungry.
He saw a vine by the side of the road, and thinking nothing of it, he plucked some leaves and said, "You'll never bear fruit!" And the vine withered over time.
The students were amazed as they discovered what had happened and said, "Why did the vine wither in the heat?"
Jesus answered them, "You speak right. If you have faith and do not doubt in your hearts, whatever you ask, you will receive. For whatever you do to the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you do it to me."
"Whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours." - Jesus' authority (Mark 11:27-33; Luke 20:1-8)
As Jesus entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him while he was teaching, and they said, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered them, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? From heaven or from humans?" "Brothers, understand one another: If we say it came 'from heaven,' they will ask, 'Then why didn't they believe?'"
But if we say, "From the people," we fear for their safety, for they are all convinced that John is a prophet.
Then Jesus answered them, "I tell you the truth, I do not know who you are." And they said, "How can you say that? You are the Christ, the Son of the Living God!" Jesus said to them, "Even if I wanted to tell you, it would not be my authority to do so."
What do you think? There's a man who has two sons. He went to the first and said, "My son, go work today in the vineyard."
My brother answered: "I'm not going." Then he regretted it and left.
And the other walked to Luldou and they said the same thing they said to the first Luldou, "Brother, answer: 'Here I am, sir!'" But he didn't walk.
"Who are the brothers who do what their father loves?" the elders asked. Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth: those who collect taxes and live immorally will enter the Kingdom of God before you."
John came in the name of a righteous man, but you did not believe him. But those who collect taxes and live in sin believed him. Even when you saw it with your own eyes, you did not believe or accept him." (Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard, Mark 12:1-12; Luke 20:9-19)
Listen well: There was a man who planted a vine of grapes, surrounded it with a wall, built a press in it, made a watchtower and separated it into five parts, and went to other countries.
As the time for the grapes to ripen approached, the servant sent his men to the vineyard to gather the harvest.
They seized the servant's five donkeys, beat one of them, killed another, and stoned a third.
And the steward of the grapes sent servants again, even more than he had sent them the first time; and they did the same to them.
Send them away and say, "You can take care of my children."
When they killed the boy on Friday, they said to each other: "This is the one who will inherit! Let's kill him and take his inheritance!"
They dragged him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
"If I were to die at the moment when the grapevines are ripe, what would you do with this Friday?"
The elders of the Jews said, "So that these wicked ones may be killed, and that the cluster of grapes be given to the other five, to whom the grape harvest shall be given at its proper time."
# Matt 11:22-23; Mark 4:11; John 2:7 Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone which the builders rejected is now the corner stone, and the most precious of the stones? The Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes.' "
That is why I tell you: the kingdom of God is like a seed that someone sows on the ground. It grows and bears fruit, and the yield is a hundredfold.
# 21:44 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: Behold, I am the Son of Man who has come to save the lost.
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard these parables, they understood that these things were spoken to them.
As they tried to capture him, they feared the people, for they considered him a prophet.
Like a king's feast (Luke 14:15-24)
And Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepares a feast for his son's wedding.
The servants were sent to call the invitees for the wedding night vigil, but they were not there.
And he sent other servants again, saying, "Tell those invited: Hanai has come, and the feast is ready; the fat cattle and the fatted sheep are killed, and all things are prepared. Come to the wedding feast!"
They didn't account for the overtime, and they left on their own. One went to his shop, and another went to his store.
And others seized their servants, humiliated them, and killed them.
The king conspired and sent his soldiers to kill those criminals and burn down their city.
The watchman told his servants: "The night shift has arrived, but the summoned ones do not deserve it.
Go out into the streets and invite as many people as possible for the evening reception of the wedding.
And those servants, you know, went out into the streets and gathered all kinds of people, the proud and the humble, until the house of the wedding was filled with guests.
When the king was about to receive the guests, he saw a man not dressed in royal attire. "My brother," they said to him.
How did you get here without wedding attire? The man just kept quiet.
At that time, the king said to his servants: "Strip him of his hands and feet, and throw him into the darkness, to weep in the coming years."
"They are calling many, but choosing only a few." (Mark 12:13-17; Luke 20:20-26)
At that time, the Pharisees went and plotted how they might seize Jesus by word.
And they sent their disciples to Him, with a party from the party of Herod, saying, "Teacher, we know that You are truthful, and that You teach the way of God with truth, and that You care for no one, for You do not regard the position of men."
We said, "What do you think? Should we pay taxes to the emperor or not?"
But Jesus, seeing their wickedness, said to them, "You hypocrites! Why do you try to tempt me?"
"Show me the tax money!" "Hey, they gave me a nice pile of silver."
Jesus said to them, "Whose image and name is this?"
They said, "The emperor's goods!" He replied to them, "But give the emperor's goods to the emperor, and God's goods to God!"
And they were amazed when they heard these words, and went away, leaving him alone. Rising from the dead (Mark 12:18-27; Luke 20:27-40)
During the day, these Sadducees came to Jesus, presenting a question, saying that there is no resurrection after death, and they asked him a question.
# 25:5 And they said, "Master, Moses said, 'If one dies without children, his brother shall take his wife and beget children for his brother.'"
And there were seven brothers among us. The first son got married, but he died without children, and his wife was taken by his brother.
The same thing happened to the second, third, and so on, up to the seventh.
And after them, everyone, the woman died.
"If only on the Day of Judgment, that woman will be as bitter as she is now towards them, because she married them all."
Jesus answered them, "You are wrong, for you have not understood the Scriptures or the power of God."
On the Day of Judgment, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.
And as if you were at the Resurrection, consider the things of the dead. Brother, have you not read what Allah says to you?
# 3:6 "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; he is not a god of the dead, but the God of the living."
As the people heard these words, they marveled at his teaching. Great is the kingdom of God, says Jesus, for it is like a mustard seed (Mark 12:28-34; Luke 10:25-28).
As they heard the Pharisees say that he had silenced the Sadducees, they came together.
And one of them, a scholar of Islamic law, asked a question to test:
"O teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the law?"
# Matthew 6:5 Jesus answered, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.
This is the first and greatest commandment.
# No. 19:18; Mat. 19:19; Luke 5:14; John 13:9; 2 Peter 2:8. The second commandment is like this: "Love your neighbor as yourself."
"The whole of the Law and the Prophets are founded on these two commandments." (Mark 12:35-37; Luke 20:41-44)
When the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question:
What do you think about Christ? Who was he born to? They said, "He was born to David!"
He said to them, "How can David call him 'Lord' when his spirit is departed?"
# 110:1; 2:34-35; 1:13; 10:13 My Lord said to my master: "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies bow down at your feet."
If David calls him 'our Lord', then how could his son be?
Not a single person could come up with an answer. From that day on, no one felt encouraged to ask any questions.
Jesus warns about the scribes and Pharisees from the book (Mark 12:38-40; Luke 11:37-52; 20:45-47).
And Jesus said to the people and to his disciples:
The book of the Jews and the Pharisees is sitting on Moses' chair.
If only you would act and keep everything they tell you. You don't do things the way they do, because they say so and don't do it themselves.
They impose a heavy burden on people's shoulders, but they never touch it with their fingers.
They do all sorts of things so that people will notice them, they grow big in their robes and lengthen the troubles in their clothing.
They love to sit in the front rows of soirées and in the first chairs of gatherings.
People love to greet them in the markets, calling out to them, "O teachers!"
Do not let anyone call you "teachers," for you are all brothers and have but one teacher.
And do not say to even one on earth, 'My father,' for you have only one Father in heaven.
And do not let anyone say to you, 'My Lord,' for you have only one Lord, namely Christ.
And let your elders serve you.
He who rises from his spirit descends, and he who humbles himself is exalted.
Woe to you, hypocritical Pharisees and scribes of the Jews! You shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces, preventing them from entering, while yourselves you neither enter nor allow those who would enter to go in.
# 23:14 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: "Woe to you, O Jews, and you hypocritical Pharisees! You pervert women into men, taking their homes and claiming to be longer in prayer. That is why your account will be great before God."
Woe unto you, Jews and hypocritical Pharisees! You tear apart the sea and the land to enter into your religion, and whoever enters will be thrown into hell, twice as much as you!
Woe unto you, O blind elders! You who say, "He who swears by the temple is not bound, but he who swears by the gold of the temple is bound."
Is it Anna who has more value, you ignorant and blind? Gold or the structure that returns the gold sacred?
And you say: "He who swears by the altar is not bound by anything, but he who swears by the sacrifice on the altar is bound by his oath."
Is it Anna who has more value, O blind ones? Is the sacrifice or the altar that receives the sacrifice holy?
If he swears by the altar, he's swearing by it and everything above it!
And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and by him who dwells in it.
And he swears by the sky, he swears by the throne, and by God who sits upon it.
Woe unto you, Jewish book-learned and hypocritical Pharisees! You give tithes of mint and dill and neglect the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faith. You ought to have done these and not left the rest untouched.
You blind people lead others astray! You strain at gnats and swallow camels.
Woe unto you, Jews, and you hypocritical Pharisees! Wash the outside of the cup and the plate, but within they are full of extortion and greed.
Oh, Pharisee, oh blind man! First wash the cup and the plate inside out so that they are clean from the outside as well.
Woe unto you, Jews and hypocritical Pharisees! How are the graves that are painted white, looking beautiful from the outside, but inside they are full of the bones of the dead and all sorts of filth.
And you, when seen from the outside, appear righteous to people, but within you are full of hypocrisy and evil.
O book of the Jews and hypocritical Pharisees! You dwell in the tombs of the prophets and adorn yourselves with the domes of the righteous saints,
And you say, "We were present during the time of our ancestors, but we did not participate in the killing of the prophets."
Here is the translation of the given text: "Be witnesses to your own souls, you offspring who killed the prophets."
Either you uphold the balance of your ancestors or you abandon it.
Oh you sons of the devil, how will you escape the judgment of the torment of Hell?
That is why I send you prophets, wise men, and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify, some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and drive them from city to city.
# Gen 4:8; Ps 11:4; Mal 1:1; 24:21 So all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of Abel, the righteous, to the blood of Zechariah the son of Berechiah, whom you killed between the temple and the altar, will come upon you.
"It is your duty: these miserable ones are all for this generation!" - Jesus' love for Jerusalem (Luke 13:34-35)
"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those sent to you, how many times have I desired to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings. But you have not wanted."
This way to keep you confused.
"I'll tell you this: you won't see me again until the time comes when you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'"
Jesus speaks of the destruction of the temple (Mark 13:1-2; Luke 21:5-6)
Jesus left the temple. As he was walking away, he left his disciples and went to the Mount of Olives.
He said to them, "Have you seen all this? I tell you the truth, not even a stone will remain here on top of another; everything will be thrown down." (The Disaster and Persecution - Mark 13:3-13; Luke 21:7-19)
While he was sitting on Mount Olives, his disciples came to him on the side and said, "We ask you, when will these things happen, and what will be the signs of your coming and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered them, "Repay them not, but love your enemies.
Many people will come in my name, saying, "I am Christ," and they will deceive many.
And when you hear of wars and disturbances in distant lands, do not be afraid. For this is something that must happen, but it is not the end.
For where there is envy and strife, there will be disorder and every evil practice. Nations will rise against nations, and kingdoms against kingdoms; there will be famines, earthquakes, and great troubles in various places.
This is just the beginning of the birthing process.
And that time will shake you with tribulation and kill you, and all the nations will hate you because of My name.
And at that time, many people stopped believing in July, betrayed each other, and hated each other.
And some false prophets will appear, and they will deceive many people.
And the majority of people's things no longer evoke love because the evil that prevails is too much.
What proves to be true for one may be different for another.
And the gospel of the Kingdom of God is to be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a witness to all nations, and then the end will come." (Great Destruction, Mark 13:14-23; Luke 21:20-24)
# 9:27; 11:31; 12:11 "And at that time you will see the 'abomination of desolation' about which the prophet Daniel spoke, standing in the holy place (let him who reads understand)."
That time caused those in Judaism to flee to the mountains.
Leave what's on top of the surface, don't lower the weight to shake the things in his house.
And let whoever is in the street not return to pick up his coat.
Woe to them who are pregnant and nursing during these days.
Ask your Lord if you flee in a day that is not winter nor Saturday.
Because at that time there was a lot of distress, it didn't happen from the beginning of the world until now.
And if God had not been generous with you during those days, no one would have survived. He did not shorten their lives because of the people He chose.
And if someone says to you, "Behold, the Christ is here," or "He is coming," do not believe it!
So that many people may appear as the Antichrist and false prophets, performing great and miraculous deeds to deceive even the chosen ones, if possible.
Hani has warned you before.
If they say to you, "Behold, the Christ is in the wilderness!" do not go out. If they say to you, "Behold, he is in the inner rooms," do not believe it!
Like how lightning flashes from the east and lights up the west, so will I, the Son of Man, appear.
"Wherever there is a carcass, there the eagles will gather." - Human Son (Mark 13:24-27; Luke 21:25-28)
# Revelation 8:12; Isaiah 13:10; Ezekiel 32:7; 2 Peter 1:10-11; Psalm 1:15 "In the time of these calamities, the sun will be darkened and the moon will lose its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly powers will be shaken."
And at that time the signs of my Son, the Human, will appear in the sky, and all the kingdoms of the earth will mourn, and all will see me, the Human, coming on the clouds of the sky in power and great glory.
And when the Son of Man comes in his glory, accompanied by his angels, he will sound a trumpet, and they will gather his elect from the four corners of the earth, from the end of the world to the end of the sky." (Mark 13:28-31; Luke 21:29-33)
Take a lesson from the palm tree: as soon as its leaves turn green and produce paper, you'll know summer is near.
And as you keep seeing these things as a constant, know that I am near the doors.
We tell you the truth: This generation will not pass until all these things come to pass.
Let heaven and earth pass away, but my words will never pass away. Always be ready (Mark 13:32-37; Luke 17:26-30; Matthew 24:39-40).
But today, it is like this and the hour is like that, that no one knows them, not even the angels in heaven or the Son, but only the Father knows them.
As it happened in the time of Noah, so it will be in the coming of the Son of Man.
Just as people used to live in those days before the floods, they ate, drank, and got married, until Noah entered the ark.
They had not even considered anything until the floods came and shook them all. Thus it is when I, the Son of Man, come.
That's how it is for two men in a race, one moves and the other stays still.
Two women are sitting on the millstone, grinding wheat; one is shaking and the other remains still.
Wake up, for you know not the day when your Lord will come.
If they knew this, the owner of the house would have known when to catch the thief, then he would have stayed awake and not let his house be stolen.
That is why you must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not expect him." (Luke 12:41-48)
Who is the trustworthy servant who knows how to act, and who makes sure that everything is in its place to provide them with their food at the right time?
Health allows this service to return to its owner and find him doing his service.
They are telling you the truth: He is doing it to eat from all his possessions.
If this servant were to turn evil and say to himself, "My master should return."
He began to strike the other servants, and ate and drank with the scoundrels.
He wants to come back on a day when it doesn't occur to him and at an hour he doesn't know.
To cut them off and put them in the place where the hypocrites are going. Where will be the crying and the tears of the years?"
Like the girls
"If the Kingdom of Heaven is like ten virgins who take their lamps and go out to meet the bridegroom, ... "
Five of them were ignorant and five knew how to act.
When the ignorant shook their lanterns, they didn't shake the oil with them.
Those who know how to act, shake their fists full of oil with their lanterns.
And like the bridegroom, they all fell asleep and rested.
At midnight, they heard shouting: "Here comes the groom! Come out to meet him!"
All the girls got up and lit up their lanterns.
And the ignorant said to those who know how to act: "Give us a little of your oil, so that our lanterns may be extinguished."
Those who know how to act should answer: "It might not be enough for us and for you, go to those who sell oil and buy what you need."
And when they were about to buy a car, the groom arrived. They entered the house where the wedding was being held with him, and closed the door.
And the young men pushed the other girls aside and said to the groom: "Our lord, our lord, open the door!"
Their answer was: "We tell you the truth: we do not know you."
"If then, prepare yourselves, for you do not know the day nor the hour." (Luke 19:11-27, like the rustling of money)
The way to the Kingdom of Heaven is like a traveler in love, who calls his servants and gives them his money.
He gave to each according to his ability; he gave five shekels of gold to one, two shekels to another, and one shekel to a third, and he sent him away.
He who took the five bundles walked swiftly and traded them, brother, and earned five more bundles.
And he who takes two steps forward, gains two steps backward.
He who took just one bag, went and dug in the ground, and hid his master's money.
And after a long time, the master of the servants returned to you and held them accountable.
He who came with the five bundles, brought five additional bundles and said: "My lord, you gave me five bundles, and now I have won five more."
Said the master: "Arise, my faithful and righteous servant! You have been faithful with little, now I will reward you with much: enter the paradise of your master."
And the two coins that he had, he put down, and said, "My lord, you have given me two coins; and behold, I have gained two more."
Said the master: "Arise, my faithful and righteous servant! You have been faithful in little, now I will reward you with much: enter the paradise of your master."
But he took only one sack, and said, "My lord, I know that you are a harsh man, reaping what you did not sow and gathering what you did not plant."
Brother, be afraid, and walk away, hiding your bag in the dirt, and here are your money."
Amma Sidou Jaabou: "O benevolent or malevolent servant, O benefactor! As I reap what I did not sow and gather what I did not plant,
You needed to deposit my money in the bank, and we'll come back to get it with interest.
And he said to his servants, "Take the bundle from him and give it to him who has ten bundles."
Go get what you have, so it increases and you have a lot. But for those who have nothing, even what they have to look at.
And as for the servant who does not even bring any benefit, throw him into the darkness outside. Where will be the crying and the tears of the years?" » The Day of Judgment
When I, the Son of Man, come in my glory, and with me all the angels, at that time I will sit on my glorious throne.
# Psalm 34:17 They gather before me all the peoples, and I will separate them, as a shepherd separates his sheep from the goats.
We put the sheep on my right, and the goats on my left.
And apart, I say to my right hand, the king who is with me: "Come, those whom my father blessed, inherit the kingdom that was prepared for you from the creation of the world.
Despite my hunger, you fed me, despite my thirst, you quenched me, despite my estrangement, you made me feel at home.
"I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in chains and you freed me."
That's how the righteous answer me: "O Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?"
And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you? Or naked and clothe you?
And when did we see you sick or in chains and visit you?
And I, the king, will answer them: "Every time you did this to one of my younger brothers, you did it to me as well!"
And turn away so that I can tell the one on my left: "Get away from me, you cursed ones, go to the fire prepared for Satan and his angels forever."
I was hungry and you didn't feed me, I was thirsty and you didn't give me a drink.
"And I was a stranger, and you did not welcome me; naked, and you did not clothe me; sick and in prison, and you did not visit me."
And they added, "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, a stranger or naked, sick or in prison, and did not help you?"
And I will answer them: "You have the right to do so every time you don't do that with one of my younger brothers, you haven't done that with me."
"That they may go and suffer forever, but the righteous will go to eternal life."
The Jews tried to kill Jesus (Mark 14:1-2; Luke 22:1-2; John 11:45-53)
When Jesus had finished saying all this, he said to his disciples:
You know that Easter comes in two days, and I, the Son of Man, am handed over to be crucified.
And at that time the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the house of Caiaphas, who was the highest priest among them.
They consulted with each other how they might seize Jesus and kill him.
They said, "We didn't find him during the festival, so as not to cause a stir among the people." Mary poured perfume on Jesus (Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8)
At that time, Jesus was in Bethany, in Simon the Leper's house.
She came to me with a dab of expensive perfume on her hands, and poured it over his head while he was eating.
When the students saw them, they whispered to each other and said, "Why this waste?"
"This perfume used to sell for a fortune, and it was given to the poor!"
Did Jesus know this and say to them, "Why are you troubled? She has done a wonderful thing for me."
The poor will always be with you, but I am not always going to be with you.
If she sprayed perfume on my body, it's to prepare me for the burial.
"It is your duty: wherever you go in all the world, proclaim this gospel, so that it may be told of the deeds of this woman, so that people may always remember her." (Betrayal of Judas, Mark 14:10-11; Luke 22:3-6)
At that time, there was a student named Judas Iscariot, who went to the chief priests.
# 21:32; 11:12 And He said to them, "What shall I give you for it?" And they gave Him thirty pieces of silver.
And at that time he was waiting for an opportunity to betray them. The Passover meal with the disciples (Mark 14:12-21; Luke 22:7-23; John 13:21-30)
On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and said, "Shall we prepare for you the Passover meal so that you may eat?"
He told them: "There's one in the city who will tell you: 'The teacher says his time has come, so we will have Easter dinner at your house with my students.'"
The disciples did as Jesus told them and prepared the Passover meal.
In the evening, Jesus sat down to eat with his twelve disciples.
And while they were eating, Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
They sighed a bit and started to say one by one: "Hey, am I the one, O Lord?"
Answer them: "The one who puts his hand in the dish with me is the one who will betray me."
# Ezekiel 41:9 Behold, I am the Lord, the Son of Man, who has been shown the vision to show you the things that shall be. As I have written in the book, so it shall be: 'Woe to him who betrays!' It would have been better for that man had he not been born."
They asked Judas, who had betrayed him, "Surely you are he, Teacher?" Jesus answered, "You have said so." Last Supper (Mark 14:22-26; Luke 22:15-20; 1 Corinthians 11:23-25)
And while they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after blessing it, broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
Take a cup and thank them, and say: "Drink from it all of you."
This is my blood, the blood of the covenant, which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.
We tell you: We can't drink this grape juice anymore, until that day comes when we'll drink it with you, something new in Papa's kingdom.
And they went to the Mount of Olives, singing hymns. Jesus told Peter to deny him (Mark 14:27-31; Luke 22:31-34; John 13:36-38).
# Matthew 13:7; John 16:32 And Jesus said to them, "You will all scatter and leave me alone this night, for it is written in the Scriptures: 'The shepherd will be struck, and the sheep will be scattered.'"
"But after we rise from death, I will meet you in Galilee before you."
They said to him, "Even if they all leave you, I will never leave you."
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, this night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times."
Peter said, "I will not deny you, even if it means dying with you." And all the disciples said the same. Jesus prayed in Gethsemane (Mark 14:32-42; Luke 22:39-46).
And Jesus, with his disciples, went to a place called Gethsemane, and said to them, "Sit here, while I go over there to pray."
Peter and Andrew, the Zebedee brothers, shook their heads, and he felt a heavy sadness and restlessness in his spirit.
That time he said to them: "My spirit is sorrowful to the point of death. Wait here and stay awake."
And then he took a little more, and it fell on his knees, and he prayed, saying: "Father, if it's possible, let me have this cup. But if it's what you want, not what I want."
And he returned to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter: "Brother, can't you stay awake with me for even one hour?"
"Stay awake and pray so that you don't experience this. The soul loves to be alert, but the body is weak."
And he prayed again, and said, "Father, if this cup cannot be taken from me, but I must drink it, let your will be done, not mine."
He returned again and found them sleeping, as their heads wouldn't move from sleep.
They left again, and after he prayed for the third time, he spoke once more.
And he went out to the disciples, and said to them, "My brothers, are you still sleeping and resting? The hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners."
"Let's go, let's walk!" said Jesus (Mark 14:43-50; Luke 22:47-53; John 18:3-12).
And while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived, accompanied by a group of people with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
The family gave them a sign and said: "Whoever wants to kiss this one, grab him!"
And as he was walking, a great crowd followed him, and they said, “Hail, Teacher!” and kissed him.
Jesus said, "My friend, do what you have come to do." At that time they came and laid their hands on Jesus and took him away.
And in that moment, one of the disciples reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
And at that moment Jesus said, "Put your sword back in its place. For those who wield swords will die by swords."
Brother, can't you think of something else? I can't even ask our father to send us more than two angels' armies?
"But how can the sacred texts that say this thing be true?"
And Jesus said to the people, "My brother, have you come to arrest me with swords and clubs? Every day I was teaching in the temple, and you did not lay a hand on me.
"All this happened to fulfill what is written in the books of the prophets." At that time, the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was brought before the Jewish council (Mark 14:53-65; Luke 22:54-55, 63-71; John 18:13-14, 19-24).
And they stripped Jesus and mocked him, and handed him over to Caiaphas, who was the highest priest, and they gathered together the elders and the scribes of the Jews.
Peter was following him from afar, until Len reached the middle of the house of the highest priest. He went inside and sat with the guards to see what would happen.
And the chief priests and the elders of the Jews were in council; for they all sought after one who should testify against Jesus, that they might put him to death.
Even if they didn't know how, some people were forced to come forward and testify falsely. Two witnesses came forward.
And they said, "This man said, 'I will cast down God's temple and rebuild it in three days.'"
And the highest among the priests said, "Brother, why don't you have an answer? Brother, don't you hear how these men are testifying against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. And the chief priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us: Are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
Jesus said, "You have said it. I tell you, today you will see me, the Son of Man, seated at the right hand of the Power of God, coming on the clouds of heaven!"
He cut off the top one of the priests' heads and said: "Here is blasphemy! Brother, do we still need witnesses? Here, you just heard it as blasphemy."
"What should we judge him by?" they asked. "He must die!"
They spat on him and hit him on the hand, and some of them complained about who hit him.
And they said, "Tell us, Jesus, who is it that struck you?" Peter denied Jesus (Mark 14:66-72; Luke 22:56-62; John 18:15-18, 25-27).
At that time, Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, when a servant came up and said, "You were with Jesus of Galilee!"
He denied it in front of them all and said, "I don't understand what you mean."
And when he went out through the outer gate, he saw another servant, and said to those who were there, "This man was also with Jesus of Nazareth!"
Peter denied it again, swearing and saying, "I don't know this man!"
A little distance away, some of those present approached Peter and said to him, "Truly, you are one of them, for the way you speak is like theirs!"
At that moment, time began to swear and cover itself: "I don't know this man." And at that moment, the storyteller shouted.
And Peter remembered Jesus' words, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." So he went out and wept bitterly.
Jesus before Pilate (Mark 15:1; Luke 23:1-2; John 18:28-32)
And in the morning, the chief priests and the elders of the people came together, and they all agreed to kill Jesus.
They stripped him, spat on him, and beat him, then handed him over to the governor Pilate. "The death of Judas" (Acts 1:18-19)
And when Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he repented and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
And he said to them, "I have committed a great sin by shedding the blood of an innocent person." They said, "It's not our concern; take care of yourself."
He threw the silver into the structure and left, walking with a hanged spirit.
But the chief priests, shaking the silver, said, "It is not lawful to put it into the treasury, for it is blood money."
Either they understand and buy the clay from the potter to make a shallow grave to bury the brainless.
That's why they call this language "Blood Language" today.
# Zak 11:12-13; Jer 32:6-15; 18:2-3 And thus the thing came to pass that the prophet Jeremiah said, "Shake the thirty pieces of silver, the price for which they valued Me among the congregation of Israel,
They gave him money to buy a potter's field. "Just as the Lord commanded me." Pilate asked Jesus. (Mark 15:2-5; Luke 23:3-5; John 18:33-38)
And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Art thou the king of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "I am."
But when the priests and elders accused him, he did not answer a single word.
And the distance ones said to Pilate: "Brother, don't you hear how they are testifying against you with so many things?"
But they didn't answer a single one of his questions, which left the governor quite puzzled. The sentence of death passed on Jesus (Mark 15:6-15; Luke 23:13-25; John 18:39-19:16)
And every holiday, the governor would give the people one of the things they loved most.
And at that time they had one known in prison named Barabbas.
And when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, "Whom of the two would ye have me release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"
In retrospect, he knew it was jealousy that led them to betray him.
On top of that, while Pilate was sitting in the court, his wife sent him a message saying, "Be careful with that righteous man, for I have had a dream about him this night."
And the chief priests and elders persuaded the people to ask him to release Barabbas and to crucify Jesus.
The governor said to them again, "Who will deliver you from these two whom you love? And they said, 'Barabbas!'"
Pilate said to them, "What would you have me do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said, "Crucify him!"
And he said, "Why, what evil have they done?" But they cried out even more, "Crucify!"
Unless Pilate, who had done nothing wrong, could find any fault, he took water and washed his hands in front of everyone, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood! Do whatever you wish to him."
And all the people answered, "We and our children are demanded by blood!"
And they divided his garments, casting lots for them; but they stripped him, and gave him vinegar to drink, mingled with gall (Mark 15:16-20; John 19:2-3).
And the distance shook the soldiers as Jesus approached the governor's palace, and they gathered all the troops before him.
We tried to dress him and dress her in red clothes.
And they made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and put a reed in his hand, and knelt before him, mocking him and saying, "Hosanna to the King of the Jews!"
They spat on him, tightened the rope, and hit him on the head with it.
After they had mocked him, they put a red robe on him, and plucked his beard, and spat on him, and shook the thorns into his head, trying to harden him. Jesus on the cross (Mark 15:21-32; Luke 23:26-43; John 19:17-27)
And when they were coming out of the city, a man from Cyrene, named Simon, passed by, and they compelled him to carry the cross of Jesus.
And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means "Place of the Skull"
They gave them a mixed drink called "amr" to drink, but when they tasted it, they didn't want to drink it.
# Mark 22:18 And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots for them.
They sat down and kept looking for him the next day.
And they laid the charge against him on a signboard, on which was written: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
They crucified two criminals with him, one on his right and one on his left.
# 22:7-8; 109:25 And the people who passed by were shaking their heads and cursing him, saying:
"If you can tear down the structure and rebuild it in three days, save yourself and come down from the cross if you are the Son of God."
And the priests and scribes of the Jews, and the elders, were continually mocking him, saying:
"Don't let others finish, he can't finish himself! He is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross right now and we will believe in him."
Mao trusted in God and said, "I am the Son of God," Let God decide if they are satisfied with him.
And those who were crucified with him reviled him, saying, "You who claim to be the Messiah, save yourself!" The death of Jesus (Mark 15:33-41; Luke 23:44-49; John 19:28-30)
And by noon, the darkness of the world covers everything, even for the three things of the evening.
# Matt 22:1 And approaching the three, Jesus spoke loudly, saying, "Eli, Eli, why have you forsaken me?" which means, "My Lord, my Lord, why have you abandoned me?"
And those who were standing and listening said, "This man is calling for Elijah!"
# And one of them ran and fetched a cloth, and dipped it in vinegar and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink. (John 6:21)
But others said: "Wait, let's see if Elijah will come and save them!"
Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and breathed his last.
And the veil of the temple was rent in two, from top to bottom. And the earth quaked, and the rocks rent.
And the graves gave up their dead, and the bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep arose.
And they went out of the tomb after Jesus was risen, and went to the city of Jerusalem, and appeared to many.
When the captain and his men came to Jesus, because they were looking for him, they saw how the earth shook and what happened, and they were terrified. They exclaimed, "Truly this man is the Son of God!"
And there were some women standing by, watching from a distance, who had followed Jesus of Galilee and served him.
Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of John the Zealot. They were present at the burial of Jesus (Mark 15:42-47; Luke 23:50-56; John 19:38-42).
And in the evening, a rich man named Joseph from the region of Ramah came. He was also one of Jesus' disciples.
He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph shook the body of Jesus and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
And they buried him in a new tomb, hewn out in the rock, and placed a great stone at the entrance to the tomb, and went away.
And Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb, weeping.
And early in the morning, after the dawn, the chief priests and the Pharisees came to Pilate's court.
And they said, "Remind us, O our Lord, how the false prophet said when he was alive: 'I will rise after three days.'"
That's why they've been trying to dig up the grave for the third day, so that his disciples won't come and steal it and tell the people, "He has risen from the dead," and lead them astray even more than they were led astray before!
Pilate said to them, "You have guards. Go, make it secure as you wish."
If they had gone, they would have put wax on the room and soldiers to search the tomb.
The Resurrection of Jesus (Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:1-12; John 20:1-10)
And after the sabbath, as the sun was rising on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
My brother, a great earthquake occurred, and an angel from my Lord descended from the sky and came and stood over the room.
And the scholars described how lightning appears as white as snow.
The guards trembled from the fear of what was coming, they moved like the dead.
And the angel said to the women: "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
He's not here, he left just as he said. Come and see the place where he was sitting.
And they went on their way, and said to their disciples, "He has risen from the dead, and is going ahead of you to Galilee; and you will see him there." I told you so."
If they had gone to the tomb, they would have found it empty, though they were both afraid and filled with joy, and they went to the disciples.
And as he turned, Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Peace be with you." Then he drew near and touched their feet, and said to them, "My brothers, do not be afraid."
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid! Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." This is what the soldiers reported.
When the women were killed, the soldiers returned to the city and told the high priests about everything that had happened.
As the priests' chiefs gathered with the elders, they consulted and gave a little money to the soldiers.
And they said to them: "Tell the people: 'They came as students at night and stole it while we were sleeping.'"
When the governor heard the news, we will make peace with him and we will get you out of the problem."
And the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been passed down among the Jews to this day. Jesus appeared to his disciples (Mark 16:14-18; Luke 24:36-49; John 20:19-23; Acts 1:6-8).
And they went into Galilee, to the mountain, as Jesus had told them.
And they knelt before Jesus, but none of them accused him.
Then Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
And teach them to do whatever you have commanded them, and I am always with you until the end of time."
John the Baptist (Matthew 3:1-12; Luke 3:1-18; John 1:19-28)
This is the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah: "Behold, I send my messenger before you, who will prepare your way."
# Isaiah 40:3 "A voice cries out: 'Prepare the way for the Lord, / Make straight in the wilderness a highway for our God.'"
John the Baptist was in the wilderness, preaching baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And the people who were in the region of Judah and dwelt in Jerusalem, all of them turned to him, and were baptized in the Jordan River after confessing their sins.
And John's clothing was of camel's hair, and he had a belt of skin, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
And he was preaching and saying, "He who is to come is mightier than I, and we are not worthy to untie the laces of his shoes."
"Anna, you shall be baptized with water, but He (Jesus) will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." (Matthew 3:13-17; Luke 3:21-22)
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan River by John.
As soon as he came out of the water, he saw the sky opened and the Holy Spirit descended on him in the form of a dove.
# Matthew 2:7; Isaiah 42:1 And a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Jesus was tempted (Matthew 4:1-11; Luke 4:1-13)
And when the time had come, the Spirit sent Jesus into the wilderness.
Forty days passed, and the devil tempted him in the wilderness, surrounded by animals, with angels serving him. Jesus in Galilee (Matthew 4:12-22; Luke 4:14-15; 5:1-11)
And after John was cast into prison, Jesus went into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God.
He says, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel!"
And when Jesus walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting their nets into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
And when they had made their nets empty, they followed him.
And after he had rowed a little farther, he saw James and John, the sons of Zebedee, in a boat mending their nets.

Jesus and his disciples walked away to Capernaum, and on the Sabbath day Jesus entered the synagogue and began to teach.
The attendees remained amazed by his teachings, as he taught them not how one with authority should be, but rather how a Jew's book should be.

And he said, "What have I done to you, Jesus of Nazareth? Why have you come to kill us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"
Brother Jesus said, "Be silent! And get out of here."
The cursed spirit seized the man, and he cried out loudly and left.
Everyone was amazed and they started asking each other: "What is this? A new education with authority! Even the damned souls obey him!"
And at that time he spread the news about Jesus throughout all the region of Galilee. Simon's mother-in-law was healed (Matthew 8:14-17; Luke 4:38-41).
And as soon as Jesus and his disciples left the synagogue, they went to Simon and Andrew's house, with James and John.

As soon as Jesus spoke, the leper was cleansed and healed.
And at once Jesus ordered him to go, and warned him.
# 13:49; 14:2-32 And they said, "Be careful what you say, do not speak until someone asks you. If you go to the priest, let him examine you, and offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded, for this is how you will be healed, so it will be a testimony for them."

But because of the crowd, they couldn't get close to him. So they dug a hole in the roof of the house where Jesus was, and lowered the mat on which the paralytic was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "My son, your sins are forgiven."
And there was a company of the scribes of the Jews, who were in the midst of the people, pondering in their hearts,
Does this man speak like this? He's going crazy! Only God can forgive sins.
And knowing what they were thinking, Jesus asked them, "Why are you thinking these things?"
Is it easier to say to a paralyzed person, "Your sins are forgiven" or to say, "Get up! Shake off your sheets and walk."
"But do you know that I, the Son of Man, have authority on earth to forgive sins?" And he said to the paralytic,
Translation: "Notice: Get up! Shake your bed and go home."

Jesus passed through the wheatfields on the Sabbath, and his disciples reaped the wheat, shaking it out into their laps.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look, why do your disciples do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"
Answer them: "Brother, didn't you read what David did? And he had time when you needed and were hungry?"
# I Samuel 21:1-6; II Samuel 8:17 How did David enter the house of God during the time of Abiathar, who was the highest among the priests, and eat of the bread of the Presence, which only the priests were allowed to eat, and give also to his men to eat?

Brother told the guy with dry hands: "Get up and stand in the middle!"
And the distance speaker said to them: "Brother, is it permissible on Saturday day to do good or evil? To save our soul or to kill it?" But they remained silent.
Jesus looked at them with indignation and sorrow because of the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand!" He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
The Pharisees left the council and immediately began to discuss how they might kill Jesus with the members of Herod's party.
