How is the choice made in the kingdom of heaven?
At that very hour, the disciples approached Jesus and asked him, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?" Luke 22:24
He cried out to Jesus for a newborn and stood among them.
"Say: 'You shall have the truth: unless you change your ways and become as little children, you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven.'" - Mark
And whoever humbles themselves like this child, they are the chosen ones in the Kingdom of Heaven.
And whoever welcomes a child like this, my name will also be welcomed by them.
And he who fell into the sin is one of these young ones who believed in me; it is better for him that a large millstone be hung around his neck and he be thrown into the sea.
Oh woe to the people of the world from the things that lead to sin! It's not necessarily that these things must happen, but woe to him who causes them!
Otherwise, your hand or foot will be the cause of your downfall, cut them off and throw them at yourself, for it is better for you to enter eternal life with one hand or one foot, rather than having two hands and two feet and being thrown into eternal suffering. When?
Otherwise, your eye will cause you to fall into sin; take it out and throw it from you, for it is better for you to enter eternal life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hellfire. Matthew 5:29
If you lose one of these little ones, we will say to you: 'Their angels are always with those in heaven.'"
"The way of man to save those who are in distress. [18.11] This verse is not found in many ancient manuscripts."
What do you think? If someone has a hundred sheep and one of them goes missing, wouldn't they leave the ninety-nine in the mountains and go look for the missing sheep?
I'll tell you the truth: If he finds it, he won't be as happy as he is with his 90th birthday, which he didn't even know about.
"And thus, the ones up in the sky don't want even one of these little ones to be lost." the wise one said.
"Except for your brother's fault, go to him and argue with him, but if he listens to you, you will save your brother, perhaps."
Otherwise, he doesn't want to listen. It takes one or two of you to testify, so that every word is confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
Otherwise, if he doesn't want to listen to them, tell it to the people of the church, if he still doesn't want to listen, consider him like someone who worships idols or a tax collector.
I tell you the truth: what is bound on earth will be loosed in heaven, and what is loosed on earth will be bound in heaven. Matthew 16:19; John 20:23
And remember: unless two of you agree on something on earth, it will not be granted to you from heaven.
"Wherever you gather two or three in my name, there I am among them." — The example of the servant who does not forgive.
Peter approached Jesus and said, "Master, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?" (Luke)
Jesus said to him, "Not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
On this account, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who wants to settle accounts with his slaves.
And when he began to account for them, they brought him a bill for millions of dirhams in silver.
If he couldn't repay it, he ordered his master to sell him, his wife, his children, and all his possessions to repay his debt.
And the servant prostrated himself and said: "Be patient with me, my lord, and I will return to you what I owe."
His master forgave him, released him, and allowed him to pay his debt.
And when that slave left, he found one of the other slaves with a hundred dirhams of silver, and he seized him, hung him up, and said: "Give me back what you were asking for!"
His companion fell at his feet, begging him, and said: "Be patient with me, and I will return to you what is due."
But he didn't want to, so they took him to prison until he repaid his debt.
When they saw their slaves in such a state, they became very sad and went to tell their master what had happened.
His master shouts at him and says: "Oh, this servant who has no value! I forgave you for all that debt because you did not disappoint me."
Why didn't you show mercy to your servant as I have shown mercy to you?
His master was concerned, and had him sent to prison to be reformed until he repaid what he owed.
"This is how he will show you what is in the sky, as long as each one of you does not allow his brother from the bottom of his heart."
Chapter 10: Jesus teaches about divorce
And when Jesus had finished saying these words, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan River.
And many people followed him, and they saw him healed.
The Pharisees approached him and tested him, saying, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
He answered them and said: "Didn't you read in the Book of God that God created mankind from a single soul, male and female?"
Translation: That's why the man becomes weak and apathetic and ends up sharing his wife, they both become one unit.
And it is not that they have disappeared, two of them, but one has remained. And whoever God brings together, no one can separate them."
And the Pharisees asked him, "Why did Moses command that a man should give his wife a bill of divorce when he divorces her?" Matthew 19:7
Jesus answered them, "In the beginning God made man and woman. Moses allowed you to put away your wives because of your hardness of heart, but that was not how it was from the beginning."
"I tell you: if a man divorces his wife for any reason other than sexual immorality and marries another, he is committing adultery." Matthew 5:32; 1 Corinthians 7:10,11
Tell him to his students: "If this is the case of men with women, it's better for him not to get married."
Jesus answered them, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven.
"There are people who are born with the spirit of their dead parents and cannot marry, and there are those who have been made like this by people. And there are those who have not married before the kingdom of heaven. Whoever understands this understands it." Jesus blessed the little children.
They had some young children come and place their hands on them and pray with them, and they rebuked the students for bringing them.
But Jesus said, "Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
He put his hands on them and walked away. The young man wearing them.
A young man came to him and asked, "Teacher, what good work can I do to have eternal life?"
Jesus answered, "Why do you ask me about what is good? God alone is good. If you want to enter eternal life, keep the commandments."
He asked him, "Which commandments?" And Jesus answered, "Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness,
"Be grateful for what you have and what is close to you, as you wish for your own head."
He said to the young man, "I have done all these instructions, so what else do I need?"
Jesus answered, "If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come and follow me!"
But when Mali heard the young man say this, he left, sad, as he was deeply affected.
Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you the truth: it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.
And we say to you: entering the kingdom of God is easier for those who enter it with a pure heart than for those who are dressed up!
The students were amazed when they heard this and exclaimed: "According to this, who will be able to escape?"
And Jesus, looking at them, said, "You see, it is not people who can do this, but God, for whom nothing is impossible."
Peter answered and said, "Here we have left everything and followed you; what will be our reward?"
Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth: when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, all authority will be given to him, and he will judge the nations. And when he comes, he will send his angels, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the earth to the other."
And whoever permits his daughter, or his sisters, or his mother, or his wife, or his children, or his lands to be taken in my name, will be repaid a hundredfold, and he will have eternal life with God.
"Many who are first will be last, and those who are last will be first." Matthew 20:16; Luke 13:30
Chapter Twenty: The Example of the Servants in the Gardens of Grapes
The way to the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who has a vineyard, and he goes out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He would spend a dinar a day with them and send them to his paradise.
And as the morning dew lifted, they found other servants standing in the market without any service.
He tells them: "Go until we reach my paradise, and I will redeem you with what you deserve."
And they left. And the laziness of the day emerged again, and it emerged again at three in the afternoon, with even more servants.
And once again, he stepped outside his five-room house in the evening, and found other servants standing and asked them, "Why are you standing here all day without work?"
They answered: "Because we have served him to the best of our ability." And He said to them: "Now go and strive for the gardens under my care."
When evening came, the master of the garden said to his agent: "Call all the servants and give them their wages, and start from the last ones until you reach the first."
Those who I loved in the five o'clock in the evening, each one of them took a dinar.
And when the eggs were sold, they calculated that they would make a profit, but they only got one dinar each.
As they finished, they began to inquire about the king's son.
They said: "Those others only worked for an hour, and we've been working all day in the sun."
He answered one of the king's men and said, "I didn't wrong you, my friend. Didn't we agree on a dinar?"
Eva take what's yours and go your own way! And that's what's coming to you in the end, I wanted to give it to you on your own.
"Do I not have the right to spend my money as I please? Or are you envious because I am generous?"
And Jesus added, "It will be like this with the last; the last will be first, and the first will be last." Matthew 19:30; Mark 10:31; Luke 13:30. Jesus prophesied for the third time about his death and resurrection.
As Jesus was approaching Jerusalem, he separated from his disciples and said to them by the way,
Here is the translation of the provided text: "Now we are going up to Jerusalem, and soon someone will hand over the Son of Man to the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and they will condemn him to death."
And they will hand him over to those who do not know God, who will mock him, beat him, and crucify him, and on the third day he will rise from the dead." Jacob and John were asking Jesus for their children.
The mother of the Zebedee brothers, along with her sons, came to Jesus, prostrated themselves before him, and asked him to grant them a request.
She asked him, "What do you want?", and he replied, "An order to ensure my two children, one on your right and the other on your left, are well-cared for in my kingdom."
And he answered Jesus, saying, "You do not know what you ask, can you drink the cup of suffering that I am about to drink?" And he said to him, "I can."
Tell them: "Indeed, whatever you drink, but the glasses are on my side and my table, not me, because it will only be given to those who ask for it."
When the ten disciples heard this, they were greatly concerned for Jacob and his brother John.
Jesus said to them, "You know that the rulers rule over their people, and the great ones exercise power over everyone below them. Luke
And this is something that should not be between you. But whoever wants to be great among you should be your servant. When?
And whoever wants to be first among you, let them be your servant.
"Thus, man was not born to be served by others, but to serve and save many lives." Jesus healed two blind men.
And when they came out of Jericho, Jesus followed a great multitude of people.
And there were two blind men sitting by the roadside, and they heard that Jesus was passing by. And they began to cry out, saying, "Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!"
And they kept on shouting at them, urging them to be quiet: "Our Lord, have mercy on him, David's son!"
Jesus stood up and cried out to them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
And he answered: "We want our eyes to be bright, Sir!"
And Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes, and they saw, and followed him.
Chapter Twenty-One: Jesus Enters Jerusalem
And when they drew near to Jerusalem, at the Mount of Olives, he sent forth two of his disciples, saying unto them, "Go, and make ready the passage for us."
Tell them: "Go to the square in front of you, you will find a donkey tied there, with a young goat next to it, untie them and bring them to me."
Or else, they'll say something, something like: "God needs them, and they'll be back soon."
And all this happened so that the words of the Prophet would be fulfilled:
Tell the daughter of Zion: Behold, your king comes to you, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
And the disciples went forth by pairs, and did as Jesus commanded them.
They loaded the donkey and the ass, put their belongings on top, and Jesus rode on top of them.
A large group of people spread their belongings on the road, and others cut down tree trunks and spread them on the road.
And the crowds of people who had gone before Jesus and followed him were saying: "Glory 21:9 Glory. Literally: We have been given command concerning this Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Glory to God in the highest!"
And when he entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, and they said, "Who is this?"
And the crowds answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus was driving out the sellers and buyers from the temple.
And Jesus entered the Temple of God, and walked through the market where people were buying and selling doves, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the chairs of the dove sellers.
Tell them: "It is written in the Book of God that this place will be called the House of Prayer, but we have turned it into a den of thieves!"
They came to him, and Allah sent people to him who were blind, lame, and sick, and He healed them.
But the religious leaders and scholars were troubled when they saw the miracles that Jesus performed, and when they heard the children shouting in the temple, "Hosanna to the Son of David!"
And he said unto them, "Do you not hear what they are saying? Have you never read in the book of God: 'Out of the mouth of babes and infants you have ordered praise'?"
And after he had left them, he went out of the city to a place called Gethsemane, and spent the night there, fasting. Jesus cursed the vine.
And when morning came, he was still hungry as he returned to the city.
He saw a vine by the side of the road, and went to it, but found nothing on it, only leaves. And Jesus said to it, "No fruit will be on you forever!" And immediately the vine withered.
And when they saw what had happened, the students were amazed and asked: "How did the vine dry up so quickly?"
And Jesus answered them, saying: "Truly I tell you, unless you have faith and do not doubt, you will not achieve anything. Just as I commanded the vine, so will it happen to whatever you command, whether it moves or falls into the sea. When you speak, it will be done."
"The need that you seek in prayer with faith, you will receive." Who gave Jesus the authority?
And when Jesus entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him, and they said, "By what authority do you do these things? And who gave you this power?"
Jesus answered them, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? From God or from people?" They consulted with each other and said, "If it came from God, he will tell us, 'Why didn't you believe in John?'"
Otherwise, we would have said it came from people; we fear the people because they might think John is a prophet."
They answered Jesus, saying, "We do not know." And he said to them, "Neither do I tell you what authority I have to do this." Example of two sons.
One day, a man had two sons. He went to the older one and said: "Go, my son, and work today in my vineyard."
His son answered and said to him, "I don't want to. But later he regretted and left."
And the first boy went to the second boy and said to him as he had said to the first, and the second answered him and said: "Even if you are my master! But he didn't go."
"Who among these two does God want?" They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth: tax collectors and prostitutes will enter the Kingdom of God before you."
"For John the Baptist came to you, walking in the truth, and you did not believe in him, but tax collectors and sinners believed in him. Even after seeing his miracles, you did not repent or believe in him." Luke 3:12; 7:29,30 The parable of the vineyard and the fig tree.
Here is the translation of the given text: "Listen to another parable: A man had a piece of land, and he planted a vineyard there. He built a wall around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a tower. Then he left for a long time."
When the time came to harvest the grapes, he sent his slaves to the vineyard to collect his yield.
The gardeners and the Coptic slaves fought, beat one, killed another, and stoned another.
He sent more slaves than before, and they were treated in the gardens just like the others.
And so he sent his son to them and said: He will respect my son.
But when the gardeners saw the boy born in the garden, they whispered among themselves: "This is the one who will inherit! Let's kill him and take his inheritance!"
They enticed him and led him out beyond the gardens of grapes and killed him.
Ah, there's a vineyard in the garden of paradise, what does that gardener do with those vines?
And they answered him, "Those farmers will have a poor harvest in the end, and the vineyards will give their fruit to other gardeners who will yield a harvest at that time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Book of God: 'The stone which the builders rejected is now the head of the corner; this is from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"
Here's the translation of the given text into English: "On this, I tell you: the Kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will yield its fruits."
The person who fell on this tile will have their foot crushed, and the tile that fell on them will crush them."
And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his words, they understood that he was speaking to them.
They started to discuss how to capture him, but they were afraid of the crowds of people who might consider him a prophet.
Chapter Twenty-One: The Display of the Wedding
Jesus spoke to the crowd again, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepares a wedding feast for his son.
His slave messengers called the attendees, but they didn't want to come.
He sent for more slaves and told them: "Tell the ones who are here: I have found the wedding, I have slaughtered the sheep, the fat calves, and everything is ready. So come to the wedding!"
But they didn't all do that; some left to tend their fields, while others went to buy and sell.
Two of the exhibitors took their slaves, measured them, and then killed them.
The king was concerned, so he sent his army, who killed those warriors and burned their city.
He told his slaves: "The wedding is here, but those we offered it to don't deserve it."
Eva, go now where the paths cross and show every person you meet the wedding invitation.
And the slaves went out to the roads and gathered what they found, neither the good nor the bad, until they filled the wedding house with guests.
When the king went to greet the guests, he noticed a man not dressed for the wedding.
He said to her: "How did you manage to come here with my friend, and you're not even wearing wedding clothes?" The man remained silent as he had nothing to say.
He said to the servants, "Take him away from my hands and feet, and throw him outside in the darkness. Then where will the wailing and the gnashing of teeth be?" When?
"Many have been called, but few have chosen." - The Emperor's Tax Exemption
And the Pharisees went away at that hour, plotting together how they might catch Jesus in his words.
They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians, and said, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God honestly, and you are not concerned with anyone's reputation, for you see people as they really are."
"Eva, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to the emperor?"
Jesus knew their intentions and said to them, "Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?"
"Show me the money! How do you get rid of the tax?" They gave him a dinar.
Ask them: "Whose picture and writing is on this money?"
He said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's!"
When they heard it, they were amazed, and left, wondering about the trade of the dead.
A delegation of Sadducees, who deny the resurrection of the dead, came to Jesus and asked him, "What is the purpose of the commandments?"
Sir, Moses said: If a man dies without leaving any sons, his brother should marry his wife so that he can have children in his brother's name.
We had seven siblings, the first one got married and passed away, since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother so that he could marry her.
And thus it happened for the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh.
And so, after they all died, the woman died too.
Who among these seven will be this woman's husband on the day of the sale, since they were all her husbands?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "You are mistaken, for you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.
As for those who died in the flood, people did not marry nor were they married, but they will be like angels in heaven.
As for the matter of the dead, have you not read what God says to you when He said:
Am I the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living."
When the people heard this message, they were amazed at his teaching. The Great Commission.
When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
And one of them, being a scholar of the law, tested Jesus, asking him:
Sir, what is the great testament in Islam?
Jesus answered and said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind."
This is the great testament and the last will.
And the second will be just as it is: seek what is close to you as you would seek your own head.
"And these two commandments are the foundation of the whole law and the prophets." - Luke 10:25-28, Jesus and the Prophet David
And when the Pharisees had come together, Jesus spoke to them, saying:
"What did they feed Christ? Who was he born to?" They answered, "He was born to David!"
He asks them: "How did David receive the revelation of God's Spirit when his Lord said to him?"
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool under your feet."
"Except for David, all cry out to the Lord, how can the Son of Christ be?"
No one could answer him even a single word, and not a single person from that day on dared to ask him any more questions.
Chapter Twenty-Three: Jesus Tells His Disciples to Be Wary of Religious Leaders and the Pharisees
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
"The scholars of Islamic law and the Pharisees are the ones who have the right to interpret Moses' law."
Do what Eva says, but don't follow their actions, because they don't do what she says.
They bundle up bundles of words and difficulties in their minds and place them on the shoulders of people, but they don't move even a finger to lift them with them.
Or else they do something just to be seen by people, and they widen the gangs from their shoulders and foreheads, and they lengthen their veils.
They should be in the preferred places at parties, and in the first rows of prayer halls.
People in the market greet them and say: "Sir."
But don't let anyone make you feel inferior: "Sir, you are all brothers and you have one master."
And do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father in heaven.
And don't let anyone sue you: for you have one Teacher, the Christ.
And among you, the greatest should be your servant. When?
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted. Luke 14:11; 18:14
But woe to you, you law experts and hypocritical Pharisees! For you close the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; for you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in.
But woe to you, O scholars of the law and hypocritical Pharisees! For you devour the livelihood of widows and lengthen your prayers only to be seen, and for this, your punishment will be more severe than that of other people. [23:14] This verse is not found in many ancient manuscripts.
Woe to you, religious scholars and hypocritical Pharisees! Why do you go to such lengths to bring back a Jew from the sea and the land, and when he turns Jewish, he deserves hell even more than you do, twice over!
Woe to you, blind authorities! They say that an oath made in the name of God is not valid, but an oath made with the gold of the House of God must be fulfilled.
Ah, these fools and blind ones! Is it not better to return to the truth, to the sacred gold, to the House of God?
And here is the translation: "Saying again: He who swears by the altar, his oath is not accepted, but he who swears by the gift that is above him, especially he should fulfill his oath."
Ah, these blind people! Why is it so dark? Is it the slaughterhouse, or the one that echoes the slaughterhouse's sacred sound?
He who swears by the altar swears by everything that is above it.
And whoever swears by the House of God, swears by it and by Him who dwells therein.
And whoever swears by the sky, swears by God's throne, and by Him upon whom He has power. Matthew 5:34
Woe unto you, O scholars of the law and hypocritical Pharisees! You feast upon mint, dill, and cumin, while neglecting the important matters of the law, which are truth, mercy, and faith. You should have done this without leaving things to others.
Oh, these blind officials! You filter the water from the mosquitoes, but you let the camels pass.
Woe unto you, religious scholars and hypocritical Pharisees! You wash the outside of the cup and the platter, but leave the inside full of extortion and greed.
Ah, this blind Pharisee! Wash the inside of the cup and the dish, that your outward part may also be clean.
Woe unto you, O scholars of the law and hypocritical Pharisees! You are like the beautiful tombs from the outside, but within them lie the bones of the dead and all sorts of filth. Deeds
And thus it is, they write to people from outside, claiming to be God-fearing, but within, they are full of hypocrisy and sins.
Woe unto you, O scholars of the law and hypocritical Pharisees! You have written the tombs of the prophets and defiled the gardens of the righteous.
Say: If we lived in the time of our ancestors, if we had shared in the killing of the prophets.
And thus, you will bear witness on your heads that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
Complete what your ancestors started.
Ah, this is the devil's trick! How will you escape the torment of Hell? When?
They send you prophets, judges, and scholars of the law, some of whom you kill, some of whom you crucify, and some of whom you beat in your mosques and drive them from city to city.
So that the punishment for every shed innocent blood may come upon you, from the blood of Abel, whose cry for help has reached God, to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you killed between the temple and the altar.
"Run and tell them the truth: all this judgment will fall on this generation!" - Jesus' love for Jerusalem
Jerusalem, Jerusalem! The one who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her. How many times have I wanted to gather your children as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you did not want it.
And behold, your house will be left desolate for you.
And here is the translation: "And don't forget: you won't see me again until you say: 'Congratulations, in the name of God'."
Chapter Twenty-Four: Jesus Predicts the Destruction of the Temple
And Jesus went out and walked toward the Temple, and his disciples came to him to show him the children of the Temple.
Jesus said to them, "Have you seen all this? Truly I tell you, there will not be left here one stone upon another; all will be thrown down." Signs of the end of the age.
And as Jesus was teaching on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately and asked, "Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
And Jesus answered them, saying, "Resist him not, but if any man shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also."
As many people came and took my name and said, "I am Christ!" and many people were deceived.
You've been hearing about war and war news, and then you freak out! Because all of this is bound to happen, but this won't be the last time.
As one nation rises against another, and kingdom against kingdom, and there is famine, and earthquakes in many places.
But all of that is nothing compared to the pain.
The clock's hand washes you, the one that's going to judge and kill you. All the peoples of the world will turn against you for the sake of my name. When?
Many people have returned to their faith, sacrificed for each other, and others have done the same for themselves.
They spread a lot of false news and confuse a lot of people.
And because of too many sins, the love from many people will cool down.
But even the most hardened among them, that Gang, repented. When?
And he will tell this good news of the Kingdom of God to all the world, and it will be a witness to the peoples of all the world, and then the end of this age will come." (Great Tribulation)
And when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, let those who read understand.
The cock of the clock that is in the land of Judah flees to the mountains.
And he who is on top of the surface does not descend to take what is in his house. Luke
The one who was in the field wouldn't go back to get his clothes.
Woe to pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days.
Pray so that your escape is not in the winter or on Saturday day.
Time is precious, and you never know when a great calamity will strike, unlike anything the world has ever seen since God created it, and it will never happen again. (The Vision)
And had God not shortened those days, no human would have survived, but because of those whom God chose during those days, they will be shortened.
It's almost time, but I have to tell you something: here is the Christ, but he's not staying! Don't believe it.
While some people claim to be Christ and others claim to be prophets, they perform miracles and do amazing things to deceive even those chosen by God.
Ah, I've told you before.
Just listen to me: he's in the desert! Don't go out, and he's not even in the houses! Don't trust them.
As lightning strikes in the east and appears in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
"Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather." - Luke 17:37 (The coming of the Son of Man)
3:15; Revelation 6:12; 3:15; Revelation 6:13 "After the tribulations of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not shine, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken."
And soon, your time will come, when the sign of the Son of Man appears in the sky. After that, they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with great power and glory. (The Vision)
And he sends his angels, with a powerful trumpet, to gather those he has chosen from the four corners of the earth, from every place under the heavens." An example of the grapevine.
Learn from the vine this example: When its branches are watered, they turn green, and its leaves begin to grow, you know that summer is near.
And so it is, when you see all these things happening, you know that it is drawing near, and it is at the door.
I'll tell you the truth: There's no way this generation can avoid all this.
"The path of heaven and earth is given to them, but my words will never be given up. The day and hour are unknown."
On that day and at that hour, no one knows them, not even the angels in heaven nor the Son, except the Father alone.
As it happened in the time of Noah, so shall be the coming of the Son of Man.
As people were in the days before the flood, they ate and drank and married and gave in marriage until the day that Noah entered the ark.
They didn't know what was coming, until the flood came and took them all. Thus will be the coming of the Son of Man.
The clock's hands will be two feet long, one will take and the other will leave.
And there will be two girls grinding at the mill, one will be leaving and the other will stay.
Eva, sleep well, because you don't know when your Lord will come.
You need to know that the owner of the house knows what time it is at night, so he stays awake and doesn't let anyone steal his house.
"On this, we must realize that one day, the human being will no longer exist." Example of the phrase by the faithful servant.
Who is the faithful and wise slave that his master has appointed over his household to give food to the slaves at the proper time?
The happiness of that servant is when his master comes, he will find him doing the work he was ordered to do.
I'm going to tell you the truth: It's going to cost you everything you have.
Unless that servant is ugly and wicked, his thought was: "My lord will get stuck in his return."
And it seemed that he was beating his slave companions, eating and drinking with the sailors.
She is the master of that servant on a day when he does not remember it, and at another time he does not know it.
He will be severely punished and associated with the hypocrites. Then where will be the weeping and the sharpening of swords?"
Chapter Twenty-Five: The Example of the Ten Virgins
"And verily, the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Luke"
And among them were five virgins and five others who were chaste.
They shook those five baskets of wrinkled, slimy fish without taking any oil with them.
The five sensible women brought their own needles and oil for the lamp.
When the groom got stuck, all the single women started to sing together until they fell asleep.
And as night falls, you hear a loud cry: "Here comes the bride! Go out to meet her!"
They all put on their best clothes and found their best behavior.
Give us a little of your oil, for our lamps are about to go out.
But the sensible ones answered and said: "He can't provide enough for us and you, go buy it from those who sell it."
And while they were going to buy oil, the groom arrived, and entered with those present at the wedding venue, and closed the door.
And then the singles returned to their homes and said: "Oh Lord, oh Lord, let us be!" Luke
But the groom answered and said: "In fact, I don't know you."
"Behold, over this (event), they will remain watchful, as they do not know the day nor the hour [of the coming of the Son of Man] # 25.13 The last part of this verse is not found in many ancient manuscripts."
"And the kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling abroad, who called his servants and entrusted them with his property, Luke." An example of the struggle for money.
He gave one person five coins, another two, and a third one, according to their efforts, while he was traveling.
And he who had received five shekels of money went and started selling and buying with them, and he made five more shekels.
And those who took two paths, God gave them two paths to win.
As for those who received only one coin, he went and dug a hole in the ground and hid the coin his master had given him there.
After a long time, Mr. Dealt with those slaves and held them accountable.
And when someone comes to him with five dirhams, and adds five more, he says: "Here are the five dirhams you gave me, and here are the other five that I earned additionally."
Tell him: I have nothing to ask of you, you are a good and trustworthy servant! You were trustworthy with me in little things, and now I will entrust you with much, so come and rejoice with your master.
And then, God gave me two paths to choose from, and I chose: O my Lord, You gave me two paths, so here are two more that I gained, even more.
Tell him: I have nothing to ask of you, you are a good and trustworthy servant! You were trustworthy with me in little things, and now I am entrusting you with much, so come and rejoice with your master.
And then, someone came to him who had a single purpose, he said: "My lord, I have realized that you are a harsh man, you reap what you did not sow and gather what you did not know."
And because of that, you were afraid and hid your purse in the ground, and now here is your fortune.
And his master answered him, saying, "Come here, you ugly slave! How did you come to know that we reap what we did not sow and gather what we did not plant?"
You should have deposited my money with the money changers, so that when I return, I can take it back with its profit.
Take this bundle from him and add it to the one who has ten bundles.
Give to each what is his, and do not exceed the measure. And whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. When?
"And this servant, who is useless, they threw out into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Matthew 8:12; 22:13; Luke 13:28. Man will be judged by the nations.
"And when the soul of a human being leaves its body, with it goes the pride of its achievements, and at that moment, it will be exalted on the throne of its pride, when?"
And all the peoples will gather before him, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
And the sheep graze on his right side, and the goats on his left.
And after the king had dismissed those on his right, he said, "Come, those who have been blessed by God! Enter into the kingdom of God, which has been prepared for you since the creation of the world."
When I was hungry, you fed me; when I was thirsty, you gave me to drink; and when I was a stranger, you took me in.
Naked and shamed, sick and attended to, in prison and brought to me.
The clock's dial responds to those who do God's will, saying: "O Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you to drink?"
When did we see you as a stranger and welcome you? Or naked, did we clothe you?
And when did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?
And the king answered and said to them: "I tell you the truth: every time you did this to one of these little brothers of mine, you did it to me!"
And he said to those on his left: "Behold, these ungodly ones shall go to the eternal fire prepared for Satan and his angels."
You left me hungry and didn't feed me, you left me thirsty and didn't give me a drink.
And I was a stranger, and you did not welcome me; naked, and you did not clothe me; sick and in prison, and you did not come to me.
And they will answer Him, "O Lord! When did we see You hungry or thirsty, or a stranger or naked, or sick or in prison, and did not help You?"
And the king answered and said, "I tell you the truth: what you did not do for these, the least of these, you did not do for me."
"These will go to eternal punishment, but those who do God's will will go to eternal life."
Chapter Twenty-Six: The Jews of Kitauro Plot to Kill Jesus
And when Jesus had finished saying all these things to them, he said to his disciples:
As you know, Easter is in two days, and people will crucify the human child.
And at that time, the leaders of the religious men and the elders of the people gathered in Caiaphas' house, the chief of the religious men.
And they consulted among themselves how they might take Jesus by deceit and kill him.
But he said: "We cannot do this during the festival, lest there be disorder among the people." The woman who sniffed Jesus.
And when Jesus had come to Bethany, he lodged at the house of Simon the leper.
He was close to a woman who had a strong, expensive scent that she poured over her head when she got angry, especially when arguing at the dinner table.
When his students saw what he had done, they didn't like it and said: "Why this waste?"
"Because of this smell, it could be sold at a high price, and its price would be shared among the poor."
And when Jesus knew their thoughts, he said to them, "Why do you think evil in your hearts? For this woman has done a good thing to me."
Since the poor are always with you, but I will not always be with you.
She's so familiar with this scent, it's like she's guiding me to the grave.
"I tell you the truth: wherever this good news is proclaimed in the whole world, people will speak about what this woman has done and will remember her." Judas, the traitor, agreed to hand over Jesus.
Time be damned, one of the slothful disciples, whom I have named Judas Iscariot, went to the religious leaders.
He said to them: "What will you give me if you hand me over?" And they agreed to give him thirty pieces of silver.
And from that time on, Judah began to seek the opportunity to betray Jesus, at the meal where he was to be handed over. The Passover meal with the disciples.
And on the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread, the students came to Jesus and asked, "Where do we buy the Passover meal for you to eat?"
And He answered them, saying: "Go to the city to Flân and tell him: Thus says our Lord: The time is near; I am coming to you with my disciples to celebrate the Passover with you."
And the disciples did as Jesus had taught them, and they found the Passover meal.
As evening approached, Jesus sat down at the table with the disheartened disciples to eat with them.
They were having dinner when one of them said, "I tell you the truth: one of you will betray me."
The students were very sad and each began to ask: "What did I do, sir?"
He answered them and said: "He who puts his hand in the pot, that is the one who will deliver me!"
The way a human being is born is as written in the Book of God, but woe to that man who denies the birth of a human being; it would have been better for him if he had not been born.
And he asked Judas, who had agreed to deliver him, saying, "But, my Lord?" And Jesus answered and said to him, "What you have said." The Lord's supper.
And while they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks to God, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
And after God, the cup is to be thanked to Allah and He gave them, and said: "Drink from it all of you."
This is my blood, the blood of the covenant, which is shed for many people to forgive their sins.
We tell you: from today, we will not drink this grape juice again until the day comes when we will drink it with you anew in the kingdom of Ba'a.
And after they had prayed, they left and went to the Mount of Olives. Jesus foretold that Peter would deny him.
Jesus said to them, "This night, you will all fall away, for it is written in the Scriptures: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'"
"But after I have been dead, I shall go before you into Galilee." (Matthew 26:32)
Peter answered him, "Even if they all complain about you, I have never doubted you!"
Jesus said to him, "I tell you the truth: before the rooster crows three times, you will deny me three times."
Peter answered, "Even if I die with you, I will not deny you!" And that is what all the disciples said. Jesus was praying in the Garden of Gethsemane.
And behold, Jesus came with his disciples into a garden, which is called Gethsemane, and said unto them, "Sit ye here while I go and pray."
And after that, Peter and the two sons of Zebedee were with him, and he began to feel sorrowful.
He said to them: "My heart is very sad, even to death; stay here and keep me company!"
And then he took a moment, prostrated himself, and began to pray, saying: "Oh, if only... After this trial, but not like I want, but like you want."
And after he returned to the disciples and found them sleeping, he said to Peter: "Could you not stay awake with me for even an hour?"
"Stay awake and pray so that you don't fall into the experiment, for the spirit is strong but the self is weak."
He walked for the second time and said: "Oh! If it wasn't possible for this trial to pass by me without tasting it, then let it be as you wish."
He returned and found them asleep, as sleep had overcome them.
He left them alone and walked away, then prayed a third time and repeated the same words.
Later, he went to his students and said to them: "Are you still sleeping and at ease? The time has come, and the son of man is about to be handed over into the hands of the mediators."
"Let's go! That's the one who will lead me there." Jesus said.
And while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived, accompanied by a large group armed with swords and clubs, sent by the religious leaders and elders of the people.
And the one who handed them over gave them a sign and said to them: "The man whose ear was bitten, it's him, grab him!"
And behold, a certain man from Judah came to Jesus, saying, "Greetings, Master! Peace be with you!" and he kissed him.
He said to him, "Why have you come to me, my friend?" And they drew near to Jesus and seized him.
And one of those who were with Jesus, taking a sword, drew it and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword away! For those who live by the sword will die by the sword."
Do you think I can't call my brother now and send him more than a dozen messages from the angelic army?
"But how can the words in the Book of God be fulfilled, and what they say is that this is how it should be?"
At that hour, Jesus said to the crowds, "Why do you come to me with swords and clubs as if to seize me? Every day I was with you and taught in the synagogue, and you did not arrest me! Luke
"But all this happened so that what is written in the books of the prophets might be fulfilled. And at that time, all the disciples fled. Jesus stood before the Jewish court."
But those who seized Jesus brought him before Caiaphas, the high priest, where the religious scholars and elders were gathered.
Peter followed him from afar, until he reached the house of the religious leader, and he entered the chamber with the servants to see what was happening.
And the chief priests and the elders were seeking false testimony against Jesus to put him to death.
But they couldn't find any, even though they brought many false witnesses. In the end, two witnesses came forward.
They were saying: "This man said, 'I can draw near to the house of God, and the day that we build it.'" John
He stands as the spiritual leader and the messenger of Jesus: "Then he asked him, 'Will you not answer anything to what these men testify against you?'"
But Jesus remained silent, and he said to the chief priests, "I will ask you one question: Is it true that you say I am the Christ, the Son of God?"
And Jesus answered him, "You have said it! But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of God, coming on the clouds of heaven!"
You have a chief among the religious men who says: "This is an abomination! We no longer have any witnesses, here we heard his words of abomination."
"What do you see there?" they asked. He replied, "It's worth dying for!"
They pressed against his face and hit him, and a couple of them slapped him.
And they came and held him, and asked him, saying, "Tell us, O Christ, who is it that struck you?" Peter denied Jesus.
And Peter was standing by the sea, and a servant girl came up to him and said, "I was with Jesus of Galilee!"
And he denied in front of everyone present, saying: "I don't know what to say!"
And he went into the house and saw another servant and said to those who were there: "Even this one was with Jesus of Nazareth!"
Peter denied it again and swore, "I don't know this man!"
And after a little while, those standing nearby came up to Peter and said, "Surely one of us, for we see your glory!"
And he began to curse and swear and say: "I don't know this man!" And at that moment, the rooster crowed.
And Peter thought of Jesus' words to him: "Before the rooster crows three times, you will deny me." And he went out and wept bitterly.
Chapter Twenty-Seven
And early in the morning, the chief priests and the elders of the people came together, and they agreed to kill Jesus.
They stripped him and brought him before the governor Pilate. Judas Iscariot, who had betrayed him, cut his throat.
And it came to pass, when Dick had seen Judah, who had betrayed him, saying, "I have betrayed the Son of Man, for thirty pieces of silver," that he repented, and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
I told them: "I'm sorry that I let someone off the hook." They said to me: "It's not our problem, sort it out yourself."
Judas threw the silver coin into the Temple, and then went away and hanged himself.
And they took the heads of the silver-tongued religious men and said: "It is not permissible for us to put it in the treasury of the House of God, for it is the price of a human being's blood."
They agreed to buy the clay field and turn it into a garden for the foreigners.
And because of this, people still call this land "the land of blood" to this day.
And you shall take thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that is valued, from among the people of Israel, to hire a craftsman, and with it you shall buy for yourself a field.
"And with these words, they bought the field of clay, just as the Lord commanded me." Jesus before the governor Pilate.
And Jesus stood before the governor who questioned him, saying, "Is he (Jesus) the king of the Jews?" And Jesus answered him, "You have said it."
And whenever the religious leaders and elders accused him, he would not answer them at all.
Pilate said to him, "Have you not heard all this testimony against you?"
Jesus did not answer him a single word, which amazed the governor greatly.
And it was the custom of the ruler that every Easter, one prisoner would be released to please the people.
And they had a prisoner, a famous one, named Jesus Barabbas, at that hour.
And when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release for you, Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
As Pilate knew there was envy among them, he presented Jesus to them.
And while Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him this message: "Have nothing to do with that man, for I have suffered greatly in a dream from him today."
But the religious leaders and elders incited the crowds to ask Pilate to release Barabbas and to crucify Jesus.
Pilate said to them, "Then, of the two, which one do you want me to release to you?" And they answered, "Barabbas."
And Pilate said unto them, "What shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ?" And they all said, "Crucify him!"
I asked them, "What kind of trouble are you in?", but they only increased their silence and answered me, "Be quiet!"
And when Pilate saw that nothing could be gained, and that the crowd continued to stir, he washed his hands before them and said, "I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves."
And the whole people answered him, saying, "Let his blood be on us and on our children!"
And at that hour they released for them Barabbas, but Jesus they handed over to be crucified, after they had beaten him. The soldiers were mocking Jesus.
The soldiers of the ruler Jesus led him to the ruler's palace, and they gathered all the army around him.
They stripped him and dressed him in red silk.
They bound a crown of thorns around his head, and put a reed in his right hand, and began to bow down before him, mocking him, and saying, "Peace be upon you, O king of the Jews!"
They pushed him down, kissed his cheeks, and hit him on the head with the staff.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him and put a crown of thorns on his head, and they gave him a reed to carry as a staff. Jesus was crucified.
And as they were leaving the city, they met a man from Carthage named Simon, and they compelled him to carry the cross of Jesus.
And they reached the place that I called "Al-Jaljuta," which means the place of the skull.
They gave him wine mixed with a herb called "amr," but when he tasted it, he didn't want to drink it.
They crucified him and divided his garments among them after striking him with a reed.
And they remained calm under pressure.
And above his head they placed a sign that read: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
You have two clocks with him, one on his right and the other on his left.
And the people who were designing would measure him, and they would look at themselves.
And they said: "He who leaves the house of God and rebuilds it in a day, is as a son of God; he will come down from the cross!" When?
And the leaders were religious scholars, legal experts, and elders, even they would laugh at him and say:
Other people survived, but he couldn't save his own head! If only he had been the King of Israel, he would have come down from the cross right now and we would have believed in him!
Rely on God! He will surely save him now if he wants, since he said: "I am the Son of God!"
Even the thieves who were crucified with him reviled him, saying, "Why are you not saving yourself, Jesus?"
And darkness fell over the entire country from the silence of the day until the third hour of the evening.
Despite the three hours of darkness, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
They heard only a few of those standing there say: "He's calling for Elijah."
One of them took hold of the top, dipped it in the vinegar, and put it to his head, holding it up to drink.
They said to each other: "Let's see what comes to save him!"
And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and breathed his last.
The raw materials of the House of God are revealed to both, from above and below. The earth trembles and the rocks split.
And the tombs are made beautiful, and many holy people follow death.
And they came forth from the graves after following Jesus from death, and entered Jerusalem, the holy city, and appeared to a great multitude of people.
And when the captain and the soldiers who were with him saw the earthquake and what was happening, they were very afraid and said, "Truly this man was the Son of God."
And a great number of women who had followed Jesus from Galilee, who were mourning over him, beheld these things from afar. Luke
Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. They were buried with Jesus.
And in the evening, a man came to him, dressed in linen, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus.
And this man entered and approached the governor Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. And at that hour Pilate commanded that it be given to him.
And God raised Joseph in rank and wrapped him in a pure shroud.
And he placed her in the new tomb that he had hewn out of the rock, and he rolled a great stone over the entrance to the tomb, and he walked away.
And Mary Magdalene and another Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. They were mourning over it.
And the next day, after the day they had gathered there from the day after the Sabbath, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together with Pilate.
He said: "We thought, Sir, that that liar, when he was alive, used to say that he would leave in three days. But when?"
Eva, give the order to keep the guard at the grave until the third day, so that his disciples do not come at night to steal it and tell the people: 'He has risen from the dead! This ridiculous lie will be discredited from the outset."
He said to them, "Have you nothing better to do? Go and make the tomb secure as you wish."
They went and saw the room in the tomb, and they put a stone over the entrance.
Chapter Twenty-Eight: Jesus Followed from Death
And when the sabbath day was past, at the rising of the sun, Mary Magdalene and another Mary went to see the sepulcher.
And suddenly, a strong earthquake occurred, and the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and rolled away the stone from the entrance of the tomb and sat upon it.
And his form was resplendent like lightning, and his clothing was white as snow.
And they trembled with fear, following the condition of the dead.
But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid! I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
The way is here, as it followed death as it said. Come and see the place where it was placed.
They will go astray and tell their followers that he (the Prophet) has been taken by death, and that he will precede them to al-Quds (Jerusalem), and then you will see where he is. Now, I have informed you."
And the girls came out of the grave, trembling and very happy, and they ran to deliver the news to their classmates.
And he met them unexpectedly, and said to them, 'Peace be with you!' And they came up to him, worshipping him, and saying, 'Help us!'
Jesus said to them, "Do not leave. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, for there I will be seen." They went and told him what had happened.
And when the girls left, some of the elders went from the graveyard to the city and informed the religious leaders about what had happened.
They gathered with the elders and consulted about this, and bribed the soldiers with a lot of money.
Tell them: "Say that the students of his class came at night, stole it, and we were sleeping."
Otherwise, the governor will spread the news. We will convince him, and you shouldn't expect anything bad from this.
They took the money and did as they were told, and this news spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus entrusted his disciples.
But when the disciples came to Capernaum, they went up into the mountain, as Jesus had commanded them, and there he taught them. (Matthew)
And they did not see him, but they bowed down to him; yet some of them murmured.
And as he drew near to them, Jesus spoke to them, saying, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Acts
And teach them to do what I have commanded you, and I am with you all the days until the end of time."
The first chapter of the Gospel of John introduces John the Baptist, who testifies to the light, that is, Jesus.
This is the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah:
The sound of the wind in the desert and the echo: "I send my messenger before you who will show you the way."
And John went into the wilderness, baptizing and teaching people about the baptism of repentance so that they might receive forgiveness of their sins from God. They found the way of the Lord, and they walked in his paths.
And all the people that were in Judea and Jerusalem went out to him, and were baptized of him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.
And John the Baptist used to wear clothes made from the hair of camels, and a belt of leather, and he used to eat locusts and wild honey.
And he was saying to the people, "After me, there will come one who is stronger than I am, and we will not be worthy to bend down even to untie his shoelaces.
"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." - John baptizing Jesus
And Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And verily, at the hour that he emerged, the sky was made fairer, and the Spirit of God descended upon him like a dove.
And you will hear one voice from heaven saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Matthew 3:17; 12:18; Mark 9:7; Luke 3:22 Satan tempts Jesus.
For your sake, the time had come for the Spirit of God, Jesus, to go into the wilderness.
And forty days passed, and Satan continued to tempt him. The beasts were raging at him, and the angels were fighting against him. Jesus was preaching in Galilee.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went into Galilee to preach the gospel of God.
"Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand. And if you believe in the gospel, you will be saved." (Mark 1:15) Jesus began to choose his first disciples. (Matthew 3:2)
And as Jesus walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen, and he said to them, "Come, follow me."
He said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
They left their windows open and followed him.
And he increased a little, and saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat mending their nets.
And Jesus, knowing that they intended to take him by force to make him king, withdrew again into the mountain by himself. With him were the disciples, and a great crowd who had come to him out of all Judea and Jerusalem, and who were convinced of his power and wonder-working.
And they went to Capernaum. On the Sabbath day, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.
People were amazed by his teaching, as he was teaching them as if he had authority, not like the scholars of the Sharia. When?
And the mosque was inhabited by a man from the other world, he began to speak.
Saying: "What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Did you come to kill us? I know who you are: you are the Holy One of God!"
And Jesus, rising up, said unto the spirit, "Be still, and come out of the man!"
The jinn man fell to the ground and began to struggle, and the jinn struggled hard and emerged from him.
And all the people were amazed, and they began to question each other: "What is this? This is a new education that teaches them by force; even madness obeys them when they command!"
Gradually, the news of Jesus spread throughout all Galilee. Jesus revealed himself to Peter and to many others.
And Jesus went out with James and John from the house of prayer, and they walked towards Simon's and Andrew's house.
And Nisibe, Simon's mother, lay in bed, suffering from fever, and they told Jesus about her.
He approached her, took her hand, and squeezed it. The heat left her face, and she felt a chill.
In the evening, the sun's last rays, people brought Jesus the sick and those possessed by demons.
People from the city had gathered near the door.
Jesus healed many who suffered from various diseases, and drove out many demons from people. He did not allow the demons to speak, for they knew him. Jesus taught.
Jesus rose early in the morning, before dawn, and went out and walked to a solitary place, and began to pray.
And Simon and those with him began to look for him.
And when they found him, they said to him: "Because people are looking for you!"
And he said to them, "Come, let us go into the nearby towns so that I may proclaim the good news, for it is for this that I have come."
And he went throughout all the region of Galilee, preaching the gospel, and healing all that were oppressed by the devil. Matthew 4:23; 9:35 Jesus healed a man possessed by a demon.
Then a man who was blind and lame came to Jesus, and threw himself at his feet, and begged him, saying, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me see."
We approached him, extended our hand, touched him, and said: "I wanted it, so let's be clean!"
The clock's hands have strayed from the correct time, and the pure one has departed.
Jesus sternly told him not to tell anyone, and sent him away alone, saying:
"Be careful not to say anything to anyone! But go and show your purification to the priest and give them what Moses commanded, so that it may serve as a testimony for them."
