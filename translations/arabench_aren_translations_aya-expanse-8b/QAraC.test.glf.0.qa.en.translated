If you don't want it, I do.
O Sultan, what are you saying?
It is forbidden for you, opportunity after opportunity, it comes to us with our hand, we let it slip away from us, it is forbidden.
Later, I'm not being greedy about the topic; I have a right to take it, and you actually have a right to take it before me.
Sultan, and whoever blesses your parents, don't bring us problems.
"Sa'al (asks) don't happen, I seek forgiveness from Allah."
Can you honestly say that there's a brother advising his brother about what he's been saying?
You're hungry.
In front of you, I found a plate with bread and meat.
The Chinese have no ruler, no patron, and no boundaries.
Say the truth to yourself
This plate is not in front of us again.
Don't be stubborn, Saleh.
We missed the opportunity.
La la la, don't try, impossible, impossible, it's not me who does this.
The problem is that he's afraid.
He's afraid of something.
This is a government project where everyone takes and sucks up resources.
This is a rule.
Now, people who have no interest in projects take them.
He is the head of a large project committee.
It means "Why are we here, it's like he has the thread and the needle."
The Global Beaches Project for the Third Millennium (Phase 1 Infrastructure)
The bull gored him.
This is the one with the vacuum.
If he has taken it.
And what does that have to do with you?
You have the right to take from their project.
Since his car was broken down.
It wasn't me who used to bring him to the project site.
La la if this is your right.
Whoever gives you the right to your car's oil four times and five times.
Leave it to me.
Don't become what you read and follow your head.
Extend your hand and push.
The phrase "جوف خميس ريل خالتك" translates to "Your aunt's Thursday is deep." Please note that this translation is literal and may not make sense in English as it appears to be a poetic or idiomatic expression in the original language.
Now, according to your saying, they say you're a millionaire.
A third of the right to speak is the right to be heard.
One-third commission.
The one who breaks up in the popular band.
They tell you to organize a party for the nation.
And they bought a new lamp.
What did they do?
We finished the class.
There's no use, Auntie.
May God guide him, God willing.
And he will eat with him.
Last night, I tried all night.
This is an opportunity.
So that good may spread.
And may goodness, God willing, spread far and wide.
This is something known.
The prophet said, "The matter should be between us."
Don't come out.
Afterwards, I'll recommend.
Just the quarter
A problem that can stop us like a bone in the throat.
The real estate market is declining.
Sitting with him today
Two hours in the morning.
And he began to be convinced.
We have a meeting with him later.
We need to work on it together, you and me fairly.
The one who cuts our livelihood.
They only started socializing with him with the hope of gaining his favor.
My brother Ali, my brother Osman.
I don't know.
Assuming that today is my first day of work.
May I ask you?
How isn't it possible?
Sure, here is the translation: "Definitely, but are you sure you're taking it?"
Now I'm just asking you.
You're hungry and not on track.
Do you eat or not?
I am of the kind that eats.
What's on you
Chinese violin
We're still in the first item of the meeting.
If you can.
And if you have a fear.
I am the one who wants to know.
You and I are part of the project.
God guide you, Saleh.
You may be because this is the first time you have participated as a committee chair in a government project.
And this is simple, and I am your brother.
Our share is being lowered
I included the project budget.
How are you?
So no one will feel the situation.
We put a cap on the amount.
This amount has been vacuumed.
by the LLC managers of the project
What will happen?
No, no, no, Saleh.
Do you know the rules?
It seems like there's a little bit of fear inside you.
This is his right, of course.
In the end, it all comes down to
That means everything is in our hands.
It's not that attractive.
What's the matter? In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. What's the matter?
My friend's new car is amazing.
He says
The car of his friends is okay, fine.
And in a distinguished location.
Whoever has money can do it.
What would you say if someone told me or heard me?
The one who bought the land and registered it in his name.
He told me, "Please."
He wishes he had the money in his hand.
It attracts now again.
It seems like there might be a typo in your text. "مب احنا هله" doesn't translate directly into English as it's in a non-standard dialect. A possible interpretation could be "Aren't we here?" in a colloquial Egyptian Arabic accent. A more standard translation would be "Aren't we here?" in Modern Standard Arabic, which is "أليس نحن هنا؟" (Ālis nāḥnu huna?)
"خلاص يعني" translates to "That's it, means" in English.
Where are we going?
He'll let us out through the east door.
He wants to sell his soul for a bite to eat.
Don't shake your head.
Or else your brother.
Come sit down, there's nothing to worry about. Just let your mind relax.
I stayed up all night for him.
I told him that it doesn't matter if they die, they deserve it.
I made Lin agree.
And these are the obligations.
Inshallah, you won't just take it once.
This project is for global beaches of the third millennium.
(Infrastructure) between brackets
He will come back later to start the second phase.
And you keep going with him.
May God reward you for your efforts.
You've made it beautiful, but I'll only agree.
And you are like everyone else.
But there's nothing in it.
But hopefully, you convinced him.
We want a percentage.
They are all agreed about it.
Even after he agreed.
It seems they are boycotting the budget-setting meeting for the project.
We should follow their rules and guidelines.
We've got them covered, we're sure of it.
I'll do it as soon as possible so that it can be approved.
Take your time.
My brother, do you know him?
This will become the brother-in-law of the madam, he is with me now.
This means
You have doors, windows, and everything related to finishes.
Delicious, delicious
That's enough for us to finish.
You have clearly defined your rights.
We are taking something.
Let's give ourselves a week to think.
We determine the amount we will take.
We are people waiting and hoping.
Abdulaziz's words are just.
One person determines his own worth at 500,000.
He has relaxed himself this week.
He specifies the amount he wants.
They decided, they thought, they determined.
How are you?
Do as you please.
You don't have to worry about them.
What's your companion (or friend) and what's your condition (or what's wrong)?
How come God put this with us?
What, are you going to put this into the project? Here?
This is a government project.
Your brother's name is Sultan.
These are my neighbor's houses.
It took us hours to figure out the car was broken down.
Record it for me.
Abdullah's document
La la in three, then others.
What can I do about it? I don't want to.
I'll tell him, just leave it, let's finish our budget.
No, no, this is a flat fee.
And I stand in awe of him.
Poor him, he has children.
Whoever has a Zaidi, let him give five and a quarter of his mother's inheritance.
And a quarter of his mother
Everyone stuck to their guns.
How much more will you distribute to them?
Wade returned.
The kind mother when mentioned
Yes, mom.
Just laugh, but this is the last one, dad.
No, dad, you can't go to Thailand to get treated.
Moment by moment, heal.
And how are you carrying this burden?
Just stay in the first phase between the brown [infrastructure]
Used fan
Add three thousand to them.
Buy me Thai watches where the whole face shines like this.
I recorded it.
What leadership?
I don't need to register it, I just wanted to confirm your name.
My dear, I say to you, "O mother."
Make the Chinese dish bigger.
Just simply, the budget needs to be set. It can't be this open like this.
Tomorrow, let's have a meeting where everyone shares the amount they have in mind.
Afaa 'alij (أفى عليك) translates to "May it be upon you" in English.
One million enough
Wide, my love.
Guys, guys, just give us a moment, please.
The committee is meeting as they decide on the project budget. It's closed now, the money issue is resolved.
I stay extra.
We told you to keep quiet about the scandal. You're sitting in the ministry's courtyard.
Oh, our supporters, don't embarrass us.
Hey, is everyone here having a good time?
We connected the electricity, but it hit us with a shock.
Stop creating confusion for us in the ministry's square.
Come on, come on.
The cut you heard.
I'm sorry, but I can't translate this text as it contains non-English characters. The correct translation would depend on the context and the specific characters used. If you provide the text in a supported language, I'd be happy to assist with the translation.
Without my brother
With the project, all of us means all fifty million.
This is the first phase, but only 50 million.
The amount has been transferred.
Ha Saleh
Oh, you real man, take care of the half-sheep (or: "Salam, the keeper of the half-sheep").
In general, get well soon.
And now, come on, calm down, let's get to work. All the beneficiaries are waiting for us, you know.
It's not a problem, but the most important thing is that we don't want budget-based discussions and that's it.
And from tomorrow we will start implementing the project.
It serves a very large segment of the community.
This is a project for global beaches of the third millennium, may God bless it.
This is the first stage, God willing.
(Infrastructure) between brackets
This project is for future generations.
Of course, here is the translation: "Naturally, in the name of the program's family, we would like to congratulate you and also congratulate you on the opening of the project, which I believe will be tomorrow, God willing."
And it took a million and a half years of work to achieve it.
One and a half years
Of course, the translation into English is: "Once again, under the name of the Future Bids Program."
This project is
For future generations
May God continue to bestow upon us the blessings of oil.
Second, third, and tenth stages
With the presence of a representative
Welcome to him and easy.
They are the ones who move us here when the cars come to take us.
And where should we go now?
Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. I have grown old and senile, you.
We both sat in the sun, we died of heat.
The people build
But I don't see anything.
My only path is the sea.
Why like that?
Iman told me that your sister Manira congratulates you.
About the story of my father who is in the desert.
I said, "Be fair. See for yourself and hear from those who told her. They're spreading false news."
This is the land.
But when one sees a villa by the sea, they say, "This is my father's."
Later on, I'll get back to these things.
You have brothers.
They work hard, praise be to God, invest in land, real estate, and companies.
I hold the head.
Ava ya Iman
And then, my sister...
How does that mean you don't know?
They forced me to give it to them.
These two are your brothers.
And there's nothing sweeter than honesty.
Because money
We've come to trust her to get us to the hospital.
She has been in court for several years with her brothers.
Nineteen years old, if not older.
Never again
The brothers of Al-Maslamin are thieves.
He came back and yesterday you told me.
All I want is for you to build me a mosque before I die.
You never know.
I don't say that your brothers are like that, God forbid.
Now that my father has passed away, it has been X years.
Why are you asking now?
And she saw the villa.
Wait a moment.
He goes to see her every three months.
The falcon gave us a hint, let's figure out what's going on.
As per will
We have changed, by God, sisters who don't even look at an aria.
The solution is with me.
Where from?
And it's not like my flux.
Manira Shagoof
And whoever surrenders to you, their hearts are in your hands.
It became fifty thousand.
Because I bravely asked about my father's land in the desert.
I'm sure my rights are more than this.
Every unit resides in that villa.
Their children are in the best schools.
I am vertical, Mirna.
I won't remain silent about my right.
I'll take my share.
We should invest our money in the company, it's better than leaving it idle.
Every second head
Compassion has died in the hearts of people.
Do not say that your brothers will be better than my brothers.
"جوفيني انا" translates to "I am young" in English.
Twelve years
And I am adapting to these courts.
And in the end
Neither did I take right nor wrong.
Why are they doing this?
That's why I tell you, "Mom, control them."
Take them gently.
They are laughing loudly.
So why do courts take so long?
We are all four hundred thousand.
If we reach millions like other countries,
By God, Mom, I didn't even expect a verdict to be issued.
You are my brothers.
I swear to God, Mom, I don't want anything.
Oh, mom, what do I say?
I don't say "it's not our fault," but rather, "We rely on God and He is the best of agents against the unjust."
"Al-Hamdu lillah wa n-na'am al-wakil." Translation: "Praise be to God, and [He is] the Best Disposer of affairs."
You didn't have a court date last week.
I will be back, mom.
The judge says write a memo.
And this is how we are, from memory to memory.
Look, mom, they're investing millions while you're just watching.
And as I told you, adapt to your page and implement it.
He doesn't deserve it.
That's why I say if I were you.
Shut up and take what they give me.
Because the woman
Your father's permission is enough for us.
The real question is.
What does "اهيه عن عندها يعني" mean in English? It translates to: "What does she mean by that?"
"Ashويه" is likely a dialectal or colloquial term, making the translation challenging without context. However, based on the rest of the sentence, a possible translation could be: "A bunch of questions about their share and stuff like that."
I just want to know and then leave.
If the evidence
Open it and replace it.
I cannot translate "ابيذلف ابروح" into English as it does not form a coherent or meaningful phrase in any known language.
Do you expect us to sign a waiver?
Fifty-two, her train is moving.
It appears that you are trying to translate a phrase from an Arabic dialect. The translation to English would be: "It seems that your head is in the storm." Please note that the phrase structure and word choice might vary depending on the specific dialect and context.
What made her speak now?
But greed
And a garden is not my share.
My father left me a clear inheritance, or else how could it be?
Neither I nor he/she determines.
This is the will of God.
Why are they torturing my father in his grave?
I expected my brothers to act like this.
This money and what it doesn't do.
She has been working for 30-40 years.
I don't know how to act, Nasser.
Land, buildings, and real estate are easy to recognize.
How do they make the most money?
Even the company
You are entitled to go and find out everything.
And I am not them.
How do you go back to them?
It's up to you.
And it's not up to you, I have the right to know everything.
An agency without a gatekeeper.
Make your choice and I'll make it official.
This official authorization allows him to access everything in our company.
Saker Saad
Yay, long tongue!
Falcon freedom
Brother Nasser
With your permission, I'll take it.
At your service, anytime.
And there you are in front of me.
With your permission, let's go.
Don't let him catch us doing anything.
Sure, the translation of the given text into English is: "Definitely now if I were to complain."
And he said, "Are you able to do it?"
Means leave it to his discretion.
In his hand, he holds an official document.
We can't officially prevent it.
He has the right to know everything.
If the budget and accounts are dry
We give her forty thousand every three months.
If the budget is dry and the justice is precise.
Hit twelve in eight.
Adorn her part into three.
Thirty-two
Do you know how much it costs?
This is what we're asking for.
This is different from knowing about the lands and projects.
And we managed.
We don't fear what they fear.
Welcome, but we don't need this.
He goes to take care of her.
They give their sisters small amounts of money to live on.
Mixed once
Her husband supports her.
Mixing money is bad.
Yes, this is the right statement.
At your service.
Let him rest.
Even my office
My brother Rashid means that it was supposed to be like this from the beginning.
At your service
File File
When I found out her true inheritance.
Apart from villas and lands you're not aware of.
They came out seven.
Look and you will see.
Weak and blind
She was shocked.
God forbid.
Stay behind them.
And if you want to spare your parents' honor, don't bring up the court case.
The most precious thing in a human being.
The coldest thing for a rival.
Precise text
And then he says his usual phrase.
Four thousand seven hundred and some (exact amount unclear)
Do you see a holiday there, dad?
You shouldn't leave the room at all, Mom.
God heal you, Inshallah.
La la, the house is your house, what's the problem?
My sister and I are radiant.
After we locked the door and threw him out of the company.
A guy from my school days came by.
One named Abdullah
What do you expect?
I miss you too.
It means he can affect them.
Inshallah, he will be able to.
AI AI AI
Do not resort to courts.
I see courts as nothing but memoranda.
And his delays and his killing by lawyers on trivial matters.
The years passed.
And life goes by.
And you don't take even one shekel from them.
May Allah have mercy on her, Am Salimin.
She left me a will one day before she died.
She told me to bear and go to court.
Our courts are like this.
She died and didn't take her share of the inheritance.
She died and the case is still with the judge.
What if we were like the second country?
Hello Abdullah
Abdullah the brother
Many years have passed.
This is my brother Saad.
May God keep you safe and sound.
The most important thing.
Gathering and brotherhood
Brother Rashid
You are like my brother.
Don't let problems, money, and
You have another topic, besides your sister's topic, to talk about.
Please, if you would.
Why is he silent?
He's right.
We are hoarding our father's lawful share.
Yesterday, my mother told me that your sister-in-law, Sa'ad, has passed away.
Her father is a correspondent for the ministry.
It's all halal (permissible) according to my father.
We've been patient all this time.
Let's take a look at this last attempt.
I sent them your friend Abdullah.
They showed their disrespect for him by speaking ill of him and expelling him.
Let's see what volunteer Abdulrahman Ashbiswy does with them.
That's right.
He told me, "Inshallah, Nasser."
An eye for an eye
Threaten them with court.
You forgot the late Am Salimin and her pilgrimage from the courts.
It is possible that the brothers of Am Salmin are used to the court proceedings.
Just brothers
They might be afraid of what people say.
They might say it's a flaw to go to court, what will people say about us?
Let's see what the volunteer Abdulrahman is up to.
May God welcome and bless you.
His speech is eloquent.
Hold the door.
What do you say, my son?
He is saying the truth.
Please go outside for God's sake.
I am going to court tomorrow morning.
Why should I delay until tomorrow?
After that, I'll decide, not you.
What does "اشبيصر يعني من احين ل عقب باجر" mean in English? **Translation:** "What does 'from now until tomorrow' mean?"
Hello, my brother Rashid.
Take it from me.
I've told you before.
Threaten them with the court.
He's begging me to delay my departure now.
Because they have dried up the truth, my dear.
It's necessary to go to your sister Noro's place.
What's this?
Hah, you told me what's this? May God keep you safe.
Those present offer their greetings.
A very small 3D model of a courthouse building.
May Allah bless you.
Those present offer their greetings.
Control your anger.
The only thing you said was "ما غير انتي" (You're the only one).
Don't go today.
Leave it for tomorrow.
For God's sake, I've prepared this document for the court building.
Ready, the effort we put into it, the path will be illuminated.
Two people came from this door.
The first thing you enter through the door
Put away all your toys.
My phone is made of metal so it doesn't make beep beep beep beep beep.
You said, "I'm going to the 8th floor, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, elevator."
Destroying documents
Get the specific one if you need it, for example, a particular type of judge.
And this is after
Do you want to complain about us?
Let's light the path.
And we wonder when you will take your rights.
You take the 6000
As he said
Goodbye
He came over for dinner at my sister's place today.
Oh, they agreed to his ministry project, Boulaid.
My sister told me she's flying with joy, she can't believe it.
He told me to rely on my project for dinner.
Thank God, after all, it's a matter of luck, once upon a time.
God, what joy you have now, Abu Walid.
I don't know.
My sister told me yesterday that she slept from happiness.
Returned, by the grace of God, O Manal.
My father, he has nothing to do with these matters, but Allah has provided him with righteous children.
Inshallah, say the truth to my father.
Forgive us, we are trapped in the palace.
We have no shortage or lack of Olay (a popular brand name in the Middle East).
God bless you, O father Walid, you didn't disappoint.
God will enrich you and increase your blessings, God willing.
You are a good cook, God bless you, Walid.
Now you have a good accountant and a secretary to organize your work.
They told me, "Just run the office and leave the rest to us."
Please, Uncle.
And my beloved looked into my eyes.
I want a BlackBerry
We want to build a bigger house.
See how he responds.
We agreed today to receive a word after eating.
And now, esteemed guests, with the permission of the project owner, Abu Bou Walid, please proceed with your speech, thank you.
Forgive us again.
Congratulations, congratulations, O father Walid.
You deserve it. May blessings be upon you. You deserve it.
To be honest, you're not really involved in business and trade.
Man, this project has a story, you guys.
How are you?
See how it means "Alhamdulillah" in English.
That year
One day, the Japanese national team will play with us.
I am standing in the market.
I don't know about it.
This is a catalog from a manufacturing plant with multiple ministry halls that have requested samples from us.
Any brave person will build for you.
What is understood
Any contractor
These Japanese are not playing.
Just say "stop" and the computer will listen.
I want to go to the cinema.
I want a kitchen that feels like a kitchen.
I'll tell you the day I submitted the catalog for the ministry committee.
How does your agreement with the factory look?
I paid them a sum
مقدم يعني "introducer" or "presenter" in English.
The most important thing is to reach an agreement with the factory.
Thank God, I signed it.
Give me a delay after now means ask for my first order.
I'm finally done with this.
Adopting it is correct.
Let's just wait and see what Sheikh Fahd's signature looks like.
How are you, secretary?
He told me, "Bo Fahd didn't show up."
Ask for a seat for yourself.
Ha yaabu Walid bashar sawit
The problem with Fahd is that you never know if he will come or not.
The day exists.
He doesn't have time.
It means "So come here now."
You are the manager here.
Tabi bo Fahd yadkhini.
It's the necessary one that matters.
All these files are scattered all over my desk and need to be signed by Bo Fahd.
The solution means
God help you.
It's 2:15, Abu Walid.
The shift is over.
I don't think Boufhad will come.
God help you, come tomorrow.
You say that the manager knows him from a long time ago and is a friend of yours.
Heal you, woman.
The manager is taking a picture of his team in the office.
Excusing the time, they are sitting at their desks.
Just a loss of starch in their pockets.
I can't translate this text accurately as it appears to be a mix of languages, possibly Arabic and Persian, and contains unintelligible words. If you provide the text in a single language, I'd be happy to assist with the translation.
It means "They're not doing anything meaningful."
They don't move a chair unless Prince Fahd orders it.
The manager didn't ask about you yesterday.
The interests of God's creation are neglected.
It means "So, after you leave, you'll go to them."
God damn it.
Every day, I encounter a problem.
Because the factory is giving me an extension.
Never, God forbid, may he say that.
And if they ask about you?
It's not just that you're waiting for Bou Fahad.
Look at these files.
They're all waiting for Bou Fahad's signature.
I expect today.
Relax, you lot.
Or go take a walk.
If I'll talk to you.
If something happens, just don't call, you'll scare them half to death.
Goodbye, take care.
Forgiveness, the lady is shocked.
Oh son, from which city are you agreeing to my appointment?
But what are men doing, brother? What kind of talk is this?
Don't worry, I will make sure my daughter's university registration and scholarship papers are completed so we don't miss the deadline.
And my problem with the factory is the slow pace.
Be patient for a while.
All your transactions are encrypted.
He drinks his coffee, but as soon as he's done, he'll go over to them.
He said, "Just calm down."
May you live long.
Goodbye
Moment by moment, guys.
A moment, where are we going? Be patient for a while.
Understand what happened.
What happened after?
I have a significant trip planned.
He has a private door.
This case is back
Our interests have stopped, brother.
Every day, we make a new resolution.
What should we do, wait for Fahd?
Your efforts are appreciated.
The blame for what he blamed is from God.
Where do I find it, or how?
The factory in Japan
The rain showered down as the deadline approached.
Your aunt is from the second side.
She is poor, she has lost all her money.
Where do I find it, here or there?
Mom, I'm really scared for dad.
Don't leave him alone.
Who am I talking to?
Hello from me
Bou Walid
So you're telling me about the factory and your sister-in-law's money.
Look at Bo Fahd, yeah.
Means, "Tell me when to expect it, dad."
They can't find anything good to say.
This is what we're waiting for Boufhad.
Yabbe, you're not doing enough for me.
But all my friends are still at university next week.
The phrase "شدور يبه" seems to be a mix of languages and may not have a direct translation in English. If we assume it's a combination of Arabic and Persian, it could be interpreted as "hard work" (Arabic: "شدور" = hard work, Persian: "يبه" = work, effort). However, without context, it's difficult to provide a precise translation.
Phone dad.
No matter if your intention is only to test my patience, it's just you.
Excuse me, I don't understand.
I see a lion.
I don't know what to tell you, sister.
You've been patient with us a lot.
God will succeed.
Bo Walid's condition is not known.
I caught him in my hot yacht, shivering and trembling.
Because the deadline is near its end.
He has five days left.
He'll spend all his money on it.
"Al-Hamdu lillah" translates to "Praise be to Allah" in English. "حسبي الله عليه" (Husbi'llah 'alayhi) means "Allah is sufficient for me" or "I rely on Allah."
Burn me, burn me, burn me.
Inshallah, better feelings.
This one is strangely hot.
The text above is jumbled.
The second text under the mall is not moving.
Your noise left me at 50%
Do it at a discount for me.
Do not worry.
Your affairs, God willing, will all turn out fine.
And my sister didn't fail.
She said she's waiting for her money to come in a bit.
May God reward her well.
I escaped from your detention but
Our manager, may God help him, is our manager.
It seems our manager heard.
God knows what he [the manager] is up to these days.
I'll get it from him or from BuFahd.
God, this is a problem.
And tomorrow is the last day.
I am losing my mind.
Do not tire us out, God.
Aim for the brain, aim for the brain.
Where did you get the idea to speak?
You bring me your worries from the connected (or linked) world.
Brother Walid
I'm reaching out to you because you're on my mind.
Just stay by the phone.
Goodbye
For as long as I can remember, I have been a dedicated human being.
We used to hold you up as an example.
Don't think I'm ignoring your daily outings after work.
I am able to deduct from you.
And then with this mobile phone
Instead of deducting from you
I put you on the inventory committee.
Go with them today, the inventory.
I cannot and should not leave work.
And when the sun rises
Don't blame me after that.
Today is the last day for the poor guy.
He is waiting for his mother's call, her phone is on silent.
I'm afraid they'll fire him from his job.
Oh, Abu Walid, my phone rang.
It breaks the heart.
Let him go, poor thing.
O father of Walid
Here is the translation of "ها بشر الو" into English: "Behold, O people!"
What's wrong, Abu Walid? I'm not calling you on the phone.
Finish your transaction.
And don't worry.
You can't blame them, God knows.
The apparent continuance of the lion's roar
Sorry, I can't translate this text as it appears to be in a non-English language, possibly Arabic. The phrase "اشتبوني اسوي لكم" doesn't have a direct translation in English as it seems to be a colloquial or idiomatic expression.
This is a high-ranking official.
Where does he go?
God speed Pakistan.
My brother, where are you in Pakistan?
Pakistan's Oz is the third office on the right.
I do not marry.
Look at Boufhad
Don't sit down.
Don't look at me.
Or else you want?
House by house
Forward
Guys, the real one is in.
Do you know how long I've been waiting?
And all these years, you
Arrange the papers and bring the papers.
Ride, fall.
Wander and meander among the halls.
But we were young.
What I see in front of you, I'm afraid of life, I put my bread on my shoulder like this, as if I were carrying a child's plaster.
And after Allah has granted you safety, I learned how to ride a bicycle.
Especially after the training I learned and bought.
Relly is a yellow-green hazard.
They flirted with me as I rode my bicycle, and woe betide me.
"لقمه العيش و تربيه العيال" translates to "earning a living and raising children" in English.
The manager has arrived.
When we finish, Inshallah, we'll have the sweet.
Thank God, thank God.
The family is finally giving up on the job.
I bear witness that you, Abu Sa'id, did not fail.
Now is the time for the prophet of comfort, my brother, and farewell, goodbye.
We're present.
What do you want after I extend your year?
Just just
May God reward you well.
You gave me four years.
If only I were retired by now.
All the kids got jobs.
The last one yesterday was continuous.
He's back now, Abu Abdulaziz.
I am looking for comfort.
No, and your job is a reporter.
On a good day, yes.
Believe it or not.
I am four years old, maybe five, I haven't tasted a cockroach yet.
It's nice on him.
I smell it in my nose.
Whatever you command will happen, God willing.
Request the human resources department for me.
You finished the papers.
I'm from yesterday.
Such a delay in your case.
Bro, I'm bored.
Just enough
Don't cut us off, please.
Hello, dad Khalid.
I'm done from this moment.
Inshallah, we will rest, father, and woe to him who does not.
Delicious, delicious
I'm at work and can't leave.
The general administration can manage human resources.
I have a transaction there.
I ask you to take it and deliver it to the civil service.
"Ts tsalam tsalam yabbe, ma atqasir" Translation: "Yes, you give, you receive, father, you never fail."
Where are you going?
I have to go to the bank, it's raining.
We are all determined.
Now
The bank is waiting for me.
Pickle it with someone.
I can't leave work right now.
Okay, okay, goodbye.
His appearance doesn't match the truth.
He says he can't come out.
What are you doing now?
Tomorrow morning, I'll stop by the bank.
After so many years of learning, I've become diligent.
He must be feeling frustrated.
This is better for him.
Let him rest now.
Poor Farah is happy to be going home.
He called me and said that Khalid is...
Send him so he can complete his transaction.
Fear God.
Everyone relies on themselves.
My mother regrets the sale.
From here, nothing gets destroyed.
I'm not sorry for the sales, mom.
I mean, as soon as someone gets off work, this happens.
Where does Khalid go and what does he do?
A sleeper in his chamber.
Those who lost themselves in their sea
Good morning, dad.
Hello, my daughter.
Yabe and the one who delivers you.
They just told me that the manager is very angry.
Bring me your receipt.
Hello, Am Sa'id
I'm telling you, let the kids learn to rely on themselves. What's wrong with you, can't you hear what I'm saying?
Leave only what you need.
A debt and a credit on me.
Here is the translation of the given text: "Here I am, waiting for you, with a fly in front of me."
Today we will eat it.
Goodbye, take care.
Oh, by the way, I almost forgot to tell you.
My dear father.
God help you.
Yes, the one who goes to the market.
Get out of here quickly.
Arise, my daughter, arise.
And the name of Allah is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
God bless you.
Zain deleted the house.
Eels eel ice
I'm telling you to stay at home.
Teach your children how to defend themselves.
Happy New Year
Their circumstances are difficult, I have to help them.
Alright, alright, relax.
And I'll bring you a glass of milk.
I will send you a scorpion to eat.
The poor guy is passed out.
And from taxis
Therefore, on his face.
The branch that was in the market is gone.
They are issuing the personal ID card.
After you get into your car.
Give him the papers.
Curse your father, thank God.
Everyone depends on themselves.
I told you.
I want you to rest.
Welcome to Ilse Yana
Don't miss a good meal.
Navigate from ministry to ministry, following government transactions.
Respectfully, I refer you to the relevant ministry.
Behind the children's transactions
Treat them with respect, both the elders and the young. You really are spoiling them.
Kids are holding down nice, important jobs.
What should we do since they are busy?
Every day, either a meeting with the manager, or with the responsible person, or with the minister.
It means they have nice jobs, but they need to wait for the right time to get them; woe betide them.
And you wander in trying to finalize your transactions, and maintain your dignity, and find another job that will sustain you, how will you survive?
May Allah reward you now.
Goodbye, take care.
Come on, forgive us again, O noble kings.
They finally called me and told me it's done.
If you text your dad tomorrow, he'll finalize the transaction for you.
I'm really going to be late.
Fear your Lord.
It's impossible tomorrow, especially today.
From his love for you
He's tired and frustrated with you and your actions towards him.
You don't even respect the gray hair in his head.
There's someone lying in the room for two days.
I am wandering in the streets and under this sun.
Here is the translation of the given text into English: "Here is your transaction."
And the spirit of trampling will complete its work for him.
The committee comes from the morning until the end of the day.
My reputation, oh mother.
My structure is late, indeed.
Madam, tomorrow is your last day and you have a committee meeting.
You need to settle your bill tomorrow.
Or else, at night, come and complain to me about them.
He has a committee that he must report to.
What's up with dad?
His tear in his eyes
I didn't even tell my dad.
The committee are the ones who changed their mind.
And they said, "By the end of the week."
Say the truth to your father.
Don't go, dad.
I'm going to heaven and I won't come back.
I'm not used to shaking like this in the cafeteria with these people.
Laughter at him.
Alright then
I'm going to apologize to him.
I'm going to him.
Thank you, dad.
Eternal rest, oh father.
Thank him wrong.
And it turned out that he was selfish after all.
And what tires you is not the day when the committee doesn't come.
You are the good and the blessing.
From today on
We handle our transactions ourselves.
Tells in the house
And here is your head to kiss.
Hala hala hala ya bok.
God wake you up in good health.
Dearest father
All over the world
Don't make me angry.
And I don't get bothered.
And after, just as I told you.
Finish this transaction, please.
I'd like to do it myself.
And they said to me, "Come, see quickly."
You have a meeting.
With the happiness of the minister
Make her moment happy, father.
I have argued with these elders.
My joy, they said your son is with them, and woe be to him, this is he.
Trust in God and make the best of your situation.
Bousaid, where are you?
And whoever guides you, O father.
If this situation is in front of me, then
Just be patient and I'll send you the envelope with the bed.
My dear father
It means that's what happened.
The apparent meaning is "He seems to have forgotten."
Because the committee agreed after an hour.
In proper Arabic transliteration, "لا الله يسلمك" translates to "May God not protect you."
I have a meeting with the minister today, and oh well.
Give me just the transaction.
My routine is work from home and home to work.
Where is everyone?
Peace be upon you.
And upon you be peace, oh father, peace be upon you.
La la la, I didn't say anything, nothing at all.
Which day of the week do you usually go to the beach?
And he tells you that there's a snake in the barn.
Where does he go in the morning?
He's taking his time there, of course.
No, and I'll add a line to that.
He tells you that his cook doesn't need it.
And with a spirit of him
Goodbye
May there be no harm.
May no harm come to my father.
God guide you, only.
La la, there's nothing in me, I have nothing.
Your papers are scattered.
That's in the villa.
This is too much.
Friendship deal
Thirsty, father, I want water.
Yip me my my.
My dear sons
No, no, just erase it, erase it. I don't want it.
Don't write like this.
I'll make them struggle.
My dear sister
And you are the truth.
Lalala killed him.
By God, my dear sister.
Allow me, my sister.
The ones they call the league and the cup.
And he spoke about the judgment.
I don't know what this child will say, where he will come from.
Grab them by their ears and their tails.
People have returned to their normal routines.
They give him a topic and tell him to speak on radio and television.
And what's more than this.
Take him, hold him, and throw him in prison, my sister.
Believe, my sister.
In modern times, only one's own efforts can help oneself.
I'm in a mess.
By God, if I die now.
I won't let him ramble, and as he says, we've had enough nonsense.
Praise God for his safety.
The blessing visited us.
Goodbye
I'm late for work like this, mom.
Listen, dad.
I stayed up all night last night.
And I warn you.
I just wanted to remind you, dad.
Alright, mom.
Impossible after contacting.
No radio, no TV, not even a mobile connection.
Your sister has been living in her apartment for two days.
And your fiancée, Monira, her tears flow four times on her cheeks.
It's forbidden for you, O father (yabe), have mercy on us and whoever has mercy on your parents.
As you said
We've had enough nonsense.
I still bother you.
See your uncle with a light.
After they put you in prison, Yana.
And he said, "That's it."
Unbutton the shirt.
"May God protect you, my father. The gift you gave him has brought him good. May nothing but good come to him."
The second time, he'll grab you by the hand and take you to court. Let his daughter go.
Alright, mom.
Repentance after I say.
If you call the radio or TV, you can only blame yourself.
Repent or face the consequences.
Let me go back, I have to leave now.
Just between you and me, that's all I'll say.
The manager told me.
We don't need it here.
He will probably go and cause trouble at the administration tomorrow.
He just makes things complicated for us.
Now, what should the manager say?
Yah has a million excuses to say.
Where should I go, that means.
Just means that's it, forget about it.
I miss you.
Yes, indeed.
Goodbye
I told you.
"It means, Saleh, I told you."
The public interest has compelled us to reduce the number of correspondents in the ministry.
Your statement is correct, but...
And the one who makes you surrender is just one, and we don't need any nonsense.
Sweet from you.
We've had enough nonsense.
Yes, indeed.
I am here to help. The Arabic text "انت ليحين اهني" translates to "You are here now" in English.
We have work, if you please.
What kind of mess is this, dad?
Len took care of matters.
I really miss you, my dear friend.
I won't let them destroy it.
Monira was standing and listening when I said to you.
The translation of "ای یبه قلت" from Persian to English is: "I said yes."
I'm hearing them say that Tony just came from the mall.
My spirit, now you are inside.
Let me talk to my dad.
We said it was a mistake to go to prison, and we kept quiet.
We remain silent now after what they have done.
Just because we're family.
Did you know how?
Protect yourself from Satan.
And God willing, only good things will happen.
Remember God; He will guide you.
I don't want to drink coffee, let your coffee be for you.
I know you.
Bored
Your uncle is giving you a two-week deadline.
By God, no one will grab you by the hand and take you to court to have you released.
Mom, even if I go out.
What did you get yourself into?
Just bear it.
Even if someone tells you
Don't pretend you don't hear it.
That's not all, we're in big trouble.
Yes, sir, it is.
But they didn't punish me these days.
Stop talking nonsense, man. We only want to hear it from you once, just once.
Just fine, that's all.
To be you the police.
La la mama, you misunderstood.
And my cousin has a problem, so we asked him to speak on the radio tomorrow.
He was a bit hesitant.
We felt that we had spoken to him in a public place, so he hesitated.
So I said, "It's right that I should go to my cousin's house and talk to him privately."
It means you felt he wanted to say something.
It means "indecisive and neither this nor that".
They returned from somewhere they came from.
Just just just just just just just
I am neither your mother nor do I know you, and I will be against you until the Day of Judgment. I heard and I obeyed.
Saleh Saad
"There is no God but Him, this is the final verdict, damn it, we're free from it, thank God."
You have a sense of responsibility.
An example of a successful employee.
But unfortunately
Despite my efforts.
Peace be upon you.
Why did you bother?
I'm just finishing up a call with the secretary to let you know that you shouldn't come.
How are you, Shahin?
You didn't know who she was.
Ah, there's no one in Qatar who doesn't know that this is just nonsense.
You're good, but stop the nonsense.
We've had enough nonsense.
Hey, the job.
But there are no jobs, which means understanding the circumstances.
You hired a real pro, didn't you?
I am a fool for the work we have here.
I didn't leave a place, Manireh, I didn't go anywhere.
Even if someone told me just five minutes before I arrived, he used to have a job, but they fired him, so it's gone.
My sister lived happily until her husband divorced her yesterday.
It means that my responsibility has become this big.
After one, his responsibility became that great.
God, I don't know what to do, God.
He's getting close to the minister.
To be honest, I don't think this is fair.
He thinks I'm afraid they'll put me in his place.
You've killed me already.
Who told you I'm going to basket?
I just want this distance to be this way, away from me.
I'm thinking about how to kill him.
Finish it once and for all.
Just listen.
I know him.
That's the one who speaks on the radio.
I'm sorry, but the text you provided appears to be in a language other than English or a mix of languages that I cannot translate accurately. Could you please provide a text in a language I'm capable of translating?
And just absorb the information.
You, Saleh, are a citizen filled with national spirit.
You are a patriotic citizen.
Delivered
I have given up, by God.
I consider your voice to be the voice of truth.
I, after chatting with him a bit, told Bu-Fahd.
Return to your true self, O Saleh.
He says we haven't heard from him in a long time, this is enough nonsense.
I'd like to get to know him.
Is this normal, Saleh?
I am fighting in the tent.
Forward, forward, forward
And you are few like them.
Your words are very nice.
And your speech on the radio is much sweeter.
We only heard nonsense.
"Come on, please, just one more time for Boufhaad. He's saying, he's saying, listen, listen, listen."
Stop nonsense
These are the originals, sir. These are.
Your request continues where I stopped.
It's a bit difficult.
Stop later, please.
It means "I want us to continue so that we can address people's problems and issues."
Listen, Saleh.
I'll give you just one problem.
You, Saleh, are the voice of truth.
Go get what you want, some people.
This translates to "A high-ranking official" in English.
He said it's done, and it's done, by God.
By God.
This is your chance.
The opportunity doesn't come twice.
No, "لا" means "no" in Arabic.
What's the matter with you? You don't understand.
Be patient, please, brother.
Problems, mess, and chaos
Oh, esteemed minister.
The ministry in its latest project requested eight thousand ampoules.
The compressed package has a volume of twenty centimeters cubed.
But this employee
Agreed on the capacity pipes
To take advantage of the price difference.
We've had enough nonsense.
No matter what I do, brother Saleh, we can't keep coming up with nonsense.
There seems to be a mix of languages in your input. "لا الله ايسلمج" appears to be a variation of Arabic, possibly a colloquial or regional dialect, that translates to "God does not surrender you."
This call is a private request.
Inshallah, they will call it a yes.
Stop all this nonsense.
Do you know?
Life and what it brings
This is the last one, and only this one.
The sultan, Sultan Asad, flew away.
The minister removed the veil with great speed.
He tells you he said the right thing.
Now, what the hell, the square is full because Bu Fahd is playing by himself.
I perform all tasks.
May God prolong your life.
The minister is present.
Goodbye
We've had enough nonsense.
Okay, this is the last one. After this, there's nothing left.
Oh, here are my application documents for the forgiving job, playfully.
It means they got what they wanted.
Listen to my words.
Because he is afraid.
Inquire about him and find out his scandals and troubles.
You point out flaws and criticize.
They are afraid of you.
Deceive me, my beloved sister.
You're the good one.
Tomorrow, visit your uncle Abu Amniyah.
The condition is to work.
They're just criticizing without any basis and pointing out flaws.
Why do they hate our country?
Do we have flaws?
We don't have any connections.
I'm hearing the word "mediator" for the first time.
In our government circles, things are done by rotation.
We don't take bribes.
And we do not know her.
Look at the employee.
Does the foreigner take more than the local person? No, never.
What we do with our own hands, we do it best.
You are a child of your mother and your father, and we will never have a lord.
A superior will get mad at you if you're on the job.
We're the best people.
The best country
Flawless
And thank you.
Yesterday, I heard a broadcast.
Oh, my father's candy.
I told you there's no dessert until after dinner.
No more sweets, kids.
What tore the shirt?
Mom, my friends and I were playing.
I don't know if you're playing.
Just tear the shirt.
May God be with you, O judge.
Come, come and see what your brother's naughty child has done.
What I told you is that there's no need to buy it at a high price. You said to me, "No, it's fine, it will turn out well for a child."
See what happened.
It's no use canceling this; the shirt is already canceled; there's no use wearing it.
He said, "I'll do what I want, of course no one will approve."
Mother, where's the candy?
Look at the crack in the wall, made intentionally later on.
He returned with his baby.
He's happy to wear it for the first time.
"باراويج فيه انا" translates to "I am in a cage" in English.
Where are the alternatives?
In the garden
Why is it happening?
His father is involved in an issue between us.
What we breathe
Man up.
Hit the drum and clap your hands.
They let him go as he wishes.
He wreaks havoc.
Don't come and teach me.
Come teach me.
We raise them.
Avoid excessive mistakes and respect yourself.
Let it go about you.
You kids fight a lot.
A distant bay in the distance
Mother, do not interfere at all.
Tell him to take care of his kids fairly. Listen, listen to both of us.
Yah, this is it.
You can't distinguish between a child and a date palm.
Just knew
The blame is on me, not on you.
Let's go upstairs.
They don't deserve one.
Even if I reply to them
It's better for one to... (The sentence is incomplete in the original, so I've left it partially in the original language and translated the complete part.)
The time of calm hearts
Alright, alright, goodbye, goodbye.
But, if you please, the minister is asking for the documents and it's essential that you provide them.
Alright, alright, I'll sort things out with the minister later, you don't need to worry, I'll handle it.
Pair of blues, pair of misfortunes, pair of catastrophes.
His new dress, no, Ayisha.
This is not a verb, kids.
And you are the truth.
La la la, the more you dress up, the more you look like a fool.
Jofi Jofi
It means there's no hope you'll wear it.
Wearing a loincloth means wearing only one real and going out.
Lalala no, this is not something you can cut with your hand, it's between us.
I tell you, it's like looking into a electric saw's belly.
But all I can say is, "Al-lahi 'ala man aswahá" (God is enough for what she did).
I tell you.
Who among you wants candy? Come over.
I don't know.
If you're done, take a walk around the farm.
I don't just love you because you know how to ride a bike.
I love you because there's something else in you.
You're telling the truth, right?
So, you want some candy?
Give me two, father.
I'll give you four units.
Who cut our clothes in the closet?
Oh, your dad, how did he cut them?
He has a large pair of scissors to cut the car with.
Under the bed is where all the candy is.
What have you reached regarding these matters?
No one else did this mess.
Let's keep it quiet.
The most important thing.
If we insist on our words
I tear clothes to pieces as a child.
Any computer
What's he talking about?
The destruction I saw with my own eyes is impossible for a child to do.
Why don't you want to believe me?
Go find your quarter.
Give me just a moment, please.
This is your condition.
Every day, mom and dad argue.
Where are you, first time?
God willing, with forgiveness and safety.
God hopes that you will be guided.
Acheil can handle a knife of that size.
You're the one looking for your quarter.
Look at the cut, mom.
Going to get a bigger scissors.
Respect yourself, Sultan. Respect yourself, Owsh.
Come on, father, and may God have mercy on your parents. Come on, father.
How do I start?
And each one of you
You are fathers.
And the child is born.
The child is born.
You are my brothers.
Hear my words and make peace; stretch out your hands.
Now, tell me what you're going to do.
"Good or bad, I've torn their clothes."
Their clothes were ruined by this misfortune that happened to me. I lost all my files, my information, my documents. I lost everything.
By God, I won't leave him.
Give us some info about Arabic language museums, and I assure you, I won't let you down.
I don't have to worry about it.
Tick-tock-tick-tock, time passes by, until he gets tired and leaves.
I'm not sure about the context, but a possible translation for "مب صاحي اخوي واعرفه" could be: "He's not my brother, but I know him."
And each one greeted the other.
He is not from his heart. My father is not from his heart. His heart is full of hatred and malice.
He is angry because I broke the computer.
With a falcon
Sultan Atta Atta Atta
Just be afraid of your Lord, O my mother.
Give it time, it will happen.
Go take your cousins and go play outside.
God willing, may God guide you both.
May God bless you.
The translation of "رياييل كل واحد اشطوله اشعرظه" into English is: "The reality of each one according to their situation."
What have you done with the seeds? What have you done with the children?
Inshallah, mama.
Their brother, Abdulrahman.
Maybe, mom, this is the first time.
Do you know, mother, this is the way it is.
Can he speak with people?
And he understands them.
Don't be mad at me later.
You are supposed to do that.
Every unit has a role.
May God reform you, but only if you reform yourselves.
Even you, father, have become like them.
Oh, mother, mother, save my child, for God's sake, calm down and stop saying 'get out, get out, get out'.
And then what?
A son is like a new son.
You disappointed us, kids.
The ones who were deleting were the kids, the kids.
He's not willing to believe.
I see them with both my eyes.
Tell them to believe it if they dare.
He says from above.
He is a harsh father who beats his children, but from above he thinks he is the greatest.
Come on, I'm not crazy, I'm awake.
Please feel free to go.
You might be a bit tired or your head is spinning.
Do you know these people?
Tell me, they are going to throw stones at you.
The translation of "اهمه ص" into English is "Important: Read". Please note that without context, it's difficult to provide a more precise translation.
My love
I'll tell you to go and relax now, the most important thing is that they signed the agreement, so what's next?
In the name of God, in the name of the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
What is this? Hurry up!
"My trust is in God against the enemy."
Mama, mama
It's all your fault.
The translation of ‏سببكم انتوا into English is: "It's because of you."
Praise be, but you're all small-minded.
Please take me to the hospital, I feel like I'm going to faint, I'm going to die.
I've seen it for the first time.
And note that he doesn't take his eyes off you, O seeker.
That's what was recorded in the business with us yesterday.
Now it's been a week since he's been attending the class with us.
It's obvious that he's dying and recognizes you.
Don't be so demanding, it's not necessary.
No, sister.
He shouldn't say that about me, it hurts my feelings.
I was dried by my son and a breath was blown on me.
Let things return to normal, it's better.
He's the one who will save you, the one who has given his life for you.
That means I do reciprocate the same feeling of admiration.
But I don't know, I feel like the right opportunity hasn't come yet.
Illiteracy is illiteracy.
I destroyed and will look at you, and I wonder how.
Or else, don't wait, young man, she will come and say to you, "Please, I'd like to get to know you."
Be the initiator, my brother.
Your statement is correct.
I'm just waiting for the right opportunity.
The appropriate opportunity
More than just being enrolled in the same class with her.
The teacher is strict.
Say it, O foolish one.
Oh, come on, isn't her name really...
We've been looking at each other for three months.
No one knows the second one.
Bro, you're the first.
It means: "I need to go tell her, please."
Can I get to know you?
He won't do that again.
It's fine, I need to wait for the right opportunity to come to me.
Calm and polite
God, I don't really know what you're trying to say exactly.
We finished filming the series yesterday.
By God.
You've never forgotten us and you've never been short with us.
I have been free since I retired.
If we buy the villa behind us, it will be for Walid.
It would be great if, God willing, when our children get married, they don't go too far from us.
What's the use now?
You're very late.
And you are a bearer of good news.
I've been standing here for a few days, watching her empty house.
They purchased the land through the Development Bank.
God bless them with it, Allah willing.
Hello, hello, uncle, good morning.
Hey, uncle, pull the pin.
Thank you, father. May God reward you, may God reward you well.
Hello Nora, come here, come here. The car started, come on, I'll show you, come here, come here, dad.
And upon you be peace.
What's the matter with you?
The neighbors are sitting and gossiping, and what business is it of yours to interfere?
I say, get out, it's better for you.
Your business is none of their concern.
I'm in a nice spot, my car is stuck and I can't get it out.
With your permission, can I have your car key?
After I service the car.
Leave you in the Titanic atmosphere you're living in.
Goodbye
Goodbye
Now you know a lot about me.
And I didn't know but for Walid.
Waleed Rashid Abdullah
Sure, here is the translation: "Of course, many people if you tell them the name of your father, they will think you are the actor's son."
Machallah, same name.
My father, Rashid Abdullah, is an actor.
Rashid Abdullah, the well-known actor, is my father.
Why didn't you have dinner with them? Someone's having this steak.
Don't you come and tell me.
How did you come to know the famous actor Rashid Abdullah, Yarna?
Ah yes, it's true.
My friend at university knows them, and she told me.
He loves it and enjoys acting in it, and he only follows it because of him.
He told me that we no longer live after a famous person with value in society.
Ah, my heart, my joy.
His blood is thin, yes indeed.
His son turned out like him, may God have mercy on him.
He who said it, spoke the truth.
Did you know?
I need to take a picture with the actor I love, you'll see why.
Oh, my god, my words have betrayed me, the son of my aunt's brother.
I read an interview with him in the newspaper.
He says they're making a series about the diving days.
I say, who's going to bring you a lamb for the occasion of my new house?
He proved to be a good neighbor.
Are there any new updates?
We have a lot of names.
They told me, "May God keep you safe, O Abu Saad, your name is on the list."
It is determined based on the need and the employee's experience.
We don't know
We might be able to transfer you.
Please excuse me, I can't do anything for you.
In the name of God, your enemy.
We said we would move and sit before that, and God provided for us later on.
Fix your work.
Back, Abu Ali.
Please, don't consider me a stranger.
Anything you need.
I am at your service.
A neighbor to a neighbor, and I am your brother.
But now I've heard and seen.
You're amazing, God has blessed you, you know about furniture.
I'll go with you.
You don't have to worry, sister.
Whenever you want to choose furniture, let me know.
My dear, my father will take a loan, and if they agree to it, he will sell all our furniture.
And here I repeat it once again.
And nothing but the blood will atone.
Today, we are counting on the people.
And this is what I don't know how to study at all.
I just want her to be independent.
I was definitely speaking to her.
It means I have to tell you a secret and then say I'll ask my friend.
"Ya umme ya Ali"
I am not for anything.
Dam loves me and I love her, I understand her.
You are dreaming.
Let me propose your cousin's daughter to you.
Leave it to me.
At your leisure
Your mind is your own.
Banjuf
Goodnight.
And you, from the beginning.
Bouali Cheur
This car is a piece of junk.
Every other day, you make an issue for me.
May God keep her safe, she has just started university.
And this is the most degraded state.
Your daughter is our daughter.
What's on you
There's no need to put yourself out, brother Rashid.
In proper Arabic transliteration, "لا الله يسلمك" translates to "May God not protect you."
The car is parked in the yard and the servant is sitting with nothing to do.
The hollow development bank didn't fail you, your house and car are secure.
This isn't our car.
The car belongs to the neighbor's house of Rashid Abdullah.
Hollow relationships evolved.
We discuss mutually beneficial topics that serve both parties' interests.
Oh, incredible development!
Let's go!
He's back, feeling embarrassed.
I agreed.
Noura said, "I thought my daughter, and every day the driver brings her to university."
I should've told her that our car needs a week to get fixed.
No, by God, never.
She said, "There's no help for it; the driver will pick her up every morning."
The testimony is to God, O Ali.
Good people
La la la, dad.
There is no strength or power but by God.
Oh, what a blue, what a blue, what should I do now?
Leave your responsibilities behind.
I take my daughter to university.
Yapo Ali, as long as your connection is Professor Rashid Abdullah.
We can't say anything anymore.
Bousaad Bousaad
I'm sorry, بوسعد.
Bouali knows his worth to us.
Thank you, may God reward you, you didn't disappoint, Mr. Saad.
Everyone loves you, Allah be praised.
God is sweet, just as sugar is sweet.
Come on, guys, you see, Professor Rashid is busy, so he has to leave.
Sorry, sorry, Professor Rashid, we've disturbed you.
At your service, always ready.
Your height is a strong asset for you.
You see, we are your friends and brothers. If we need anything, just help us out, don't forget about us.
Just tell me where you want it, I'll get it for you.
Why do you provoke me?
Will you propose to Manal for me?
They agreed, they agreed.
Manal told her mother about me.
Heal him, but do not believe him.
Um Walid
And dresses for your party.
I didn't understand.
The fortune is true for Walid, Allah willing, by the look in my eyes.
She called me poor.
Take accessories
Adorn them with jewelry accessories.
This is my mother.
Now, after, you'll ride a cool car.
"Mashā' Allāh, mashā' Allāh."
Machallah, I can't compete with you.
Um Walid sees what has become of you.
For everything they've given you, after they gave you the car.
With her is the butler.
Now if you go with me of this color, they will not believe that this flesh and salt are the wife of this queen.
Ambie Way
Inshallah, you'll get rid of these clothes.
No, no, no, no, no, don't worry about me.
Without my clothes, you won't recognize me.
They say that one of those old sheikhs who came to us
Long live coffee.
I didn't recognize you, Allah! I thought for sure this was one of the cabarets, not you, not Ali.
What do you think?
And the walk is not far.
May God protect you. We're going to propose to Ali at their place.
Great people
I freed myself from the car.
I said, "I'm sure I can get it from you."
The latest series you acted in.
In a scene, mention any wedding.
I was wearing that black abaya shimmering.
And after your father, he taught me how to wear the bashte.
Because your brother, may God protect you, has never worn a besh (a type of traditional robe).
Machallah amnor amnor
How could I have made such a mistake with the group?
This is not right.
Saying 'My brother Rashid' in English.
You don't have any more buttons.
The good
What I always see with me and Khulud
The situation is like this.
You are my darling.
We are family now.
And our daughter Noor will not go far away.
Nora is Walid's right.
She said, "Let me see her at the university, and I won't find anyone better than her."
This blessed hour
Inshallah, I will tell her father the truth, and Allah will write what is best.
Why was it rejected? What's the reason?
Because his father is an actor.
Go call your father.
His quick response, Rashid is calling you.
Where are you?
I am screaming from despair.
You say it because his father is an actor.
Shame on you.
I am an actor.
But I am an example of integrity.
I perform on stage for two hours and my role ends.
My performance comes to an end.
You play roles.
I represent.
I provide them with a message that benefits them.
But you
I wear theatrical costumes.
On stage
But you
You performed in the meetings.
The rich old woman
Who is the actor among us?
Who is the real representative?
Do not grieve, Walid.
Lift your head.
We are not honored.
But you're missing the sight now that I'm coming.
Hear her screaming at him, "Don't look back, don't look back. Poor thing, it breaks my heart."
And he walks with his master.
Do you say "it's a horse"
It's Thursday, man.
This is Thursday.
His wife is not transparent.
I am jealous of him.
That's why he walks like that.
So that neither women nor he sees them.
I saw how his wife trusted him.
Sida does not look back.
But they won't bother us at the office tomorrow.
Khamis, please, please, show them how you wear your dress.
Thursday showed me his suit.
Isn't your wife the one who should be wearing that dress?
Oh come on, it's Thursday again.
I go to meet Salim Ashibi with an empty spirit.
Poor guy, brother.
How long will this gentleness last?
If you could hear the words being said behind your back.
No, by God, they even say it might be more in front of me.
Why would I do this?
I am proud of you.
I am proud of him.
I spend hours in front of the TV.
This is it, ahh.
By God, and truly.
La la, it's fine.
Hello, peace be upon you, sister.
I pair now
Kanye is standing in front of you, challenging you, and I heard the sound of a coin.
By God, sometimes I just rip my clothes off in frustration.
Respect yourself and let her go.
It's difficult to release it.
There's nothing, there's nothing, there's nothing, there's nothing, there's nothing.
Do not come near me, do not come near your friend.
Ha, I know you.
My intention is good.
Do you need me?
No one destroys you like these kinds of people you associate with.
Especially this one, I've been given up by all of you, I've been left to my own devices by God, this time it's really bad.
It looks like a freshly planted seed.
The noble person who is not ashamed.
I want to torture myself in my grave.
Let me understand her.
After that, what should I say?
I understand you.
I'm not seeing anyone here.
How are you, what's up?
Our friend Khamis is leaving.
Watch the storm and I'll tell you a story.
No, I say, the lame one in his head jumps up and down.
Normal Thursday, this poor guy.
They all turned away from her mother, who was standing there, and started to talk to her.
"My trust is in God regarding his wife."
They say, "Do you have Thursday?"
He's busy now, he has an international call. It's completely disconnected, even the line is cut off.
And she who delivered the message
I say, God help you, Thursday.
What's wrong, you're not sleeping.
I don't have anything, God, I don't know if it's coming to me.
Regarding meeting tomorrow.
With the female delegation from the ministry.
Possible means
May God guide you, Thursday.
These names came from His Excellency the Minister's office.
And then come.
You're a coward afraid of it.
If I had known it was safe, I wouldn't have been afraid.
Saying the truth
Why am I hiding and being submissive behind the water tank?
Just like that
Look, I don't understand what you're saying. What's the last number on your list?
Last digits
The last number you called after you deleted the number you were trying to reach.
Tell me her name, dad of women.
Die die die
I told her the story of Salem.
My peaceful life in work
You don't believe me, bro.
And then what are you wearing?
I plan to go diving.
And by God, my brother, she didn't let me wear it. She told me to go like this.
Call me.
Call my wife.
Hajj Marti
Saying "Give me the pen, brother, and I'll give you the number."
You are governing over yourselves.
This is your nature, you men.
You're a lucky one like him, but I'll show you.
If I get involved again, the only place I'll end up is the minister's office.
This is a horse.
He threatened me, saying, "If you complain about me to the minister's office."
That's a bold move.
This phrase translates to: "This is an attempt to cut off my livelihood."
But it's my fault for obeying you and calling her.
Come back soon, Thursday.
If she complains about me to the minister's office.
Come with me there and tell them the whole story. Get me out of this.
I have no business here.
You are really afraid.
My brothers, my sisters
I hope your morning goes well.
I am honored to attend your gathering.
Just where are the rest of them, family?
Break and run
It's Thursday, where is he?
Long live you, sir/madam.
Turn off the phone.
Alright, don't get stuck, just leave it at the office.
The whole meeting lasts for one hour.
This is my phone.
It became and it became like this.
I'm still with you from that day and I'm not going home.
Where does he go?
Where can he go?
The Zak I am today is sitting in the same state.
She is jealous, very jealous.
My love, this is not just any other.
I sit here in the hall at night.
I'll tell mom about it.
The mother is dead.
That's why I'm giving you this chance to find a solution.
Madam, why did you ask you to move from the department where women enter?
A military rule is
If you want to make the signature smaller, read below.
Brother, please transfer me to the social welfare department.
Are you sure you're enrolled in the care section?
Why strange?
Thank God, keep you safe.
You are the sister. Apologies, he is the brother Khamis.
Contact us at the minister's office and inform us.
I have reached my new destination.
And I'm with you in your office.
Jesus, Saleh, Jasim, and...
On Thursday, the minister decided to transfer you.
And today, you have reached your new stage.
And when I explained to you, I told you about my problem with my parents.
You are a decisive minister.
It means "I'll go to the minister."
He took his annual leave today.
And he will not return for another month and a half.
Yah, mess!
And I think my opinion after that.
The minister is saying the same thing.
Keep looking for a place to stay, because this time you're being relocated because a lot of people have told him about your problem with your wife.
I tell you frankly.
The solution
They said, "If she calls me, don't argue."
And how can they go beyond their reach when you are their hope?
I made them put your toys in the car, I put them in a box for you.
One alone
I divided it into ten parts, assuming that there are five of you in the office, so each person gets two parts.
What if he sees her again? He's afraid of her after she left him.
Imagine us all being named after our dreams.
And they call me Abdul Gadir.
His name is as follows.
He's handsome and sweet, so you'd be afraid of losing him like this.
In the name of God, what's wrong with her?
Call me when you said.
Any Abd al-Qadir, the one who is standing and following Hassan, who is sitting behind Khalil.
These toys, each one chooses what they want.
The translation of "جوفي هذي" into English is: "This one is deep."
The joy made him speechless.
What's wrong with you?
Please.
Where is the care office?
There should be five employees.
What's your name?
I am sweet.
I am a minion waiting for my queen.
I am a fool.
Now is the time to implement the project before us.
And we listened to them.
So what did they say to you?
They said
I lit the way for us to come to you like this.
I can't.
I'll go into the kitchen and mess it up.
God willing, God willing, God willing, I'll come to you, God willing.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, you bitch.
Come on, come on, listen to the men's words, listen to them.
God forbid you forgot that we are the Children of Scorpio.
By God, by God, I'm coming without thanks, By God, by God, by God, by God.
The main bank said that the project has no objections.
His phone is always busy.
Poor them, they've been waiting for you.
And what do I have to do with this job and these brothers?
The servant has been away for a month and now it has been three months.
God bless you, goodbye.
All the amendments are to our advantage.
The boy of ours
Just imagine if you made the garden.
At least he will go somewhere, at least for two or three days.
They say the garden is a respite for people living in the complex, this is the bank.
The men are sitting and discussing without needing a woman's opinion.
Go ahead.
We put the tea down, and suddenly the floor became slippery.
Garden no
Just a minute.
Sister, you know that I love football.
"Our parents don't know that you play football at school. If they found out, they would kill you."
Know thyself.
She said to him
I say, it's best for you to forget about it.
And do not harm yourselves.
La la la, I have you in my heart.
Saying "شقولج مشاغل مشاغل هالدنيا" translates to "You talk about the troubles of this world" in English.
It is my right that you have blessed us.
Oh, my uncle Shahin is here.
What God wills
This is Thursday.
Length and width
Fear of the thobe
I tried to find a wife for him, but I couldn't.
Origin and essence
I'll tell you something.
My Thursday marriage
This is from the resources department.
Yes, you're getting old.
Leave it aside.
Then I have a few notes on the proposal.
May your age be long.
Do you have anything else?
Long live (you).
Take care of them and if I get some time, Inshallah, I will meet them.
What did you do with the employees I sent to you?
Best wishes
I'm going now and will talk to you later.
What's happening
You're crazy.
We are older than you.
We've been through a lot of trouble since then.
Do you know what sport Fatima plays at school?
Tell them table tennis.
Just don't kill them.
The beating you're about to receive is the appetizer.
You don't know who we are.
What's our original purpose?
Do you know what the hour hand means?
This time we messed up with you.
Large scorpion
Needle
My uncle will give her a slap on the face.
Enough is enough.
You should save this for later.
You've changed your mind and decided to study architectural engineering like me.
My intention is you.
Snakes don't have daughters who work on the streets among men.
Engineering, architecture, and strength
Where shall I hide and find refuge among the scorpions?
Break my head
No, no, O Sultan, no.
Present, oh scorpion.
Break your fast with dates.
Let your brother Falcon take his chance.
It is forbidden for them by God to do what they are doing.
Don't worry, my love, at least you're enough.
I am young and alive.
So what do they want from me tomorrow morning?
They will turn grey.
Shadour, oh falcon, descend.
Forward, forward!
Where do I go?
Not a word.
Where are we going?
We told him to go and not say a word.
And instead of that, write 'education'.
And even if it causes sorrow, if we have no objection.
We argued later.
You have two options.
So you know we're democrats.
Bear with me, you say the pressure is on you.
Either education or discipline.
Come on, lower yourself.
Give us a copy of the request.
Go on, hurry up.
Large ticks, father.
The old scorpion's spirit is meant for you.
We're not in a hurry, Uncle, but when will the relief come, God willing.
Professor Ameneira
What you're asking for seems very difficult.
I can't travel, Abu Khalid.
I have special circumstances.
The minister insisted.
It's very difficult.
Think properly, Amenee.
Don't make a decision yet, think about it tomorrow.
How do you manage to work?
That's why we're quiet.
I have a proposal.
Let one of them travel with you.
We don't allow our daughters to travel.
Stop this mess.
Neither life nor shame
You're the one who's keeping us working late.
You will leave tomorrow and apologize.
Don't delay.
I hear you while you're silent.
Thursday among the children of scorpions
One of us, within us
He's an idiot and doesn't have a degree.
Just a scorpion
What does "اختي اشبتسووين الحين" translate to in English? The phrase appears to be in a mix of Arabic and possibly a local dialect. A literal translation would be: "My sister, what are you doing now?" A more natural English translation would be: "What is my sister doing now?"
What should I do, Fatima?
I am broken and weak.
How much should I do?
There's nothing in my power to do.
We messed it up.
Next Thursday, God willing.
We'll call you and tell you what time we arrived, according to the difference in time zones from your location.
Oh, how sweet this laughter is.
The spirit of the season calls for dressing up.
Go and prepare the clothes, father.
You killed me with this laughter.
My brother, I beg you.
I don't want to hear a single word.
Please make us some coffee and cake.
Who are you now, Ayisha, compared to your friend, the minister?
I'm afraid it might be a rumor, Abu Khalid.
Ameneira is a candidate to hold a ministry in the new cabinet.
Amunire deserves it.
God forbid it's a rumor.
You keep hating.
We all cooperate for the service of the homeland.
Thank you for each one of us giving in our own place.
I wish success for all of us.
Thank you for the minister's efforts.
Thank you for the warm welcome, Minister.
Thank you
The longer she stays, the better.
Peace be upon you.
Use soap as I instructed you.
She is the general supervisor of the women's national football team.
Ask him how his sister Fatima plays.
In the name of God, all praise is due to God, God is greatest.
Captain Fatima has set rules for the adults' approach.
Captain Fatima is a talented woman, my brothers. Farewell, my son.
What position does my sister play in the team, Captain Ashraik?
Just head on like that.
You're traveling to China.
Captain Jinah is a bit far from China.
God bless you.
Your sister is playing an important game.
She was studying education, but I went and changed her papers today.
Let them study its school with its architects.
Any captain, for there's no difference between the real and the fake.
And God, pour the coffee, but pour it.
Come here, where are you going?
I wanted to wait.
You are a donkey, you are a donkey.
Come on, come on, go and greet your mother. Tell her to throw me out.
By God, by my mother's father!
By God, it's a tough situation.
The drink you have is cold.
They don't know what you're up to all year round, but as soon as they hear you have a job.
How are you, how are the kids?
I missed her.
Tell her that, God willing, this time she'll be with us in the series.
Sure, here is the translation: "You're definitely playing the leading role."
Ali, leave the role to someone else, no one but Shula can play it.
My love, there's something called makeup that makes it (her) smaller.
Maryam is twenty-six, my mother is twenty-seven years old.
Let the bee benefit from the flower.
He keeps giving us lectures that have no beginning or end.
I'm afraid a bone might get stuck in our throat.
The most important thing is that he doesn't know that the company producing the series is your company, you and Hamdan.
Inshallah, we won't be late, brothers.
And Kahf Rashid is behind me
The director is ready with his technicians.
Alright, everyone, just for the time, let's start the meeting.
Whoever wants to speak, please share their opinion.
Jank Hamad wants to say something.
Frankly, I don't think there's anything better than this series.
Come, today I saw this servant commit suicide.
And you know the most moving scene affected me the most.
On Maid Day, she commits suicide.
The day her spirit clung to the bench, the bench grew colder and colder, and her blood trickled, trickled, trickled down her neck.
They found him and she started screaming at her son. God, what a scene!
He keeps shooting at it, shooting at it, shooting at it until he reaches their backyard.
Peak of action
The police are investigating, looking for the mother.
Frankly, the series is absolutely fantastic.
Just act out the series, get up on the table and act it out.
This is a violation of artistic integrity.
And the rape of societal values.
A series based on strange events.
Unbelievable
"مسلسل اثنين وسبعين حاله قتل" translates to "A Series of Seventy-Two Killings".
What's all this shouting about?
You're actually known for not wanting anyone to know.
Come on, brother Hamdan, let's be democratic.
We decide the matter by majority vote.
Oh, brother Nasser, do not hide behind the majority and democracy in the field of critical evaluation of any artistic work. There is no democracy or majority.
You got caught in the crossfire of your government job.
Goodbye
I tell you, I heard the bell sound.
And when the Indian boy held up his hand, it was like this.
He asked me, "Are you Mama Hessa?" I said to him, "Yes."
If you opened the jar
A ring appeared in it, I think its value is between seventy-eight thousand.
I'm afraid the Indian might bring us this wrong thing.
Don't worry, it's not a mistake.
This is Samira.
Hamad's wife is the responsible person at our company.
And this, God will forgive her as a gift from her.
What's the matter?
The ring is very luxurious.
I've never dreamed of having a ring that's self-adjusting.
"May God keep you safe, my dear, my love, Cissa."
This is my father, the series I call the Series of Goodness.
Ali and Hamed are our most important employees, but since they are employees with us, they cannot present the series in their names, so they presented it in someone else's name.
And what else is there but this ring?
I'll just say this, what's said between us stays between us.
Don't tell me I'm crazy, I'm just speaking the truth.
Your wise couple
The one they call the wizard.
Make it 5% stronger.
No, my dear, they're fine if they get approved four million.
Your wife will get two hundred thousand riyals of beautiful money.
I say the role of the college girl gives Nadia.
This phrase seems to be a mix of Persian and possibly a local dialect or slang. A possible translation into English could be: "This is a happy moment when you love someone and cycle together." However, please note that the exact meaning might vary depending on the context and the specific dialect used.
The title of the series we're working on after this is "Rape of the Spirit."
They told me about a role in a series.
I'd like to know one thing.
That's how our Gulf series always are, just like we say, the trend this year is sexual assault.
The important thing is to tell my love, what will be my role.
And after you, my dear, are a hundred percent certain.
Zain withdrew from embarrassment.
Kanye yay yay now.
My love, now I'll make all this delicious breakfast for you. It will keep you and make you go.
This is the secretary of the manager.
God forbid.
He's never asked me out like this before.
He told him that the series they are making is weak and trivial.
It's a sin to lose money on it.
Then, what happened afterwards?
God forbid, I go tell them, I'm afraid Rashad, that crazy guy, is saying bad things about the series.
I am not afraid of you.
Leave this matter to me.
The sick human
Social series
This is something I've only seen on TV in the past few days.
May you live long, sir/madam.
The series currently airing is called "Rape and Unreaped Rose."
But the budget they're asking for is too big.
It needs a large budget.
Later, don't forget God who guides you. The institution that produces the work is a local one.
May God protect you, I beg you to disappear.
Reassure, may you live long.
I read the arts page.
These days, we hear about the start of filming a series called "The Rape of the Soul."
And a large budget was allocated for him.
While it is said that the series is not up to the required standard.
And another says that the series is a school for teaching deviation.
There's a high probability they'll stop filming.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you. Hello, Abdulhamid.
Hello, hello, God has welcomed you, welcomed you, take it easy.
Good morning
Good morning, welcome.
I am journalist Eli Maner and I have an appointment with Professor Hamdy, if possible.
Just take it easy for a while, because he has a meeting.
Mercury allows us to leverage design and create a cosmic space.
And by the way, we contact all correspondents around the world so they can get in touch with us.
This is now your responsibility.
Mercury Production Company
Discussing his issues in a way that makes the series one of the best works in the history of the world.
Can you believe who wrote this?
If you have no shame, do as you please.
The eye blushes.
It's reasonable, we do have journalists like this.
A journalist is expected to have a principle.
Yaiin 'ekk adik ahni.
What are they coming to do? Register their positions.
I met Ya Sha'uleh yesterday, the minister's assistant. Do you know my problem?
I tell you, our series is getting weirder and weirder.
The first episode will air and we will watch it with the people.
How are you?
What? Mom, this is just the first episode.
He doesn't talk to anyone except for Gulf series.
And then my mother said, "Just kill my children, except for the ones you have."
My dear, art is a matter of taste, not of abnormal conditions that are imposed and generalized upon society and people.
This might be art in visual arts, but in drama, it's quite different.
Oh no, my head hurts.
It seems like the Turkish Eagle (or "Bayain عليه ايغلدون الاتراك" in Arabic) is a reference to the national symbol of Turkey, the Turkish Eagle. In English, it would be translated as: "It looks like the Turkish Eagle."
No more, dad, don't control now, at least watch the first five episodes.
The series is cancelled.
And it is forbidden for us to let our children hear this.
Don't push him that hard, brother.
There are many worse series than this one and they're displayed.
This is actually the work, brother Salim.
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.
And he said to each house.
Go capture people who understand dimensions and the secrets behind lines.
And present it to them.
It's not us.
Pray for the people of Egypt.
The minister passed by with his attendants.
I did it to greet him.
It's us who agreed to the series.
They can have it if they like, but the minister is happy.
Let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleague is the one who posted the insult.
I only download messages that praise the series.
Never say never, for you never know.
I'm looking forward to reading what's written, and I will send messages from my side to thank the series and praise it. I will be the first to send these messages to the readers.
Inshallah
You'll only be happy.
For this year
This is what we agreed on.
Best series in the history of Gulf drama
They all agreed to the minister's terms.
I'll walk with you, agreed with the journalists.
Headlines Headlines Only
I wish to re-rape the conscience.
Thank you to the Minister of Information for this series.
I wish they could do it again.
The first call I received was from the minister's office.
See the remaining batch of your series' funding, we've released it for you.
They can't blame you for your enchanting smile.
And until now, you haven't done anything.
The truth is, we are now in the red and we have made a profit, and the profit was excellent.
And then you see the series is a failure.
The author himself told me he regrets it.
I'm here now to suggest a second part of the series.
The minister showed me between you and me.
I've walked the talk of journalism and the false success we achieved.
He told me that he wasn't comfortable with the series from inside.
It means it's impossible for us to agree on a second part.
If the minister himself requests a second part.
I cannot
However, I would like to repeat my thanks.
For all workers
In this series
And congratulate them on their victory.
They deserve it.
The truth is that the work's winning these awards at these prestigious festivals.
It is the greatest evidence.
How come you're saying this?
It's not easy at all.
The golden prize is assured to the one who is illiterate in literacy.
Ashkan will tell you.
Readers and the press, they all agree with us.
He says in a second part, why doesn't he say.
As long as you have these Arab and Gulf TV festivals, you can do artistic washing.
Washing art
I hear about money laundering.
Art is fun.
Illegal funds
The same thing for series.
What should we do with One and Two?
How are we going to do this?
It's not just us who have a contract with them; they need to comply.
Write to them
Our products are exported from roti in various types, small and large bread, triangular and shaped.
We are at a standstill with them regarding the contract.
Two million dollars
What did you do to the Australian baker?
This is the inventor of roti.
They told you what the product does.
And they said to me, "It's roti," but what's in it? I don't know.
May Allah make your path easy.
They call it a "sawsah"
It means instead of taking this roti, you're eating what you call 'pita'.
This is the inventor's way of simplifying it.
Roti jeans
This secret
You eat roti with chutney.
My brother, they do strange things over there.
This dough is processed in a way that when you first put the dough in the pan, it melts.
And different flavors of Sesta strawberry, Sesta catget strawberry, Sesta coffee.
Do you know how much I'm invested in this project.
Three million dollars with patent rights
Come, Mahmoud.
Yes, Abu Nasser
At your service.
We visited the river today, old man.
What you're saying, Samih.
Take your son Nasser yesterday to play football with the team he formed.
I agree with him.
This team has done nothing but humiliate us, but it's all thanks to the security and drivers.
And after, we consider ourselves incomplete because all we have is one guard. If he gets hurt, we'll be in trouble.
And naturally, after I establish a fan relationship.
And the day you took the employees, according to your mother's saying, was seventeen.
I told you something.
About the important people in the company.
The ones who shape the company's heart.
The baker is taking the dough from the hospitals.
Therefore, it is certain that the boy is fine.
I told him, "Don't be foolish; you're from a well-known family, you can't just go off and mix with them, look at us." The world will laugh at us.
Whoever wants to play with them can do whatever they want.
But what really matters are the key people who shape the company's heart.
What's up, my team has a match and I'm missing four players.
We don't want excuses.
What's done is done.
Hamdi didn't come to work today, sir.
Ride with him, I climbed in with him.
He told me to wear it.
And they stopped me from speaking.
The match seemed.
I didn't feel anything later.
They say that it doesn't bother me if she comes, but I can't remember.
It means you used to play goalkeeper.
Just for Nasser.
There is no strength or power but by God.
God forbid we get caught up in this mess and this nonsense.
From today, Nasser.
There is no such thing as "kore" (in this context, it seems to be a term in an unspecified language meaning "nothing").
You need to delete the team you've created yesterday.
All the bakeries returned to their ovens.
Or what do you think?
Go straight to the point.
I don't want to hear from you.
My request, O Nasser.
Let's hear what the boy has to say, please.
Just for you, Abu Ahmed.
What do you have to say?
Our last match in the current league is tomorrow.
Don't break his heart, O Abu Nasser, please, your request, please.
Decorate, oh youth.
Congratulations, congratulations.
Blessed be the fuel, the igniters, and the fire.
Mr. Nasser, I need you urgently.
God bless you. My team was on time today.
Teacher Nasser is needed.
You promised us to throw us a party.
I want to call and book a hall in the hotel for you.
Once upon a time, the journalists and newspapers were left alone there.
No, Rashid, we'll do it at the mils (informal gathering).
So that my father, who has been through joy, play, and victory, might keep the team going.
They drank the cup, they drank the cup, they drank the cup, they drank the cup, they drank the cup.
God hears you, but.
Lala posed for photos with the players and will hold a press conference soon.
Waco is a high-ranking editor of the sports page who will conduct an interview with him.
What a picture!
Don't go too far from me.
Come on, let the picture come out clearly.
He told me he's not happy.
What's your reaction to your baker sons' players' great victory in this tournament?
With the fighting spirit
And the effort.
And loyalty to bakeries
Bo Nasser means no trouble. We witnessed the baker's team throughout the round, running in a 4-4-2 formation.
Loyalty to the bakeries and his trained line.
Thank you, Uncle Abu Nasser.
May God protect you.
Here is the guard
The one whose wealth is in the league and the cup, they came to do an interview with you.
This tail isn't council-related.
They sent their delegate to you to arrange a meeting with you.
They drank the cup, they drank the cup, they drank the cup, they drank the cup.
We know that we encourage the youth.
Inshallah, I will witness you seeing it in the future.
Yes, goodbye.
Your phone doesn't stop ringing and your pictures are in the newspapers. Congratulations on this success.
Do you know what he was telling me?
The price of machines has come down, he said, "Tamer, Abu Nasser, let's buy one."
Now I'm famous, and they only print my picture in the sports section of international newspapers under the sponsor of the top athlete in the global bakeries.
I am away from football.
What is this talk?
I was, since I was little in middle school.
The one who followed me was playing soccer.
You say, "Stay away from the football."
As long as the one who is guarding plays football, I am close to the ball.
It means I'm close to sports, which means I'm an athlete.
That means we're no longer international bakeries, we're international sports arenas.
Yesterday, I heard him say that he intends to make it a sports club.
Of course, today we meet the best athletes in international sports at the Bou Nasser public bakery.
To develop football.
Of course, before the match, we'd like to know your predictions, and before you take the stage.
The match is difficult today.
And the team that controls the text line will have a tough day.
Inshallah, we are currently reaching out to professional player agents to develop the International Baker's Team.
His name is Saud, listen to me, really, respect him, respect him a lot.
Listen to me, dad. The deal that just went through is for the players' transfer fee that came to us.
We gained nothing.
When I gave you the prices
The prices we sell to the world at.
"It means how, it means the Gulf is not like the world."
Of course no.
Here is the translation of the text "هايدا منه شغلك" into English: "This is your job."
All you have to do is let me know when the Gulf buyer comes.
Keep your fax open.
Two defenders, one midfielder, and one striker.
Look, my love, I'm telling you, the four-leaf clover players.
Three of them are the head.
Two thousand
One dollar took them all, Jackie once.
How much will it cost you 600,000? I'll give them to you in cash, 550,000 dollars.
This is sweet now, this is for the empty ones, now we're here for the Brazilians.
This player is worth $1 million, and even $200,000.
We've noted the price, but I'll send you a fax later with the details. It's in the moment I'm writing this, inside the fax machine at the club in the Emirates.
You are the owner of the veil, and the veil has deceived you.
Delivered
Wow, by God, look at that man's chicken leg.
How come?
Knee (both words, "الركبه" and "الركبه", are the same in English)
The knee, the whole knee.
We don't cheat after an ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) tear or something like that.
Oh, Abu Nasser
What is this connective tissue?
Slaughterhouse: They're all flat there, by God, you didn't disappoint.
Frankly speaking, Nasser, you succeeded, that means you have good players, the Brazilian and the others, congratulations, congratulations.
God bless you.
I say, the store is storing these two crates, by God, the store.
Wow, you have another business.
La la la, but they're just playing.
Hollow frozen crates
The roots of every good thing come from the depths of Africa.
Yes, why back again?
Karm is a hero with one cartoon.
These human beings are beautiful.
He says you didn't hear it.
They tell you that these are beautiful.
As long as we're together
Why don't you give us this little plant as a gift along with them?
Let me say to my father, Bo Nasser, if you take care of him and raise him well, it will benefit you.
He will first go to the national team, then he will run around on this field.
How many, how many, how many?
Roast it slowly on him. Roast it slowly on him, you'll see it's tender.
Put it in the air conditioner attachment, goodbye.
I have all the players you need.
If only the owner of this coach understands.
We're two zeroes in control of the match.
This one is a coach in Spain.
I love it.
Successful coach
The one who organizes the flow of play during the match.
The north, for example, is the opposite of the line of Wukhr.
Frankly, this is your coach, you can't do whatever you want with him.
The coach, yabe yabe, hasn't been with the team for two months.
We need to find a solution with him.
If only Korey Jan understood that the sides weren't going to keep attacking from deep for the entire match.
He's sitting on his guard, relying on the sneak attack trap.
Oh my god, and may those who surrender to you not hurt my head.
It is expected that he withdraws his support.
And Shinamwa put his bubble in the heart of the people to make them happy.
No, no, no, no, no. He can't even play.
Shululu habibo taba lawa, khale yuli.
Any line
According to plan
And so Hololo
It's not necessarily a requirement that there be a relationship between the manager and the team coach.
And the star of the match today, and the team star scores a super hat-trick, God upon you, Jacolamanando.
How does it mean that we don't understand football?
Hear, O Sultan.
Let him go home.
La la, don't reach them by car, let them take a taxi.
You don't have to bother anymore.
Come on, stay with me on this call.
That means just what my father did.
The coach made us sit like this.
What will he do next?
The team was destroyed.
Say hello to our team.
Mama, mama
"No one is awake means he's telling you to come, you're divorced. Say the truth if something happened between you."
From the very first day I saw him, I said to my mother, "These people are not for us; I didn't like them."
He feels it's not his responsibility.
Let's leave out the extra talk and stick to the present.
The spirit of truth belongs to her father, and from him you should learn the story. Why did your daughter get divorced?
And God, I will tell you, brother Rashid.
But why did he divorce her?
La la, it can't be, Abu Abdullah, we need to know why the girl divorced. It's our right to know.
Please, you have no business here.
How could I not intervene when he was sitting in the bar, wanting to know why his daughter got divorced?
Those who don't understand how to appreciate their spouse or respect their feelings.
And who is she from Barcelona?
I'm not to blame, I don't know how to speak Spanish.
Barcelona isn't just a city.
This is Guardiola's team.
That means I'm going to meet the guy who's waiting for me in the mall now.
If you don't go, I will. It's fine, just leave it to me. Get out of it, you people I don't know, how can I raise your daughters?
Close the door, don't shake your head like that.
Oh, it's not enough that she betrayed FC Barcelona.
Messi is a ball magician; he doesn't go a game without scoring a hat-trick.
Maradona, who is Maradona, said that Messi will be better than me.
And your daughter, who has no shame, has wronged him. See now.
Your daughter is neither from Barcelona nor from our town.
Why are you saying this?
Listen to me, God will guide you.
It's your intention to make me give birth.
He goes to apologize to her and soothe her.
I can't translate "اتخسي" into English as it doesn't seem to be a valid or recognizable word in any language.
And after that, thank God, we have a lot of good things.
We will be poor if we do not prosper in our homeland.
Oh my god, really?
The condition is that if I propose to you, she must be from Barcelona.
Mom, I'm not upset.
I don't understand, mom. Just forget about it. It's gone to hell.
Hack here, hack there, oh mother.
You have no idea, Mom, who the real losers are.
You are the only one I wish for.
Here mom
You broke my heart.
Poor her, she hasn't been seen for two days.
After a marriage that lasted just one month, it's a sin.
Why are you trying to drag me into this?
Mom, I don't want to get into trouble with him.
And you're telling me this nonsense that doesn't make any sense.
I don't have to deal with it.
You have no idea who this child might turn out to be.
What's up?
Her fate is written.
You're telling me about the building that I've been wanting to buy and turn into a furnished hotel apartment.
What's happening in Mansoura?
His father's right means tomorrow when his son takes our daughter and demands the building.
And if you are able
Tell her brother.
Hear me out.
If his father is a millionaire.
Do you know what a millionaire means?
The opportunity doesn't come twice.
You know that I have a villa in Spain, but they only use it in the summer.
So, this story about Barcelona, what does it mean?
The family could have spread this rumor to prove their daughter's innocence.
Even if we assume that the matter is true and the person loves Barcelona and has loyalty to Catalonia.
It is expected that his wife respects this.
And nothing went wrong with the team.
This if we assume that the matter is true.
God bless his father, his name is Bo Burjeen, because he has two towers on the corniche.
Do them in an unusual way like a rope twisted around each other.
People who see them from afar might think they are one tower.
"Ashqalti ya'ij al-khair ya'ij ha" translates to "I've been waiting for good things to come."
Praise be to God from whom we are.
God keep you safe, please extend your hand to help me with something, God keep you safe.
Thank you darling
Just let me know, my father Abdullah's eyes are waiting for your response.
No, O mother of Abdullah, do not grieve, for you are the light of my eyes.
If I were to look for the best in the Gulf Cooperation Council, I wouldn't find anyone better than you.
Come on, tell them to submit their estimates for building the tower.
I'm done like that. Order something if you want, sir.
Who do your parents pray to?
See their wedding requests are ready, prepare the check and I will sign it.
In the name of God, what God wills, in the name of God, what God wills. After your permission, sir, with your permission.
After Abdullah's response
Inshallah the children, and money too, Inshallah.
God bless you, Auntie.
Wear it to keep warm.
Oh, but I don't know where my mom booked for us.
Mom, I want to know where you booked for us.
My mother says she booked us a trip to Malaysia.
What's up with Malaysia, man?
Goodbye
How do you heal from the honeymoon phase?
Heal me, mother, tell me.
Tell me what's happening, mom.
She's wide awake here.
Why does she think so?
Let her handle her pride.
Mother, you did well to take her to her parents' house.
You broke my heart.
Hello everyone
So what's the problem here?
What happened there?
God keep you. Don't forget to bring us some olive oil from Spain.
Where in Spain should we go?
Anytime
My mother says she booked us a trip to the Maldives.
Don't worry, mom, after the Maldives, it's nice.
And while you're at it, may God bless you all, inshallah.
Now I said you're coming back happy from the trip.
Why does he take the children away from me, the one who is close to my heart?
Come, let's take the bag.
They are the links between them
What's wrong, my dear?
Shut up, you and whoever is teaching me about my father's face.
What's wrong, Mom? What's bothering you?
If I don't see the fruits, I get depressed.
May those who disturb you not live, mother.
Leave it to her, but divorce her. You don't have to worry about her; your father is very wealthy and there are many girls.
Shut up, you and whoever lets you go, I know him well. Down below, there's nothing and he's just living in discomfort.
Go, mom, call her and divorce her.
May God bless her.
Wah wah say it three times.
You are divorced, moment by moment, no more two more times after this.
Divorced, divorced.
And God, I'm nervous, go (or: stop) shaking.
Just go, Mom, please go and rest, and get rid of your worries forever. The girls are fine, as they always say, "Go, Mom."
Oh, it's a problem.
Just because he saw you at the dance floor.
Hit him, hit him, let me talk to him.
She said to her mother, "I'm done with him. He said, 'You're divorced, divorced.'"
He who has no shame is truly rude.
Now, just going to the dance hall by myself, it's not that I don't want to dance, it means
And if necessary, shake it well to make sure there's nothing inside.
"It's all good, what does it mean that the world has turned upside down?"
I'm original, if I don't go to his house right now and wash his sails, then he won't know that you're a girl.
I am I, O Abu Abdullah, my daughter is divorced.
My daughter is getting divorced.
A feather grew on her head.
You buy and sell them from Toy stores.
Just as Yufag is now burning for his daughter and my tribe.
And the most important thing they did was to help the poor.
I won't give you the apple with the skin peeled off.
It's fine if you shoot them as you please.
Fragile, according to his word.
This is just a normal thing, don't worry about it.
Drink from the cup that God's creation drank from.
And what your soul doesn't approve of.
Do not please them.
Do you know, this assembly ground was his.
And in a strategic location.
Just leave it to God.
No, and stop being so trivial.
My current status is standing.
I need to get Bu Saqr's approval.
Yes, indeed, I went to the office, but I didn't find it.
They told me last week that he was leaving.
I can only smell it tomorrow, after tomorrow. I'm standing here now, the problem is that I need Bu Saqr's approval.
Go to the party.
No, no, no, this is official business.
His place is with God, if God wills. The office is not the home.
After he eats
Bo Saqr returned, having had his fill.
Every one has its own key.
Say, O Abu Fahd.
You are what you know.
Tell me, I only know him through TV, and you never told me you were his age.
Just means that we don't have that knowledge.
May God cut off your talk.
God guide you, but you didn't even believe before you borrowed and spent. At least ask where this determination comes from.
There's no better occasion than this, God guide you.
The month has thirty days, and he makes dinner fifty times.
I suggest, if you're so inclined, that you get yourself listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
The most common thing in the world is making dinner.
Unless I say who this authority is that you have with you.
Welcome, may God bless this hour.
It is our honor, may you live long.
Go on, O son of Farmer!
He says that Bu Saqr makes dinner every day.
This is what we see.
But, O Father of Flah, tonight's dinner is a special occasion.
Today, God willing, your son, Falcon, will be fine.
"Machallah, you deserve it, may God bless you."
Welcome the righteous child, for his mention brings peace; may God bless you, father.
Peace be upon you.
Shenhu returned.
On the occasion, my son Saqr will go to the agency tomorrow and choose the car he wants.
I've been waiting for approval for a year and a half.
Stop right there.
But when I got to him
And he sewed it up.
God guide you, Abu Saad.
That's just how things are.
Tell him it's over.
He walks around the lot and picks out the car he likes.
We buy him three
I will take you there.
I am spiritually drawn to him.
You said you wouldn't meet him again in your lifetime.
Today, his little son, Shahin
He plays his game in the evenings.
This is your chance.
Pass by and bless him.
You deserve safety, long-lived one.
Oh, O Falcon or O Seagull
God bless you, you all.
Thank God for the safety of our son, Shahin, long may he live.
God bless you.
Except for the brother.
May you live long.
You didn't recognize me.
May God reward you for your efforts.
I was with you in your long life, the general age.
Even when I remember, I bought a red swimming cap.
I am Allah, who will protect you.
I was in the hospital.
Visit one of our children
I am honored to serve you.
He's still hesitating, should he enter the market or not.
I want to be with you, brother.
Why, O father, the falcon knows that trade is fine.
You have never set up an office and looked.
بو صقر (Bu Saqr)
Long-lived, do not hesitate and say yes.
Shenhu returned.
My gift is a falcon.
Full cycle
And if trade loves you and comes to you, tell it, "I don't need it."
Today, I have everything like you. You are the one who got the license, thank God, and the world has opened up for you. A free car and the best office on the corniche.
Yesterday, Ams Al- Abdulaziz said, "If Saqr wants to join the business, he can come in as a partner with 50%."
Mom, how can I balance trade and university?
Mother, don't force me to do something I don't like.
And by God, agencies, offices, and cars are being given to you for free.
Opportunity, my old friend, in this day and age, one can start a business without any capital.
Your wealth is the love of people for your father.
Stay smart and invest it.
Believe me, son, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Get ready to cook dinner, Allah willing, as soon as possible.
"What a relief, he finally arrived with the rent and the pepper."
Don't leave anything, don't leave anything for tomorrow, I'm afraid someone will take the samosa agency.
Your daughter has opened herself up to business.
This is what I've been asking you to find out what he told me today.
I want to expand more after investing.
He wants to go to the Caribbean and invest in the islands there.
Keep away from the eyes of the envious.
Bo Sultan told me yesterday that your son has just entered the business.
He has twenty agencies and six restaurants, and is a shareholder in two banks.
Oh, I gave him the raw end that doesn't even deserve a certificate or a name.
As far as I know, and God knows best, they haven't opened it yet.
This is the one in the northern part of our office area.
It's on my mind.
May God bless you, congratulations, Abbas!
In the name of God
God bless you.
The delay does not benefit regret.
What, Dad, what? A whole year of hardship and fatigue preparing for the supermarket.
What's going on? Every day, he keeps delaying.
This secretary, whose name is Samir, is really annoying me.
He says, "This is a deal between you and Bu-Sqr. He wants to partner with you instead of taking the shop from you."
After you've found a partner
There is no power or strength except by Allah.
But after I see you, you started laughing with him.
He asked me who the brother was.
Tell him to come here.
Why did you tell him you have an Iranian baker?
When we were walking by that place, there wasn't a small sign with the word "Shno Shno" written on it. What was the name written on the sign?
Written: Al-Frij Bakery
No, I want a different name.
And upon you be peace.
How's the work with you?
Good, may God prolong your life, we will complete the workers' housing plan for Future Company tomorrow or the day after.
La la, Monsieur Zar is my boss, I know you, Monsieur Zar, as the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?
Let her take one of the company cars by herself.
Thank you very much, you're so kind.
This is even cooking by science and study.
Today, someone comes to you and says, "I work in the business field with just a few shekels and want to invest them."
But what we have between us has neither knowledge, nor study, nor understanding of economics, nor even trade.
One like this
You believe he will succeed, but I think he will waste his time and lose.
Hear you, Abu Nasser.
I heard the two sparrows saying
Your sentence seems to be in a non-standard form of Arabic, possibly a dialect or a misspelling. The closest English translation I can provide based on the context is: "Your speech is unclear."
This is what you have, and my falcon, may God bless him.
Praise God for him (Jovoh, may God bless him)
Examine it today.
Long-lived, we didn't talk about your son, Falcon.
We're talking about the base.
Your son, Falcon, may Allah bless him, is an exception.
He says, "Just talk about the base."
We were frightened; my son the falcon built himself a nest.
He gave him a car as a gift once.
Sell it, invest the money, and his advice is to do the same.
And Allah has given you strength as you have seen.
Oh, father, we are talking about ordinary people.
And one of them, Abu Nasser, took him and put his hand on his neck.
He's got a gift for business, praise God.
Massive economic trends
We need to ask who his father is.
It is forbidden, by God, that I am astounded.
As God wills
Gulf Assets Magazine in the Economic Referendum
Please save
And upon you be peace. Hello, hello, Salem.
"Inshallah, no harm."
And I don't know what to tell you, Salim.
Yes, tell me.
The situation is really serious.
The company sent a fax to your father.
And they said to him, "It's done."
Our home could not bear it.
As you can see.
He told you the moment he heard the news.
He fell on the desk and the fax machine is broken.
And he has a great influence on him.
"He taught me shooting, as he said, but when his arm grew strong, he threw me away."
What did the doctor say now?
Pray for him, O Salem.
I am shocked.
Responsible in such a world.
A man gives the poor with his right hand, without his left hand knowing.
This association, of course, delivers its donations to all Muslims in all parts of Asia and Africa.
But of course, I want you to also explain to us, dear old man, about your future goals and steps, God willing.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Our goal at the Falcon Charity Association is to achieve mutual support within this nation.
In addition to sixty blankets for our afflicted brothers and sisters in the Pakistan earthquakes.
This is also finally, not last, meaning we are now providing for seven poor families.
A monthly salary of 1,320 shekels only.
We're not late for you.
And then we'll catch up with you right away.
Who is in my life
These are Khalid and his wife, they are hosting us tonight at the hotel.
By God, I'll be happy in any place, any place, where you and I are.
My life, God keep you, O Lord.
After my heart
This is my livelihood, it's forbidden.
This bakery
Taking money will do you good.
Five shekels for five kilos of flour, three shekels for bread.
Two cotton
Five bags of sugar for a good price.
Roll up the sleeves and get to work.
Come on, you little devils.
The captain has arrived and brought breakfast.
He wants a real estate
"Please, old man."
Back to what?
La la, the request I'm asking you, I need to hear your word, hear it in your own voice, echo it in my ears.
Hello Nora
"Al-Anoud is angry with you."
Why am I the one who upsets you?
Inshallah, it will be fine.
Why are you upset?
Nora has two simple and simple faith.
Don't say that, it'll make her upset.
Why are all these Lebanese people so nice?
You won't be able to hide it, and you'll take and give to him a lot.
And I want to rise up too.
Even the sweetest fruit cannot surpass the beauty of the most exquisite flower.
They indulge her after he tells her to.
Free and beautiful, it remains.
I paid twenty thousand and received twenty thousand rials.
Congratulations on the compensation, God willing.
God is with you.
Hello, may God bless you, Mother Saleh.
Hey Fadi, it seems you're busy. I don't want to keep you.
In my eyes, it's present.
Hello, hello
The message reached you yesterday.
Arrived Yalbaykh
You liked the joke.
Okay, did you bring the design with you?
I don't have time to make them, show me your designs and I'll choose from them.
Frankly, your taste is sweeter.
He made us jealous again.
I realized that my project was a success and started to reap the benefits.
He tells you there's a project like mine.
Design and tailoring shop
Women's clothing
This is Bo Nasser, who has nothing to do with trade.
Your sons are present.
He looks like his uncle's son.
In these days
Good, good, my cousin.
Can you believe I was sleeping? They woke me up and said your cousin is calling for you.
Inshallah, it's a good matter.
Inshallah, it will be good.
Oh, how I wish.
What do you intend to do with any project, for example, for example.
Just so you know, do you want a partner or something?
I heard they say you're planning on coming by. I said, "Maybe."
Hello and welcome.
And if you want to increase it, how?
Thank God, the work is excellent.
What should I do, Abu Saleh?
But we missed the deadline for the application last week.
By God.
God willing, goodbye, see you soon.
He remains.
Are you sure?
With her comes detail, and you don't know the big trouble.
After the storm
He opened a store next to your store.
Oh, jealous and hateful one.
Before I knew that the market was open to everyone.
I need to know.
Your heart needs to be open to your cousin.
"مب ياي انا اسالك" translates to "I'm not asking you" in English.
You pretend, you attract, you laugh at me, and you act like it's all for me.
I wanted to do my job secretly.
You're taking up space in my store that got ruined.
And Allah knows best, but they said, "Come, congratulate me, sit down, and I will show you something that is bothering me."
This is jealousy, this is hatred, by God, by God, this hatred has broken me.
Are you guys alright?
May God bless you, O Bu Saleh.
Hit me up, man, I'll send you some packs, you fool.
Extend your hand as you extended yours, and you will have earned your bread.
Hey guys
O people, pray for the Prophet.
I haven't done anything, God, God.
A Filipino designer advised me.
There is no limit to what you can achieve.
Why does a Lebanese person care?
Chit-chat with him, play around, laugh, and relax completely.
I see Bou Salha bringing a Lebanese person.
He kept telling me and convincing me.
He bewitched me with his words.
He convinced me and made me pay twelve thousand rials.
And after two days, God, your agent, went to the flea market and found there his twin brother, who was 190 shekels.
And get out of debt.
He is a Lebanese designer.
Can I meet with the professor yesterday you told me it's hard to get an appointment, it's still hard.
Oh God, today is even harder.
I feel like Abu Saleh is acting strange these days.
What is it?
No, I don't know what it is.
Abu Saleh is very stressed psychologically after opening his cousin's shop and hiring a Lebanese designer like him.
I'm sorry, I've been late with the store's sales reports for the past two weeks.
What's the problem here? Every time I open a store in my area, another one opens up right next to it, doing the same project. Can't I compete with them?
La la la, with designer Fadi Hla, they are thinking of a solution.
How is this now?
They're sitting under the tree.
If we finish this shape, I think we won't even enter the store.
A distant place from them means
That means "Make way for them."
Alright, thank you. And how much is the discount?
"اشدعوه" means "of course" or "definitely" in Arabic. The complete translation of the sentence would be: "Of course, hopefully you don't give evening gowns for free with every wedding dress."
My people have driven me out.
What's up? We have a special deal at the store where we bought your wedding dresses today. For every wedding dress, you get two evening dresses for free. Plus, there's an additional 25% discount!
Come on, let's go, let's go.
No need to wait for two weeks, the same dress will be back on sale. Make one wedding dress purchase and get two dresses for free with a 25% discount.
They are fighting us.
I think that way too because if we leave them, they'll ruin our house.
And don't worry.
Radiant afterward
This means a challenge and I appreciate it.
It's not a challenge for kids.
"You're doing well, it's good that you make the most of what you have. No one else should be given the chance to profit from it."
Don't worry, I'll tell you the news in a couple of days or three, if I don't get to it all at once.
Well done on you
Stay sweet, stay sweet, I'm coming to get you now, come on, bye!
Best regards
Saad says the store is unbearable, the smell is bad. He says he doesn't know where it's coming from.
The smell has nothing to do with your air conditioner.
Her scent hasn't left the store at least six days ago.
One hundred percent
Yay, at night
Cut off the electricity wires from the shop.
This means this is fair.
Now, you're signing a statement or we'll make a case and open a file.
Do something for him.
At the end of existence
Hey Uncle Bonasar, something strange is happening, no one is entering the shop.
Abu Nasser is sweetening his words, when he comes to me, I will tell you something strange.
He is lying on his bed, unconscious.
I was just about to say that my current mental state is... I mean, bro, I was scared to tell him that the bank is calling and they want their installments.
His cousin, the wretched fellow, left him with debts.
What happened this time?
So if they entered the store by mistake and saw the designer Saad, they shouted at him and left.
He was there, staring with wide eyes at the ceiling.
I don't know what happened to me.
Saad is in the shop.
What have you done to him, mother?
What the women see, they invent to be afraid of.
I don't know what they did.
He lost me.
Give me a wide, brother.
I'm afraid they'll imprison me.
And I have no evidence against him for me to go and complain about him.
I don't know what they did, I don't know what they did.
Let him earn it.
And if someone asks you, tell them about the magic you did; you turned the designer into a monster, and women are afraid when they see him.
A rumor spread about him.
Whatever happens, guys, tell him the photography group needs him urgently.
Hey guys, whoever God guides, tell them they are needed, urgently.
And God, they're making my blood boil, they're driving me crazy. Don't come here, Professor Abdullah.
Don't worry, Ahmed, my love. I'm not getting angry like this. You're a man of the heart, and this isn't good for you, son.
And, by God, I've been calling him a lot, he's really bothering me, but there's no use with this dumbass, he's driving me crazy.
You don't do anything right in my mind.
Go back to the corner you came from.
Its sweetness is twenty-five scenes, eighteen chapters, oh Ahmad, we want to finish.
And then it means I stop the filming so the camera assistant doesn't get in the way.
This production process
Well, Professor Abdullah, it's just that this is how I am, why are you pushing me?
My love, no one will disturb you.
The translation of "اشصاير عبدالله" into English is "Abdullah's affairs".
Late and desperate competitors
Ahmed, I don't want any of my loved ones.
Show me one person who convinces others that it's really possible to become a millionaire, a billionaire—not just anyone.
Just go to the photo booth, make your request, and it will be ready within an hour.
It's not just anyone, Ali. It's not just anyone, I'm still explaining it to him.
I'm done taking care of myself, I'll manage in two scenes, not just one.
Fantwa bear the responsibility, and as the production manager, you bear the responsibility.
And when they do what?
They'll do everything to avoid the exit, they're frustrated, but they'll find a way.
I need one with specific features that ensure its security.
Are you serious?
I didn't hear the director say anything.
I have one. May God help you with it, hopefully it will be useful.
SS Saud Aknar
Saud Qotati, it's me who tells him, Saud Inar.
In the old days, when he was small, they used to call him Saud Al-Nar, but when he grew up, they called him Al-Qutati.
Why cans?
I tell you why he is poor, wandering the streets, picking up cans, and selling them by the kilo.
My brother, sing with pride, not with shame.
His shape needs to fit the hole, the hole that Amdouh described this way, and the master builder has no length or width.
It means "It definitely works."
Inshallah, but I just want to tell you that you've done the makeup perfectly. It will definitely work; his blood type is light after all.
What's the problem? I'm just about to speak.
I don't have the number.
I'll just take the prince with me and go to him.
Where is Saud's house?
What will he say?
Shut up, shut up you.
Saud Qawati
We don't have anyone in our neighborhood named Saud Qawati.
I'm sure he's in the neighborhood, but which house is it?
This is a house of one family called Saud who live there with their mother only.
Iowa, that's right.
But this isn't a Saudi can
This is a Saudi laptop.
Sure, here is the translation: "It's definitely so, but it evolves with time; laptops are like cans."
He is tall, robust, and has a tan skin.
Cancel the order of the idiots and start oppressing my laptops, god damn it, god damn it, god damn it, uncle.
Going to the market to buy them for me, and where's the other one?
God knows, I really don't know.
These are the ones that wear it all.
I have another one. Where's the second scarf, mom?
The right to education
This is what I've been looking for, where is it?
Fax and Buffas
Heat them up a bit before they break, mom.
These days, I'm feeling overwhelmed.
God, I miss you since yesterday. I want to visit you, go to the emergency room, but you say no.
They told me they would give me...
Alhamdulillah, this is it, dad. It's time to stop your idle sitting and get to work.
Oh, come back, mom, goodbye.
Calm down, you're overreacting, you're acting stupidly, you're climbing up.
Move a little, move a little, with your camera in hand, move your feet.
Yes, Jafar, yes.
Whose laptop is this?
Any real representative of Abdullah Al-Lumaiq is a great actor.
This is how you say "How are you? I'm Fatem Ebud's son" in English: "This is how I am, at your place, I am Fatem Ebud's son."
How are you, my friend?
Just calm down, okay? Here, respect yourself a little in front of people.
Any boy from our neighborhood
Relax, relax, relax, relax, ahh, ahh.
I love acting, hopefully they'll give me a challenging role.
And God, brother, I really can't tell you.
I'm tired, God, I swear, I didn't sleep last night, brother.
Asthma is a godsend, may Allah heal it.
God heal her.
I'm in the springtime of my life.
Oh teacher, oh teacher
He has asthma, so he takes his mother's medication.
He is not a doctor.
I hate to say it, but you're full of it.
What is her name?
Fuck you, what do you think?
I heard they're talking about you.
You say light, make it a bit heavier.
Give me five million repairs for my car's engine.
Give him three million Egypt to have dinner.
Tony, I'm asking you why you're arguing like this.
Because I'm slow according to some people's requests.
You're oblivious, dear professor, our country's production of actors is at a high level.
Currently excellent means it's suitable for the role.
It's sweet of you to help, but I'm just an observer, I don't have anything to contribute.
Hi, your house is beautiful.
By God, I'm in the spring of my life.
Take the student to the makeup room, do their makeup, and Salman will, God willing, help you choose your outfit and assist you.
Walk, walk, walk, it's so nice.
AI AI
Listen, brother, leave the car with us until we finish filming, then I'll call you to come pick it up.
And don't worry, just find someone to take me.
It will get you there, no need to worry, I'll make sure you get there. Thank you, my friend, thank you very much, thank you.
Come on, call your friends, this is a competition, call them now!
Hey guys, call Saud to bring the laptop to the makeup room.
Come on, bro, clean my teeth.
It's written in front of me.
God willing, let's say.
I'm done, that means
I didn't expect that from you.
Why are we just sitting here doing nothing?
We're not just going to give up our rights.
Patience
And know who I am talking to about Abd al-Aziz.
Why did you divorce her, bro?
Just divorce her.
And we don't take a thief's daughter.
No, I don't need it. What do you think?
Just add it later, but the most important thing is that you prepare yourself to go into the dressing room to change your clothes, and we're ready for the shoot.
My teeth are expensive.
"Oh, come on, this scene is badly shot."
Why then?
We don't want to stay here anymore, my brother. My stomach is swollen. I'm tired of this tea. What's happening to us? We've been waiting for hours, waiting to see when...
Dad, I've seen nothing after you. This is normal.
God gives you health.
They're quick, God willing.
God keep you, may your life be long, in God's safety.
Greetings to the group
They say, "Bo Abd al-Aziz sends you his greetings."
God willing, may your age be long.
Candies
Assure Islam upon you, they love your anger.
For the first time, someone loves me for who I am.
How do they love them on their faces?
Problems
His mouth is like a frozen scoop of ice cream, your lips are puckered sweetly sweetly.
And God, after you didn't laugh.
May I ask you?
The best representative
I hope there's no harm in her voice.
Ah ah, I'm tired, wait for me.
Come, look at it quickly.
Welcome, Sheikh!
Go around here or there, find your own way.
Hear me, please.
Yes, indeed!
Hollow respects are excessive.
What's happening, dad?
And upon you be peace. What's up, sir/madam?
Let go, let go, let go.
Don't worry, Inshallah it will be, Doctor Hassan, come, come.
Hey Dr. Hani, what's up?
Let him rest for a while at his desk.
You haven't given me any options.
Everyone will hopefully recover safely.
Please, have a seat, long-lived one.
Shut up or I'll slap you.
I am proud of my name, Bouabdeaziz.
Call me, say "Aunty"
How are you, Uncle?
By God, what a wonder!
Yes, long live you.
Please, sir, rest.
May God bless you
With the chef
Go with him, Mr. Rashad.
And by God, if they do anything to you, let me know and I'll show you how to deal with it.
Comrade, can I get a doctor quickly?
My mother is sick, doctor.
Wait for your turn. Your turn is next.
Hear me, please.
Can a companion be possible?
Dad, please hurry, she's tired.
Despite your frequent visits to the hospital, you never mentioned seeing your mother, and they're all fine, they're happy with the least care.
It's not like country girls.
Don't let the country's girls go astray.
Just go find someone from the hospital.
Mood swing
Just bro, give me a chance.
If you're about to approach her, smile at her, make her feel comfortable, give her your number, and your intentions are pure.
There's nothing, there's nothing at all.
Respect yourself
Or else, if you don't listen, I'll speak to your teacher so that you learn.
La la ma bi ma bi shi
It's not necessary to leak the information.
I am a simple creature.
La la, thank you.
You can take it and go.
The one who talks to you is a fool.
Marrying him means marrying him.
La la, I want the coat, I want the clothes, I want the car, after I rent it from you.
So that I can reward you for your effort.
Lalala moment
God willing
What is this, a lazy slob?
Hello and welcome, God bless whoever comes from us, hello.
What shelter did my eyes look for yesterday?
I wish you had come.
I'll tell you, they were amazed by what I did for them. It was a very sophisticated and unique party.
One regular and one diet.
He doesn't have an excuse anymore.
What's this?
Mom, I'll be late for work tomorrow.
Inshallah, this will take them there.
What's wrong with him?
Nوره come up
What is this?
Do that for your own good.
"Enduring the studio sessions will make everyone talk about us."
Give me some money and I'll go buy you something classy.
Just wait, I'll keep my promises now.
I have to take him tomorrow.
Now that we're free, let's change into something cleaner so we can get something nice for ourselves in front of people.
What's the matter, oh God?
Its price is reasonable and its quality is much better.
Above average means not the highest type.
Even if it's a chocolate for the amazing chefs, I'm sorry, I thought you might need the suitable price.
After all these expenses, we still have to pay for the most expensive one.
It's not possible to check this artistic touch.
Heidi is the name of the royal chocolate.
The same chocolate that the Spanish royal court always requests.
Give me this.
Congratulations, and by the way, it also comes with a warranty certificate.
Please, please be happy.
Come on, bro, give us some of that chocolate, bro.
I say, what's the occasion, wolf?
There is no valid Abdulqader in the accounts.
Inshallah, you deserve it, come after I give you one, then come.
And we were immediately energized by the coffee.
My aunt went to their wedding.
My dear, where did you go to their wedding? It made me sick to my stomach. Can you believe it, my sister?
I heard what your aunt said.
That's why I want to make you a wedding, whether it happens or not.
There's not much left, we only have a month and a half.
I'm organizing everything.
Just come back, please.
You're not living in the real world; you don't see people celebrating their weddings, dividing their wealth and possessions.
And I saw your soul
When I bought you something, I saw how they praised you and your taste.
They told you it's great and nice.
Just, but how much did we pay?
The money we paid for the coffee brought four sheep for the wedding.
And whoever makes you surrender, you should not let your mother interfere. She knows how to do everything. All you have to do is give her the money.
It means they agree to whatever we choose.
You're right, you have no taste.
What do you think about the apocalypse?
But discrimination costs more money.
Why, why did the one who left become sweet?
What do you think of this?
For the first time in Qatar's history, someone is thinking of making a couch in the shape of a computer mouse.
With your permission, I'll grill it.
Look, don't talk about everything except the couch and the arrangements. This is the place where women sit and do nothing but talk. Just shut up.
The real one is waiting for us.
We want this mouse pad.
Strange corner
Guess the model of the year 2012.
Okay, we've taken the mouse.
Relax, it's all for your own good.
The important thing is, they chose whether to add twenty thousand to Noah's ark or fifty-twenty-five thousand to the mouse.
Proceed, we are ready.
You are not the first one to get married.
If you think you're going to get married in the Comoros, you're mistaken; this is a small country.
We're just at the beginning.
If you don't want a couch, where will the bride sit in the tent?
Iron, paint, and burnt wood
And the people are happy.
They exploit us and keep us in the dark; they're frauds through and through.
And now, what does that mean?
Angry and frustrated
You want me to get married already?
I speak to the bride's mother and tell her that Saleh has difficult circumstances.
He doesn't want to get married because he can't afford the wedding expenses. Of course, I want to talk to her, seriously, I will talk to her.
We received a beautiful bouquet from the Netherlands today.
I put them on the wedding tables for me.
Sure, here is the translation: "Definitely for the first time in Doha."
And the Middle East after.
Put it on the bill.
What does "جم اتزيد" mean in English? The phrase "جم اتزيد" is in Moroccan Arabic and translates to "How much do you increase" or "How much more do you add."
Two and seventy, that is salvation.
I just don't want to see this kind of setup at any wedding, not even at my own.
You know after people have left.
Consider them booked.
Do you really get paid more than me?
A door will open for you that you never knew was closed.
May God help you, Saleh.
Just come on, God guide you. I was trying to sort things out a bit.
But thank God, I have decided to go and see the right woman from any Arab country.
He tells you there's a wedding party that won't cost you more than 10,000 dollars and just jump in.
God bless you, my dear.
Inshallah, his wedding will be next month.
Just count the cards and tell me.
As long as the cards serve their purpose, it's all good. The main thing is that people know where and when they're invited.
This is just what you care about, not what others say.
Do people know the level of the wedding from the invitations?
I wonder what people will say about all these cards tomorrow.
They're jealous of their wedding; these are their cards, they haven't seen the cards of so-and-so.
We didn't say that, we're just asking for it from the internet.
Its cover is made of panda bear fabric and has a silver zipper.
You can't be blamed, but I'm not responsible for you.
I don't become a treatment for women's cards asking for them means asking for them.
God, it's breaking my heart, brother.
Poor him, they must be putting a lot of pressure on him.
Oh, man, no one should borrow from him.
You say that he even sold his car.
His face looked twenty years older; in the morning, he walked and talked to himself.
Don't blame him, my poor brother. I don't know when we will progress.
Close the door and don't worry.
Forgiveness, bro.
It means you didn't try to convince them that you would have a wedding that suits your budget.
What you mean is according to my ability.
Why am I living for myself?
The problem is that our society is sick with appearances, boasting, and pretension.
You have to be sick to think you're sick.
If you want to live there.
I once caught a glimpse of the bride's mother's rights.
I only wanted my clothes.
Leave it to God.
Say it.
How did you get married?
I do not want to marry a non-Muslim.
And even if I decide to get married, brother.
I'm thinking about taking a foreigner or even an Arab.
By God, your country is beautiful.
And by God, we were planning to be the DJ for the songs.
But Mrs. Nasser finally bought the wedding dress for her son, that singer.
This singer is famous, but people don't remember his name.
Heal the broken heart.
You don't like what I'm doing.
He sold his car and every day one-fourth of the distance is covered by his employer.
I struggled to open the room and found him talking to himself.
I see your words have changed now.
Because my brother Saleh's mother is exhausted, she's finally given up.
I don't care about him or her.
I am no less than other people.
Don't let us laugh at you.
And whoever comes to me, oh mother, but my brother has spent everything he had and left no one to borrow from.
And if you stop me, it's just you.
My mother has new demands for the wedding, and my brother said, "Cancel the wedding. I don't want to get married anymore."
Now, where am I?
Inside the ISO container, there are first aid supplies.
He says now it's the best but they are arranging a room for her in the hospital.
My pair of shame.
Go easy on yourself, sister.
The doctor said, "Don't talk and I'll give you an injection so you don't fall asleep."
Where he rests, and he will leave us with a laugh for those who deserve and those who don't.
I'll tell him to bring us Abdullah Arwish, he'll say I don't have any money.
Therefore, to your mother.
He was afraid of her.
"روح لها" means "Go to her" in Arabic. The complete translation would be: "Go to her and kiss her on her head."
Just do what you want.
Send greetings to Abdullah Arwish.
I don't think Yusuf will be short with me.
It's forbidden for you, what I found, there's nothing left but Yusuf.
Heal her already.
I hope you are well, Saleh.
But the minister dismissed him because he was getting old, and besides, he was very disciplined and trustworthy.
My opinion is that if you go and tell him what you told me, it's very likely his heart will stop.
I understood.
Because of the terrible crisis you're going through, you want to ask BuYusuf for funds, of course from the ministry's funds.
And God knows when you will return them to Him.
Hey, if a group of auditors come, ask them about the money.
He might as well go to hell.
No one knows what will happen, but he knows how to act.
And by God, how are you, the man in your office, carrying the responsibility while something happens?
I've stolen all my life.
Our uncle is what they call embezzlement.
In the first step
There is a white tin can with a blue strip on it, and inside there is something that looks like what you would say, like the picture of the bird coo coo.
Inshallah, my uncle Yusuf, if it weren't for my difficult circumstances.
Return it all.
Call me Yusuf
Come, you are the last of my life.
Destroy me, Thursday.
Saleh Saleh
Hassan, listen to the words. By God, if it were anyone but you, I would have been beaten or something, ya ya ya Khalid.
Saleh Saleh
All the methods I've tried have been useless. Uncle Yusuf, I'm completely lost.
I can't withdraw from the wedding now.
They are all bald.
What's wrong? What's wrong?
La la, the terror, the second terror.
In the stair, in the stair.
My uncle Yusuf is angry with all of them.
The Gothic alarm clock with the picture of a king is crazy.
We booked two rooms for ourselves, just for makeup and hair.
And we will be there early in the morning.
We built Abdullah Arwish and his band.
You'll see, my love.
I'm not going to tell you.
Season bomb
We are the first people in the world to use it.
Mama, mama
Goodbye, take care.
There is no god but God.
Mother, don't forget to read the supplications (or protective verses) when you enter the hall tomorrow.
The women here have hot eyes.
I'm telling you, it's amazing.
Sweetest groom, may God bless you, my eyes are calm in your presence.
Mama, mama, the police are knocking on the door.
I was wrong to obey you, O God.
It is forbidden for me to get married today.
Ah, the cost of scrutiny.
By God, you're going to jail.
Byوسف Byوسف Byوسف
You people
It's really not right, brother, if this happens.
The company provided a contract worth three million, two million of which is the value of the materials.
He wrote a memo to the minister.
We said corruption, but what has reached is beyond the limits of corruption.
You're not living in this world.
Here is the translation of the given text into English: "Indeed, the minister has taken the side of Uthman."
And our manager, why didn't he protest and say he was...
I don't know about it, God, I truly don't know.
Where is ethics?
The right became wrong and the wrong became right.
Oh Saad, are you sure the minister resigned, guys? What's going on in the world?
Just leave it.
What next?
The king's sister, the minister's wife.
And this girl has a relationship with the minister.
God, what a world.
What's wrong with you, you didn't recognize her?
This is the new employee the minister appointed in place of the poor Mr. Osman.
Walk walk walk
I don't know what you want me to do, Saleh, in front of the minister.
You are a fool.
Hear me, dad.
We have children, we need to live.
We need to live
What happened?
There's a poor man standing at the corner.
Finally, loyalty and honesty, brother Saleh.
John, we can do something for you, bro.
Praise be to God in all circumstances.
What's wrong, Saleh?
From this strange land that we call home.
I see things that don't make sense.
"Amri"
Your dad went to the supermarket to get us some vegetables while you were leaving work.
I'm trying, goodbye.
Who brought my sister home?
And then he laughed and told stories, after which he left.
This is my classmate at university. What's wrong with her if it's normal for me to receive a message from her?
Wow, I can't believe what's wrong with you, you're like a stranger.
What do you say?
What do you want us to say?
Your thinking is outdated.
Right and wrong have both new and old aspects.
Right is right and wrong is wrong.
The world has evolved; we are living in the era of technology.
The age of global variables that align the world, and no one can keep up with them.
Indeed, we live and we die.
Don't blame me, Ameneh, sometimes people get frustrated and lose their temper.
What I see in a day.
Say to her, "I'm sorry."
The world is no longer running smoothly.
Zain, don't bother yourself and come have lunch.
Let me go sleep, rest.
Papa isn't mad at you.
There is no father.
There's no one angry, go wash yourself, and eat breakfast.
Come on, my love.
I am of course very eager to meet you on my first day of work.
It is our honor, may you live long.
Definitely, surely.
Of course, I know that you don't need anyone to remind you of the basics of the job.
But at the same time, it is very important.
We reclaim some of the values and principles we once held.
For the common good
As you wish, long live you.
We all need it.
You need to rob it, if you live long enough.
You will become thieves.
Thank you, thank you to all of you.
And what I want to say after that.
Beware of my first day of work.
There is only one employee between you.
Honest, dedicated, and diligent, among these lazy things.
Just a doubt
There is a trustworthy employee.
So we can take the necessary legal procedures in our ministry.
I am not sure about the context, but a literal translation of "لا ابشر طال عمرك" would be "I am not a prophet, may you live long."
Thank God, we are all thieves.
Be assured, my dear colleagues, that in front of them and behind them, I say.
Where is Khalid?
Yes, long live you.
Khaled, I commend you a lot, a lot, Allah has blessed you.
God willing, may your life be long.
By God, old man, you know how to choose.
God guide you, only.
Why do you let the devil tell you lies?
Say thank God for the trust.
Mom, why is my dad in prison?
Be quiet, mom.
La la apology
Mom, why is my dad in prison?
The pain is in my head.
He became trustworthy.
Don't say bad things about my father, Amin.
This is clothing.
Every part of your body is covered.
The translation of "شيجوفون العالم" into English is "See the world".
Inshallah, you'll find me a job like this one.
In a respectful unit, cover your body and its attractions.
She covered my chest after I congratulated her for wearing her choker, which is old.
I want to be with her.
Not only that, he followed her, and I saw him looking at her from above the bed, revealing half of her stomach with his pants.
But no use listening to the words, she doesn't want to follow the righteous path.
I tell you so.
Don't blame but yourself.
We propose our son Rashid for your daughter Sara.
One of us is busy building his daughter's future these days, except for the straight-laced guy.
And Rashid, I have good news for you.
Welcome (or: Come in)
The hero's strength comes from his humble origins.
Twenty-four hours drunk.
Drunk, tired, and after a long day, I sniffed.
And misbehavior is not to be asked about.
And indeed, good upbringing, Abu Rashid.
And I bring you news of a hypocrite after me.
And how is the trumpet?
Original or not, my child, how do drugs affect you?
"Written by [name], if you find its content exactly as it is, I'll give you five arials."
We can't propose to her, Sara, we haven't even met her yet.
You know his tricks and his antics.
Original daughter
Blessings, my child, blessings for this year of life, blessings.
I am drunk.
And I can't walk.
Here comes my father.
Goodbye, see you later.
Hurry up, hurry up, call your dad so he can come and pick you up.
Why did you call him?
Here comes one to take you away.
Where is he?
There's a hollow where someone is sitting, shrouded in a cloak, with a beautiful blonde girl by his side.
You believe your father isn't the one who gives her (the money)?
Hello my dear daughter Moni.
Majid's name was not Abdulaziz.
What justice?
My daughter loves me.
And you know that since the establishment of the State of Palestine with its capital, Jenin, in the year 2000, after signing the comprehensive peace agreement with the State of Israel.
Israel still practices terrorism, pressure, and siege against it.
The latest is what the Israelis and their Arab allies are raising against the Palestinians.
They are smuggling plastic knives through the tunnels.
In particular, the second item, paragraph f, which states that the Palestinian people should trim their nails every day.
Now, we take you to the fateful meeting.
My cheap master
When Israel agreed to the establishment of the Israeli state
Man, what are you saying? You're damaging our reputation with your actions, and you should stop.
Please, if you will.
Excuse me, Mr. Tiger, excuse me, Mr. President.
Allow me to speak.
I fully committed to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
What is this guy, the Israeli representative?
We don't have any solid objects here, neither stone nor plastic, as a matter of policy.
Even our homes, man.
What do you call the Gulf people?
In all of Palestine, everything is made of wood.
American companies, as per the agreement, make us wooden cars.
And all the doors of our homes are thermally treated wood, mate.
We don't want speeches.
Don't change the subject.
Mr. President
This point is important. I request a vote on this matter as nail grooming is a violation of the agreement.
The one who agrees raises his hand.
I just had a strange dream.
To control the students.
I wanted to tell him.
This is the fourth school I will be attending tomorrow.
Because I have to maintain my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The boys chase him, tear his clothes, and he remains silent.
How many times have I come without a headscarf?
They told me their manager said.
We don't want to let Rashid go.
The children scribble on him with chalk.
He spread his cloak in the wide place before the whole world.
And they said, "This is a teacher with a weak personality who will ruin all of us."
I tell them the story of the keyboard.
Maryam is back.
And what's new after this story in this keyboard? No one told me.
They tied him to the chair with a complete set of chains.
He sat down.
And he knew nothing about the matter.
The day that the children laugh at him in the schoolyard.
Stop it already
Your manager who I work under will call me tomorrow.
But we'll give him another chance.
So I can wait for my father to tell you.
The time of goodness and weakness is over.
My nephew Abdullah
I will see Rashid differently.
And I don't need to remind you of the important educational saying.
You are an education graduate and I am an education graduate.
We all remember the saying.
The teacher is the son of the first class.
They will meet Professor Rashid Al-Qawi.
And whoever makes a mistake
Oh woe is him
The moment I started speaking, he told me to be quiet and asked, "Where did you learn that?"
Promote ash-shabakul (a traditional Arabic coffee ceremony)
Who among you is making fun and saying, "Shut up, well?"
It's you who told me to shut up nicely.
Or rather, "It's not me."
Who's got you cornered?
Go, then go to the manager.
And he said, "Professor Rashid expelled me."
I don't want to see a patch here, I'm just listening.
How dare you in my frustration.
It's not just the first day, it's like that all year round.
Oh woe is him
The one who only hears his voice.
And I explain or I speak.
Do you know what it means?
Do you know what nervous means?
Nervous
Did you hear me say I farted or not?
After hearing him
Go out of the class.
The spirit of true leadership
Go on, take your stuff and leave.
Take your toys
By God, it's beautiful.
Sure, the translation of "اكيد لي الحين ايدوره" into English is: "I'm sure I'm still looking for it."
No teacher, we haven't seen it.
Try the ice cream with milk if it has strawberries inside, it's really sweet.
My beloved Abdurrahman
Every human being is prone to error, and Adam (son of Adam)
Cheerful grandfather
It just means that the main thing is the issue, it shouldn't reach the parents.
I don't want the chocolate in my bag.
Present and polite, your manner is polite and your speech is polite. Where is your bag?
In the class
Maybe (it's) from my eyes.
You say that God is happy with you.
You can't tell the difference between a noble child and an ordinary one.
The translation of "القراده اشلون شكلها القراده خضر حمر" into English is: "What does a toad look like? The toad is green and red."
Come here, where are you going?
In the bathroom
And I'm in the bathroom right now.
Knock on the door quickly and tell him that the first part is starting in half an hour. Hurry up!
I am one orange juice and one plaster before them all.
I took all of them a little bit out of their need, my friend Abdulrahman. This is really good for health.
Alright, now go to Saud and get me a PlayStation tape.
So, what do we learn from this story?
Man
He must possess virtues of character.
These are the money for the PlayStation and he said to me, "I'll give you the whole PlayStation back at once."
Inshallah, you can ask something after my friend Abdulrahman.
Now no.
We learn from the story.
Of course, you know that I'm leaving this week because I've been accepted into a graduate program.
So I said, "I need to hand in the event file before I leave."
How can I do as Abdulrahman told me, he said I don't know where he wants to go, but he didn't specify the time.
Every time her father comes back from a trip, he doesn't say anything, thank God, I'm safe.
Please, I took him this afternoon and he got angry and didn't say anything to his father. No, no, let him, no, no.
Hello my friend Abdulrahman
God help you.
What should we do?
So sweet, just like that.
And now, children, we will take a new lesson in science.
Peace be upon you.
Thank you, thank you.
My father loves me.
I asked what I asked from my eyes.
Teacher, teacher, how do you ask a teacher for water?
In a class where a teacher walks around, he brings water to a student who is in bed, no matter how much we try, this issue won't go away, I'll write it in the report.
You're just teasing, aren't you?
Do not raise your voice or shout at anyone, or else.
How much is this worth?
How many planets are there?
Four cars five
Excellent, this is excellent, nice, excellent.
What is this?
As you can see, they are building a parking lot in front of our homes at our expense.
Don't tell me about the good old days.
Bonasar is free.
He studies hard.
Zain broke the table.
About nervousness, I speak.
What does it mean?
There's a feather on your head.
Adjust your style with me.
You and me.
We didn't say anything bad.
What's this?
Listen, things are going pretty well for you, you know.
We won't give up.
What, there's no need and I want to relax you.
What are you trying to say?
Instead of what its name means
It seems you want...
I want to know how you are, for real.
Faster, faster
Ha ha, this is beautiful.
Whatever he wants, it doesn't matter.
Frij abuh
We're here at Uncle Naif's place to discuss, not to argue.
Whoever is righteous acts in the neighborhood as they please.
You made me speak.
Alright, guys, be quiet so we can hear what Uncle Bonayf has to say.
Now this shit that's worth nothing is playing with your nerves.
Leave me alone.
If I give him a slap, I'll stick it to the umbrella he made.
The game is played by its players.
Attractive beauty
Goodbye, with love
You haven't seen anything yet.
You know he has a jewelry store.
She is wearing rings and chains.
God is with us
Just walk, then you'll be fit in the heat.
Rashid couldn't believe it when it happened, he was caught off guard and had nothing to prepare for it.
They were placed by the Deputy General Director of the Global Educational Center.
He'll tell you, "He'll teach you, you're a teacher and he's a teacher, but deep down, where did it happen and where did you end up?"
May I ask you?
May God be with you, Abdullah.
I'll teach you the secret.
The teacher has arrived.
Professor, I didn't do anything.
Do you know this boy, Professor?
My love, who is this boy?
IKA (I'm telling you), look, we don't get nice opportunities like this.
I'm looking for a job. God, this made me laugh.
Don't worry, the job is in the pocket.
Thank you, you didn't disappoint. Keep it up!
Greet him.
If my mother greets you after God, she sends her greetings to you, Inshallah, she will greet you too.
Oh, goodbye my love, may you be safe in God's care.
After your brother gets into politics and becomes a minister, believe me, dad.
Alright, mom, we'll work, we'll work on something heavy.
But my dad, if they don't say anything about your job.
That's all I can give you.
It's just something normal, right?
Our usual automatic response is not to speak.
My dear family, please make my dream come true.
Before you dreamt, I dreamt.
Build me a tower among the corniche's towers.
Come on, let's go!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Her height is 5'6"
I say your friend looks distressed.
It's not obvious, brother.
You're up to the task, O Bou Salih.
You believe he suddenly dropped his phone and gave it to Bouzid.
Look at these moves, and for sure Sultan carries a million percent on him.
His relationship with Bousalah was never good.
No sultan can do such a thing unless he has something in mind.
It's reasonable, after all.
The door of his car won't open.
In the end, the minister's car door stopped working.
Oh father, don't break my heart, don't break my heart.
The story I heard in the cafes is happening in the country.
But I can't believe what I'm hearing.
My heart is stopped, my heart is stopped.
I'm afraid of this matter, mother. I'm afraid it will fall into the eyes of women and there will be no more mercy for me, mother. You embarrassed me in front of women.
Say something, O Sultan, you speak, because I am shocked by the day.
If you please, I know what I'm doing.
No one has a monopoly.
I'm working on a quiet fire.
By opening the door to him, this is the beginning of the plan I have in mind.
I should be the minister, not him.
Let me work, I have a plan.
Let them take it.
What plan?
But he has to trust me from the beginning.
They told me his eyes are a minister because he was appointed a month before you.
Because I am sure of his coat and his pocket.
Magic can be undone.
What is this?
After the rain, the sky is clear.
And every activity that photographers are prohibited from doing, they will take a picture to burn his picture in the newspaper.
And its smell rises to the surface.
Sure, the translation of "اكيد عاد" into English is "Definitely back."
Be patient, let me work on it and I'll show you the results.
Long-lived on the contrary
Of course, Your Excellency the Minister.
Come back later and say
Thank him for the lamb, it's very good meat.
The real (money) is at the door, pick it up.
Don't become a people-pleaser; you need to stand up for yourself and not diminish your own worth.
Just keep going, minister.
Lalala, I don't see myself as a minister's servant, but rather a picture of a minister's servant.
Snap it in the second, give it.
And God, my brother, your plan really impressed me.
Where should I take you dad?
Picture picture picture
Any necessary minister
I'll just say this to you in a moment.
Go to the last but one page.
His bride is taller than him.
Say "There is no god but Allah."
Every day has a picture or two.
As you said, a social activist, goodbye for now.
They all love you, but you don't know what's wrong with you.
Touch everywhere in the walls
These two envious, jealous people only throw stones at the productive tree.
Go to the market.
I am not yet prepared.
Peace be upon you.
Hello peace to you, hello to you.
You are well-known.
Saadah Abdulhadi Abdullah Saadah
This is my husband.
I understand what my mom is saying.
Thirty-five
May this person be well
Until today at home, hopefully no harm.
By God, today I'm feeling really exhausted, my head is pounding, my body feels broken, and my colon is giving me trouble.
I'm tired, by God, I've been tired for a month and I'm still looking.
Let me relax today.
Oh, hello Am Sultan.
I say
Oh, just take me there.
I'll see you later.
Have you seen the purple flower that's blooming this month?
I know, thank God, that you have been convinced.
The translation of "تبين الصراحه" is: "It becomes clear."
Your minister seems to have taken a liking to this matter.
I am sending you a message, my brother Saad.
No, I truly didn't follow any activities today nor read the newspapers.
Goodbye, God willing.
God will remove the ant, even if it has wings.
Peace be upon you, brother. There's a conference at the hotel tonight.
Wedding
"Afah means everything means there's no such activity, like a birthday party, wedding."
I don't know exactly, but you might be able to see the hotel behind us.
Oh, we're at the hotel, wait for us.
You can stay in the car and I'll go to the hotel to ask.
Go, go, go, take your time, ask away.
May everyone succeed, Allah willing.
Let's let the minister rest and relax.
It means he found no party, no wedding, or any excuse to cut it short.
He had visited eighteen thousand hotels, but he found no luck; his face was his misfortune.
Just be quiet.
I didn't find any birthday for him.
The truth is that you can catch the second chance.
Every number has a hundred pictures.
If he doesn't sleep, he won't come, my brother.
Hey, this is a trick question. First, I need to take a picture of this guy, and then I'll put the crepe on it.
They are having a competition today over a picture of the minister.
One asks the other, "They've printed how many pictures of the minister in today's paper?"
And whoever wins, they'll give them a prize.
This is the story: every day, you come to the coffee shop and listen to the comments about my photos in the newspaper. They say I'll never stop.
God is near to His departure.
As they say, "The butterfly is fleeting, but if God intends it to disappear, it draws near to the light."
People are pointing at you and greeting you.
He became one of the country's most famous celebrities.
What's up with you and who is this?
You ruined my prestige.
May God protect you and her.
You say that we're all married except for the poor one among us who hasn't married.
This share
It's not meant for me to promote.
And I've already forgotten about the marriage story.
"My trust is in God against whoever was the cause."
Look at those hollow-eyed people over there.
What shall I cure them with?
The hollow ones who play with their hair.
These are my sons or my daughters.
After my father died, and I mean, I killed him.
Are both of his eyes open?
It's forbidden to leave it with the maid.
Come on, let's go.
I wanted to talk to my mother, but she's not just hiring one servant, she's hiring two.
We told your mother many times, this child is not yours, he is not your son.
You don't have another story, except for eternity and the servants, except for the servants and eternity.
Mom said it's not a good idea to keep a maid for 24 hours straight, she only wants her for a few hours.
Go outside, let me rest, I want to sleep. How can I?
My Saudi brother Khulud has become my son.
Look, if my dad finds out about you...
I guess you mean to translate the Arabic text "الا باقولج خلود اشفيه خلود" into English. The closest translation would be: "I mean, what's wrong with Khulud?"
Saud says that Khulud puts on makeup and acts like a six-year-old girl.
Oh oh oh, Saud, you really should...
He puts makeup on Khulud's face, but it's anti-makeup for kids. He saw the makeup box and played with it.
I saw the great opposition and it didn't even show.
Nice, warm, and gentle
I am Saud Bahaus.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
Why didn't you answer me when I asked you what would happen when I grew up? Now answer me, what would happen when I grew up?
And when my beloved Kholoud, you become an officer, what will you become?
We go to London every year.
AI translation: "أي كلمة المرتجفة في البحرين" English translation: "Any word trembling in Bahrain"
His saying, "Let him bring سوسan and his pride and his immortality."
Greet Sorah.
I ask forgiveness from Allah the Most Great.
Today, my father told me to choose.
I want to build you a house by the sea, or a house that we both can enjoy.
I told him I don't want to choose.
I love you, I want to live with you anywhere.
Thank you, my dear.
Teach me how to catch a fish.
Oh God, I wish I could close my eyes and open them again, and they say to me, "Hope, you've finished university."
It's a men's perfume.
I don't know, but the smell is really strange.
Make me feel better.
Your way of speaking has become feminine.
You forgot that you're real.
Inshallah after that I'll talk to people outside.
I can't believe it, Khalid.
Please leave my room.
"Ya kasra ya khalod" translates to "Either loss or eternity" in English.
You fell out of my sight.
Come on, don't hurt my feelings. I swear, I'm just telling the truth to my mom.
This is my son and I know him well.
So, O Khulood, my eye's delight, I wish all children were as bright and full of feelings as you.
And may I not see a delicate and quiet one, you call them my daughters.
Shame, shame, you're saying such things about your brother.
Just stop exaggerating, it's a small matter.
If it's worth it, add a little perfume; it has a sweet scent now. There's no difference between men's and women's perfumes.
I cannot translate this text directly from Arabic to English as it contains colloquial or regional language that might not have a direct equivalent. However, a possible translation could be: "I wish you wouldn't tell my father about this."
I have
Just keep quiet, so Mohammed doesn't feel anything.
Oh, where do these girls come from?
God forbid that you do this. This beautiful girl doesn't deserve this.
Don't look at him, don't look at him.
God, I'm afraid I might sense something personal.
Give yourselves a rest.
I know you're looking into the Bluetooth technology that's popular these days.
I'm waiting for Saad but let him come.
How are you, Saad?
May God keep you safe.
I say, you're waiting for me, but we haven't played our cards yet.
Why, indeed?
Do you drink something?
He's been lying here in your apartment for two days.
On the previous Bluetooth.
Any brother of the same kind is sworn to it.
I'm afraid of him.
Don't try to save him, don't try.
Take refuge in Allah, O mother, for my sake.
I have booked already.
I'm finally free from where they kept me with those people.
And say the truth to your father.
Tell him anything.
Oh, those kids, oh, them!
This translates to: "This is the end, mom."
Remember when Kholoud was younger.
This is definitely the result.
It's forbidden for you, but go out, anyway.
The truth always hurts.
The jar broke.
I cannot live in Doha.
Mali wye
I haven't been using my phone for a while.
Blame me, O hope.
And while you build him, be vigilant all day long.
I'm vertical, and it's real that all day I meet people outside.
Difficult or hope?
I can't live my whole life keeping my head down.
My father has a feeling that something is going on at home and there is a change.
And when will my father be absent from the events happening at home?
My father is right sometimes and wrong at other times.
I understand, Amal, when you remember his hardship and dedication to his work, so that we can live with dignity among people.
And I blame him.
When he left his responsibilities at home and his children to their mother.
We don't want to dig into the past anymore.
Did my father know or not?
But I intend to
Transfer it via Bluetooth.
But I won't give it to him.
I don't want to see my father's shock in my eyes.
It hurts a lot.
Whatever hope.

Better than known through others
Our house's loss has reached this level.
Because a dirty bomb named "Eternal" exploded in it.
Customs and traditions
Teach them with all the audacity.
Cover their ears from it
And they do not hear the greatest.
Just one voice only
It is the voice of filth and perversion.
Wadison is all good.
What crossed your mind?
Suddenly, I decided to travel for study.
All we can say is, God bless you, my child.
May God protect you.
He returned the gift that they had brought from their trip, not the one they were going to give.
Your statement is correct.
This is the rule.
But every rule has an exception.
I hope my people come with me quickly.
Here there is a dry place
I didn't hear a sound.

How are you, Saa'd?
Father, what's wrong?
Dad
Don't be angry.
You are a great woman.
What young man does not wish for his wife?
I never divorced you because of a flaw in you.
I divorced you.
Because it's impossible.
Accept that I am the father of my children.
A strange one like your brother.
The correct translation of "ها صلوح" from Arabic to English is "Is it valid?"

That one is under the ground.
By God, this is powerful speech. You are capable of such speech.
You're joking about having 500,000 dollars, God has plenty of money.
Machallah (or "Masha'allah") is an Arabic expression meaning "Praise be to God."
Come on, let's go!
You've been away for seven months, stop playing with henna, it's burning my heart. Come on, take me home.
Failure and disgrace
I'll tell you about this hurry.
He hasn't done anything for seven months.
Hear me, please.
Travel and free us from it.
Travel and bring someone else.
My understanding is that he doesn't know what this word means, he doesn't know the losses of money over time.
Train his driver for his trip and free us from it.
You are the first person who comes to my house in six months.
After this, Zain will say new and inspiring words that will make you think.
This is petrol at the lowest and highest price of 1000 rial per liter, half a rial per kilogram. It's very expensive, dad.
Alright, you've had your fun, listen to me, I'll tell you.
You are the first one I've seen come here to give me a car.
Seventy gives
You're very new, you've only been here for a sufficient six months, you haven't even seen eighties.
I need money.
This is an old driver, it speaks old language, you are new.
These are seventy-eight.
Roh
This says, "Just come over and I'll give you 100 riyals."
Three hundred thousand is no use.
I speak very well.

I'm telling you to travel.
But anyway, don't think I'll do that.
Take it wherever it is.
Traveling means traveling.
It's easier for me to pay for his ticket and travel than to have him stay in the country broke.
I wish I could just catch it.
There is no friend like a fellow traveler, especially when no one is buying tickets.
At the beginning of the match, you seem very nervous.
We're just afraid of what we're afraid of—that our team won't score any goals.
We need more than three, we need ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were terrified, afraid of the opposing team.
I'm not scared of the opposing team, I'm scared of our team. I'm afraid that we won't score more than three.
This is our team's level, I know it, I'm talking about our team's level.
A great trust in you.
The opposing team has nothing.
The foxes are cute. They've scored, now you've advanced to the first goal.
Where are you going?
Roh بيت
In his car.
Come, I'll take you with me, I'll get you there.
Oh, thank you comrade.
Our team tries hard but they can't beat us.
May I ask, the matches of the league are just beginning.
What he says is intriguing.
He tells you it's a big problem.
Come on, Mahmoud, let's go.
The hen is a companion, come see the beautiful clothes.
Go on, Uncle Saqid.
Please, sir.
What's he doing to himself?
Ah, the Indian valley
Yes, sir, that's a stupid mistake.
There's no saying this isn't true, it's just the way it is, it's not up to me, we're foxes.
Sway with the rhythm, rhythm.
Come on, you worshipper (of God), come on! Hurry up, hurry up, the match is about to start. Hurry up, get a bottle of water, the foxes (metaphor for opponents) are playing today.
Our esteemed viewers, we have with us one of the most famous supporters of the Fox Club, nicknamed "The Fox".
They just say you won because they're missing some key points.
This is in the words, in the words, there's nothing beautiful.
What's missing from this team? Every team has its weaknesses, and this team has a dozen flaws.
A missing two makes no gain, it's the same as nothing.
This is a devil fox.
This is our best fan.
Well, on this occasion of the half-win, Mr. Fox, I would like to address my final words to the foxes.
Everything we say is standing still.
When we disperse in the saying of 'Th'aalab' (a term used to refer to cunning or sly people)
This is flying high in the sky.
This is the fair supporter.
See, brother.
He received it with great enthusiasm.
Please, my dear.
Where is the Indian boy who kicks the ball?
I haven't seen you in a while.
Oh, this one, it's a big problem, it doesn't belong here.
I haven't seen you in a few days, I didn't recognize you. You were sitting at a café in Flagio, it's called Starbucks.
I remember that kindness used to stay with us in the Lord. He wasn't with us for even a cup of tea.
This translates to: "If I were to give the boy twenty riyals as a tip."
Why would he do that?
Oh, he's talking to the big officials of the club, they'll sort it out, so they won't deal with him.
I say hyena
The name of my mother.
My mother says, "Do as you go, do as you come."
You have no idea, you're encouraging a pathetic and tired club like this one.
This is my team, the Mali heart foxes.
When my heart stops beating.
Goodness abounds within
You've lived long, have you not heard the poem written by the judge?
The day of our match with them.
Please, please, oh cunning fox, say it's a poem, say it, say it.
Mother, I have no other than Allah in this hidden world, where I am.
This is my own fault, I am in a lot.
I don't sleep at all at night.
You know that we're fans of the Fox Club.
It means, "I can't tell you the winner's name so I can break the news as a journalist."
We have a press conference and hopefully we will announce the winner's name there.
Say what beauty is.
And the famous "Fox" supporter, who was honored today by the administration of the Fox Club in a generous gesture and a very beautiful initiative.
God
Congratulations a thousand times, Hyena, on this beautiful honor and the wonderful gift.
Sano says, "Is this in your pen or in your head?"
And Allah knows best.
This is in a twist.
I tell you, it is he.
We need to inform the police.
Stay where you are, be quiet.
All this for just a few fans' money.
La la la, your dad is just like that.
I tell you, it is he.
You're late.
I don't know when the matches are, brother.
Now, how do I catch him?
There's only for us to wait for the Fox Team to play the next match.
Akko akko jafteh
Attach it to him.
Bro, you're late.
Akko akko akko akko
He pushed him hard, pushed him right back.
The thing is, we're not sure right now, is it or isn't it.
I tell you, it is him, Yabe.
I say, the opinion and wisdom is that we go to the two of them and ask them, "Tell us, where did this driver come from? How did he get to you? When did he come to you?"
Ah, you have to make one trip into two.
I'll go tell him, I'm sure he'll understand.
And may God protect you, may God bless you, my dear.
Registered under my name.
The wind blew this in the second earth next to it.
The words of your father, he says, "Islam has come to you, the son of Abdulrahman al-Saggi. What safety, what safety, what safety?"
La la Allah isalmek, the apparent is that we are mistaken, ya bok, we are here for a friend, and we resemble you.
God, blessed be He, creates and guides people towards what is right, as He is the Creator of forty people.
Thank you, you're welcome, long life, thank you.
La la Allah islamak, masamaha, masamaha, shukran, shukran.
By God, we are grateful for your kindness, we do not deserve your generosity, by God, may peace be upon you, may God bless you.
And tell me after you're sure.
What's happening to us now, God save us.
What did you do, Walid?
And as I walk, I carry the bag on my shoulder.
God, tear down this wall.
Go and get into your room.
God forbid.
God forbid.
Come back, now understand your father's words.
Before my father realizes
Broken into a million pieces
Alright, mom, let's go buy one just like it right now.
Before my father comes.
And whoever surrenders, O mother.
Do you know your father? When he gets angry, he becomes like a monster.
Go to your room and don't come out.
We did nothing.
By mistake, he knocked over the vase; its precious contents fell and broke.
Mom, I'm afraid of him.
I don't know where he went.
La la la, he's not in his right mind.
It's forbidden for you to do this to the child, oh mother.
The Berber's heart is torn between two loves.
I say, "Mommy"
You've lost the boy, what happened?
Okay, I'll give you a call.
God forbid.
Auntie, I know where Walid went.
Come here, I want to ask you where you've been.
Hurry up!
Where are you from?
And whoever leaves me won't go home.
Be careful with you.
I haven't seen the vase.
God, I don't know.
May God guide your father (and) heal you.
Come, Mom.
I'm not afraid as long as I'm at home, dad.
I have the solution.
We didn't say anything, Abu Walid.
Your son's request is granted, Abu Walid.
Just for you, I'll forgive him this time.
I don't see it at home.
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where is he? Where?
Don't worry, son (Walid), your father won't do anything to you.
Sure, the translation of ‏اكيد يبه into English is "Of course, dad."
"ای يا یبه ای" translates to "Oh, oh father" in English.
You leave it here, I'm afraid someone will pick it up and break it.
He told me, "I want it just like the one that broke, my son gave it to me."
Exactly, I just came back and all I found was this last one in the store, he's so lucky! Oh no, where are the kids?
In the room, they study.
God keep you safe.
But these values and principles are what I stand for.
Oh, wow!
Alright, let's go study!
Alright, let's just end this game and leave.
Don't say the truth about my uncle, whoever gives you peace.
Don't say that about your brother, it's the last time, God.
You're reaching out to him.
And you, in particular, mistook my friend at the coffee shop, it's me.
Go ahead if you know what's good for you.
I'm done, this phone is always in my pocket as long as it's in memory.
Mama, why don't you take him to the doctor?
God guide you, mother.
The Berber's heart is heavy and his fear is great because of what he endures.
Poor boy.
Be you (feminine)
Where is my beloved mother? I didn't see her with you today.
Wooda with her
My sister, this dress doesn't satisfy me.
And oh, mother, what did you say about the story of Anireh with her son Nayef?
Her child is as young as God's child, may He protect him.
The same length
Yesterday, she told me she didn't know what to do with her son.
I want to take her to the hospital, but her husband, Yusuf, refuses.
I didn't talk about the matter yesterday.
And then she screamed at her.
He says how didn't you tell me?
This one is a psychological case.
Despite himself, the boy accepted.
He takes his son and ties him up in the courtyard.
He then tells him to do it again and wet the bed.
You're agreeing to a ruin.
Shagltay, Yam Amnireh.
I tell her to eat, eat.
Eat and be blessed.
It's all just luck.
Mama, mama
Your father doesn't even know you exist.
Or else I'll kill you with this weather.
Come on, take a shower and wash up before your dad does something bad to you.
I have nothing to do with it.
Poor things
They're yelling to resist.
I'm afraid something might happen to my children.
I need to take them to their uncle to teach them manners.
I am nervous.
They have successfully brought down their importance.
Why take them to their uncle's?
We captured 48 out of 50.
Why don't they vote fifty out of fifty?
Their uncle warns them.
And honestly, I agree with his perspective.
Let go of your emotions.
It is necessary to teach my brother Adab.
Alright, bye bye.
Last time, last time
Fifty out of fifty
Waste our time, I insist to them that these are our children.
Why don't you get fifty out of fifty?
Jab jab jab, I'm warning you, but you don't listen to the words.
You don't listen to the words.
Jalil al-Hayya
Give him alone, let me behave well.
"Oh, okay, dad."
So that you don't make the same mistake again, you will return.
Just go already.
Do you know what to do?
We're stacking them high, one after the other, making falafel.
Be careful, you might go to those public places with your family.
Convey the ambiguities
Professor Walid, where are you?
What's wrong, why are you screaming?
This is an excellent degree.
Strange that you're shouting.
You should be happy.
You Japanese, all people take buses. I waited, hoping someone would stop to take you.
"عند باب المدرسة" means "at the school gate." "معناها ينطر الباص" means "it means waiting for the bus." "الباص وصل" means "the bus has arrived." "ونزل اليهال" means "and the children got off." "ومو وياهم" means "and they're not with them."
Did you hear about that boy who committed suicide today?
Hello, may God bless you, they have given him the testimony.
His father threatened him if he does not achieve the full mark.
Walid, Walid, come back, Walid, come back.
I greet you live on air and welcome you to a new episode of the No Boundaries show.
Oil accounts for more than thirty-five percent of the total diverse energy sources.
While the rest goes to natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.
And therefore, oil is considered the primary source of energy in the world.
And the Gulf States and Iran alone have 586 billion barrels.
Following Iran with a 12% share, Iraq with 10%, Kuwait and the UAE with 9% each.
Each one contributes, with Venezuela accounting for seven percent.
Then Russia accounts for five percent.
The Gulf countries and Iran account for two-thirds of the world's reserves.
To unprecedented prices, surpassing $100 for the first time in its history.
And in this episode, we try to understand many of the complexities of oil.
And the problems faced by the exporting countries.
Despite the enormous rise in its prices
Similarly, the problems faced by citizens and residents in these countries.
Due to unprecedented inflation and rise
which will appear successively on the screen or write to us through our website on the internet www.aljazeera.net
Because today, the market is the main factor.
and not the producing states
The factor that determines the price is market power.
It is not OPEC.
Of course, the offer and the request have their part, naturally.
But other factors
Other factors are the political tensions.
In the world
And real estate markets.
And the markets of the LLBP and others.
And they turned to the prices of the speculative commodities.
In commodities, for example oil.
And tomorrow a thousand dollars will arrive, God knows.
Oil in 2024 jumped from $44.
And today we see that even the prices of petroleum
It fluctuates from one day to the next.
Oil prices fell below $90.
And increased in the second quarter.
Especially with the arrival of spring, two major entries (or entrances) coincide with the maintenance period of most refineries worldwide.
What is always relative to the girl in the second quarter
Seasonal demand for oil declines
In the winter, it drops below ninety.
And all of this indicates that the struggles have power and control over the market now.
"رت كثيرا يعني" translates to "It means a lot" in English. The complete sentence would be: "It means a lot that we return to the traditional market in the past."
The market was influenced by supply and demand.
The translation of "ال ال ال العرظ ال الطلب الموسمي" into English is: "The seasonal demand surge"
Today, we see that economic growth is...
Today or yesterday, General Valon, the commander of the Central Region in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
His resignation sparked massive reactions due to its connection to the so-called upcoming American war.
Political or geopolitical implications
They impact the oil market in a way that is either negative or positive, very quickly.
The impact may certainly come, and it will have its effects.
Even among those who are not fighters, they still engage in political struggles.
Those who confirm might tell you that some say the American war against Iran is coming.
Here, what will the market anticipate? The market anticipates its way.
Question: In the shadow of His Excellency's efforts, the deputy is now arguing that the White House
And this restored a tense atmosphere.
This is the porcupine.
But perhaps Falun saw this scenario.
A very rapid reflection is seen on the oil market.
Today, we prove by numbers that there is no shortage.
Let me give you an example over the past seven weeks.
In the United States, its oil inventory has increased to its highest level in more than five years.
It means today, not me, I mean to say.
Not even for the upcoming war, because today I tell you that even the world has a stockpile that has run out.
Even global consumption today shows long lines or queues in front of gas stations in many countries around the world.
This is something else.
What is the danger this represents to?
What number do you expect, I don't know, it might be...
It could be 300 dollars, it might be less.
It might escalate if these tensions reach a point of no return.
As I said, the Gulf region accounts for sixty percent.
In his country, it means far away, even from oil-producing countries.
See the inverse effect on the oil market.
And it can reach up to three hundred dollars.
And they shifted and moved from stocks and others to the oil market today, look above the two or trillion dollars.
Today we are going to see Brent.
"He trades in it (the market) with a barrel of oil per day, meaning..."
These tensions in the region and the anticipation
April, as it has been said, is supposed to be the month for launching this war.
And Allah knows best, I didn't mean my generation.
For in the logic lies the root of all things now.
The year is an election year.
The current American administration is only a few months old.
George H. W. Bush launched a war in Somalia and sent thirty thousand troops in his final days in the White House.
We see and do not anticipate events.
But I don't expect this scenario to be
Because this script is very expensive.
You won't be paying anything; you, the Iranians, and the consuming nations will bear the cost.
America today
Now it relies on African oil and has many alternatives.
Look, let's be clear, let's talk openly.
In your essay in the introduction, you stated that sixty percent
Oil reserves
But now they import twenty-two.
From their oil in the west of the west of Africa
I am from West Africa and no matter what they import from any region in the world.
Petroleum production
Because this is a difficult number with established precautions and precautions.
Deep-sea or offshore or deep-water marine production
The navy and therefore the gulf will remain a tough number
And the Caspian Sea oil
I consider them as dreams because they are not the reality and the truth.
They will destroy it and devastate it.
The important thing is that it means there.
Today, Qatar is the world's largest energy exporter.
The reason for that is this, these countries are a tough number.
There are energy needs in states.
It certainly emphasizes that there is something called secure supply security.
And despite internal objections within the United States, even at the level of General Fallon.
But there are still concerns.
It is not up to President Bush to...
Did you notice that the political risks did not come from the Gulf countries?
It means "No, no, no, it's not about generosity because there's no one who deals with generosity among us."
Not in dealing with generosity at all
But it's not in my article.
We are not part of the charitable work.
Please, may I?
Just be kind to Westerners, not anyone else.
With America, specifically.
Where is the market?
Where will the economic return go that we will be going for?
We will not
Like oil and gas
Put them for generosity and
I have the proof.
I have the proof.
It doesn't exceed sixty to seventy dollars.
It is not the price increase.
It is not the decline in the dollar that you insist on, but...
You are primarily as Gulfis and Opec members.
Provided that the export is in dollars and you reject it.
Changing the currency despite its subsequent collapse.
Even though the return is not in your favor.
No, I am not seventy years old.
But the experts' words are not my words.
Okay, the dollar has fallen by 35% and oil has risen above this decline.
If we take the measurement year as 2004.
We see that oil prices are fluctuating between $35 and $63.
It means of course, it means
The price of oil increased.
But the increase is slight, the deputy said.
It means if we take them.
We consider it now, means.
Even at these prices
It means "if we take it in comparison to 204"
It has even exceeded the 1% drop in the dollar's value.
The intriguing one
Interact with the dollar's decline.
As the dollar drops, oil prices rise.
And this is also something the market began to give him a sense of.
The current benefits are preservation.
Now the situation has changed, perhaps at the beginning of the decline two years ago, this was said, but the situation has now changed and there is...
And it seemed the dollar was losing value against major currencies such as the euro, yen, and sterling.
Now, the question is, why do you insist on linking your work to the dollar?
His work is weak and has no backing.
This is this is a historic period.
Petroleum and its derivatives in dollars, and even European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
It states that America was in the mid-1970s.
I removed the gold cover that was on the American coin.
This isn't that, this isn't correct.
The correct translation of "طب اولي ايه الصحيح" is "What is the primary medicine?"
OPEC organizes.
Four Gulf countries
Qatar, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia
Today, OPEC has a significant share in the global market.
Forty percent
Today, if we assume the world consumes eighty-five million barrels.
It's fragile to price its oil in dollars.
If you value his work, everyone will follow.
You cannot
All oil-producing countries must agree.
We are the adults.
Those with 66% of the global reserve are all the big ones.
"Ti'at but I took as export."
They include Venezuela, Libya, and Iran.
Cameroon, Angola, and Guinea are countries organized under the OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries).
Do not exceed today's market share of forty percent.
Produced and exported from non-OPEC countries.
And this cannot be owned by the forty percent.
You cannot do it by yourself unless...
In countries that have tried but...
Attempt is not a real truth.
You are rejecting because of the ties with America.
From one job to another.
All oil-exporting countries
How much oil does one barrel contain?
They are the loss for what he is issuing.
His currency has risen significantly.
He sells his oil in dollars.
Now, the recipient's or the receiver's part is to receive the money in dollars and then convert or transfer it to their local currency.
His currency is not related to the dollar.
Correct, but only.
But your problem is also that you sell in dollars, and your job is not linked to the dollar. You have no problem.
I'd like to ask my important question now.
What is anxiety and the impact it creates when your work is linked to the dollar during its decline?
He has been associated for many years.
Especially in the 1970s when the dollar was a very strong currency and its value was extremely high.
This disengagement is not easily done.
The paint is easy.
No, here no.
Divorce has costs.
It serves the interests of these states, not against them.
From profit and loss
Dungeons announced in its newsletter yesterday that there are four countries, one of which is Qatar.
But there is also a report from the Just Finance House stating that there are four Gulf countries, as Oman naturally left the Gulf Arab currency union.
I read the statement about the dungeon and don't think it's a genuine statement.
The Qatar Central Bank governor has denied the reports.
He said yes and said he would study, but also that all Gulf countries should.
You need to study profit and loss in a thorough manner, as I mentioned, without emotions.
Let's leave it at that, let's leave the matter to study and see until they come.
I'll get you some economists who will tell you in another study.
This study reflects
The Local House is a simple and neat place, and they issued a report on March 8th, meaning...
Only four days
The global solution is simple and requires political will.
The political decision boils down to two rights.
There is no third, the first need.
Regarding her intention or the five-year plan, along with Kuwait, her intention for 2020 is to issue the currency or study the issuance of the unified Gulf currency.
The second point is to issue a decision to decouple from the dollar.
First, regarding the single currency.
In my personal opinion.
To see the Gulf unified currency
The work, the work when this work will be strong.
Will be
Maybe it's one of the strongest currencies in the world, as you say.
And the precautions that follow, and the revenues that come after them, are immense.
That's why this is what His Excellency the Prime Minister focused on when he said...
Here is the translation: "These are the Gulf countries because no single country can stand alone."
With a stronger economic guarantee.
And today's economic bloc, even the euro today, we see it.
But you mustn't forget that the central bank has a very significant role.
In the evaluation
And and and the calculation of profit and loss.
From all these news
Tensioned
As observers say, 1982 Global House said that inflation will continue.
For a long time in the Gulf countries, but the solution is in the hands of governments.
Some countries have increased salaries by seventy percent, such as the United Arab Emirates.
To stop the inflation process which
And my question now is when will you increase the salaries of the poor people in Qatar?
Hear from you the answer after a short break.
Today's topic is oil reserves and daily production of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, specifically the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
She has a reserve of 46 billion.
Two out of ten barrels
And you should pray nine and two from ten daily.
One million and one hundred fifty million, and one billion and seventy-two million and seven out of ten million.
Qatar: QAR 12.20 billion and 50,000 Omani rials, 6.5 million of which is 7.2 billion.
Bahrain has a population of twenty-five million five hundred thousand, with thirty-five thousand people living in transit.
And the total revenue was thirty-eight billion last year.
From 137 to 107
In Europe, one hundred billion
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion
In Asia and other countries
However, the Gross Domestic Product of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries was 2,677 billion in 2017.
The total output in 2079 is expected to be 7.97 billion ten.
In 2019, the tenth of ten billion
However, the inflation is devouring the salaries of employees and workers who live in this region.
It will increase from 2813 to 2818.
Kuwait is 14% of the UAE's population in 2029, which is 8.98 million.
It will become ten, but Saudi Arabia was six and a half, it will reach six.
Eight out of ten
Wages are devoured.
So what are the amounts and percentages by which you will increase the salary of the poor employees here?
If we want to solve the problem.
Real treatment
Salaries are always increases.
It is not the solution.
I am not against higher salaries.
It is true that this is not correct.
We are always
In faith, of course.
The case of excessive increase and lack of control over inflation will be inflation that eats up all these increases.
To address inflation, a supreme committee comprising all experts and specialists is weak.
And now this committee is putting... (The sentence seems to be incomplete in the original language.)
Because of the global increase in salaries
And the golden economic rule says, of course.
It will have no end.
And whatever
Wages have risen and will continue to increase.
Inflation will increase.
It must be processed and must
Here, a scientific study was conducted by the specialized recruitment institution, Home.com, in collaboration with the UK's Office for National Statistics.
They conducted a survey on fifteen thousand employees working in the Gulf countries across twenty important sectors.
Especially for experts and those in specialized jobs, there is no job satisfaction.
The inflation rate is devouring
Especially those with experience
They are considering moving from these countries where inflation is eating away at their money.
You are now going to lose.
This is the easy idea, meaning this is where you put the easy idea and try to apply it.
The inflationary effect is an increase in wages.
Parallelism in the subject exists.
"موجود و" translates to "and exists" in English.
We are keen, and the state and government are very keen.
He should address this issue with a genuine solution.
Temporary solutions never solve the problem, they only make it worse.
It means "add more" in English.
We hope that there will be more time for this committee to put things in order.
All applications
Here you are, and this is your deputy's pursuit.
Boredom will always be.
Just now, the state also tried and raised the fourty percent increases.
There is a very important point here regarding the increases.
You only increase salaries for Qataris, while non-Qataris used to work for Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
You care about the Qataris, but not about the expatriates.
And it's the high ratio in it.
Ahmed, you're living in Qatar, not Germany.
You speak about this topic and suffer.
Salaries are much higher in the public sector.
And conversely, we saw.
In governmental coverage
On the contrary, the government sector has become...
The best elements and competencies have become
I have also read a report, as you know, on the oil sector.
For work
When we become experts in something, we...
Engineers and workers who come from outside Qatar
And because we also interact with the global market.
For all these things, there is a percentage increase in salaries.
And hope is with Allah, the Most High, but we say...
There is a plan with the government.
I say controlling inflation is more important.
Temporal processing
I will see, I am sure.
I see that there will be
Positive results
It will be around fifteen percent.
The sweet says there are 25 billion barrels of oil and 34 billion cubic meters of gas.
No comment. We are the client, not a client of Rash.
The operation and of course we
The prophecy about economic growth should also reflect on people.
And of course, any economic growth today, Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world.
And the opposite.
The huge belts in the country are also a part.
But for these massive dams and huge projects
In the country, there was also no part of the inflation.
It also contributed to inflation.
And this also led to an increase in liquidity in the market.
First, regarding the link between the dollar and oil.
I pawned oil for protection from
In the United States of America, this stability in governance means
Thank you.
Saad Al-Ghamdi from Saudi Arabia, your question is...
Peace be upon you and the mercy and blessings of God.
The truth of the ring means success and a good title.
What I'd like to touch on is that the region is now under the shadow of America's current policy.
America's policy in its current war, in addition to its cultural aggression against Islam, is an economic world war.
In today's China
And the American deficit with Japan also reached 61 billion dollars.
Japan had also invested in the year 2000.
With America, it's equivalent to nine.
One billion dollars while it is now investing with the European Union more than twenty-seven billion dollars.
In the context of American political dynamics and its policy of making the dollar the de facto global currency.
My brother, I say that buying now is a good idea.
And the Gulf region will become...
KKK means "Ku Klux Klan" in English.
Thank you, brother Saad.
Mohamed Al-Wasef from Egypt
Hello, I appreciate your deputy's effort with you.
The deputy's efforts remind me of Arab rulers in the Middle East region.
When there is
When there are protests or demands for price adjustments
Adjusting salaries Adjusting salaries in proportion to prices as you have kindly suggested.
"Biyaakhad" means "it takes" in Arabic, but the rest of the sentence is not clear or grammatically correct. A possible translation based on context could be: "It takes, in Qatar, we consider you as the norm." However, for a more accurate translation, please provide the complete and correctly structured sentence.
And he is determined not to announce this increase; that is an Arab style.
We consider Qatar to be the father of innovation.
He says what he wants, he has the right to do so. Of course, he is responsible for this policy.
The question first.
The deputy has to take into account his black skin.
One two swap with public opinion
With the poor, as you will see, they are the people who deserve care and attention.
The Arab rulers who don't care about the poor.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you.
I would like to invite two of you to my wedding.
I want a raise too.
The salaries are excellent and very good.
May God bless you. As for the subject, it is something that we need to work on.
With the poor and always, God willing, there will be no poverty in Qatar, and we are certain.
And the judge ruled that Qatar, as he said, the funds go to the ruling family and the ruler.
This is the important question now.
Let's go back to the brothers.
He cannot judge.
What's happening to this wealth?
Now there are entirely new cities, almost like pearls, such as Lusail and others, meaning even Qatar has started to expand.
The issue is the issue.
Proportioned urban planning
In short, there are only two minutes left, the first one being the one you'll focus on.
Qatar is now there, a post-oil and gas country.
There is, of course, a clear policy for the state.
Because it is not
Perpetual wealth
Because wealth is a constant observer.
And so, the trend for the day in the state of Qatar is...
The capital of education in the Middle East
Today, we see that we are a cultural city, an educational city.
Today, this educational city hosts some of the best universities in the world.
Creating medical cities, promotional cities, and financial cities.
Because today oil and gas are not just...
Of course, we don't imitate anyone.
Other satellite channels and
It's not just about creating a hundred islands; we can't afford to sustain them.
Because, brother, these countries, these are our countries in the Gulf now.
In the 1970s' boom, everyone now remembers the 1970s' boom.
Today, when we look at the growth in Qatar,
And this also calls for a special issue on Qatar post-oil.
Our vision for oil, its future, and its wealth in the region, especially in Qatar, in conclusion, I convey to you the greetings of the program team.
And Ahmed Mansour greets you without limits, and peace be upon you and the mercy of God and His blessings.
Peace be upon you and the mercy and blessings of God.
I greet you live on air this week from the Qatari capital, Doha.
Welcome to a new episode of the Limitless program.
At the same time, Qatar hosts the largest U.S. military base outside the United States, which is the Al Udeid Air Base.
With enemies of the United States in the region
Like Iran and Syria.
Its doors are open to leadership.
In fact, Hamas leaders enjoy distinguished relations with the Qatari leadership.
As the Emir of Qatar was the only Arab leader
Those who visited the southern suburb of Beirut, destroyed by Israel during its war on Lebanon in the summer of 2006.
And there is still unlimited support for the reconstruction of what Israel destroyed in Lebanon.
And at the time Qatar reconciled, and at the time Qatar reconciled.
With her older sister, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, about two years ago.
At the same time, skirmishes with the regime in Egypt.
Like the Lebanon file where we succeeded where others failed.
I gathered Lebanese leaders in Doha where they signed an agreement that led them to safety.
To the latest elections
As well as his files are stubborn.
Which was concerned with being the driving force behind these files, not the diameter.
The smallest Arab countries
And in his circle today
We are trying to understand the foundations and rules from which Qatar's foreign policy stems.
For whom?
The small geographically and demographically Qatar plays these big roles.
And what are the qualifications that enable her?
That was in a live dialogue with the Prime Minister and the Qatari Foreign Minister.
And for our viewers who wish to participate, they can call the program's phone numbers, which will appear on the screen one by one.
The visit by the Emir of Qatar.
The roar of Al Jazeera's cannons is a desire to improve relations with Saudi Arabia.
I am from a past attempt at a Saudi coup against the Emir of Qatar in collaboration with members of the Al-Marra tribe.
In its issue published on June 20th last
What is the nature of the secret deal?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Many of the things that most people
I don't think it's accurate.
The precise translation would be: "The fact is that I, in more than one interview in this program, have always said..."
And if we consider it the backbone
The Gulf Cooperation Council
There was a misunderstanding.
Then,
And differing points of view
We've solved the border issue correctly and this was a major obstacle.
The historical relations between Saudi Arabia and Qatar are distinctive.
These relationships, if we pay attention to them.
M between the two families and between the two countries
They are similar to each other in many misunderstandings.
Neither by us nor by them.
Because there are no conditions between the brothers.
And now, the relations are in a position where I can assure you that they are excellent indeed.
For the benefit of the Gulf Cooperation Council
But how was the situation with Al Jazeera and Saudi Arabia resolved? It was the obstacle or the reason that led to the year 2011.
At a significant point
And I repeat to you, if you go back to all the programs, I would always say.
Not only my older sister, but I would say that we rely on the Cooperation Council for...
Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
And our relations with them give them importance.
There was a media battle, and this was obvious to both sides.
These countries found themselves
It fails when the brothers agree.
The Qatari-Saudi private house
Rather, they found that most of them had fallen into a dispute.
They have neither share nor part in it.
And I don't think it's a strategy from any side that entered into this dispute.
But, elder, allow me, allow me here in this framework so that matters or points are above letters.
Many observers see that Al Jazeera has been influential in the past two years.
In the time when the situations that were criticized on Al Jazeera's screen are still ongoing.
Before the situations inside Saudi Arabia
Whether it's detained people, opponents, or others, the situation still stands.
The island nation has stopped dealing with these matters.
Until Al Jazeera's coverage of Hajj changes.
A tribute to the system and what the King of the Two Holy Mosques is doing at a time when it contradicts...
You should first check with the Island Administration about this issue, not ask me since I...
The gathering of the two countries.
Regional stability
This strategy continued and strengthened, first and foremost, the stability of the region.
The region refers to the Gulf region.
Gulf Region
There are many cases that are acute in the Gulf region.
Also, a call from the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Kuwait.
It resonated with all the listeners and with the entire Arab world.
He spoke from his heart about resolving and overcoming Arab disputes and burying them.
It doesn't just mean perspectives.
No, policies are not opinions. Policies are guidelines or rules established by an authority to govern a particular field or aspect of society. Opinions, on the other hand, are individual perspectives, beliefs, or judgments formed through personal experiences, knowledge, or beliefs.
In the Arab world, it is believed that this...
A kind of war
While in the advanced world
You're talking about the same interest.
Now you have been several years.
The current situation, the current situation.
See first.
There is a complete difference between this topic and that topic.
The idea that a small country can punch above its weight and make the big powers feel weak in comparison.
Every disagreement or every misunderstanding
He had his reasons.
And his reasons ended.
It ended with the judgment of the leaders.
Are there guarantees for future relations?
There are guarantees for the relationship between the parties.
Based on love, brotherhood, and the common interests that unite the two countries.
And the leaders' words are considered more than a document.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
And we hope that this Qatari-Saudi relationship will continue to develop.
For the best, and there will be large areas.
For this relationship, just as we have Model B with other Arab countries, other Gulf countries.
Regarding Qatar, it is a significant state.
Saudi Arabia is an important country.
Regarding Egypt's position compared to Qatar, it's something like this: even though you reconciled with Saudi Arabia at the same time, it was noticed.
And three organizations are Hezbollah
It is Al Jazeera channel.
Egypt is the most populous Arab country and is orderly.
First, let me start with the following introduction.
The Egyptian people
We respect Egypt's motherland.
And her interest.
Many Arab remnants and Egyptian people's sacrifices
And this is a matter
Some believe that this is an opportunity we want to use to enter into dialogue, or lack thereof, with our brothers in Egypt.
And in light of this, you say that you respect Egypt and the Egyptian people... right?
And we believe that God is a good person.
Our disagreement with Egypt is on two points.
He is a point.
We've prepared for the coup in Gaza, and I don't think so.
And we don't enter.
In issues concerning other countries.
Do not believe in interfering in the affairs of any nation unless there is room for reform.
It means that any intervention you have in the coup that Hamas carried out against the authority in Gaza is complete.
Of course, it's not like we actually knew about this; we only found out just like everyone else from the media.
Yes, we have relations with Hamas and we have relations with all parties.
What made Egypt different or caused a dispute between you and them on this point?
This is a place for me.
Hezbollah conspiracy
Hezbollah's conspiracy too
But I'm talking about my country.
We were greatly surprised by this topic.
If it shakes for Qatar's benefit
What are the pyramids?
The pyramids said, "Reach."
To harm Egypt and its standing.
Can I respond?
Clarified: We go back to the conspiracy they talked about.
Days will reveal this matter.
I am not starting from the Gaza conference.
And I absolve the Egyptian people and President Hosni Mubarak.
If we go back far enough, to the Mina Conference
After the Madrid Conference, Mina remembers the meeting held in Doha.
And this was agreed upon as the conference was about to take place here.
They said we don't want to postpone the conference.
Guys, we know you have coordination with Israel.
I am from Qatar and this is...
What we want to understand is what.
We sat down and kept talking, and the conversation was always pleasant.
It has two sides.
What are they?
In opposition
In political orientation
If we come to the Gaza conference about what happened.
His Highness the Prince spoke to all the presidents, including his brother, H.E. President Hosni Mubarak.
And we were informed from a foreign country.
The brothers in Egypt have a point of view on this issue, they believe that what is being held back is...
They kill people while we watch.
If you don't want to meet in Doha, we can hold it at any location within the Arab University.
And it is shameful that on the margins of the Kuwait conference, they discuss the issue.
By Israel and the Western world, standing by and watching the issue.
When we arrived, we said, "Okay, this is happening, there's no turning back, we Arabs can't stop it, neither can any major country."
Egypt's announcement of a request for a cessation of hostilities in Gaza, followed by an extension of the ceasefire.
Even us
We should not take the Arab street for granted. Our dispute with the Brotherhood is over just one point.
And this is in international norms.
Our hospitals are not enough for doctors who stand at the borders.
You stood at the border.
There used to be, but no one dared to enter.
The brothers are very sensitive about this issue.
The reason for the sensitivity is that Gaza is adjacent to Egypt and is considered part of national property.
When we talk about any human issue anywhere in the world, we are talking about a human issue.
And we respect Egypt's sovereignty.
And we know a position, but this does not harm the Egyptian position.
We hope a lot in Egypt.
It is the largest Arab country.
And we believe it can carry our voice and the voices of others in the Arab world.
To all other parties
It means even the rescue operation after the jump.
The Europeans tried to save it.
What happened in Gaza at the conference
Whether it's a donor conference, I consider it a government rescue.
We were not invited to the conference; we were invited to coordinate among the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
We met in the Council of Cooperation.
These funds will not be disbursed to any party.
Rather, you will spend.
For the affected parties in Gaza
Directly, and this was
"لان ممنوع الدخول ومن كل جهه" translates to "Because entry is prohibited from all sides."
I am happy for Egypt, and every people in every country is happy for Egypt because Egypt...
Egypt's victory in political affairs is important to us.
But you're anticipating
Just give me, just give me two minutes.
One of the ministers boasted about what had been saved and said:
He who challenges Egypt will have his leg cut off and his arm broken.
By God, I believe this official has disgraced his country.
No, they didn't fail, and they can only speak about themselves if we come to the truth.
Those who helped in this and that, I mentioned it for our brothers in Saudi Arabia. Saudis intervened because the king has authority over this issue.
I manage affairs in the Arab world.
We agree.
The king decides that this is in the best interest.
We accept the decision of King Abdullah because we respect and trust him.
But if someone prevents them, even by insulting the one who prevents them.
They looked like students in a school.
That means I believe this.
The limit and its origin
It is believed that God should impose his power.
We are sorry, we are sorry about this issue.
If they believe that a smaller nation has no right to have its sovereignty withdrawn.
You are interfering in Darfur.
Arab decision at the Arab University
African and a resolution by the United Nations
I believe the main problem.
The Hezbollah conspiracy is cleaner with Qatar's involvement.
The conspiracy is not known what Qatar.
It means that if someone travels, even after recovering from swine flu, if they start in a certain place, it could be the source of spreading the pandemic.
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and knows its capabilities.
But Qatar has its own perspective.
Qatar has a separate policy.
If Qatar is able to solve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor for us.
Because of any Arab dispute
Any Arab dispute, we believe, weakens our position in front of our main causes, namely Palestine and the other issues we face.
The Arab world has become a receiver.
Even our analyses have become the same as theirs.
Western analyses
While we know Shana, we know what happened in Pakistan.
To be sure, with God, I want someone to receive me, to spread a red carpet for me in Washington.
Can Qatar be blamed?
Did Qatar commit an injustice against any Arab country?
She tried to contribute financially.
These contributions are provocative.
What's possible is that I say "Peace be upon you" and you reply by saying "I'll greet you back" just to annoy me.
This is a second chance, meaning you have a problem or a shortcoming.
This is an issue that concerns you, not me.
But if you have an internal problem.
I always tell him.
And especially after the speech of His Majesty King Abdullah, the Servant of the Two Holy Mosques.
In Kuwait, and I know this man, he is indeed truthful.
What a man says is what he means.
In his heart, "lalalala, this lala, this is what I always say."
This translation is: "This is what I always say."
I always say this during the peak of our dispute with Saudi Arabia: "I used to say this."
And refer to all the documents you have in the island but
The matter is different altogether.
Unilaterally, we said, "No more, let's stop at this point."
And we tried our best.
I don't want to get involved in this matter.
They see their affairs, they see their mistakes where.
And maybe we realize our mistakes, which doesn't mean all that we have is right.
This is the translation of "هزا معالي الشيخ" into English: "This, Your Excellency, the Sheikh."
To internal problems in Egypt.
They want to get out of it.
Qatar denies any form of external conspiracy against Egypt and cuts ties with Turkey or any other countries.
And by God, we have a unique ability.
And they number seventy million, if we are capable of achieving eighty.
They also have a problem that they need to address.
You played a role in the Ghandi Shalit case despite knowing that this file is a sensitive issue for the Egyptian government.
And I sought with the French.
We received a call from a friendly country.
In a pot, we found something, so we said to our brothers, "This is what the Egyptians have."
We want to look at this issue from a different perspective.
It is a mistake to attribute this to Israel and other countries; we need to look at the other side and see this issue objectively.
When we saw this issue, we told them, "Brother, if the same conditions that the brothers are discussing with the brothers in Egypt."
And what we have announced means that a responsible person is saying, in effect, that we are laughing at the entire Arab university.
God, this means, means poor.
It means how did you pull it off on us.
President Mahmoud Abbas remains
And we support this.
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is on your end.
I believe I believe this is a healthy phenomenon.
I am not the owner of Al Jazeera as you have accused.
And Al-Jazeera needs to enter the media competition, just as there are many media entities in the West.
There are many media outlets that during adolescence, all of them insult each other.
But after a period, they will reach the stage of maturity.
The given text seems to be in Arabic and contains repetitive and unclear words. A possible translation, based on context, could be: "It can be, it might be, it is possible." However, for a more accurate translation, please provide the complete and correct text.
First, our position with Saudi Arabia is different.
And even if we concede to Saudi Arabia, we will not accept this in Qatar.
Important relations
Egypt is an important country, but in terms of privacy in Saudi-Egyptian relations.
Egypt also has a unique relationship with any Arab country. Egypt is the largest and most powerful state.
This is true. This is true, but when it comes to Saudi Arabia, both history and the relationship differ.
It is a personal dispute between the officials here and there.
We respect the dignity of the Egyptian president.
I hope there is no disagreement in policies or perspectives.
I told you about the problem when the Gaza Strip was attacked.
The second problem is that they have a sensitivity that we haven't yet identified from anything Qatar or whatever does.
Why don't you now strive to arrange a meeting with the Egyptian president between the prince?
Saudi Arabia has intervened in this matter.
And as it was leaked to the press, they said the first thing was a secret meeting, and then we found out the next day.
There was a meeting between me and Omar Suleiman.
In Saudi Arabia
Irreversible cut
I can't tell you that we agreed on everything.
Let's just say, so that no one else interprets that you're comparing yourselves.
But dignity is dignity, whether for the young or the old.
If Egypt gets the appropriate satisfaction, the minister would be satisfied.
Entertainment for children
I don't think this is Egypt, Egypt is bigger than this, I think it's a house of expression.
Do you have a vision for solving problems with Egypt, or are you just the Egyptian people waiting for divine intervention?
This, this, please. I want to talk about the intervention of heaven and other things, because God knows who lives and who dies.
And here I am calling
He was led to believe that there was a style.
And we are proud of Egypt.
It is evident that there must be a certain way.
Either stop with me or stop against me.
Why does any Arab citizen suffer?
In the Arab world, we grieve for it, and this is the policy of His Highness the Prince.
States derive their power from sources of power.
The United States has sources of power, China has sources of power, France has sources of power, a small country like Qatar also has its sources of power.
By God
What's clear is that there's nothing there.
All of this is a mess, you're just doing it.
But we are a small country in my eyes and on my head.
And repeat it a hundred times.
So no one says we're sensitive.
No one of us will seize them.
You are now a thorn in Israel's side.
Before I leave for Israel.
What is your vision for solving the issue with Egypt?
The problem is that they weren't even first.
And every day they file a complaint against America if I were to tell you about the major powers you are referring to.
They deal with us on a profit basis, and we deal with them on a profit basis.
All complaints and all
In order to sabotage the relationship
I believe it diminishes any major nation that does that.
It also diminishes our Arab pride to run around complaining to each other.
Everything comes and everything we know
Our vision is to be based on the Arab interest.
And we're not involved in anything with them.
Are there any upcoming steps to repair the relationships?
But I know that there are intimate relations between the president and His Highness the Prince.
If someone moved any matters.
Against the proximity of the two countries and their cultures, he will find himself a loser, for in the end...
No, it's not possible. Maybe in ten years, God willing, I won't know either. We've always been on the side of attending any conference we're invited to.
Whoever invites us to a conference, we will attend, and if we have a point of view, we will express it at the conference.
What we can do
Egypt is our older sister in every matter, but we have our own perspective and we discuss.
This is all that is required. When the time comes, of course, we would be delighted to discuss this topic.
It was canceled due to this policy.
And as I mentioned, we respect the Egyptian people.
Of course, canceling a contract and adding another is a different matter. If you're asking about the number of Egyptians who came to Qatar at the same time, ask how many.
But if the policy of his country, we, the Egyptians, are close to you in Qatar from the bottom of our hearts.
On April 4th, you stirred the emotions of the Arab peoples by closing the Israeli office, and on April 4th, Arts published it.
Why did you say we tickled him? We've been trying to tickle them for 12 years and it's closed.
When Shenin was, everyone was carrying his burden before reconciling with Israel and before secret meetings were held between some Arab countries and Israel.
And after, and after, and after that, and after they reconciled, most Arabs...
Whether under the table or on top of it, with Israel or talking to it in any capacity.
If we wanted to tickle emotions, we tickled them at the previous Islamic conference.
In the United Nations, Nasser's supporters held a reception at the Israeli Embassy's residence, in the person of its ambassador, Bilakji.
Yes, he was a guest among many guests present at his meal. He didn't know the occasion for which the ambassador had organized it.
Because in the United Nations, we sit next to Israel, so no one can deny this fact.
We found a glimmer of hope in alleviating the suffering of our brothers in Palestine.
Now the administration has changed the matter. Egypt used to take up a small part of my focus, but unfortunately...
I didn't raise you, you raised yourself.
My question is about the United States and the new administration, and how that might affect the relationship between Qataris and the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
In a difference of opinion
The road leads to many solutions in the region.
And if they are all serious, we will help them to the utmost extent.
Expecting a special relationship or a solution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these issues have been resolved.
The Emir of Qatar yesterday in Paris spoke about what is happening in Iran.
And Iran has unique relations with you, despite its bad relations with the United States.
First, we need to put it within the framework of internal affairs, because we must respect every country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said in this program that the Doha Agreement ends with the holding of elections.
Is this your vision as well, or do you see an existing agreement, or will you move towards a new agreement?
The Doha Agreement was a step towards a phase that would lead to peaceful elections.
A year and a half has passed since the Doha elections.
We followed it day by day and moment by moment until they reached the elections according to the Doha Agreement.
If we recently intervened in one of the electoral districts to clarify some misunderstandings that arose.
But you still have an interest in sorting things out in Lebanon.
We're always close to Lebanon, you know? Qataris love Lebanon and go there often.
That means I was the first country I visited after Western countries, Lebanon.
Quick question about what's happening in Yemen.
You intervened in the Houthi affair, and there are accusations that you supported the Houthis.
Involving you at the very least, put them in a partnership with the state. Now there is a greater danger, the danger from the south.
We suffered what we suffered, and this soul returns to ask: Why didn't you stop here? Why did you stop here in Qatar?
Indeed, we faced a lot of pressure on this issue, but this is our vision and this is His Highness the Prince's position on this matter.
The topic of the Houthis
Its stability positively affects us, and its instability negatively.
We intervened through an honest mediator between the two parties.
We signed an agreement.
But I understand that if this is to be exploited for other reasons,
And I would be with them there, and we would always stand with them on every issue.
And and and and, what about the fundamental truth?
I see that there's no need.
Sell them
And this is what I say, and I'm sorry, I know that there is a large Arab audience that will be against me.
Thank you, our esteemed viewers, for your continued support, hoping that we have clarified some aspects of Qatar's foreign policy for you.
In conclusion, I convey to you the greetings of the program team, and Ahmed Mansour sends you his warmest regards without limits.
And peace be upon you and the mercy and blessings of God.
Dear viewers, peace be upon you. Welcome to this special interview.
Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani is the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar.
Of course, why do I say a special and exceptional meeting because...
Qatar and this man in particular was the main sponsor.
Sir, a simple and direct question.
I believe it happened because there was an Arab consensus at the beginning.
And we tried that when we went to the United Nations.
The Arab consensus was important, and the Lebanese determination from both sides was significant.
Upon reaching results
It is very important that external interference
Many opinions or suggestions from the outside
Lebanese Arabic international if you want to say.
But he meant to go through stages.
"What isn't anything but something that becomes something that doesn't mean that these stages didn't exist."
Does complexity mean in Lebanon?
For a long time
It means when you now converge and directly engage on the Lebanese line and file.
Have you discovered that the Lebanese knot is a major knot?
A Lebanese, Arab, regional, and international entity requires significant unravelling.
A is a very simple, small contract, but it was exaggerated by external interference.
Because we know that Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, a beacon for many things.
The Lebanese should not allow...
It affects the security and peace in Lebanon.
Problem number one
External reverberations on Lebanon
You suddenly decided, after twenty-four hours, to take everyone on a single flight.
Direct from the plane, I am meeting the Emir of Qatar.
It wasn't even something they expected, meaning they couldn't rest for even a minute unless you deign to grant it to them.
The secret, the real secret is that we need to let them rest and think more.
And they make many connections, it was the secret.
To consider the idea of transferring them to Doha, as we need an environment.
She will face many diverse difficulties.
In many circumstances
So we put them in these circumstances because if you come to solve it.
If we want to succeed, we must get them out of this environment.
And quickly
May God grant us success in the clarification of the Venetian statement or the Beirut statement.
Then we were fortunate that the most of them agreed to go to Doha.
Both parties decided to go to Doha.
Some people believe, for example, that Qatar is biased towards one side against another.
He is from Beirut but...
It means that the prince's highness implies that if we are intermediaries.
In this process
To be perfectly honest, the Sheikhdom of the country.
Did you consult seriously?
With the two main parties involved, at a minimum, in what is happening here in Lebanon, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Syria.
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
He expressed his support for his idea.
It means that we benefited from Prince Saud by saying that we...
Everyone wanted a solution.
His excuses are weak.
If I go, you will go to reason.
His excuses are weak.
It should have been removed because there is a lot of tension in Palestine.
There is an Iranian nuclear case.
The Arab University must necessarily have a mechanism to solve issues.
The African Union is better than us at solving problems.
He's trying to gather the pieces.
And he organizes conferences to solve the Arab flux that you have collectively endured for years, they cannot.
If there is a need, let the Arabs unite or gather the parties, or intervene to support the oppressed.
He must study.
If we want it to be a wake-up call for the Arab University, not the University of the Arab World, then...
With it, he has the tool for implementation.
One of the officials here was President Nabih Berri.
Sin Sin requires
Now it seems that the Lebanese have agreed.
And God, just look, what does that mean, us.
The first of them is Qatar.
It never led to a result.
For the Arab interest
It is a force for the Arabs.
We tried it in several ways.
In the United Nations, when we went to the Doha Agreement.
And the agenda is the solution to the problem, not another agenda.
There's no doubt that
And the most important role they play in the Arab world as a whole, especially.
In a situation
We agreed to stop it.
Help us, it's for the greater good.
Because this is a serious matter, and this is a serious matter but...
Why have we reached a point where everyone plays in our field?
On our square
It is very important to prioritize the interests of our people and the public.
Now we need an Arab summit after this agreement to see what we will do among the Palestinian brothers.
What will we do in Somalia?
What will we do in Somalia, it's not a matter of the Arab League?
Why is Sudan not a member of the Arab League, and Iraq not a member of the Arab University?
We are part of the Arab world and a small part of the Arab world.
We hope that this is not a suggestion, this is an idea.
Can Qatar have good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia?
I believe that first and foremost, if something is asked of us, we should do our best.
But I am certain that His Majesty King Abdullah
King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
And his brother, President Bashar.
Historically, Saudi Arabia and Syria were in agreement.
A transitory phase can be achieved.
We will find her afterward, God willing.
Nevertheless, I insist on asking, if you don't mind, can you play a role in this regard?
Even if secretly, you now possess what is meant by trust.
We strive for any convergence between Arab countries.
And this is the policy of His Highness from the beginning, but this means the topic...
Can what happened in Lebanon suggest that the region is heading towards serious compromises?
What happened in Lebanon is a local Lebanese affair, regional matters are still ongoing.
Not too attached to this situation
I wish the opposite. I wish this wasn't...
Starting a new phase in the Arab world is a wish.
We can create.
It will happen elsewhere.
In other words, does the Sheikhdom fear that the escalation that was taking place a while ago will resume?
At least until the end of President George W. Bush's term.
There is no doubt that my concerns remain, whether it's about Palestine, or currently, Gaza.
That means I want to ask you.
We don't want anything else.
He orders me to pay attention to this human side in Palestine.
We can't provide them with a cure.
And food
Electricity for the patient in the hospital.
The one who dies if the electricity cuts off.
That means "I wish" in English.
As the Arab League, we agree on a sum for this issue, medicine and food, we call it medicine and food.
Bro, we don't want the Red Crescent to deliver it.
The Red Cross will deliver it.
But excuse me, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli siege.
I don't want to go into the details of this issue, I just say that as Arabs, we should deliver medicine and aid even if we disagree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made efforts and pledged to preserve and protect the Holy Kaaba.
Because this contradiction will only benefit the other side.
It is incorrect to say "Do not deal with this party as we will solve this for you."
And I
So far, there are no signs of a solution in front of me.
Do you fear an American-Iranian confrontation in the near future, or do you anticipate it?
This is of course a natural entry.
At least talk about the state of Qatar.
Iran is an important neighbor to us.
We may not agree on every policy or they may not agree on every national policy.
They basically tell us that we don't want your relations with Israel or your contact with it.
Some may perceive you as necessarily being a party through the American rules that are there.
We know how to handle this issue.
Some have said that after the visit of the Emir of Qatar to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,
As if he had met, consulted or spoken with the Saudi family.
In Istanbul, there are negotiations between Syria and Israel.
And I can almost say by chance.
The second topic: The Kingdom was keen to find a solution, and I was in touch with Prince Saud.
What happened in the last hours
Changing tactics changes the negotiation tactics.
By you or by the parties?
We are responsible for this mess.
And you from every side, and we locked ourselves in the room.
In the end, we found ourselves that after the intervention of His Highness the Prince, it became important.
And from it, the invention emerged.
The (without mentioning it now) has ended.
And the message was clear when he said, "We know our size, our place, our role, and so on," as if
He wanted to play the role of a mediator without provoking any other party.
Whether Arab, regional, or international.
But still
He became responsible.
You wanted it or not.
"It means that some jealousy is a sign of what we want to avoid, because as a country, we..."
That these states
You can work or
I believe this is the most comfortable combination.
Perhaps a final or last question about your current relationship with Washington: is it a fading, prolonged, distinguished relationship?
That means our relationship with Washington is a good one, let me put it this way.
It is not devoid of differing viewpoints on issues.
But this is our right, and if they speak of democracy, this is democracy.
How is it good, that means how do you translate it in reality as good your relationship with...
"If you talk about the economy, she's excellent. If you talk about education, she's excellent."
If you're talking about health, and if you're talking about politics, I can tell you that they're doing well.
In your clear opinion during the upcoming phase.
In my opinion, we should drop the issue of confronting Israel.
And if we want to stop the game in the Arab field,
We heal the rift between Palestinians.
We agree on a view so that we can be a respected force.
I don't think we're here.
If we can be something effective.
Thank you, our dear viewers, for your good company. Until we meet again, God willing. I appreciate you.
Welcome, viewers, to this dialogue with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jasim bin Jaber Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We are trying to anticipate the Arab political reality and Arab efforts.
Welcome, honored guest.
To investigate what is happening in Gaza.
And I hope that through this dialogue, we will be able to...
To shed light on some of your questions
The Israeli entry into Gaza by land in a coordinated manner
And our goal was to have an Arab stance.
Her dealings with friendly countries
And the sisterly states
And how to attempt to find a clear, strong Arab position that the Arab states...
And then we find areas for reconciliation.
Before us, we know that more than one Arab state has violated.
In a arbitrary way
And no one shall be held accountable while...
We find that we are held accountable for everything, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
We are the specialists.
The only world we always target
We always educate in a polite manner.
I believe what
To the point that we won't be able to
Let's meet at a high level.
To stop the disciplinary action, we are the ones who suffered.
We did not intend to create a rift in the Arab world.
And there were five further oral agreements.
By a two-thirds majority
But the purpose of the meeting is not...
We hope it's correct and our perspective is wrong because the goal...
Solving the problem is not the goal of a summit now.
But will it be resolved with the blood of Palestinians?
What we requested now, the ministerial level, does not cancel Qatar's request.
And also confirmed by His Highness.
In his speech, he said that we are not bound if the embarrassment is in Qatar, we are not bound for it to be in Qatar. The summit can be held wherever it may be.
An Arab stance that respects others.
Yes, but regarding the ministerial one.
We just want to tell them that the UN Security Council decision has been issued.
And Israel
She was not involved in the decision and continued to kill and bomb in Gaza.
And we need to ask the Arabs, what are we doing?
What are we doing?
After Israel finishes, what then?
Implement the remaining parts of the Security Council's resolution.
Or there will be a stance since Israel has not stopped.
Firing to prevent our brothers from being forced.
According to a decision, it is considered that the time has passed.
For a few days
We will discuss the ministerial meeting.
In the end, you support this argument.
We naturally support an Arab summit, and this is our idea, as well as the idea of several other Arab countries that have also requested a summit in Syria and Yemen.
I am in an Arabic gap.
He dispersed all our disputes into a camp of moderation.
And the camp of extremism
And excess (or extravagance) - what do they mean by that?
The ones who divide us west.
The Arab moderates who call themselves moderates and the Arab non-moderates.
We find that there is a moderate nation and a non-moderate nation.
And then we need to understand what moderation and extremism are. Is moderation following Israel's plans?
And ending the matter in a humiliating way.
Or we just need to keep the issue alive.
That means this is an important question.
The topic means do states
You are following Israel's plans and want to solve issues in ways
I don't say she's following Israel's plans, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say
If we name a camp "Moderation Camp"
What is moderation in the West's perspective?
Do we agree to slaughter a specific group of Palestinians?
Of course, elections did take place.
I am neither for nor against Hamas, but I am speaking about reality.
The reality is that there is
Thought
Some of those who are called the Radical Movement
But we must ask ourselves, what is this radical movement demanding?
Is she claiming her right or is she fighting for it?
Are we segregating them?
And we also create other blocks.
Against because we
Internal Arab intellectual
And this seemed to be happening.
Therefore, we do not want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, Sir, briefly.
Who prevented the Arab summit from taking place?
I can't say for sure, as there are testimonies and everyone, and the matter is well-known.
The subject of prohibition
But the (as I told you), we could have...
Let's take a vote and get two-thirds.
But that's not the point, it's not about a challenge, it's about a pressing need that we believe in.
I don't think it's something urgent.
Alright, we went to the Security Council.
Or in the resolution of the Security Council
But the decision by the Security Council, Israel said, is that it will continue and then look at the issue.
I only want to focus on that again.
We should strive to apply the decision to the weaker party.
How will this differ from the first meeting?
The topic of disagreements usually involves differences of opinion.
As important as it is
Are we ready to take a clear Arab stance?
Humanitarian aid
Clearly support our brothers.
And also addressing the Israeli academic community, he said.
This assumes that we should look into it, but I don't think everyone is ready.
Why don't we freeze the Arab initiative?
We agreed to the ceasefire 48 hours ago, and we have been committed to it. The Israelis, however, have not.
It's natural for meetings to have disagreements, but in reality, those disagreements...
It expresses positions that express innermost feelings in a certain person, that is to say.
One of the altercations she was aware of was
Some describe Hamas' movement as a "band".
And not even a minority
This is a situation that occurred, and we responded to it as brothers among the ministers.
And I believe this means what the West says.
Although these are radical movements and a disparate group, one might say they are thus.
And we do not want to be other men's tools.
And therefore, it always means and I don't mean anyone by it.
Any foreigner who finds
In Western or Western countries, you will find...
Among the Arabs
Yes, alright, the happiness of the sheikh now.
Call for a second ministerial meeting
And indeed, his schedule should be one thing.
Where are you, Arabs, in what is happening? What is the position of your 30-million nation?
A million Israeli softs
Which resulted in Resolution 1860
The decision that was issued.
Israel has not yet implemented it after the mission is completed.
And there is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort.
He is grateful for this decision.
If we demand Chapter VII because Israel is above the law, it means Israel.
And if you ask them again, they will say, "We understand."
It's not the Arabs' fault if they...
If that's the case, Israel, no, don't question.
She is above international law.
This is reality
Why did you go to the Security Council? And why did you link the holding of an Arab summit to what the Security Council would issue?
At the summit, the Security Council will strive for us.
He needs to make a difficult decision.
To a decision
A responsible person may lose their position.
We in the West are afraid.
And we are the ones who testify that after they decide, for example...
I want to get out of the topic.
Those who carried out this aggression are responsible for rebuilding Iraq entirely at their own expense, as they were the ones who destroyed it.
Let's not ask the Iraqi government or the people who have died.
There are no compensations.
Exactly the same thing happened in Sudan when they started talking about the trial of Bashir.
Happiness of the Sheikh
Sheikh's happiness
A major diplomatic Arab victory in the Security Council.
He faced difficulties in the Security Council because the initial focus was on a presidential statement.
The consequences
Israel did not comply with it.
You will commit after two days, after a week, after you finish the task.
Because they did not adhere to the decision.
Excuse me, people should comply.
Because Israel accepts after completing the mission.
Do you have an alternative to this decision now?
All that we've done
We unfortunately executed some of our brothers due to their own efforts.
The Gaza blockade they participated in.
I am a friend of the West, and I see no harm in having a relationship with the West. I am not against it.
Against the West, not against America.
But these people know the language of interests.
If you are strong, your friends will believe you.
Or if you have a point of view.
In the end, our perspective is taken into account, one percent at a time, and we say we have won.
What is victory?
What it entails
I can't say anything about reservations now because the decision hasn't been made.
And the council is its own master.
You participated in the formulations.
We participated to some extent in the formulations. Yes, we participated.
But why didn't you call for a meeting of the Arab ministers with the U.S. Secretary of State?
But I'm sure the brothers who went will stop for us.
I pointed to the surroundings for a specific purpose.
In this field, happiness is found by the sheikh.
Since two years ago until now
Look, I don't want to talk about accusations.
I can't claim that we're aware of everything.
Are they people?
An Israeli rejection met with international rejection, and we too contributed to this rejection.
And from here the dispute began and the siege started.
Last month, Israel killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the ceasefire.
They prefer to remain hungry until they are worn out, because we do not want them to be in power.
Those are the happy ends of Sheikh's life.
She clearly states that the Palestinian-Palestinian dispute
It means if there were...
Who created the Palestinian conflict? Perhaps there was a Palestinian-Palestinian conflict before.
If I were to tell someone that you are completely right, would that make a difference?
I don't say Hamas is entirely right.
I do not claim that nor do I say that.
But a mediator, typically, is usually a neutral party equidistant from all sides.
And I don't just mean the mediator; I mean as Arabs, we should be at an equal distance from everyone.
We don't want it to exist, so we need to end it by any means necessary.
Once training the right and left forces.
And also by their siege and refusal to give them money or salaries.
And once we create a positive model in the western shore.
The people in Gaza are seeing how people are living.
His life is smooth.
In contrast to the opposite in Gaza
You have invited to a second ministerial meeting, an Arab ministerial meeting, but at this time...
Discussions about her are still ongoing between Hamas with Turkish mediation and
This meeting you've called seems to be an attempt at circumvention.
If we take the initiative, we can make a turn.
We don't have initiatives.
In this topic
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
And it is required of her to play a role and we support any Egyptian effort that leads to understanding.
But it is important
We do not come
Tomorrow, it will be as if one side has triumphed over the other.
And there is no path to harmony.
Egyptian balanced initiative
Between international requirements, Arab requirements, and humanitarian requirements
And the requirements for Egypt's role, which is an important role.
It is an Arab pioneering state that we respect and appreciate.
This is what is required, in my opinion, for Egypt.
The current proposals do not meet those requirements, Your Highness.
I have a vision for the initiative.
We hear about it from here and from there, and we get information about it.
I can't comment on something I know nothing about.
With due respect to the government or the Palestinian Presidency, it must be present, and we all recognize the Palestinian Presidency.
But there are also people.
The affected parties at the end, we need to consider their perspective.
So that we can make this mediation successful.
By the way, consider the viewpoint.
Hamas' position was clear: this decision was taken without our consultation, meaning how can such a decision be issued?
A decision in which Arabs participate in its drafting without contacting or seeking the opinion of the main party concerned on the issue.
"We just mean that, of course, we deal with the Palestinian state as a state."
And we deal with them as authority, let's say a one-sided party.
But now there is a rift in one end that is located in a place and in the other end it is located elsewhere.
This does not mean that if we deal with people in Gaza, we should drop our dealings with the group in the West Bank or the Palestinian Presidency.
We deal with Palestinians as one people and one government.
If they ask for a limit from the Gaza, it should be with them.
And now we're starting to sync up together.
What was announced, was announced.
First, the decision is that he did not say to him, he welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiatives.
Some considered it a form to him.
This is an interpretation, but from my reading of the resolution, I understood that Ahaz welcomed the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative succeeds in achieving
Stops the fighting
I do not doubt our brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the decision of the Security Council.
And you consider that this decision has become non-existent as Israel did not accept it.
Even if you accept it later, things might have changed on the ground.
Yes, Your Excellency, in talking about Egyptian efforts, Egyptian efforts.
Turkey's efforts are also shared at the same time.
About Arab Inability
Regarding Arab disputes that cannot reach a solution, therefore, he came to take its place.
It means: "It was supposed that Arab parties would occupy him."
Welcome Turkey's stance.
And a position that must be appreciated Arabically and Islamically.
Turkey is an Islamic state.
And therefore this natural role
And if the people need to follow me.
There is no Arab consensus to address the situation.
One says, "Let them finish the task."
There must be a clear Arab position against this aggression, its continuation, and the delay tactics.
To be in a position opposite to an Arab.
That means Israel is capable of stopping in the Quran. I'm not talking about an Arab-Israeli war, and we are among the people who always call for peace.
"لا واحنا دوله" means "We are a state" in Arabic, and the second part, "يعني اتحب اتعيش بامان", translates to "means you want to live in safety."
But I'm not asking for an Arab war, I'm asking for a position.
Clear Arabic
In the context of talking about initiatives and proposals, of course, you follow what is happening.
And the proposals and conditions set by Hamas movement
Do you think?
As an observer now, I am seeing the field reality.
The political outcome of the military operation now allows Hamas to impose its conditions.
The necessary is to be right.
These are the points we agree on, this point we do not agree with you on.
The second thing
They're not here now, they're negotiating. I don't know about this negotiation, as I told you.
The second thing
In difficult situations, what is expected of Arabs?
This Arab reality
What we witnessed following the start of those operations
It is doubtful that the Arab street's position is much, much more advanced than...
As governments, we...
Of course, I regret that some describe this popular uprising as chaos.
They sometimes tell me about this issue.
Represent the opinions of our peoples.
The leaders now
It means if they want.
At least they should see what.
Of course, here is the translation: "There is a high ceiling and a modest ceiling."
By halting normalization, relations with Israel are also halted.
Qatar Pan
The Israeli Embassy office in Doha is closed.
Qatar, which takes this position
It is considered that the Arab side must be radical and take radical positions.
Any agreement the Arabs reach, we reach collectively.
We will definitely agree if there is an Arab consensus.
A treaty is one thing, and relations are another.
We are ready.
We stand with our Arab brothers.
But there must be a clear Arab decision and credibility.
And they deal with others, not just countries with relations.
Even countries without relations
Very important
We should never be agents of others.
He says, "Why shouldn't Qatar be a model in this field?"
If this is the only model, we are ready to be part of it.
But we also want
Qatar adheres to a part of its Arab commitment.
Like
And no one should sell anyone else into slavery.
The problem is that trust between Arab countries is missing.
And what I want to say is, our journey, unfortunately, I don't want to say brokers.
And that is very important.
A formal invitation anywhere, because we must rise above this.
Some called for the ambassador, some presented protests, some expelled the ambassador, like Switzerland, for instance.
And this is part of the dispute.
But some of them summoned the ambassador, and the one who summoned the permanent representative of the great country of D was five ambassadors, and all of these are movies about our peoples.
It means we spoke about the modest ceiling of popular demand.
With the highest roof, there are those who demand the opening of fronts, there are those who demand Syria open its front with Israel.
Look, I've told you, we call for peace, not for fighting with Israel.
And we do not call for a fight with Israel.
To fight against Israel
And how shall we agree?
What problem?
What made us talk to each other, overcome our differences.
What you said, O esteemed sheikh, has captivated me.
The condition that states do not sell to each other.
What do you mean?
means now
The street won't spare us.
Happiness of the Sheikh
Is what is happening today a continuation of a project that began in 2006 with the Lebanon War?
She considers that there is a difference.
No, I don't think there's any difference between the goals.
Lebanon meant that it had a land liberated.
The remaining parts, of course, are supposed to be a deposit with the United Nations.
Or something similar
Lebanon means that we have dealt with the Lebanese issue in a major way.
Israel of course needs weak countries around it.
Even she dominates, she is the one with the longest arm.
And of course, there are countries that are supported by foreign entities.
And therefore she wants to remain the sole power in the region.
And now they want
They change this example in Gaza.
In Lebanon, you speak to how many sects?
And how many sides?
While Lebanon sleeps, in Palestine they speak of one side alone.
But I still insist that the Palestinian problem has listened to the Arabs more than the foreigners.
Two parties, and from here the gap grew, with each side believing they had control over the other.
In my opinion, as an observer and follower.
As planned, it ends in a broken bone.
As Arabs, do we accept this, since this example may be repeated for those who insist?
He expresses his opinion.
Whether for Israelis or others in the future.
And we took an example.
The highest in obedience and in assisting to break bones.
In our saying, it means "I and my cousin are like strangers, and I and my brother are like my cousin."
We should now assume any disagreement with Hamas, and I'm not saying Hamas or any other group is immune from error or authority.
They all have mistakes.
Now we must not pass over this issue.
On the edge of submission
Because here, failure will not be the failure of the category.
Saada Al-Sheikh, Qatar: Traditionally, she has been proactive in putting forward proposals for a while.
And initiatives for solving this took place in Lebanon.
That happened in Darfur. We will talk about this issue, even briefly, in a little while.
If we
We do not want to burden our brothers, because there is a sensitivity in some cases.
If our country is taking all these initiatives, we have no objection. The main thing is that the issue is resolved.
It's not our goal right now to put Qatar on the top headline.
That means the objectives of His Highness the Prince.
These were his goals: how do we stop this bleeding.
And we stop this oppression.
What happened goes beyond imagination.
And we are in Qatar.
Do we know something they don't? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is that we have the intention.
Honesty is the key to finding a prestigious solution.
Talking about the initiatives means it is useful to know where the initiative has reached regarding Darfur, the solution movement of Justice and Equality.
And the Sudanese government in Khartoum.
And the icon is special in that it solves the Darfur problem, because you see, the Darfur problem began...
The Arabs helped.
But as soon as we achieved our goal, we reached the international level.
Based on the desire to avenge the system, and now we need to solve the issue, but we don't know how to do it.
And we always strive to implement decisions as mentioned at the beginning, which means we're the best at implementing decisions.
Removing the issue from competition - Is there also competition regarding the issue of Darfur?
What I want to gain from this topic.
Before we conclude this conversation, there is an economic summit.
Will this summit be held? Will you attend this summit?
No, we will ban the summit.
It will be held. We wish it were held in an environment different from the Arab one, but it is scheduled.
It's a defect.
Well, if they were present, if the Arab leaders were present at this summit.
When Palestinian blood was pouring in Gaza, they are now listening to financial and economic reasons.
Help us light the fire.
But it doesn't seem that anyone is afraid of this street.
What we know about the circumstances means that of course we don't wish for anything but safety for all of us.
And be safe.
But it means that no one should take anyone else's small bag.
The Qatari Foreign Minister and Prime Minister, Hamad bin Jasim bin Jaber Al Thani, I thank you very much.
Dear viewers, wherever you are, peace be upon you.
So what is the point of this celebration, and how genuine are the statements of the High Commissioner for Human Rights?
People with disabilities are the most neglected group in the world.
And what about our Arab region and the extent of its interest in this issue?
These questions and others, we pose to our guest on today's episode.
The former Special Rapporteur of the United Nations on the rights of persons with disabilities
She holds a Bachelor's degree in Arts and Social Service and Sociology from Qatar University.
Similarly, a Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policies from Helwan University, Egypt.
And I held many positions in the field of people with disabilities.
She is a founding member and the general coordinator of the National Committee for People with Disabilities.
The year 1998
And the Deputy Chairman of the National Committee for People with Disabilities in 1999.
Even 203
She also contributed to the establishment of the center for people with spinal cord injuries.
By people with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest oversaw the launch of numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
And activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world
As well as contributing through giving lectures and participating in meetings, conferences, and forums.
Welcome, Ms. Hessa, to this episode with us.
The approved term is people with disabilities.
In the beginnings, we used the term "disabled" which was prevalent in the 1980s and before.
More educational when
They are located within those who provide that education.
In the 93rd session, an important document appeared at the United Nations.
On mentioning this term before diving into the details.
Compared to other regions, although there are regions that are not or are considered less developed and are classified as poor.
And Latin America, and especially Latin America as a reality, this trend may be stronger there than in any other region.
But statistics have proven otherwise.
The trend towards legalism is present in the Arab world, and you can find it in many countries.
It is possible that resources are available and political will exists.
Alright, let me tell you some statistics. I assume you're already aware of them.
Eighty percent of them are from poor countries.
UNESCO says that nearly ninety percent of children with disabilities in poor countries do not go to school.
How do you interpret these statistics, Lady Share?
They are largely true.
I first witnessed it in Darfur, Gaza, and other areas that are exposed to such events, which are wars and conflicts.
There, you don't distinguish between a disabled person who is disabled or not, the numbers are large.
Separate the children's literacy rates by gender, for example, about 35% for females or 52%.
And in other countries
There are many barriers that prevent these children from attending school, even if they do not have a disability.
The city originally has no infrastructure, so even if this child found that school.
If he can reach it
For the children and for other members of the population, it is
This means that these projects and agendas are great, but we don't often hear about them being actually implemented.
Only when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated a few days ago, what is the point of this celebration?
The situation in the world
Better off than those who don't have any disabilities at all.
There are organizations that have arrived and established many projects.
He applies a very important strategy for health.
Through this strategy
There is an overlap between the humanitarian sphere and working with specific marginalized groups, such as people with disabilities.
In a certain degree of awareness, the current situation in the Arab world is better.
At the point of awareness, we stop to receive communications and continue our dialogue.
Thank you.
I have two questions I'd like to ask since she was previously a UN official.
The second point is what?
United Nations laws that call for, for example, fighting systems that hinder the participation of children in society, for instance, my son, the Syrian intelligence system.
Is there a law that allows me to file a lawsuit against the system, as there are many in Syria?
Yes, Suleiman, your idea is clear. Suleiman, Krou, told us from Syria. Thank you very much. With us is Naif Al-Sa'id from Kuwait. Please, Naif.
Peace be upon you and the mercy and blessings of God.
And upon you be peace.
Good evening
Good evening, please have a seat.
If you would allow me, I am intellectually disabled.
It means that Arabs say, "A free man understands a sign."
And in the Quran, you will find: "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Praise be to Him who has given speech to us and to everything."
It means that I've been sitting for over thirty years, maybe I can't speak, saying only one or two words a day.
Praise be to God, God has given me speech.
It means he is speaking in metaphors, so I understood.
It means: "You're accusing me of using the Quran for my own gain and of being a hypocrite, targeting certain people."
They slander me and come to me, while they are in the lowest fire in hell.
All I got was bad publicity.
And they do not deceive the blind.
He who lives in a glass house shouldn't throw stones at others.
And of course, psychological disabilities.
It falls within this definition: A question, the question of Solomon regarding...
United Nations programs or their responses regarding disability-causing factors such as political goals or others.
Turning to different organizations and agencies
To discuss it, convince her, and know to what extent.
Disability issues and topics are on her agenda, meaning:
UNESCO is an international organization for intellectual cooperation. UNICEF, on the other hand, is a specialized agency of the United Nations focused on the well-being of children. These organizations do not inherently create obstacles; rather, they aim to address global challenges and promote progress.
It is one of the programs that tries not to neglect children with disabilities.
Favorable opportunities and schools
From various environmental and aspects
Similarly, UNICEF.
But there is a weakness that we must admit, there is a weakness in the position of the United Nations as well.
The main weaknesses and shortcomings you mentioned are what?
Regarding the United Nations.
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
Directly, I was present in my country, the State of Qatar.
But there was a routine and bureaucracy that hindered.
I work particularly; sometimes I see her even in the midst of constraints or limitations.
People with disabilities struggle, try, and fight for recognition.
Until it reached a level that was somewhat satisfactory to them, they did not put it in a separate category as the Global Disability Movement intended.
But it occupied a somewhat suitable part.
Unfortunately, there is no coordination between them.
This is one of her most significant shortcomings.
The survey carried out by the Special Rapporteur and applied to countries
The staff or the workers involved in those programs.
Unfortunately, we only received three responses from eighty organizations and agencies, only three responses came to us.
Don't put off.
The permanent, stable, and continuous disability for many years, although this issue is primarily a human rights issue.
In recent times, thank God, for the past two or three years.
The issue of disability is at least being raised through events such as seminars and others.
Oh, peace be upon you.
Madam, why are there no binding laws and decisions for Arab countries? Who is responsible for enforcing these international laws?
Regarding Arab countries and the allocation of salaries, for example, allocating a salary for the disabled.
Are there funds allocated by the United Nations?
And do these funds go to governments or to United Nations offices, and do these aid reach the disabled truly?
And in conclusion, it was noted that there were no binding decisions regarding the Arab countries.
Many thanks to you, Ahmed Al-Halabi, for talking to us from Greece.
We have Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia. Please, Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you.
And upon you be peace.
You should adopt this proposal.
It means writing directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
Transform to this box
He is a manufacturer of products.
Allocate just one percent of the annual net profit
I return to our guest to answer the questions of the callers.
And he says that doctors advised him to undergo surgery, but...
He spends a lot of money, but he cannot afford these operational costs, so to which direction does he turn?
He is from Algeria.
I believe it's important that we meet the needs of brother Naji.
Like any other rights, it means the rights of persons with disabilities.
All these rights are his due, this citizen must obtain them.
To join the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this is a binding and legal agreement.
Satisfying the rights and needs of individuals within its national scope
Even at the level of non-governmental organizations
It is binding on all states and there should be oversight to ensure their implementation.
At least, at the level of top officials, there must be awareness.
So at least if we work on these documents in this way.
Even if there is no significant commitment
There was a response to the reports of the monitoring you were doing and was there interest.
But do not forget that standard rules are a binding ethical document, not legally enforceable.
To be in compliance and be certified
And understanding that these issues will be resolved, discussed, or raised within the context of a society suffering from many problems and issues.
Naji Zakarnie is the director of the Qatari Deaf Center and a sign language expert at Al Jazeera Channel.
At the beginning, Ali Sir thanks Al Jazeera deeply.
The one who has kindly broadcast this special episode now.
Now Ali is speaking and saying, "I am very proud."
And she was the servant for all the people with special needs in the place where she was and still is.
We support her and stand by her always and forever.
I also say that there are many people with special needs.
Some of them do not know about this agreement because there was no training sessions.
Regarding them, especially if they are in schools, hospitals, or in government and private institutions.
It is essential that this agreement be published.
It's a law that deals with people with special needs worldwide.
And this he emphasized, urging states to:
By adopting and signing this agreement
Similarly, like the state of Qatar and some other countries, they have signed this document with the aim of serving people with special needs and serving us.
Thank you very much, colleague Naji, for reminding us that Ali spoke on our behalf.
Thank you both very much.
Your opinion might make a decision.
The former UN Special Rapporteur on Disability might start with the proposal submitted by one of the callers, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Establishing a Support Fund
It is a donation box and accepts any contributions from countries.
This box is intended to be used for expenditures related to activities even when the Special Rapporteur is not on duty.
And even the Arab countries did not provide donations except for one country, which is Syria.
Therefore, fulfilling those obligations is a problem existing in the United Nations.
The box that
Unfortunately, due to the non-compliance of the member states and lack of interest.
Unfortunately, many people say this, meaning that they believe we are indifferent to the current situation.
It's a matter of obligations.
Human Rights
The human being in its broad general form
The marginalized especially
But these documents exist for that reason.
So, these countries may fail to meet their obligations, but the brother's good idea that he launched is still alive.
It should not only be a separate box in its independent form, but also the existing organizations in the region.
From what she has in terms of budgets
"Step up for projects for people with disabilities in Gaza."
Assistance for the disabled
The issue is always intertwined, meaning political factors are involved.
His state or government has greatly supported him.
Unfortunately, the number has decreased.
With symbolic amounts
The parent is disabled.
Of course, the nationality was withdrawn from him.
The girl withdrew from him a daughter of her age.
Sometimes
Problems in teaching
We travel or go out, and we find ourselves in a state of confusion.
Peace be upon you and the mercy and blessings of God.
And upon you be peace.
And we can
Rebuilding their selves with knowledge
I wish Arab countries would allocate a portion of their budgets.
Thank you very much, Bahjat Kروان Bahjat from Kuwait.
Aisha Mohammed from Qatar, please.
Peace be upon you.
And upon you be peace.
Good evening to you and good evening to Sheikhah Bint Khalifah.
I just want to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In the past years
With our best wishes, we, the parents of children with special needs.
In her continuous support for them.
Bearer of the standard of the Noble One from Tunisia, welcome to you.
Then there is another level, which is genetic.
I believe that genetic level care reduces the rate of disabilities.
In our Arab customs, it is always the case that a cousin takes the daughter of his cousin's cousin, or the daughter of his uncle, and so on.
This means at this level, which is the level of disability, and thank you.
The comment responded to what was said in the viewer's communications.
The truth is, as you said, at the national level.
I know that there are guidance and support programs.
It is within the health services.
Which also fall under the umbrella of medical care.
The text translated into English is: "The psychological clinic also believes in the programs of the Supreme Council for Education."
The special education department, to be honest, I don't know if it still exists.
But it's certain that it's about health services. Yes, there is support and there are medical services.
And its qualification offers for these cases.
Prevention is better than cure, he pointed out, and mentioned the genetic factor of marriage between relatives. Are there any campaigns?
For example, for awareness.
In this field
This is definitely a very important and serious point.
And it's one of the things that I and others have touched on in many words and many posts.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns that are not only targeted.
It was implemented by the World Health Organization.
Similarly for UNICEF
Now in many Arab countries, Qatar included.
And certainly Tunisia.
There are now mandatory decisions for early examination.
And which has been implemented in many countries.
All of this is on the preventive side.
And do such campaigns receive a response?
The positivity, especially as it clashes with customs and traditions.
Of course, the difficulty lies in that it clashes with societal culture.
It should be a decision to be part of strategies, a will to take action and commit to addressing it.
The issue of early screening, for example, is a very important issue before marriage.
I ask if there are statistics speaking about the disabled.
Especially for the disabled in the Arab region
Measure according to Arabic logic meaning that
And especially
With the recent events in the region
In regions and in conflict hotspots, with regard to wars, conflicts, and others.
For every victim, three disabled people are met.
The events in Lebanon, Darfur, and many other regions.
Never, no, it's not enough, first of all, the issue is that I...
With the principles of human rights
There must be provisions for people with disabilities, their programs, and plans.
The agendas of the existing ministries, institutions, governmental and non-governmental organizations are interwoven.
In situations such as wars or disturbances
Only for your high commissioner for human rights at the United Nations, Navi Pillay.
In the world and stranger still, what the International Monitoring Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said is that the population statistics
This means that people with disabilities are not included in the general population statistics.
Not always announced
For example, in the State of Qatar, when the census was conducted, I believe it was more than five years ago.
But honestly
In cooperation with the relevant authority, the Planning Council, and the...
The council made it a reality with our participation as the office of the special rapporteur.
To employ more detailed classifications of disability.
The needs that I am expected to have
The quality of these actions, with all these important details, must lead you to a result.
Is there anyone disabled or not?
Exactly, but at least.
Statistics are somewhat progressing in this regard.
Peace be upon you.
Madam, thank you for this program and thank Sheikhah Hissa.
But I thank God and am grateful that I am a Qatari and receive this attention from my country.
My daughter is a student in independent schools now and she receives good education, thank God.
And I would like to thank Ms. Hesa.
And its protective role and its function that makes us not fear or worry about our children.
And all praise and thanks are due to God, and heartfelt thanks to those who support and care for this category of people.
Thank you very much, Fatima Al-Dosari, for telling us from Qatar. We will stay in Qatar with Latifa.
Peace be upon you.
And upon you be peace.
Our esteemed sister, the reality and the hoped-for solution, which we expect you to resolve, is to solve the problem of our children without papers.
Where is the role of the sheikh in our Qatari children?
I hope she responds to it. Respond to this question.
Peace be upon you.
And I bear witness to the services provided by the State of Qatar, especially for the hearing impaired.
We had a program for early detection of hearing impairment.
There is a Higher Council for People with Disabilities.
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability.
Even civil society associations like the AMU or other communities
Because the reality and the expectation is that if I compare during the next five years.
What has been provided for the disabled in the past five years and now?
Thank you very much, dear Karim Nassim, for joining us from Jordan, and I'll return to our guest list.
Of course, the translation of "طبعا ال ال" into English is: "Of course, the"
The society as a whole, including both individuals and specifically families who have...
Children with disabilities have ambitions and high expectations from anyone.
Whether at the planning level or at the implementation level
However, regarding one of the points you mentioned, which is a very important point.
Children who do not have documents or any other proof, either in Qatar or elsewhere.
The international agreement, like many international documents...
And a commitment to translate it into plans and strategies.
To provide those services automatically
Starting from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, sex, or nationality.
Well, my teacher said that she had previously served as a special rapporteur for the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities for six years.
You were wishing
Maybe time didn't allow, maybe financial assistance wasn't enough.
That means there have been many achievements accomplished, and I am proud of them.
Through my participation or through the existing organizations and the various governmental institutions in many countries.
In particular, I focus on the Arabic language.
There should be more research and larger studies.
We embarked on a global survey that yielded more than one report.
Raising awareness is a continuous process that must be constantly and significantly worked on.
Coordination among Arab countries
Amongst themselves, disabled individuals and their organizations, because they are...
But they have a duty they cannot avoid.
To struggle for it
Deepest thanks
Thank you.
At the close of this episode, I'd like to thank everyone who shared their thoughts and comments with us.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will meet a new guest.
Stay connected with us through your calls and messages in a new round of live broadcasts until we meet again.
Morning of roses
I'm very happy to have you with us.
At the beginning, before we start asking different questions and chatting this morning.
"Thank you, Shimaa, I'm happy."
The Middle East as a whole deserves this global achievement.
Qatar has indeed put us on the world map.
Thank you Qatar
Also, please be kind, Ali.
The first thing that becomes clear to the watching brothers.
And I say congratulations on the hosting, to the Qatari people as a whole.
And Allah knows best, as Sheikh Mohammed said.
Before a dream, and now, God willing, it will become a reality and work will begin from today or from the announcement period.
You expected Qatar to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
Despite having strong files, like the ones from America, Japan, and Australia, I wasn't worried about this area, specifically this topic.
No, look, it means I'll be honest with you, seventy percent of the time I don't choose.
Our file is too many.
They have global plans and are competitive.
We were the ones who were in the competition.
Why should we be afraid?
But thank God, the Qatar file was indeed strong and deserved it.
It is true that the 2022 FIFA World Cup and its hosting in Qatar are a thing.
So what does that mean for the mathematicians themselves?
It means to them in this field that surely the joy will be very, very great, God willing.
It means: "I like it like this. We used to talk before the weather, but I liked to hear about the weather like this."
In the moment of announcement
Where were you? How did you receive the news? How was the shock? I don't know, tell us, tell the viewers, share your story.
In radio
The whole world is behind us.
Draw a notice and here are some tips
How did you perceive global media?
Look at the level of support for sports channels in general, especially in Arab countries. Thank God, everyone supports him.
Just an announcement that Qatar's victory is that it has the right to host.
All Arab countries, and it's not surprising, have shown this generous gesture by declaring their readiness to support Qatar in any way needed.
Media-wise, human resources could include future volunteers.
Even at the level of external media, Shimaa
It means that I went to celebrate a failed event.
Include them among those whom I included; the French news agency also photographed them.
We also have meetings.
It means that no one insisted at all, Qatar has become now, let me tell you, every day I'm remembering.
Hundreds of times a day, on the smallest spot on Earth to the largest spot on Earth.
I expect that everyone will now know about Qatar, even those who didn't know it before, thanks to the internet.
Its owner is the 2020 World Cup.
Any football player who dreams of serving his country aspires to be part of the national team.
Of course, every player, whether in the Qatari League or not, would certainly wish to represent the national team.
It's not positive that one would kill themselves even in competitions.
He will give his all for the team, even if he makes it and joins the national team, he will put everything he has into it.
It means whether in exercises or in matches, since the team's logo is on his chest, he has to give his all.
And by God, the responsible parties have not been remiss in their attention to the players, especially the young ones. They teach them professionalism from a young age.
Eating, sleeping,
Tell me about your experience, you have played in many different age stages. How was your experience and where is the most important one for you?
"And by God, it was of course."
I was included in the stages of the youth team to the first team.
You know camps with clubs, with the team, with the national team.
Each stage has its own special character.
Yes, Lana, Allah willing, that's how you've been transitioning from...
We're used to you now, because you're our sports partner.
We always see you like this, athletic. We love to get information from you and know the sports news through Lana. So, what's the latest in sports with you?
In all honesty, I don't watch much of the variety shows. In variety shows, we used to host celebrities in their respective fields, and we also host celebrities in sports.
Like Ali and others in their respective sports fields.
On the contrary, physical activity.
What do you mean that we used to be the capital of sports?
Qatar, and now let's become the capital of global sports and football.
Instead of just presenting variety shows, you could offer social, economic, and cultural programs.
You have different fields, you have airplane hatred, different basketball tournaments.
But after that, sports.
Excellent sweet
I wished for a conflict.
I wish I were twenty-five years old instead of twenty.
In the future, young players will have opportunities and great opportunities.
And they seize it, meaning as they say with their hands and
It's sweet of you, hopefully the words I want to address to the players are...
Of course, the translation of the given text into English is: "Hopefully, there will be young beginners who will have a bright future ahead, God willing, in the coming days."
Of course, I told them this is an opportunity and they must, that is, take advantage of it.
This means "These opportunities have come on a silver platter, they say."
They must make maximum use of it.
What's new with you? How are you doing? What's the latest news about the programs you'll be presenting? I know we've been a bit lazy from the break.
Keep us updated on your news, God willing.
We are constantly in touch with the event, God willing, we will be prepared for the Asia Cup in one month's time.
We've just won the Gulf Cup, by the way. Congratulations to the Kuwaiti team.
Publishing news is also present, meaning with intuition, we are prepared to keep up with intuition.
Sure, here is the translation: "Of course, I am fundamental to the idea of a Qatari TV, meaning the first glimpse for viewers was through the Qatari screen."
He immediately denied this kindness to them completely.
And, God willing, they will convey the media message through various channels.
Whether they are private channels or sports channels or any other type of channel.
Thank you very much, Qatar TV.
We certainly wish you all the best and hope for your continuous success. We are still working on this topic.
First of all, I would like to thank the management of Al-Wakra Club for and
The fans of the Al-Wakra Club believe that...
My childhood and I in the village.
A sheikh was with us yesterday. Sheikh Nasser was with us.
From the club
I am the son of Al-Wukrah and the son of Al-Wukrah.
Just as I told you before, this is a professional program.
Each individual on the territory of Qatar
We already know that young people love sports and addiction, just like adults.
How can we make sports accessible to social integration?
Media awareness, first and foremost, means that media has a crucial role in promoting sports in various magazines. Let's talk about life.
You have the youth addicted to technology, but currently, sports are entering schools. Sports awareness has become part of the curriculum in schools.
When it comes to events, they celebrate any sporting occasion with special celebrations.
Having Qatari street means we see signs on the streets while walking, too. These are also considered a form of sports awareness.
The female element, for instance, taking specialized roles such as in the stands or anywhere else.
Hi, let's also promote women's awareness or let's create sports for women's participation in sports.
Later, regarding us, we now have a Qatar women's football team.
So imagine, thank God, sports are starting to expand.
And I also expect, because the time period
To work on many projects and increase awareness significantly about the topic of sports, and I expect this to be a sufficient period.
If studied correctly and done properly
It is enough and with the same intention that we need to exploit it properly, just like the other.
Later, in my position, I intended to exploit the fact that younger generations can also take advantage of the national team.
It means capabilities, experiences, devices, everything is available.
It's also significant in his work that, thank God, in Qatar, this is something well-known in Gulf and Arab societies. They greatly love sports.
How can I attract this audience to continuously follow sports news and matches taking place in Qatar?
And the attendees at the same time.
But you know, most Qataris love sports, especially football. The problem is with attendance.
If you enter forums, you'll find that there's a lot of interest, especially in forums of some clubs or most clubs.
Great interest in football in the league.
As a player, as a Qatari citizen, what solution do you feel could attract you to participate, not as a sports figure, not as a player?
How can I watch football matches with my friends and peers?
It depends on the individual, not as a general thought or something.
Some of them like to watch it on TV or maybe in gatherings.
For example, Japan has made a big plan to attract a large audience to attend.
When I watch the matches, I collect points, I don't know what it means, they are now looking for solutions, hopefully.
The Arabic
The most important point is that every player will hopefully be present in Qatar, especially in the 2022 file. What do you expect we need?
Beyond material support, what do you think is the most important thing we really need?
And provide the means that can be prepared for the generation to truly deserve the name of the Qatari selection and participate in the largest World Cup.
Time is what he told me, now it seems to be ending. In my mind, I keep asking, "When?" By God, time flies when you're with the beautiful ones.
We dreamt the impossible, and made the dream that we thought impossible a reality. Thank God, we are living it now on solid ground.
Just like Sheikh Mohammed said, these are moments of celebration, but the work has begun.
God willing, the year 2022 will be an event that does justice to Qatar's name.
I congratulate every person on the Qatari land and say frankly that Qatar is now one of the world's landmarks.
Hosting two thousand and twenty-two
And thank you to the elegant media person, Lana Al-Adi, we wish you all the success, God willing, and we will always follow you so that we can benefit from sports.
Thank you very much, surely the joy is in the eyes of the Emir.
Qatari young talents
And they keep singing a new version of songs that have emerged during this period.
But in a form that casts a spell with the rapid music and rhythm of the Muses.
And also, his love for rap, God willing.
Be with us, our viewers, as our journey begins from this moment, and good morning.
We're trying to cast a certain look upon him.
In short, we can define rap as fast-paced singing music.
The performer executes it with a tremolo, not a fast rhythmic singing of the song's lyrics.
Comprising a large number of rhymes, it addresses various topics and issues.
And which may be personal sometimes.
A political emotional meeting.
And it is often controversial.
and largely liberated
And the rap performer, our viewers, does not sing the song's lyrics.
He merely repeats it.
And the tone of his voice is a secondary factor.
In rap music, voice isn't generally important.
And for this reason, he is not called a singer but a rap performer or rapper.
And the rapper pays attention to the following racism in songs.
For example, flow as a flow of beats, synchronization, for example, or casting.
"The sorrow follows them, their audience, their lovers."
They have a specific rap style.
And expect them to give you a more comprehensive and broader idea than I personally can.
Good morning, welcome.
And by God, the first thing means that we used to love doing something new.
We excel in something.
Why shouldn't we sing rap, after all?
Later, rap is an art form that exists in every country in the world.
Why isn't it available in the app?
So we said, "Well, we'll invent something new."
It means giving him an idea of it in a message.
In it, I talk about the positives and negatives that happen in our society.
It means that we send a message first, second, it means that it's a shroud.
This is a form of art among various others. Interestingly, this knowledge might significantly address many social and psychological issues faced by youth.
I expect every time that it will change, and with the passage of time, I expect.
And by God, it was a little more difficult than expected.
We sing from 2020, almost the beginning was a bit weak.
In saying that we are at a new beginning for ourselves in the year 2010.
In ignorance and popularity even more.
She likes to try and sing and rap in the same style during this period, I noticed this.
It's definitely a big part of who I am after all these years.
Also in his work, we need to talk about this, you have made so many divisions.
"It's a beautiful band, you've had so many concerts. We can talk about this band."
How was it founded? How did the idea come about that one can actually make a difference? And how many of you are there in this field?
And Allah, in the beginning, we mean before the band was established.
Rap arrived in Doha, meaning it started in 2005.
It means that everyone loves the idea of rap, that he sings rap, he was singing and posting on the website.
I'm downloading Salman, فلان is downloading, and so on, until there's a competition.
And we got to know people.
In Arabic: "ف يعني صرنا انافس بعضنا" translates to "So we became competitors."
After a while, after a long time, we've finally reached 2020.
In 2010, there was a group system, so this is a group on its own, meaning every three or four are together.
So, we decided, why not? Why not unite as one group called "Rappers Team"?
Or as it is translated into English: "Or as the lazy ones say, rap artists."
So we agreed on this, finally, meaning we said that with one name, we are all one hand working together.
And when we "come out," it's like we're acting and representing this thing, and we're saying that this idea itself is...
Almost twenty-five units
Twenty-five "واوs" - what a great collection, God willing.
Well, someone does play or whatever, everyone performs rap songs.
He is the one who coordinates and he is the one who composes.
Can you say something personal?
How are the numbers arranged in groups? The arrangement of the twenty-five is excellent.
It means that each one has their own capabilities.
It means that every member of the band can do a complete song.
Without relying on anyone else
But skills can vary, for example, if Salman is better than me.
He hears me say, "No, correct the words, they're not right."
Each one can adjust for the other.
Help a little.
Even for there to be a formal entity that sponsors these actions, or even a company that advocates them.
And there will be proper distributors in it.
It means that the work should look like this, with a high-end, sophisticated style, and indeed be something formal.
And honestly, we really wish for support, you know? We wish for help that will actually reach us, like when a company like Tina says, "Alright, we're going to produce an album for you."
We don't have any problem, that means.
Some things are hard to do.
So why not think that the first initiative should come from you?
Even just one person getting to know the first CD
That way, you can later attract partners like you want.
Around the year 2007, I almost finished a CD.
And Allah has distributed it among the youth.
How was the turnout?
And by God
The text translates to: "It's a new era, it's 2007, perhaps I'm the new rap king, it's not possible to stop now in the Gulf."
But I'm not as strong now
So we were preparing to sulk, not to even find out about the news, meaning for example you hear a large group of young people between Valencia and Castellón, for instance.
Let's talk about it.
They told us that we're organizing a party for you.
And it means covering all the costs and all the procedures, and coordination meant work, honestly, we didn't expect it to be at this level.
It really surprised us and it was amazing work.
And simply, there was a bit of pressure, meaning there were no ads, nothing, just the party.
What was in the ads, what was in something, means before the party two days ago.
So we said, meaning no one invited us, so there's a party in two days before the announcement that no one invited us.
So, while we're here, that means before the party starts.
That means this is a point in our favor.
"If we are successful, it means our voices reach families, not just the youth."
Our view is that we expected this idea to be solely the youth's right.
At this stage, we've discovered that there's a category, or rather, several categories that hear us.
In a certain song, there was a great interaction with the audience and with the band.
Or most of the songs had interaction.
It's not a stranger that most of the songs, but simply because there were so many songs and we were a large group.
Means that the group is more or less the whole group.
What are the words to treat different issues?
We're talking about the situation we're in, but this is just a brief overview.
Bake at least even if it's just a little.
Even if they spoke before, it wouldn't be me.
You need to generate random sentences.
If it means, it means the rhyme comes out.
It means that if we think critically about it, writing these words, these phrases, is better.
Okay, so we have a song like this, let's take a look at it.
One of the songs that you made.
And we continue to follow it and also see the public opinion on this issue.
And hopefully, they too enjoy such words.
Thank you for liking the introduction because it includes the name of my program.
With you is DJ KiD and DJ Mr. Bobo on the Doha Morning show.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Mr. Bobo and his SKT1 hot to be.
And don't forget, the program airs at 9:30 AM, so everyone should be sitting in front of the TV.
With us in numbers, Hassan Neama is with us in presentation, Shima Al-Hamadi.
With us in the end, Nasser Al-Maliki, guests of the episode, rappers from Qatar, for sure.
Because it does indeed contain the name Al-Bashir. Thank you, young men, may Allah reward you. I
I have to clap for you, and youth is on top in the control room.
It was recorded last night.
And who wrote the words in you or who?
Everyone writes their own words.
For if I came to write words for Joseph
He's not just writing these words, he's in love with singing, in love with the emotion.
You need to write about the 2022 World Cup and the Asia Cup, right? It's possible that you can participate, or is that not the case?
We are definitely talking about ourselves, that means we are surely going to release a song, so to speak, on this topic.
But it should be formal or a bit more serious, that means.
So it is necessary to have Qatari songs, songs about the homeland and love for the homeland.
Through the art of rap, it is indeed art.
Yes, I expect that today, everyone is waiting for...
We're seeing it live on air now.
And of course, this cup and its decorations adorned the streets of Doha.
If our viewers have seen Doha decorated to welcome the Asia Cup.
And all the relevant arrangements have been made to be received.
The crowd and the expected, it's certain there's a larger gathering than what we've seen.
Before starting, expect the length of the corniche from beginning to end.
Sure, here is the translation: "Undoubtedly, the importance lies in the reception of this significant sporting event."
In upcoming parties, Allah willing, I will continue to follow them in the coming days, Allah willing.
She said on one side, "We'll organize a party for you."
But as of now, things are a bit complicated.
The procedures, and this is for sure.
So, let's try to mean for example, "I saw Yusuf and I saw so-and-so."
I saw a few people I want to mention, I have a song topic I want to sing, and I saw all three.
The appropriate right for the song
The possibility that we can sing
To be sitting at home.
And then send him Joseph's rights via email on the net.
Here's the English translation: "You have this part of the song, Yusuf."
They also traveled abroad.
Entering this field has meant millions of fans for them.
We don't try to imitate, but when you hear someone, it means the best.
But he means a strong competitor with his style.
What prevents me from taking ideas from them and imitating them in things?
Just means reverse it, take the idea, change it, and apply it to my song. I'll shape it differently.
They created a special division and they have more than one CD in people M.
It's about a person named Abdullah Al-Daail.
He has experience and the ability to discover groundwater.
And it is in their ability to detect groundwater sources.
One of the residents of the city of Marrat
There are many experienced people.
To identify water sources before drilling wells
And he may need to dig many wells, but there is no water.
Using copper bars or branches of the pomegranate tree
He uses the date palm to locate water sources.
What tools does he use?
The well-driller discovered the underground water.
These are ancient.
But now they have been replaced by copper wires.
Now align the two rods parallel to each other.
We walk now at a leisurely pace, a light, unhurried step.
We watch as we pass by a stream of water.
Then the gates will open.
Now, right now, we are going through this right now, we are passing by a river.
I opened up like this now.
When we cross, it starts now.
This is right in the middle of the water flow.
And from here is the midpoint.
By this method, we can now determine the extent of the water flow or the water course beneath the earth's surface.
And of course, the process is repeated several times in several locations until we find the strongest site.
Abu Ibrahim affirms.
Reaching an advanced stage in this profession
To become as precise as his discoveries.
In its region, sometimes and outside sometimes in Shaqra, and in its harem, and in Ethiopia.
And more than 150 bears have been discovered.
The error rate was five out of a hundred, not exceeding five percent.
You need training, experience, and a gift from God Almighty.
Supering modern devices and labs.
In a record short time
Abdulrahman Al-Marshid
Doha Morning Program
The city is located several times north-west of the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
We continue this report and we promise, God willing, more reports from Arab and global countries.
And a Gulfie, God willing.
We've reached various locations and headlines with you, our viewers, but they all have a meaning.
The large and first title of the book is "وف" (a term that can mean "life" or "death" in Arabic, depending on context).
If I expect a large group of young Gulf people within the Gulf itself.
In certain individuals, you should look up to them.
However, it doesn't mean you should merely imitate them, but rather feel that it's necessary to follow their works first and foremost.
And indeed, they are the rappers of the Gulf in general, and there is a connection between them.
F means that I'm not competing with competitors. It means that I've released a song.
And speak about the topic.
It means "It means to create a competition as you say, with a goal."
We have a connection, but it's just with one specific person.
In Saudi Arabia, Qusai is doing so well, praise be to God.
He became famous, had a CD, and gained a following.
And he became like this, with more than one partner that one could adopt.
You wish you could reach this stage, and perhaps even surpass it, with Allah's will.
Inshallah, we wish you all the success, God willing, through this team.
Of course, we are present and welcoming this important sports cup, the Asia Cup. Let's take a look at the clips that are available on the corniche.
In addition to a group of Qatari youth
If you move, whether from the West but in a Gulf style.
Also, emotional songs, rap songs, and distinguished groups of twenty-five people.
It is necessary for one to follow your news first and foremost.
You will need to have an email, and it would be helpful to have a specific website or forum online.
How can one reach you?
And by God, we used to have a special place among us a while ago.
But if there are some problems with the company, the hosting company.
He meant sometimes to do it, sometimes he didn't know what to do.
So, we had problems with it, and in the end, we just closed it.
So, definitely, the site is closed, closed.
Okay, and now what's the alternative currently until this problem is solved, because as a team...
In the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, or even in Morocco or Egypt.
One needs to communicate with you, know your news, and check out the songs you produce from time to time.
What's the alternative now?
Currently, the alternative relies on private pages, for example.
What exactly is the name?
It is a deep-learning model based on the Transformer architecture, but implemented in Google.
The name "باسم راب قطر" or "رابرز قطر" translates to "Qatar Rap Name" or "Qatar Rappers" in English.
You make clip videos just for yourselves.
You worked on the program yesterday.
We've uploaded more than one video to YouTube.
Sing and record
Sing a song and keep the same format as a video, but film it from behind.
I expect that we'll have to see you develop further.
You need a quiet place, but each person should have their own device at home.
And the blender, the computer, the piano, and the guitar.
To be honest, God, I really hope we get some support.
For example, "شركة" means "company" in English.
We produce CDs for you.
Make a special place for you.
From within ourselves
But in the end, we're still talking about personal work.
We don't want this to be personal work.
By God, my words do not differ from Yusuf's words.
We need a music video clip.
The album's father
The power of dissemination through video clips is extremely important.
Because it conveys the information better.
If support is present, everything is present with it.
Your sweet voices reach everywhere.
It means one of the various arts that deals with problems and addresses issues.
Thank you to Youssef Al-Naimi and Salman Al-Abdullah for being with us.
And we see them and we wish them all the best, of course, in the name of our program Good for Youth.
These projects were indeed a success.
In the project, almost ready, but some technical development is still needed.
Expiration date Price
You have reached the cashier's right; you have the total, you have all the details, and it's ready.
And recognize the products instead of holding every detail and looking at the ingredients and their requirements.
He is walking on the trolley.
The icon is self-contained, allowing one to choose the material they desire with precision.
Of course, projects often reflect a child's perception of a problem.
He also has different activities and goals.
The center means, in its entirety of programs it designs and events it organizes, revolves around a main idea.
We have ten goals set by H.H. Sheikh Moza for establishing the center.
Possible, possible, too.
He goes straight down to the underground train, moving under the ground, from his house.
The main idea is that it's the clothes.
Show me all the stores in Qatar that have black T-shirts.
There is also the house key, the car key. I have a button I press.
Show me if I've lost the key, please.
Yes, we will return to the projects that you will carry out, God willing, through the cultural center.
Weakness in early childhood education
And developing his skills and fostering the talented.
We move between a set of children's skills, whether they are media-related or research-oriented.
If the personal skills in public speaking and convincing the audience are developed.
With the diversity of these skills, we should design a specific program to serve them.
We have begun signaling the future, and we have achieved a significant milestone in it. Now we have reached the graduation projects and their conclusion.
We also reached a large number of young child preachers.
And their creativity
You also have young announcers.
Returning to television means that they must necessarily present programs for children.
We're sitting, we're watching TV.
Through their television, Qatar TV.
Counting them now means we will be done with them in eighteen years.
Welcome to them wherever they are, yes.
This also means national TV.
Our need is to attract, recruit, and discover these talents and develop them.
From declarative to investigatory.
To special cases of thought
To reading into diverse many fields
In this, there is a collaboration between you, you take ideas from each other.
In every field, for example, the promising orator program with the Ministry of Awqaf.
Our exposure is also the exposure of generations.
The Scientific Club played a significant role in developing projects and also provided technical support for these projects.
The main role also for the Supreme Council of Education and their support for schools and their partnership.
Professor Abdullah, your transfer to Katara, this grand structure.
It also collects a large collection of great events and activities.
Does this push him forward towards the very center itself?
However, you take such a building separately.
Far from this grand structure.
They gave us a front-end to interact with the public more easily, which means:
And also pioneering projects are good.
In many cases, the reception of guests and introducing them to the nature of the cultural programs that are presented, which provide programs for children.
Because this has been our main project over the past three years.
It is the national project for the development of reading among children.
Under the patronage of Sheikhah Hesaa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
She adopted this project and provided it with great support.
And this is a major project, which is the development of reading skills and writing children's stories to develop their skills.
The different cultural aspects, particularly those related to reading.
Of course, the translation of the given Arabic text into English is: "There are of course many programs."
That means we recently moved.
And now, re-organizing some means re-arranging the activities.
Its design and development should be tailored to the nature of its visitors, meaning Katara.
We certainly wish you all the best, God willing, through this center.
The one that contains in its folds very important ideas.
Of course, the translation of the given text into English is: "Of course, the first thing is to thank you for this generous hospitality."
The most important thing is that as we interact with children more, we discover that our children are...
Today's children are not yesterday's children; their childhood is not our childhood.
They need us to give them more attention, focus, and time.
Give him enough attention to his care and imagination.
And I communicate with him intellectually.
They work, meaning their way of dealing with children is like a hotel that provides accommodation.
He is a bank that provides money.
He is missing a figure who listens to these ideas, who listens to this fantasy.
We have indeed been moved, in recent days, from one exhibition to another, to twenty or thirty.
Through this display
We wish success, God willing, for the projects that have won awards.
And thank you for joining us, Professor Abdullah Al-Jamili, director of the Cultural Center for Childhood. We wish you all the best, God willing.
Even if these projects are actually realized and exist in reality, they won't just be a dream.
Welcome to you, our viewers. On Monday evening, the Cultural Center for Childhood concluded at the Diplomatic Club.
Activities of the National Exhibition of Generations' Dreams under the slogan "Generations' Dreams, Facts of the Homeland of Tomorrow"
He organized it on the occasion of the country's national day with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar.
The fair witnessed our viewers diverse activities and various competitions.
Innovative projects for children
We are pleased, on your behalf, dear viewers, to host Professor Abdullah Al-Jamili, Director of the Cultural Center for Childhood. Welcome and good morning.
Good morning, God bless you, my dear sister.
I would like to thank you for taking the time for the center.
Talking about this distinctive spectacle is indeed true.
We are also delighted to have your participation through the program to cover as best as possible all the events that took place during this exhibition.
This is the national showcase of the dreams of generations.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Of course, this observer.
Contribution of the Cultural Center for Childhood
For the national day celebrations
And he had, of course, a very significant pause. He had a very important touch with every child.
With the aim of empowering children
I live with a dream.
And with the project
This project or dream
Children's dreams are vast.
Its scope is wide, we defined it within a frame which is 20-30.
And other key areas for seeing Qatar 23
We started by training children in four phases.
How do brainstorming mechanisms and the collective use of tools expand the child's thinking?
What do you mean by this sentence specifically?
They are the facts of the nation of tomorrow.
In other words, what our children dream of today.
This project keeps growing with this project.
So this was the truth, meaning this interpretation of this vision that children will start living from this day on.
I have a big dream.
Whether it's an environmental field or a field such as health and human development, or other areas.
Which serves the homeland's people
I expect that when we know there are children present at a certain place
He is at a certain angle
So is all this present through
The exhibition had distinguished guests.
Honor guests are those until children learn from them as role models.
The Arab fall yesterday, two or three weeks ago.
And there were also winners in various awards in the Arab world.
There was a table to display their projects.
Yes, and the pictures are certainly witnesses to your speech, Professor Abdullah.
This is a collection of images that were present in the exhibition and various events.
This is also the owner of the latest project, the owner of the forest.
Innovation or creativity
This is one of the children's innovations, praise be to God. It's a really beautiful idea that we can make more accessible to viewers.
And we tell it a little, what is this topic exactly, the colored ball.
Then approximately four or five projects spoke about this topic, one of them being the colored ball.
It is also a smart field.
This ball if you look at it outside the field.
Its color changes.
We've come this far, so I expect a lot more in future matches, God willing.
Okay, what does this mean after these dreams?
It also relates to a need meaning it concerns his interests.
And I expect, especially when there are responsible individuals, to take into account these small projects from small minds.
But we don't know if these projects will indeed serve us. Well, the president of the football federation here in Qatar...
What do we think of his colored ball?
Do you love the idea?
Certainly, the cost of his visit and standing behind the projects dedicated to football.
Road halt and these projects were adopted at that moment.
Too grand for display at the moment and these projects are adopted.
The audience also voted for a large group of projects submitted by our children.
And our friends, so what are the projects that we can say had significant spotlight and you all voted for?
Of course, here is the translation: "Obviously, we have a way of evaluation in a review committee, and they have a main evaluation method."
These are the projects that won the awards, first, second, and third.
It was from the forest and won the first prize.
He had very detailed information about the project, and the project was ready to start.
It means, of course, besides the administrative side, many administrative aspects are needed.
It went into many very detailed aspects and also distributed visitor brochures, meaning it was ready for its project.
These are definitely the pictures we're looking at.
This is a collection of yes, this is also a collection of many projects I participated in.
They might just be feeling that way, you know, not because they're important or anything, just that they're watching movies or cartoons.
No, it is not a fixed connection; it may be realized in part and adopted by institutions.
For example, we give project names like, "What are these projects?"
How can this surplus be utilized in the house? How is it spent and then recycled?
Forty-seven students
Qatar University celebrated yesterday the graduation of 247 students from the 33rd batch.
And His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al-Attiya, Minister of State for International Cooperation.
And a large number of parents and teaching staff.
The university today celebrates the graduation of 177 students.
Of course, we thank our colleague Salman Al-Majd and we will continue in the same artistic atmosphere. He will be with us today as a dear guest.
I am a fan of the series of classifications by artist Abdelhamid Al-Shershini.
And his presence was confirmed through many works, including the series "Hearts for Rent."
They struggled to prove themselves in the artistic field.
Especially since the field of art knows no flattery.
"مما يعني" translates to "which means" or "it means".
Welcome to you, and good morning. I love to greet the viewers.
On the contrary, the program is dimly lit, frankly speaking.
I'll take a look at a very simple aspect of one of your works and start a dialogue with you.
You laugh at me.
Take the fake cashmere and bring the original.
Go and get it.
The pashmina is present.
What is the best way to return the pashmina?
Damn it, she ground it in her stomach. Damn her father.
I am a member of a committee consisting of five members.
In the Supreme Committee of the Conference
I do not agree with you.
I have no objection.
If this is a quick clip, a simple paragraph from a series we will watch the second part.
We ask about your participation this year in Part Two.
Tell us a little about your roles in the show, where each episode is a different theme.
What is your contribution telling us?
Of course after (what)
That era has passed many times.
And Marrat is also famous for the Mountain.
Akmat, who has always been sung about by poets throughout time.
When history is a witness and endures in the memory of cities.
And it points to the antiquity of its past.
Which is seventy-one kilometers north of the capital, Riyadh.
It is said that his name is derived from 'Amr al-Qais al-Tamimi.
It excelled in its ruins, the sweetness of its water, and the freshness of its air.
Poets sang about it, were captivated by it, and its fame was linked to its famous mountain, known as Al-Muttah.
They say Ghadir is like a camel's hump.
Of course, a city that is ancient is a city with a long history.
And before the emergence of Islam.
There were old things whose history was unknown, like the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
The current situation we find ourselves in
The distinguished companion Khalid ibn al-Walid, may Allah be pleased with him, dug this well while passing through the Battle of the Ridda.
And it remains to this day.
"A sure promise is better than many promises."
If you see a quantity, you see multiplicities.
Of course, another legacy is also the Ghadir Khum.
The one who has been the source of sweet moments over the years.
Which was enough for the city for a whole year.
From the start of the rains until the next rainy season.
This monument is also still standing, with an unknown construction date.
There is also the bride over there.
Jabal Qamiat is one of the landmarks of the city of Ma'rat.
And this mountain has many proverbs, poems, and verses said about it.
Wherever he comes from all parts of the kingdom.
Its most prominent landmark is the Well of Al-Walid.
That is because he descended during the days of the Ridda wars and was heading to Yamama.
He encamped there and ordered men to dig this well.
Whose water is still being used for drinking and ablution.
Yaqub al-Hamawi (Jacob of Hamah), in his work Mu'ajam al-Buldan (Dictionary of Countries), mentions that Khalid passed through many places.
It is an old mud house that has been restored to its original state.
It contains several sections that highlight the architectural character of the region and its renowned heritage and landmarks.
The poet said, "When we reached the water, it was the water of our thirst."
The gathering of al-Ghadir is not like the gathering of the Evangelists.
Professor Ayman is also there, Allah be praised, there is a cooperation between the family, the guardian, and the authority with this center for the child as well.
And I expect different ways, maybe he will be with you from the start.
To manage the training operation in general
It means from the moment the intern, or student, or child arrives.
This file will contain the complete personal data.
Even his monthly grades will have a monthly fluctuation, that is, for example,
It means our home is a peaceful program.
Every four lectures, there will be a test.
Through a username, password, user name, and password, a parent can...
We give it to him so that he can enter.
Yes, it means the extent of his level, from the beginning of his enrollment at this center until the current day.
Yes, we have several different models that we will follow up on.
We have a small child.
With Professor Ibrahim, of course, he will honor us in a little while.
We're going to see so many different models, wish we had more space.
But we made a model of his child.
"راح يتم" translates to "will be done" in English. The full sentence would be: "راح يتم أكثر من اختبار أمامكم على الهواء مباشرة," which translates to "More than one test will be conducted live in front of you."
We ask her questions in mathematics and various other questions.
We'll take a short break and then we'll be back with you, after which we'll see this clever little girl. Stay with us.
The administration of the public's perception of artists has become intelligent nowadays.
Any action that is too intense from the first two or three sentences, the work has not been done, but the remote control is ready.
He won't bother himself with twenty thousand other series.
Correct, twenty thousand series are valid.
"سلسل السنه" means "a structured year" in English, and the second part of the sentence translates to "and some people don't focus on just one thing."
If he completes the second tasks, he will be able to see them.
The correct translation of "صح ماهو ما ظ" from Arabic to English is: "Is it really what it seems?"
He says I only watch TV during Ramadan.
Of course, we welcome you as a dear guest, Abdul Aziz Al-Sharshani.
I love to address a word to my viewers, to my audience, of course, those who love you. I am definitely part of your audience.
We address this word to you.
I tell them, "Wishing you a happy new year."
It's true that we may not always succeed, but we don't fail often either. We don't always represent ourselves well, but that's up to you, of course. I've mentioned the reasons before.
The coming is better.
Inshallah, we wish you success in works that are the Sunnah.
Inshallah, we will have another meeting where we can talk about these plays.
It's all connected to each other.
Now fashion shows seem to be gaining popularity among many, and fashion enthusiasts are eagerly awaiting new designs.
We welcome you, our dear viewers, through the Doha morning and we are with you through the air.
Today, we are definitely discussing the Skills Development Center and a group of students (both male and female) who have enrolled in this center.
This center offers a wide range of various scientific disciplines.
Their focus is definitely on developing various capabilities.
And also operate their minds at 100% if God wills.
Of course, the translation of the given text in English is: "Professor, his name is Ayman Khoujel, he is the executive director of the Skills Development Center."
Hello and good morning
God bless you.
And with us, the beautiful wish, the wish for good morning.
Good morning
How old are you, my love?
The given text "سفن قرايد سفن" appears to be in Persian (Farsi) and translates to "Cruise ships are ships" in English.
God willing, we wish you all the success.
What are the things you provide for our sons and daughters?
It was clarified with Professor Ayman and Mrs. Nasma, and it was specifically designed as a program beneficial to our children.
And it is a program of minds for mental mathematics.
Through clickers and through abax
To achieve some specific goals, we tried to simplify a part of them.
I felt, Professor Ibrahim, that there was indeed a difference. The student, when they first enter, in the first two days,
And after spending months with you, perhaps three or four months.
If he studies in public, private, or even independent schools.
In principle, the program works scientifically through certain methods.
After completing the first level of the program
The one who clarifies where the abilities the child has lost or needs to develop are located, gets them there.
And he has reached a certain level or what developments have occurred with the child.
So we're following a scientific approach with a science program.
It's not just some methods or mechanisms that are applied as usual.
In a scientific and organized manner.
Before the program starts and after completing this course or the levels it has gone through.
Professor Ibrahim is with us as you can see from our viewers. He is addressing the female students who have joined this center.
We wanted this thing to happen today on the air so that we can show our viewers the importance of this matter.
I have no problem with going back to the past.
If this is a quick clip, it's a simple paragraph from a series we will watch the second part of.
But since we've seen this clip from the classification series of part one
Tell us a little about your roles in the show, where each episode is a different theme.
The focus of the year is that he will go.
The translation of "غافل فاظل" is "Careless and foolish".
The one who encourages while sitting and provides opportunities.
The 18th chapter is classified under book 2.
Of course, the translation of the given text into English is: "Naturally, the ring's manager comes out, the ring's elder comes out, the ring's baker comes out."
It means diverse languages.
Professor Ganem Al-Sulti from Qatar
We have artists from Qatar.
Many artists don't ban me now, of course we have female artists from Bahrain, such as Zohra Arafat, Abtsam Abdullah.
We have
Faisal Rashid and Mohammed Adel
Of course, Tara.
"Means, if it weren't for Tara, the youth wouldn't have participated."
The least amount of work we've been doing is in Qatar, about two jobs per year.
Qatar TV also produces dramatic works, just as we can do.
A Smart TV provides an output product.
The Qatari TV hasn't been short, of course, but it only produces one show a year, and all Qatari actors want to work on it.
And this was the reason.
I heard that one series and all the artists in Qatar want to work on it.
Even if someone experiences a frightening situation, they would say, "Alhamdulillah" (Praise be to God).
Praise be to God in all circumstances.
Alright, let's go back to your beginnings then.
Of course, the translation of "اوجه له شكر اكبير طبعا" into English is: "I express him a great thank you."
Consult him about several things.
Of course, artist Abdul Aziz Jasim has moved from the judgment of humans to another day, to the aftermath of dispersion, to yes or no.
In his plays, we used to work with him on a theater production. It was the first time that a live production was executed by Abdul Aziz Jassem. We worked with him both in theater and television.
He is the one who nurtured us, he is the one who taught us, and he is the one who made us.
Of course, after Professor Ganem finished his talk about the world, he didn't hesitate to help Fayez, who is blind.
Because honesty gives us opportunities as young people.
They have between thirty and thirty-two projects per year.
We have two jobs a year, so thank you, thank you, Tara.
A choking feeling, of course, the same thing as Tara's production for artistic production.
The series director is Professor Monir al-Z.
We return to our viewers, and today's topic is reflexology in medicine.
Hand massage using the palm of the hand
This is a treatment that has actually been practiced since ancient times.
We have a guest with us.
The examination method is as follows.
Painful swelling
You feel inside the hand, sometimes it feels like sand, like the broken veins inside the hand.
Rest your hand
Of course, our friend has a bit of nervous energy.
You feel pressure, you've reached your stress limit, a bit.
The left side
Of course, here is the translation: "Naturally, we are now, dear viewers, examining the left side of his body."
So that they are in the picture.
Any health issue becomes apparent when we recognize the headache, we know the dizziness that comes with it.
There's a pain here.
The phrase "الم يعني مشكله" translates to "The problem is significant."
What's the problem? The problem is exactly here.
Here, the pockets are in the ear.
Do you have an operation in your nasal cavities or a problem before?
He tried, but it's too late.
What's the point or purpose?
He gains weight without eating.
Okay, your left shoulder.
This is from the nerves when you tell him to calm down.
Ten years ago, I walked barefoot on the sea.
Well, we know that when one walks by the sea, they expect to feel relaxed.
Unequal grounds are not only the sea.
Negative energies can affect us.
He might also be surprised that you discovered these things through massage.
Sure, here is the translation: "Children are definitely the most important people."
Children, praise be to God, come to their mother. Pay attention to me.
Tired of milk and food and the nutrition it provides.
She met her child and put him to bed automatically.
Sugar your hands
Simple pressure, praise be to God.
After a few seconds, you'll notice the child relaxes. The first thing they do when they feel a pain is to tell you a little about it.
Suddenly, by the grace of God, you see gases emerging.
What discoveries have you made, Professor Abdulaziz?
But less than the second set of problems, now I have joint and bone pain, headaches, thyroid issues, and obesity.
Second, regarding menstrual cramps or pain during the menstrual cycle or period pain in general.
Focus on a rock or your stones, or just by pressing here, you give commands, "Praise be to God," to your lower back and menstrual cycle problems if it's within you.
In a matter of seconds, God willing, it will disappear.
Pregnant woman
It makes childbirth easier for her.
But here or there, of course, or God knows.
If they tell her, by God, you are either in the seventh month of pregnancy or in the ninth.
But on the sand
It means "Walking on sand is no problem, but on rocks, no."
Seven dates daily, a nourishing meal.
And if a date palm tree bears fruit, it will be enough, Allah willing.
As Allah said, "I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed devil," and I discovered this from the Quran, of course.
God means that He is unable to make this ripe date come to her, despite His power.
"All praise is due to Allah, and I seek refuge in God from the word 'I'."
The rock answers, it gives a small core.
The birth bed is weak, for example, she fell on the birth bed and grabbed the metal.
"Notice that even in private hospitals, an East Asian woman comes."
Now, hopefully, this is actually a common practice in East Asia.
Our mobile phone is not needed here.
Just the mobile phone
Cooperating with some means that everyone, I give advice to every creature that hears me now.
Be diligent in charity and be mindful of others, for you were created for the service of God's creatures.
To serve people, that's first. Second, I'm not a religious figure or a sheikh; I'm just an ordinary person.
"Assalamu alaikum, Professor Abdul Aziz, I thank you for this pleasant meeting. Of course, thank our guest who is with us."
Thank you very much, God willing and good luck.
He will talk to us in detail, Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of the Public Health Department at the Supreme Council of Health.
Good morning, Sheikh.
Let's directly take a look at these events.
The truth is a program of healthy steps towards Qatar.
It means: "It is a program that is one part of the national strategy to address obesity."
It means four out of the ten countries in the world with the highest rates of obesity are Gulf countries.
So we started in the Supreme Health Council a strategy, of course in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and Training and other entities, to combat obesity.
Fearing its further spread, soon it will be everywhere.
One of the programs to protect against obesity is healthy steps towards a smaller waistline.
They should work on this competition together to make it an international one.
Of course, the program is a six-week course.
Every week is different from the next week.
To raise awareness among 7th and 8th-grade students about the importance of health at this age.
Because it's the first time they show concern, meaning they're becoming aware of themselves.
As you remember, the first week was about what's your favorite fruit.
Second week, walking.
"لازم تمشي" means "Of course, every time one walks, they earn points."
It's a map of Qatar, and every time someone collects points, they take a step forward in their school and class, meaning they progress.
There will be a sweet competition among the students.
In the third week, he doesn't drink the water he likes, he drinks carbonated water.
We can say he's gotten into the habit of drinking soda water instead of regular water. He doesn't need to drink lots of carbonated water every time he's thirsty; he just grabs a soda. I don't drink water.
Later, during the fourth week, we have your favorite sport.
Some people enjoy playing games at school.
So we're looking for sports equipment he loves to play with.
To force him to mean, means to practice sports.
The boy is eating a healthy meal.
And his family knows that he needs to pay attention to his son so that he eats a healthy meal.
And the Island Academy is an academy for boys and girls so we can learn.
Of course, this is an example of its success, God willing, we will increase the experience in the coming years.
Of course, the students are excited. I don't know how to describe their feelings, but they say our activity is more engaging.
The more games we play, the more we enjoy with our colleagues.
The girls will tell you our skin has improved, the acne has lessened.
Exactly right, it becomes conscious.
Fathers know their children.
And their colleagues in the second rows, they ask, "How are you?," learn from them, and their colleagues and brothers.
And thanks to God, many schools are already excited to participate next year, of course, starting now.
Inshallah
Of course, the official sponsor was Qatel in supporting this.
We had an Aspire Zone that organized sports competitions for students and awareness.
"عل عل عل على طاوله الطعام" translates to "Clap, clap, clap on the dining table" in English.
In the name of God, there are several points, some of which I have mentioned, and perhaps some others have escaped me.
But thank God, everyone contributed a part of what they had.
Some of the brothers used to hold competitions on Saturdays.
There was diversity in it.
We tried to make several types and include as many people as possible.
He is the future generation, that means
Until we popularize this experience or spread it as widely as possible in the country.
"So, this is the first time you're noticing some issues that need to be adjusted."
After its spread, thank God, now and the satisfactory results.
Inshallah, we will publish it because there are people now demanding, saying, "Why didn't you include us?"
Ending up eating healthy food will get you to this thing, you won't have any problems.
We tend to achieve what we desire by the time we're twenty or twenty-five, if not sooner, when we're young.
You mentioned a set of titles for each week, with a title for each week.
If we go back, we will try to make today's segment about the conclusion of the events.
And also, if we look back at our program, we had more than one guest.
We go back, review, and go back every week. What was the information we wanted to reach the students with?
Inshallah, my sister, of course, for example, the first week, the favorite fruit.
Of course, fruits as a whole, what are their benefits?
What are the benefits of fruits that contain Vitamin C?
He's starting to figure out what fruits he likes, not all fruits are his enemies, that means.
It means he can be allergic to one or two types, but why doesn't he eat the rest?
The second week, people think that walking is only for young disabled individuals, why do they walk?
It means that when I grow up, I will walk.
On the contrary, you walk because it calms the mind and the brain.
And when a person relaxes his mind, it means clarity of thought improves, meaning
You were making them walk to the students.
Not all of them are required to walk, whether it's at school or at home.
They record their points through their grade schools.
Because it's not every day that they mean it.
This was an event where people organized a march for the girls' school.
We want them to be creative, to have innovative ideas.
The spirit of competition and teachers presenting new ideas, we don't want to give them ideas, they won't stay within them.
Each one had their own skills in this area.
Of course, during the third week, I drink water naturally throughout the day. We try to drink water to avoid dehydration and the desire for carbonated water.
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite sport.
If we can reach his favorite sport and support him in it.
He is passionate about sports.
Their love for sports is such that they play them without even realizing it.
Since we've mentioned it, let's talk about the Qatari Association for Multiple Sclerosis Patients.
Let me welcome our guest for today's episode and the light that shines in our studio.
Welcome to you.
Welcome to our program.
And from it comes this disease, perhaps to many of us we have never heard of.
As they say in Egypt, "Straight to the point."
Is it a chronic disease?
It affects the nervous system in the human body.
It affects individuals between the ages of 20 to 40.
This disease also has no cure as of yet, and the cause is still unknown for this disease and for his condition.
The active segment of society, which is usually the youth segment, is affected.
Cancer patients' treatments keep evil away and other diseases.
This disease is characterized by inflammation of the brain and spinal nerves.
And it is the central nervous system in the human body.
The body prefers there is a nearby body near it.
A neuron is a cell that
The text you provided appears to be in Arabic and translates to English as: "The one that covers this electric wire."
White blood cells, or leukocytes, are the first to kill or dissolve this protective layer.
Which leads to the failure, weakness, or disruption of the neural signal.
It leads to paralysis, far away from you.
Despite the advancements in medicine and medical science, Professor Abdulaziz states that until now, we have not found a cure for this disease.
Well, if the solution is not available, we need to understand how we can get it, in other words.
One also needs to be protective about this issue.
The direct cause means the nature of life, the nature of food, selections in life.
And what exactly is the direct cause that allows a person to contract this disease?
Everything that exists now is theories.
Even by virtue of marriage
They are trying to solve the health problems that humans face.
Yes, yes
"It means that all these topics might somewhat stir up controversy in society."
We still don't know its causes.
The age group that is most susceptible to this disease, of course, is the neurological hardening of the nerves.
Both sexes
Of course, the disease after reaching forty years of age begins to subside with the person.
But so far, we haven't found a solution for this disease.
Does this mean there is evidence of many people, whether they are in the Gulf, the Arab world, or even just in Qatar?
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, statistics show that they have twenty-five thousand (25,000) victims.
And likewise, Qatar means
Personally, I have been made aware of three to four very recent cases diagnosed last week alone.
Currently, we have twenty-five (25) victims. This is recorded in the files.
And there are many people when they are diagnosed with this disease, they go to other countries for treatments, for example.
Well, Professor Abdul Aziz, so are there any remnants or, for example, signs that a person has been affected by this disease?
Are there any signs that would indicate to those close to this person or to him personally that I am suffering from multiple sclerosis?
And this virus seemed to be ending
Let's be honest, it's not a virus.
Because it is a nerve disease, nerves control the whole body.
Let's move on a bit and give a specific reason for a particular place. It's just the nature of food, it's just the nature of things.
Please provide the text you would like translated into English.
