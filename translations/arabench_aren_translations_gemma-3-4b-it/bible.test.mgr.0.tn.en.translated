Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? (Mark 9:33-37; Luke 9:46-48)
At this time, the students came to Jesus and said, “Who is the greatest one in the kingdom of heaven?”
Jesus called a little boy and they stood in the middle.
He said, “Verily, I tell you: if you follow as young children, you will never enter the kingdom of the heavens.”
Anyone who is humble and turns to this little boy as he is the greatest one in the kingdom of heavens.
Anyone who accepts a little boy, how does he dare to disregard my name?
But whatever might be a stumbling block for one of these young men who promise me good, even if it concerns a large room of a ship and is thrown into the heart of the sea in his neck.
Woe to the world and the things that make people commit sins! Indeed, those things must come, woe to the human who brings those things that make people commit sins!
And if your hand or your leg makes you commit sins, cut them off and throw them away far away. If you enter life eternal with your leg cut off or you have any defect, it will be of no good to you when you enter the fire forever, and your hands or your legs will be complete.
And if your eye causes you to commit sins, pluck it out and cast it away afar. If you enter into life by one eye only, better for you that the eye be cast away, lest both of you be cast into hell. The Lost One (Luke 15:3-7)
Respond with your hands, don't underestimate anyone who is a little different. Your message: They are the angels, their possessions are always seen in my face in the sky.
# 18:11 There are old texts containing this verse: I am the son of man who has come to pay the guilty ones.
What's your opinion? If a man has sweet water and one of them is lost, shouldn't he go up to the ninety-nine in the mountain and look for the lost sweet water?
We convey the truth, if he receives it, then he will rejoice in it more than the ninety-nine who lost it.
“The Lord showed me visions of what will be in the heavens, he does not desire that one be born of this kind, it will be destroyed.” (Luke 17:3)
If your brother makes a mistake against you, walk away and point out the mistake to him directly, and if he listens to your words, you have won over your brother.
But if he didn't listen to your words, and one or two others were with him, so that every word spoken would have two or three witnesses testifying to it.
If they don't want to hear their words, tell the church, and if they don't want to hear the church's words, consider him as someone who is not a believer or a follower.
Connecting you to justice: Whatever you tie down on earth, it will be tied up in the sky; whatever you make in the earth, it will be made in the sky.
Let me repeat: If any of you agree on anything you want to have done on earth, I will tell the one in the sky to do it for you.
Where do they gather, two or three in my name, I’ll be in the middle of them. Like the comedian who doesn’t forgive.
This time, Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, how many times should I forgive my brother who sins against me? Should we forgive him seven times?”
They said to Jesus: “You don’t tell us seven times, but you tell us seven times seven times.”
That is why the Kingdom of the Heavens resembles a king of love, accounting for the blessed servants.
He started to audit them, and they brought him someone asking for money without an account.
As he was paying off his debts, Mr. Sido had to sell everything he owned – himself, his wife, and his children – to pay off his debts.
Man, the servant fell on Rakibo and said, "My lord, my lord, be patient with me and we will finish everything for you!"
And he found Sido and Sebio and forgive on the religion.
But that servant went out and found another servant asking him for a little money, and he nearly choked and said, "Finish with him about the money he's asking you for!"
Man, the other servant tripped over Rakibo and started to say, "Be patient with me, we'll finish you off."
He didn't love her, and they took him to prison until his debt was paid.
They illuminated the deeds of other servants, what happened, they worried a lot, they went around and told their master that they were hit.
This time was terrible, they said: "O slave, O evil one! I forgive you in this world, for you have disgraced me."
"And you have no right to pity the servant, your friend, the way I pitied you?"
And Sido gets it, and hand over the responsible person to prison until the debt is paid off completely.
“So, Dad went up to heaven so that he could work with each of you if you didn't forgive your brother from the depths of your heart.”
Marriage and Divorce (Mark 10:1-12)
Jesus began to speak, saying, "This was fulfilled in the prophet Isaiah," and then he departed from the region of Galilee and went into the region of Judea across the Jordan.
And many people followed him, and they didn't understand the ones who had gone before.
And the Pharisees said to Him, “Is it permitted for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”
She replied, "Honestly, I didn't read it. The One who created them in the beginning created them female and male."
# Tag ‏1:‏27; ‏2:‏24; AFP ‏5:‏31; I Co ‏6:‏16 And he said, “Why does a person make his wife a slave and his brother servants and binds his own daughters to himself with ropes?”
Imala houma ma 'adush thnin, amma baddan wahad. Hadaka 'alaash elli yjamma'u Allah ma yfarouch el-insan.
The Pharisees said, “Why did Moses command that a man write a divorce certificate for his wife and then not release her from his marriage?”
Jesus said to them, “Moses allowed you to put your relatives before your heads, like slaves. But this need wasn't like that in the beginning.”
And Ana, I tell you: whoever divorces his wife for a reason other than adultery and marries another woman is still committing adultery.
The students said: "If this is how a man is with his wife, then he should be good if he doesn't marry."
But he said to them, “Not everyone accepts this word, but those whom God wills to accept it.”
There are some who cannot marry because they were born of their mother’s belly, and there are some to whom people have done harm, and they are not able to marry; and there are some who do not want to marry because of the kingdom of heaven. Let whoever can do this deed, do it. Jesus blessed the children (Mark 10:13-16; Luke 18:15-17).
They gave Jesus small children so that he could put his hands on them and bless them. The disciples were ashamed of the people who brought them.
But Jesus said, “Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to the meek.”
He put a hand on them and walked away from that place. The rich young man (Mark 10:17-31; Luke 18:18-30).
And one said, "Oh teacher, what are the things that we need to do in order to take eternal life?"
They said to Jesus, “Why do you ask about things that are expensive? Is there only one that is good? If you want to enter into eternal life, keep the commandments.”
They are the commandments? Jesus said, “You shall not kill, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear witness against your neighbor falsely.”
# 19:18 Cherish your father and mother, and you should love your neighbor as you love yourself.
They said the boy: "We do everything with these things, what's still missing from me?"
They said to Jesus: “If you want to inherit eternal life, sell all you have, give to the poor, and follow me!”
The boy had seen this thing; he walked with sadness in his heart, wishing he had many things.
And Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I tell you, it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven!”
And we repeat once more: It is easier for a needle's eye to enter than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
The students heard this word, they were very surprised and said, "Who can finish it?"
But Jesus said to them, “With man it is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”
Peter replied: "We left everything and followed you, what do we take?"
Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, a time is coming when you will not see me, but you will see the Father. And I in the Father. And to the Father you will go and come. Truly I tell you, whoever surrenders his life for me will find it back, and whoever refuses to surrender his life will lose it. For I must be crucified, just as it is written. But if I die, I will live again, and whoever lives by me will live again; this is the work of God that may believe in me.”
Anyone who has not left his father or brothers or sisters, nor his wife or children, nor any of his relatives – except for me, who takes me as his own, to drink from my water as he drank from his own, and to inherit the eternal life.
And many people come in the beginning in order to flourish in the end, and the people who are in the end come in the beginning.
Like the Khadama, a delight of his grape wine.
A path to the kingdom of the heavens, like the house of the early morning dawn master placing workers in his vineyard of grapes, his merchandise.
And agreed with the workers on a silver entertainment room during the day and sending a bunch of grapes.
He left with the nine, you know, and saw other people standing in the market and he stopped.
He said to them, "You came for grapes, go, speak Arabic, and we will give you what you deserve, you went!"
He went out again, approximating the noon, and distancing himself from the three evening hours, and did the same thing.
He left with the five vendors of the evening market, and he found other people sitting there, and he asked them: "What's going on? Why are you sitting here all day when everyone is out?"
They said: "Not even one of you can refuse us so we can work." They replied: "You guys went and worked in the wine press."
As the dusk approached, Mulla al-ʿInb said to the one engrossed in the servants: “Call the servants and dismiss them, and proceed with the [other] ones until you reach the Wali.”
The group that started serving with the Five of Evening, and each one took a silver key.
Wotley Jaw the followers, he walked in their minds about what they were going to take more than the others, as each one of them took the bait of silver.
Wotley howma ykhallasu tagshshu ‘ala mulla al-ʿinab.
They said, "The Iranians, these two, served for one hour, and you took them in as if you had served them all day in the kitchen!"
But his answer was one: "My friend, I didn't wrong you. Didn't we agree on the generosity of Fida?"
Put on your helmet and walk. I liked to give this other guy the way I didn't give you.
Man, I don't have the right to spend my money however I want? Or are you jealous that I'm generous with you?
And Jesus said, “Truly I tell you, the sons of thunder will say, ‘We have heard it ourselves.’ Yet they did not go to him. But go you to the city, and you will find him in the temple, sitting the leaders of the Jews.” Jesus spoke again this third time, concerning his death and resurrection (Mark 10:32-34; Luke 18:31-34).
And Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, when the Asshenan, a disciple, leaned to one side and said to them on the way:
Hana is going to Jerusalem, and Ana, son of man, will present me to the heads of the priests and scribes of the Jews, and they will judge me to die.
And they will hand me over to other peoples, so that they will mock me and beat me with the whip and crucify me, and on the third day we will do it. The thing that Rebekah asked and John (Mark 10:35-45).
And then she came with her mother, and with her daughters, and she knelt before him and asked him for something.
And Jesus said to her, “What do you want?” She said to him, “I command my two daughters to sit here, one on your right and the other on your left in your kingdom.”
But Jesus answered and said, “You do not know what you are asking for. Why do you want me to drink the cup that the Father has given me?” They said, “You do not know what the Father does.”
They said, “You must drink my cup, but as for me, I am the one who decides who sits to my right and to my left, but my brother is the one I brought to this place.”
And when Wutley heard about the ten students of the others doing that, they hooked up with the two brothers.
But Jesus told them, “You know that the rulers of the people control them, and they have authority over them.”
But you must not have that thing between you. And whoever wants to be great among you, let him be a servant to the others.
Wali loves Yoli Loulou, let him be a slave to everyone.
Even I, son of man, did not come to be served by people, but to serve them and to give my life as a redemption for them. Jesus heals two blind men (Mark 10:46-52; Luke 18:35-43).
When Jesus and his disciples left Jericho, a large crowd followed them.
And there were two blind men sitting by the roadside who heard Jesus passing by, and they began to shout: “O Lord, O son of David, have mercy on us!”
Man, the people woke up and demanded silence. But they shouted even more: "Oh my Lord, oh son of David, have mercy on us!"
And Jesus stopped and said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?”
They said, "Oh our Lord, we want to go back and see!"
And we will set before them Jesus and delight their eyes, and as they look and follow Him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem (Mark 11:1-11; Luke 19:28-40; John 12:12-19)
As Jesus and his disciples approached Jerusalem and reached the village of Bethpage, by the side of the Mount of Olives, at this time Jesus sent two of his disciples.
He said to them, “Go to the village that is opposite you, and you will find a donkey tied up with a donkey-boy, and a guard. Bring him to me.”
And if anyone among you asks for something, answer him: “The Lord provides for his need.” And return them in good time.
This thing happened so that what the Prophet said would be done:
# Psalm 62:11; Zechariah 9:9 Say to the daughter of Zion, “Behold, your king comes to you, He is the Lord of hosts.”
Meshaw al-zuz talamida wa ‘amalu kay ma amrhum Yesu’.
They tamed the wild beast and the ox, and put their own bonds on them, and Jesus rode.
Most people decorated their houses along the road, and others cut branches from trees and put them in the road.
# Num. 118:26; Lk. 2:14; Matt. 21:15; 23:39 The people who preceded him and followed him were crying out, “Bless the one who comes in the name of the Lord!” Bless him in the highest!
And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and the whole city watched and asked, “Who is this?”
The people said, “This is Jesus the Nazarene, who operates in Galilee.” Jesus drives out the money changers from the temple (Mark 11:15-19; Luke 19:45-48; John 2:13-22).
And Jesus entered the Temple, the goods of God, and drove out those who sold and bought in the midst of the Temple, all of them, and He turned over the tables of those who gave in money and the chairs of those who sold in the public toilets.
# Verse 56:7; 7:11 He said to them, “It is written in the Scriptures: ‘You shall call this house the House of Prayer, and these walls shall be called the Rampart of Slaughter!’ But you have turned it into a den of thieves!”
Java the blind and the flaws of the structure, it was their mouth.
But the heads of the soothsayers and scribes, who were Jews and clung to and witnessed Jesus’ miracles and how the young boys called out in the Temple: “Blessings be to the son of David!”
# Verse 8:2 And they said, “Man, do you hear what they’re saying?” Jesus said, “Yes, man, you never read this verse: ‘Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings you have made strength.’”
And they left him and the nobleman departed from the city to his house, and it was a wearying journey. Jesus cursed the fig tree (Mark 11:12-14, 20-24)
Waqtli was returning to the city in the morning, Jesus was hungry.
Karem saw a vine by the side of the road, you know, and he didn't find anything in it but paper. And he said to it: "You'll never ever bring in the harvest!" And the vine dried up with time.
The students were astonished by what happened and said, "Why did the wine dry up with time?"
And Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not waver, anything you say is possible for him who believes. For truly, I say to you, if you say to the mountain, ‘Be removed and thrown into the sea,’ you will receive it.
Whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you will receive it, and it will be yours. The authority of Jesus (Mark 11:27-33; Luke 20:1-8).
And Jesus entered into the temple, and the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him, taking up a certain matter unto him, and said unto him, “By what authority doest thou these things?” And he answered them, “What and to whom do you question me?”
She answered, “Jesus said, ‘I will give you one question to ask, if you answer it, I will tell you any power I am doing in this thing.’”
Where was John baptized? From God or from people? “You understand them, they say: ‘If we say it’s from God, then why don’t they believe in him?’”
But if we were to say, “It’s from the people,” we fear the people’s opinion, and everyone is certain of what John the prophet says.
Emma replied to Jesus: "We don't know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither did I tell you that I had authority to do this." Like the two sons.
How do you think? There's a man who has two children. He went to the first one and said, "My son, go work today in the grape press."
Look, answer the kid: "I'm not going." Then he regretted it and left.
And he walked to the other ones and they said the same thing that they had said to the first ones, man, they answered: "It's not moving, my lord!" But it didn't move.
“Who is Anahu Malzuz of the brothers who did the thing that Bo loved him for?” the elders asked. Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth: those who are looking at prostitutes and adulterous women are sitting ahead of you to enter the kingdom of God.”
John said, “This man is a sorcerer, I don’t believe in him at all. But when they saw the healing of the paralyzed and the sinners among the women, they believed in him. And when I saw this thing, I didn’t believe in it and didn’t repent.” Like the servants of Simon the Leper (Mark 12:1-12; Luke 20:9-19).
Listen to this last story: There was a man who planted a vineyard of grapes, and he built a fence around it and built a wine press in it and installed a watchtower and rows of stakes for five men, and he traveled to another country.
As the time drew near to harvest the grapes, the servants dispatched the merchandise to the fifths so that they might deliver the vintage.
And they seized the five servants, plundered their possessions, and struck one of them, killing another, and stoned another to death.
And Moulay El Anboub sent servants again, even more than he sent them the first time, you know, they did the same thing to them.
They were far from their families and gave birth, and said, "They are able to have my children."
But the fifth ones saw the boy, and they said to each other: "This is what will be inherited! Let's kill him and take the inheritance!"
They dragged him out of his grape press and killed him.
“What should I do, kill them, come to the second vineyard of the grapes, what should I do with these fifths?”
The rabbis of the Jews said: “Let him kill such wicked men and give the rest of the grapes to five others, just as he gives the vintage to the tax collector.”
Jesus said to them, “Haven’t you read in the Scriptures that the stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone? And that God put in Zion a captain of salvation?”
That is why we are taking you there: to the kingdom of God, that He may entrust you and give you fruit from what its people produce.
# 21:44 There are old texts containing this verse: I am the son of man who came to pay the guilty.
And the Sages and Pharisees heard Jesus speak parables like these, and they understood what he was saying about them.
But as they tried to seize him, they feared the people, and for their own sake, they considered him a prophet.
Like a banquet for the king (Luke 14:15-24)
And Jesus spoke to them again like unto them, and said:
Kingdom of the Heavens is like a king working a night shift at a wedding feast and delight.
And the servants went to summon the guests to the wedding reception, but they didn't show up.
And other servants sent word again saying, “Tell the invitees: Hani has prepared my dinner and slaughtered the bulls and fat cattle, and everything is ready. Get the wedding decorations and entertainment!”
But they didn't even take the late-night hours into account and went on their way; one went to the Siliana area, and one went to his shop.
And others seized the servants with their goods and harmed them and killed them.
They seized the king and sent the soldiers with pleasure and killed the criminal. This is what happened to them and they hindered their city.
Mubaad said to the servant: "The night vigil is present, but only those summoned deserve it."
Emma, go to the streets and invite as many people as you can to the wedding party.
These servants went out to the road and brought the wealthy and the needy, everyone, my God, the wedding house is full of guests.
But he told me that the king was coming to see the guests, and he saw a man not wearing a robe. They said, "Wow!"
How did you get in here and you're not wearing wedding clothes? Like, the man just stayed silent.
Then the king said to the servants: "Strip off his hands and his feet, and throw him from on high into the darkness and the abyss, so that he may cry out and be afflicted with the years."
There were many people calling, but only a few I chose. Paying taxes to the Caesar (Mark 12:13-17; Luke 20:20-26)
This is how the Pharisees schemed and agreed how to get Jesus with a word.
And they sent the students to collect their belongings, along with a group from Herod’s party, and they said to them: “Teacher, we know that you are telling the truth, and you teach in the way of God with sincerity, and you don’t care about anyone, considering that you don’t respect the status of people.”
He told us: What do you think? Should we pay the taxes to the Caesar or not?
But Jesus was angry with their cunning, and said to them: “You hypocrites! Why are you trying this?”
“I’m giving you the money for taxes!” He brought them a silver-handled fan.
Jesus said, “Whose is this cloak and this name?”
They said, "The Emperor's belongings!" I replied to them, "No, give the Emperor's belongings to the Emperor, and the belongings of God to God!"
And they were amazed, and they wondered at the words that he spoke, and they followed him, and went away. The resurrection of the dead (Mark 12:18-27; Luke 20:27-40)
In this day, the Sadducees came to Jesus, and they said to him because he said that there would be no resurrection after death, and they asked him a question
# تث 25:5 And they said, “O you Prophet, Moses said: ‘If a man dies leaving behind a wife and no children, his brother shall marry his wife and bear him children.’”
And among us there were seven brothers, and the first wedding of my brother was without issue, and his wife took her by his brothers.
The same thing happened to the second, the third, and the seventh.
And then everyone died, the mother.
Let her be in heaven today, so that she may be once with all of them, for her sake, she married them all.
They answered him, Jesus said, “You are all mistaken. You have no understanding of the Scripture and the power of God.”
On the Day of Judgment, they will not marry or marry each other; rather, they will be like the angels in heaven.
And you are the possessions of the dead, you know, they haven't read what God said:
# God is Abraham’s God, and God is Isaac’s God, and God is Jacob’s God? He is the God of the dead, he is the God of the living.
And they heard the people say this, and they were amazed at the value of education. The greatest testimony (Mark 12:28-34; Luke 10:25-28)
But as you heard the Pharisees, who silenced the Sadducees, came together among themselves.
One of them, a scholar of Islamic law, asked a question to test us:
“Hey, is Aani the biggest testament in Islamic law?”
# Matthew 6:5 Jesus’ Answer: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.”
This is the first and largest will.
# Rev 19:18; Matt 19:19; Mal 5:14; Luke 13:9; Deut 2:8 and the second commandment is, love your neighbor as you love yourself.
“The entire Law and the prophets are based on these two commandments. The Messiah and David (Mark 12:35-37; Luke 20:41-44)”
At that time, the Pharisees were gathered together, and Jesus asked them a question:
What do you think about the Messiah? Who is his father? They said: "Son of David!"
They said, “How was David calling ‘the Lord’ and killing himself and his soul, and saying?”
# Psalm 110:1; Isa 2:34-35; Eze 1:13; 10:13 My Lord said to me, “Sit at my right hand until we put your enemies under your feet.”
If David Yanulleo calls “Lord,” then how would their child be?
Not even one person could answer him with a word. And from that day forward, no one dared to ask any question.
Jesus warns from the scriptures about the riches and pride of the Jews and Pharisees (Mark 12:38-40; Luke 11:37-52; 20:45-47)
And Jesus said to the people and to his disciples:
The book is a Jewish and Pharisee's property, they are sitting on Moses' chair.
Imala, do your best and memorize everything they tell you. As for what they don't do the way they do it, let them say what they want and not do it.
They pile heavy burdens on people's shoulders, but they don't touch them with their fingers.
Let's do everything so people can see it, let them grow in their ignorance and lengthen their worn-out clothes.
They liked to sit in the first rows of the tents during the evenings and in the first chairs in the assemblies.
And people like to greet each other in the markets and call them: "Oh, teachers."
But you guys don't even let anyone call you “teachers,” on your own terms, all of you are brothers and you have one teacher.
And you don't even say to anyone on earth, "Hey, look at this, we have a father who is in the sky."
And no one dared to say to you: "O Lord," with a whim of one master, who is Christ.
May your eldest serve you.
Those who emerge from their souls will descend, but those who humble themselves will rise.
Woe to you, O books, pleasure of the Jews and the hypocritical Pharisees! You intoxicate the kingdom of the heavens in the faces of men, you have not entered, nor have you allowed those who enter to enter.
There are old texts containing this verse: “Woe to you, O you who cling to the Torah, and hypocrites among you! You disguise yourselves before women as men, dead, and take them as your wives; you take their houses and reckon that your steps are longer than theirs in prayer. That is so that your reckoning may be great before God.”
Woe to you, O books, the delight of the Jews and the hypocritical Pharisees! You tear apart sea and land to make one for your religion, and when he enters, you return him as he deserves, to hell twice over!
Woe to you, you elders, you blind men! Those who say, “Whoever swears by the altar is not obligated to pay, but whoever swears by the gold of the altar is obligated to pay.”
Anna is the one who has more value, you kids and the blind? Gold or the Temple that returned the gold is sacred?
And they say: "Whoever swears on the altar isn't necessary at all, but whoever swears on the altar that's above the altar is necessary on the right."
Anna is the one who matters most, blind man? Is the sacrifice or the altar that makes the sacrifice sacred?
If someone swears by the altar, he swears by it and by what's above it, damn it!
He swears by the structure, he swears by what's inside it, and he swears by the one who resides within it.
And he swears by the heavens, and by the throne, and by God who is above it.
Woe to you, O books, the delight of the Jews and the hypocritical Pharisees! You give ten talents of mint and anise and cumin, and you have neglected the important things that are in the law, namely justice, mercy, and faith. You should have done these things and not allowed them to dominate you.
You lead people astray, you blind ones! You taste the water with the mosquito and swallow the camels.
Woe to you, O books, the delight of the Jews and the hypocritical Pharisees! You wash the cup and the dish from the outside, and it is full of extortion and greed from within.
You hypocrite! Wash the cup and the dish first, inside and out, so that the outside may be clean.
Woe to you, O books, the pleasures of the Jews and the hypocritical Pharisees! How are the tombs, smeared with white, which appear fine from the outside, but within are full of the bones of the dead and worthless things.
And you two, while appearing virtuous to the people from abroad, are full of hypocrisy and evil within.
O the book is the pleasure of the Jews and the hypocritical Pharisees! You build in the tombs of the prophets and adorn the domes of the possessions of the righteous saints.
And they say: "When Gideon was present, we didn't share in their killing of the prophets."
You bear witness to your own souls that you have killed the prophets.
Be balanced and weigh the goods of your possessions.
Hey, you guys from the Laafi family, how are you going to escape the judgment of hell?
Here's the translation: That is why I send you prophets and wise men and scribes. There are some of them that you want to kill and crucify, and some of them that you want to whip in your assemblies and harass from city to city.
# Psalm 4:8; Leviticus 11:4; Zechariah 1:1; II Chronicles 24:21 It is required of you that every pure drop of blood that has flowed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zachariah, son of Barachiah, whom you killed, between the altar and the sanctuary, be reckoned.
Bringing justice to the oppressed: all the lost and broken will come to this generation! Jesus’ love for Jerusalem (Luke 13:34-35)
“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often you have desired me, and how often I have said, ‘I desire your desire!’ But you have not obeyed.”
How are you, my brothers, the ruins are yours.
Listen to me: you won’t see me until the time comes when they say, “Blessed is what is coming in the name of the Lord!”
Jesus speaks on the Mount of Olives (Mark 13:1-2; Luke 21:5-6)
Jesus left the temple. They killed him, and he was walking away with his disciples behind him, following the stones of the temple.
“Look at this ceiling? Here, even this room isn’t going to stay above its sister; the ceiling is going to fall.” The disaster and persecution (Mark 13:3-13; Luke 21:7-19)
When I was young, I was in Mount of Olives, Java said to his students beside him and they said: “When shall this thing happen and what is the sign of your Lord and of the end of the world?”
She answered, “Hold tight and don’t let a single one of you make a mistake.”
The road is full of people coming with my name and saying, "Ana is the Messiah!" and many people make mistakes.
And listen, you guys, about wars near and wars in faraway places, don't be afraid. This thing has to happen, but this isn't the end of it.
The people are coming against the people, and kingdoms against kingdoms, and famine and earthquakes are falling in many places.
This belly is nothing but the first of the joys of childbirth.
And at this time, they want to break you down to torment you and kill you. And all the people hate you because of my name.
And this time, many people want to stop believing, betraying each other, and hating each other.
They show a lot of false prophets and make a lot of people mistake.
Most people no longer have love, just because of evil that increases.
But the one who proves it will pay.
And the Gospel is the enjoyment of the kingdom of God, this is to be proclaimed to all the world, a testimony for all the peoples, and it will not come to an end. The Great Tribulation (Mark 13:14-23; Luke 21:20-24).
# Dave 9:27; 11:31; 12:11 "The filth of devastation that Daniel the prophet spoke of is appearing in the holy place (those who read understand)."
This is the time when those in Judaism flee to the mountains.
Let what's above the surface, don't descend so that it shakes the things in its place.
Let whatever in the second part not return, so that his shoe shakes.
Woe to them, the bound ones, and whoever nurses during the days like this.
Ask God that you escape on a day that is neither winter nor Saturday.
I'm thinking about it this way, so that there's a great deal of hardship, as if he hadn't been in the world since the beginning.
And if God didn't fail you in those days, he didn't even save a human being. But he failed them because of the people they chose.
And if at this time someone says to you: "Here is the Messiah here" or "Havinou is going to come," don't believe it!
The masses will appear in great numbers like the Antichrist and false prophets, doing great deeds and wonders to deceive them, even the chosen ones, if possible.
Hani was warning you before.
Imala, if they tell you: "Here is the Messiah in the latrine!" do not leave, if they tell you: "Here he is in the mausoleums!" do not believe it!
As the lightning flashes from the east and shines in the far west, so is Gianni, my son of man.
Where a carcass lies, the vultures gather. John, son of Man (Mark 13:24-27; Luke 21:25-28)
“And in those days of distress, the sun will turn dark, and the moon will be hidden. The stars will fall from the sky, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.”
And at this time, my sign will appear to me, son of man in the sky, and the thrones of the earth will all weep, and they will see me, son of man, coming in the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.
And suddenly, the angels came out, and a sound of a trumpet of great power filled all the earth; and the heavens opened, and the One who was chosen from the four corners of the earth, from the farthest part of the world to the farthest heaven, appeared. - The Book of the Generosity (Mark 13:28-31; Luke 21:29-33)
Take the lesson from Karim: The days are getting shorter and the vegetables are turning green, you know summer is coming.
And you two realized that things like this were falling, you know, like I was near the doors.
Delivering justice: This generation hasn't even reached the point where these things happen completely.
The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. Prepare your souls always (Mark 13:32-37; Luke 17:26-30; 12:39-40).
But today like that, and the hour like that, not even one knows them, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son. But the Father alone knew them.
Just as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be when the Son of Man comes.
Just as people used to eat, drink, and celebrate before the floods, even until Noah entered the ark.
They hadn't even considered anything until the floods came and overwhelmed them all. That's how time passed and I, son of humankind, came to them:
This was the time when there were two men in the courtyard, one shaking and one remaining.
Women are sitting in the fields, some shaking and others remaining still.
Wake up, you haven't known that day when your Lord will come.
But they know this thing, he was the master of the house and knew when to catch the thief, now it's late and he didn't let anything be stolen.
That’s why you all came and brought yourselves, and I, son of Man, am coming at a time that will not surprise you. Like the faithful servant (Luke 12:41-48).
Who is the close confidant who knows how to act and whose master feeds him and drinks him so that they give him his due on time?
Health, why this servant returns master and finds him served by servants.
Transferring justice: Rahou will eat all of your land.
But if this servant turns out to be evil and says between his soul and himself: "My Lord, let me return in the end."
And he began to beat the other servants and eat and drink with the Scargies.
Sido Bash returns on a day that doesn't come to his mind, and in an hour he doesn't know.
Let them cut and chop, and put them in the place where the hypocrites are going. How to make the tears flow like rivers of time.
Like the girls
Imala, queen of the heavens, resembled ten maidens who had mocked the lanterns of their possessions and were eager to present themselves to the groom.
Five of them were fools, and five knew how to handle things.
The children broke their lanterns and toys, but they didn't break the oil.
But those who didn't know how to act, threw their hands at the oil with the lights of theirs.
And as for the groom, everyone settled down and fell asleep.
But in the middle of the night they heard a cry: "The groom is coming, go out to meet him!"
Seriously, all the girls got up and lit their lanterns.
They said the fools who know how to handle things: "Give us some of your money, just so our fireworks can be lit."
But those who don't know how to act answered: "It might be enough for you and for us, go to those who sell oil and buy what you need."
Wotley huma mashin bash yshriw, wasel el 'arees. Wdakhlu ma'ahuh el hadireen lil-dar elli feeha el 'ars weskrar el bab.
Mubāʿid came with other girls and said to the groom: "O Lord, O Lord, we have broken the door!"
But their answer was: "I tell you the truth: I don't know you."
Emma, be ready with your own money, don’t know today or the hour.” Like unto the tax collectors, they received tithes generously (Luke 19:11-27).
The way to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man who loves to travel, so he called to his servants and gave them his wealth.
He gave each of them according to their ability, he gave one person five full sacks of gold, and another person two full sacks of gold, and another person one sack and traveled.
He took five camels, walked a long distance, and traded them, may God grant him five more camels.
Ali took two chairs, and gained two other chairs.
But he took one pot, walked and dug in the ground and hid Mr. Doe’s money.
And after a long time, these servants returned and accounted for them.
He took five chests, and brought five more chests, and said: "My lord, you gave me five chests, I have won five more chests."
They said, "Wake up, Ya Khadim, Ya Saleh, and Ya Thiqah! I was a little deceitful, I’m letting you rest on my palm: Enter the paradise of the master."
Wali took two chairs, and said, "My lord, you gave me two chairs, so I bought two more chairs."
They said, "Wake up, Ya Khadim, Ya Saleh, and Ya Thiqah! I was a little hesitant, now I'm telling you to go to the paradise of Sidi: enter his wealth."
And Ali took a single jar, he came, and said: "My lord, I know that you are a harsh man, you reap what you have not sown, and you gather what you have not planted."
Man, you froze, and I walked away and buried your jar in the dirt, and these are your money.
Sido Jaoube says: "Either a servant or a villain, or a miser! You know that I harvest what I didn't sow and collect what I didn't plant."
You should have put your money in the bank, and we would return it with interest.
He said to the servants, "Take from his granaries and give to those who have ten granaries."
He who has, wants to increase it and have a lot of it. As for those who have nothing, even what they have is destined to be broken.
The useless servant, throw him down into the darkness. How is he to cry out and lament his long years?" On the Day of Judgment.
Come to me, O Jacob, and behold, the Son of Man in glory, and let all the angels come with me in this time; we will sit on the throne of my glory.
# Job 34:17 And the nations gathered together, and I separated them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, according to their manner.
And we put the goats on my right, and the sheep on my left.
And I often say to the King on my right: "Ijaw, who blessed you, Father, inherit the kingdom that I built for you when I was born."
You tormented me, I was starving and you fed me, I was thirsty and you quenched me, I was a stranger and you sheltered me.
I was naked, and you clothed me; I was ill, and you visited me; I was bound, and you set me free.
This time they answer me, the righteous: “O my Lord, when did you abandon me hungry and destitute? Or when did you quench my thirst and refresh me?”
And you healed us, stranger, and clothed us? Or were you naked and adorned us?
And did we find you sick and burdened with trouble?
And Ana, the king said, "You have the right to do this with one of our little brothers whenever you did this with us!"
And I always say to those to my left: "Keep me away, you damned ones, go to the fire that the devil and the angels made for eternity:"
I was very hungry and you didn't feed me, I was thirsty and you didn't quench my thirst.
And you were a stranger, and you did not dwell in my place, naked and without clothing, sick and bound, and you did not visit me.
And they added, “O Lord, when were you absent, hungry or thirsty, strange or naked, sick or bound, and did you not help me?”
And I will answer them: "You have the right to do this to one of my little brothers sometimes, but you haven't done it with me yet."
And so they go to suffer for eternity, while the righteous go to eternal life.
The Jews were trying to kill Jesus (Mark 14:1-2; Luke 22:1-2; John 11:45-53).
Jesus finished this speech, he said to his disciples:
You know that Easter is coming in two days, and I, the Son of Man, am coming so that I may be crucified.
And at this time, the heads of the seers and elders of the people gathered in the highest one of the houses of the seers in the House of Qifa.
And they consulted together to devise a trick to trap Jesus and kill him.
But they said, “We haven’t prepared anything for the feast, so let’s not cause a commotion in the middle of the people.” Mark how he pours perfume on Jesus (Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8)
He was saying to me, "Jesus is in the house of Simon the Pharisee, at the house of Caná."
She had a dove in her hands, a very expensive perfume, and she put it on her head and told him to eat it.
But when they told him the students saw them, they said: "What's this waste?"
This perfume used to be sold in exchange for fingerprints, and given to the poor!
But Jesus knew this and said to them, “Why are you troubled? He has done good by me.”
The poor are always with you, but I can never be with them always.
And if she sprayed the perfume on my body, it prepares me for the evening.
Deliver the truth: Where will this Gospel be proclaimed in the whole world, so that it will be told about his deeds of wickedness, so that people always remember it? Judas’ betrayal (Mark 14:10-11; Luke 22:3-6)
This time there was one of the two disciples, whose name was Judas the Galilean, and he went to the chief priests.
# He asked, “What are you giving me for my inheritance?” And they gave him thirty silver pieces.
At this time, he seemed to be waiting for an opportunity to betray him. The Last Supper with the disciples (Mark 14:12-21; Luke 22:7-23; John 13:21-30)
On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the students went to Jesus and said to Him, “We want to prepare a Passover meal for you to eat.”
They said, “There’s one in the city who went around saying: ‘The teacher says: my watch has come, so we’ll have a post-Ramadan dinner at your house with my students.’”
And the students did as Jesus told them to do and prepared the Passover meal.
As evening came, Jesus sat down to eat with his disciples Simon and Cleophas.
And when they were eating, Jesus said, “One of you will betray me.”
And they grieved a lot and started saying to each other: “Oh my God, am I? Lord?”
I answered her: "The one who put his hand in the plate with me is the one who will betray me."
# Verse 41:9 - "I am the son of man, and I must die as it is written on me. Woe to the man who commits adultery! This man is good for nothing if he does not cease to exist.”
Judas asked Jesus, “Rabbi, you said it yourself, didn’t you?” Jesus replied, “You said so.” (Mark 14:22-26; Luke 22:15-20; 1 Corinthians 11:23-25)
And when they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take and eat, this is my body.”
They took a cup and thanked them, and said, “Drink from it all of you.”
This is my blood, the blood of an oath that has flowed for the sake of many people so that their sins may be forgiven.
I'm telling you: I'm not going to drink this grape juice anymore until that same day comes when I drink it with you. New in Dad's kingdom.
And they sang to the Lord, and they went to the Mount of Olives. Jesus told me, Peter should deny Him (Mark 14:27-31; Luke 22:31-34; John 13:36-38)
# John 13:7; John 16:32; and he said to them, “You know that I must go, so that the Father’s work may be made manifest through me. But this is what is written concerning me: ‘I must by no means fail to tell you all that I have heard from the Father.’ Therefore, I tell you, it is not for me to say where you should go, but go in whatever direction he shall direct you.
After we get up from death, I will race you to the Galilee.
Man, they said Peter: "Even if everyone was against you, I'll never leave you."
They said to Jesus: “The true transport: this night, before the rooster crows, if you have repented three times.”
They said to Peter, “Let us not deny you, even if it is necessary to die with you.” And all the students said this. Jesus was praying in Gethsemane (Mark 14:32-42; Luke 22:39-46).
And Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, “You shall stay here until I come; and you shall wait for me and pray.”
And with him were Peter and Zobdi, both of them, and he felt in his spirit sad and worried.
They told him: "I feel my soul is very sad until death. Wait here and stay awake."
And upon them is a little bit, and he fell on the reins and prayed, saying, “Oh my father, if it is possible, let me hold this cup. But let it be whatever you like, not whatever I like.”
And he went back to the students and found them asleep, and he said to Peter: “You guys can’t even stay up with me for an hour?”
Stay up late and pray so you don't experience that. The soul loves to remain alert, but the body is weak.
And again, he prayed, and said, “Dad, if this glass isn’t possible to take away from me, and it forces me to drink it, let my will not be your will.”
And he returned and found them sleeping, at ease, not even bothering to lift their heads from their shoulders.
And he repeated it again, and after he prayed for the third time, and he repeated the words, "Piedu."
Mubayed went to the students and said, “Why are you still lying around and relaxed? This hour has arrived and I, as a human being, am here to deliver the guilty hands.”
Let's go! Here's what he's saying to betray me.» Shaddan Yeshu (Mark 14:43-50; Luke 22:47-53; John 18:3-12)
Waqtli is still speaking like Judas, who was one of the twelve disciples, and with him are many people carrying swords and staffs, whom the heads of the priests and elders of the people sent.
And he gave them a command, saying: “I will kiss him like that, hold him tight!”
And as time passed, he walked like Jesus, and they said, “Peace, O Teacher!” and he bowed.
They said to Jesus, “My friend, do the thing you were told to do.” At this time, they came and put their hands on Jesus and dragged him.
And the Galileans were with Jesus, extending their hands and lifting up his sword, and striking the master of the highest priest, Joshua, and Azarias.
And this is what Jesus said: “Turn your swords back to their places. Whoever raises a sword will die by a sword.”
Man, I can't get in my head how Dad sends me more than a battalion of angels?
But how is it that you say that the sacred books tell you this thing must happen?
And Jesus said to the people, “Why are you presenting me as a criminal coming to me with swords and clubs? Every day I was sitting and teaching in the temple, and you didn’t even bother.”
But this thing, the blow was struck so that what is said in the prophets' books would be fulfilled. At this time, the students were dismissed and fled. Jesus in the council of the Jews (Mark 14:53-65; Luke 22:54-55, 63-71; John 18:13-14, 19-24)
And they led Jesus to Pilate, who was the ruler of the Jews, and to the chief priests and the elders, and they brought him to the council.
And Peter followed him from afar until he reached the highest house of the heads of the priests. He went inside and sat with the guards to see what was suitable for him to place.
And the prophets and wise men in the council, all the Jews from among them, entered upon a man who bore witness against Jesus falsely, that they might kill him.
But how are they, despite many people coming and testifying to falsehoods. And they didn't bring any more witnesses.
They said, “This man said, ‘I will cause a structure to fall, and I will build it in three days.’”
And the highest one of the prophets’ leaders said: “Hey, you don’t have anything to respond with? Hey, you don’t even listen to the men, how are they testifying against you like this?”
But Jesus remained silent. And they said to the chief of the priests: “We have heard that this Jesus is calling himself the Son of God;”
They said of Jesus: “You said it like that. But I tell you: today you will not see me, I am the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of God’s power and coming in the clouds of heaven!”
The highest-ranking shaman, Dabush, said: “Rahu is an apostate! Are we still needing witnesses? Listen, I just heard he’s an apostate.”
“Who are they judging?” Answer: “They must die!”
They spat on him and slapped him with a fist, and there was one of them who hit him.
They said, “You will be betrayed, O Son of Man! Who is it that struck you?” Peter denied Jesus (Mark 14:66-72; Luke 22:56-62; John 18:15-18, 25-27).
And at this time, Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard of the house, and suddenly the servants came and said, "You have become like Jesus who went to Galilee!"
But he was a stranger in front of them all, and he said, “I don’t understand what you mean.”
Wotili went out to the outer door, saw another servant and said to those present, “This man was with Jesus who was in Nazareth!”
And Peter denied again, swearing, and saying, “I don’t know this man!”
They stepped back a bit and said to Peter: "You're one more among them, so speak like them!"
This time he seemed to be arguing and straining: “We don’t know this man.” And at that time, the sergeant spoke.
And Peter remembered the word of Jesus as it was: “Before you curse me, you have denied me three times.” Then Philip left and wept profusely.
Jesus before Pilate (Mark 15:1; Luke 23:1-2; John 18:28-32)
And in the morning, the heads of the priests and elders of the people all agreed that Jesus should be killed.
He tied him up and delivered him to Pilates the governor. The preciousness of Judas’s death (Acts 1:18-19)
And Judas, who had betrayed Jesus, regretted and returned thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He said to them, “I committed a sin by sending one innocent merchandise.” They said, “It doesn’t concern us? Mind your own business.”
He threw the silver into the structure and left, and the spirit of Rougo walked away.
But the seers mocked the silver and said, “We will not put it in the box of the temple, as long as it is the money of blood.”
They understood and learned from it the secret of the potter so that he could make it strong, so that they could bury in it the jars.
That's why the swelling is called hematoma today.
# Zechariah 11:12-13; Jeremiah 32:6-15; 18:2-3 And so he did as the prophet Jeremiah said: “They shall shake loose the thirty pieces of silver, the price set for the field which he bought with the company of the children of Israel.”
And he gave them to buy a jar of ointment for the embalmer. “As the Lord commanded me.” Pilate asked Jesus (Mark 15:2-5; Luke 23:3-5; John 18:33-38)
Jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him, “Aren’t you the King of the Jews?” Jesus replied, “You said so.”
But the heads of the priests and elders accused him of it, and he didn’t answer with anything at all.
Mubayed said, "You don't hear how they're accusing you of things, you know?"
But they didn’t answer even a single question of theirs, until the governor was astonished greatly. The death of Jesus (Mark 15:6-15; Luke 23:13-25; John 18:39-19:16)
And every year, the governor would leave one of the marshals for the people who liked him.
And they had in that time a well-known one in prison named Parabas.
And Pilate said unto them, “Which of these two do you wish me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Christ?”
He would have known what they gave him because of jealousy.
Zayd was at this time and Pilate was sitting in the courtroom, he sent for his wife and told her: "Respond to him, do anything to this man, I was very worried about his dream last night."
And the wise men and elders persuaded the people to ask him to heal them with Barabbas and have Jesus killed.
He told them again by the governor: “Who are they, the two who love me, I’ll leave you?” And they said, “Barabbas!”
Pilate said, “What do you want me to do to this Jesus who is called the Christ?” They all replied, “Let him be crucified!”
He said, “Why? What’s the evil they did?” They were shouting even more: “They’re burned!”
Pilate, seeing that they were going to kill Jesus, was dismayed, and by no means did he want to do anything, and conversely, there was no commotion; he took the water and washed his hands in front of the people and said, “I am innocent of this man’s blood. Do whatever you think is right.”
Everyone answered: "We and our children are wanted with blood!"
And they taunted him, Barabbas, and Jesus mocked as he was being scourged by the whip. The soldiers mocked Jesus (Mark 15:16-20; John 19:2-3).
The soldiers of Mubaad escorted Jesus to the governor's palace and encountered a whole battalion of soldiers in front of them.
We tried to dress him in a red dress.
And they made a crown for Meshullam and put it on his head, and they gave him a fortress in his hand, and they prostrated themselves before him while he mocked them and said, “Jehoiakim, king of the Jews!”
They spat on him and tightened the rope and hit him with it on his own head.
After they mocked him, they tried to dress him in red, and they dressed him in a leopard skin and flogged him to make him stiff. Jesus on the cross (Mark 15:21-32; Luke 23:26-43; John 19:17-27)
Wotley howma kharijin mal-madinaty, ‘ar’ahum raji’ min qirina, ‘ismu Sam’an, wa lazimuh ‘alaih bash yhez al-salib mataa’ Yasu’.
And Watley arrived at a place called the Skull, which means “Skull Spot.”
Atua, he drinks a mixed drink called Mer Bach, but when he tasted the time-killed one, he didn't want to drink it.
# My brother was executed, and they drew for his clothes and divided them.
And they sat and stayed, tormenting the one who was leaving.
They placed the charge upon themselves in a block written: “This is Jesus, King of the Jews.”
He solidified his alliance with two criminals, one on his right and one on his left.
# Men 22:7-8; 109:25 And those who were arguing with him were striking their breasts and cursing him and saying:
“I will tear down the structure and rebuild it in three days; if you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.”
And the prophets and the scribes said, “This is the Son of David who boasts.” The Pharisees and the elders, dismayed, said, “This is the Messiah!”
“Other people have finished him, and he cannot finish his soul! The King of Israel, let him descend from above the cross so that we may believe in him.”
Mao trusted in God and said, "I am the son of God." May God deliver them if they are pleased with him.
And the criminal who was crucified with him were reviled by him with words. The death of Jesus (Mark 15:33-41; Luke 23:44-49; John 19:28-30)
And half of the day is the darkness of the whole world, even for the three possessions of the evening.
# Mark 2:22 and suddenly, with three in the synagogue, Jesus cried out, “Elijah! Elijah! Why have you cast out the child?” The meaning of this was, “My God! My God! Why have you forsaken me?”
And who are those standing and saying, "This man is calling out to Elijah!"
# Verse 69:21 And one of them ran and shook a shufna, blew it into vinegar, and put it in a fortress, so that Madohalo might drink.
But the others said, “Wait, let’s see if Elijah Bash comes and pays them off!”
And Jesus shouted again with a loud voice and his spirit came out.
And the veil divided the treasures of the framework between two above the land. And the earth trembled and the stone cracked.
The graves were adorned, and a multitude of women's belongings of the saints who were lying in them rose up.
They emerged from the tombs after Jesus rose, and they went to the Holy City and appeared to many people.
The jailer of Mya and those who were with him, fearing for their lives because of the earthquake, said, “Truly, this man is the Son of God!”
And there were a great many women, watching from afar, who were the ones they followed in Jesus of Nazareth and served in.
Among them was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Joseph, and the mother of the Lord Jesus Zebedee. They took Jesus and buried him. (Mark 15:42-47; Luke 23:50-56; John 19:38-42)
As dusk fell, a wealthy man named Joseph from the Ramat region arrived, who was a disciple of Jesus’s disciples.
Pilate went and asked for Jesus’ body. Then Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
And Joseph wrapped the body of Jesus in a clean linen cloth.
They buried him in a new grave, they dug for his soul in stone, and they placed a large stone at the gate of the grave and walked.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. Sages were weeping at the tomb.
And the next day, which was after the day [of Passover], the chief priests and the Pharisees came to Pilate.
They said to us, "O our Lord, remind us how the deceiver said when he threatened to kill us: 'I will return after three days.'"
That’s why I ordered them to disturb the grave on the third day, so that their students wouldn’t go to steal it and tell the people: “He has risen from the dead,” and people would make even more mistakes than they did before!
He said to them, “You have guards, go away and do with him as you please.”
Imala and her companions placed candles in the room and soldiers to disturb the grave.
The Resurrection of Jesus (Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:1-12; John 20:1-10)
And after the Sabbath had passed, and with the dawn of Sunday, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
Man, a huge earthquake happened. There was an angel from God who descended from the sky and came after the door and sat on it.
And the view was how the lightning and Debshu were white like snow.
The guards trembled with fear, like the dead.
But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid. I know that you will go to Jesus who will be crucified.”
He's not here, he went as he said. Come and see the spot where he left it.
And go and say to your students: "He rose from the dead, and he’s going to beat you all to Galilee, and he’s going to see him." I told you so.
They went to see the grave and it was huge, and they were both scared and very happy, and they told the students.
And in the corner they showed Jesus and said to them, “Peace.” Then they grabbed him and bound his legs and knelt down.
“Don’t be afraid! Go and tell your brothers to go to Galilee, and tell them, ‘The Teacher is going there and is looking for him.’ ” The soldiers said this.
Women in my time went forth like soldiers returning to the city, and they told the heads of the priests about everything that happened.
And the heads of the priests gathered with the elders, they consulted and gave a lot of money to the soldiers.
They said to them, “Tell the people: ‘Their students came at night and stole from us and killed us while we were sleeping.’”
The governor heard the news, we approve of you and we’ll get rid of you unless there’s a problem.
The soldiers took the money and did as they pleased. And this story is still spreading among the Jews to this day. Jesus appears to his disciples (Mark 16:14-18; Luke 24:36-49; John 20:19-23; Acts 1:6-8).
And she went to the first student of Galilee, of the mountain, as they called him Jesus.
