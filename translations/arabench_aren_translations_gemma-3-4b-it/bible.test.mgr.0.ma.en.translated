Chapter 7: The Best Choice in the Kingdom of the Heavens?
And they offered him a timepiece, and they approached Jesus and asked him: “Who is the one who is willing to be the Lord of the kingdom of heaven?” Luke 22:24
He was yelling at Jesus about a child and stopped him in the middle of the crowd.
Waqal: “We tell you the truth: unless you change your governor like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.” Mark.”
And he humbled himself to the manner of this boy, for he is the one who holds the key to the kingdom of the heavens.
And he warmly welcomes this name in my name.
And one of those little ones who believed in him threw himself into the Dunub, so that a large room of the saddle was attached to his neck and he was thrown into the sea.
Woe to the world! The affairs of this life cause sorrows! It is inevitable that these things will happen, but woe to the one who causes them!
Otherwise, your hand or your foot will cause you to fall into the abyss, cut them off and throw them at you, because it is good for you to intervene for the eternal life with one hand or one foot, or you don't have two hands or two feet, and you throw yourself into eternal bliss. When
If your eye falls on the abyss, it will strike you down and drag you into it; you will fall and be swallowed. It is better for you to have two eyes and be led to eternal life with one eye, or to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. Matthew 5:29
If you ask one of these little ones for help, they will tell you: “Their angels are always in the heavens, and so is the one in the heavens.”
A man is rushing to save the people who are drowning. # 18 11.11 This verse is not found in many ancient manuscripts.
What do they think? But if someone has a hundred sheep and explains to one of them, doesn't he make the sheep run and ninety in the mountains and go to turn over the explained sheep?
I'm telling you the truth: if he finds it, he'll be happier with it than he was with the Saudi Arabia and 1990s when he didn't pray.
“And so, whatever remains in the sky will not even take a single one of these little ones to be destroyed.” The sand is…
Unless it is your brother’s sin, it is your right, go to him and contend with him privately, unless you gain victory over your brother, then you have won your brother; lest you be victorious over your brother, you have lost your brother.
Otherwise, they won’t let him hear it, there’s one or two people to accompany you so that every word is attested by two or three witnesses.
Otherwise, he wouldn't listen to them, tell them to the people of the church, otherwise he wouldn't listen, consider him like someone who worships idols or anything belonging to the tax authorities.
I tell you the truth: whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. Matthew 16:19; John 20:23
And we tell you again: If two people from you are on earth to ask for something, we will grant it from the bounty in the heavens.
O dolphin, where are you? Gather two or three by name under my name, I’m there among them. The slave’s harsh judgment.
And Peter came close to Jesus and knelt down: “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother who accuses me? Shall I forgive him seven times?” Luke
And the Lord said to him, “Truly I say to you, no one who has a hundred will not be given ten, and he who has ten will not be given one.
Regarding that, it resembles the Kingdom of the Heavens for a king who wants to account for his slaves.
He started to confront them, he had a debt of millions of silver dirhams for one of them.
He had nothing to offer in return, so he begged his master to sell him and his wife and children, and everything he owned, in order to pay off his debt.
The servant prostrated himself and said: “Be patient, my lord, and we will return everything to you.”
And he was granted his wife, divorce, and forgiveness regarding the debt that was upon him.
That slave, he was released, and he met a companion among the slaves who was asking him for a hundred silver dirhams, and he beat him and hanged him, and then said: “Give me back what I was asking you!”
He fell at her feet so that she could ask her: "Be patient, and we will return what is yours to you."
But he didn't do anything, and they threw him in prison until he paid back the debt he owed.
Melli sawfu l'ebid sahābi ashnu tra, haznu bzzaf weshaw khbero gīāʿ dāki lli wqaʿ.
He yells at his master and says to him: “This slave is not good! You gave him that all for nothing, you begged him.”
Yes, why didn't you forgive your friend, the servant, as you forgive me?
The lady worried, and Wassayth was sent to prison to torment him until he confessed what was on him.
Here's the translation: This is the way he will make for you the ‘ba’ that is in the sky, unless he allows each of you to love him with all his heart.
Chapter nine-teenth, Jesus knows about divorce.
And Jesus finished speaking, so he left the Galilean region and went to the regions of Judea on the other side of the Jordan River.
And then many of the people followed them and understood them.
Bring the Pharisees near and let them try it on him: “Will it allow a man to divorce his wife as she was the cause?”
And he replies to them: “Haven’t you read in the Book of God that God created a man from the Bedouin, a male and a female?”
WG: هذا هو السبب الذي يجعل الرجل متواضعًا ومحترمًا ويحب زوجته، ويجعلهم زوجًا وزوجة في بيت واحد.
Thus, they are two souls, but one. May God not allow a human to separate them.
The Pharisees asked Jesus, “Why did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce when he divorces her?” Matthew
And Jesus answered them, “Because of your hardness of heart, it was permitted to Moses to call the women harlots. But this is not the way it was when God created man and woman.”
I’m telling you: whoever divorces his wife for any reason except immorality and then marries another, he is committing adultery. Matthew 5:32; 1 Corinthians 7:10, 11
He says, "Except when a woman is like this, a man should not marry her, at all."
And Jesus answered them, “Not everyone will accept this word, but only those to whom God has granted to accept it.”
There are some people born from wombs that are not able to marry, and there are those who have been rejected by people like that. And there are those who don't marry until the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever understands this, understands. Jesus blesses the little children.
They had the people give them some small children so they could put their hands on them and pray with them, and they argued with the students about those they brought.
But Jesus said, “Let the children come to me and do not hinder them, for such are the heirs of heaven.”
He put his hands on them and walked away. The young man was wearing it.
There was a young man who asked the teacher: “Teacher, what good deed can I do so that I may have eternal life?”
And Jesus replied, “Why do you trouble me with good deeds? Only God is truly good. And if you want to enter eternal life, keep the commandments.”
And he permits it: “What is the will?” And Jesus answered him: “You shall not kill, you shall not destroy, you shall not steal, you shall not bear witness falsely.”
I’ve looked at you and your brother, and whatever you want your head to be, that’s what you should take.
He tells the young man: “I’ve followed all these instructions, so what else do I need?”
And Jesus replied, “But if you want to be flawless, go and sell all that you have and give to the poor. And you will have a treasure in heaven, and come follow me.”
But when the young man heard these words, he walked away sadly, as the clothes were a burden on him.
Jesus to his disciples: “I tell you the truth: it is difficult for a righteous person to enter the kingdom of heaven.”
And we add to what we say to you: It is easy to enter the good of the kingdom of God from the eyes of the liberator!
The students were amazed when they heard this and said, "Based on this, who will be able to escape?"
Jesus saw them and said, “People cannot do this, but God is capable of everything.”
Peter and Philip replied, “We’ve left everything and followed you, what will be our reward?”
Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth: when the Son of Man enters into his glory, he will glorify many Israelites.
Anyone who allows his family, or his relatives, or his sisters, or his property, or his land, before my name, will have that which he allowed returned to him a hundredfold and eternal life with God.
“Those who were first will be last, and those who were last will be first.” Matthew 20:16; Luke 13:30
Chapter Twenty: The Servants in the Vineyards
The path to the kingdom of the heavens is like that of a man who has vineyards, and he went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyards.
He brought them a dinar for each day, and guided them to the gardens of his beloved.
The morning drowsiness washed over me and I found some workers lying down, idle in the market.
He tells them: Go to my paradise, I will pay you for what you deserve.
He went out again inside the filth of the day, and returned again at three o'clock, and hired more workers.
He left around five in the evening and found other workers standing there, asking them: "Why are you standing here doing nothing?"
And they replied: “Even if no one has helped us, it’s okay, go to my paradise.”
In Mellilaya el-ʿashiya, ݣال مول الجنان for the agent of it: He shouted at all the workers and gave them their release, and started from the last ones until he reached the leaders.
And those who had wronged them in the fifth hour took a dinar from each of them.
Milli jao loulin, hiba lehum bli gadi yitkhallasu bitman zaid, walakin hatha hum khadaw bghir dinar lwal had.
They had finished their business, they began to quarrel about the King.
Wikicolo: Those others only worked for one hour, and they gave me to the team we stayed working the whole day in the sun.
He responds to the master of them, and says to him: “I didn’t wrong you, my friends, did you agree to a dinar with me?”
Yeah, you got what you deserved, and go on with your life! And this is what was coming, I was the one who wanted to give it to you yourself.
Why don't I have the right to spend my money as I want? Or am I being envied because I'm generous?
Jesus increased saying, “Therefore, the last are the first, and the first are the last.” Matthew 19:30; Mark 10:31; Luke 13:30 Jesus prophesied for the third time about death and his being raised.
As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took with him his disciples, and he was also telling them along the way.
Ha Hanna are going to Jerusalem, and there is someone there who will hand over a human child to the leaders of religious men and the scholars of the law, and they will judge him to death.
And they will hand him over to those who do not know God, who will laugh at him, beat him, and crucify him, and on the third day he will be followed by death. Am Jacob and John ask Jesus for their children.
And a woman named Zibdi and her sons went to Jesus, and she knelt before him and asked him to fulfill one need for her.
“What do you want?” she asked, and the girl replied, “An order to feed my sons, one on your left and the other on your right in your kingdom.”
Jesus replies: “You don’t even know what you want, do you? Can you drink the cup of suffering that I’m going to drink?” They said to him, “Yes, we can!”
Okay, here's the translation: “Yeah, they’re going to drink him, but the glass for my left and my right isn’t something I’m going to give them, because it will only be given to those who have ‘ba’.”
They all heard this message. Be very worried about Jacob and his brother John.
And he cried out to them, “You know that the rulers control the people of Israel, and the great men impose their authority upon everyone under them.” – Luke
And this is not what should be between you. But whoever wants to be big with you, especially his servants. When
Whoever wants to be the leader among you, especially if he becomes your slave.
“And thus was born the son of man, so that people would not dare to serve him, but that he might serve them and redeem many people with his life. Jesus heals two blind men.”
As they and time passed, they were leaving Jerusalem, Jesus was one of the great people of the world.
They were two blind men sitting beside the road, and they did not hear that Jesus was passing by, and they began to shout and say, “Have mercy on us, O Lord, O son of David!”
Everyone was telling them to be quiet, they had died more and said: "Have mercy on us, O son of David!"
And Jesus stood up and wept over them and said, “What do you want me to do to you?”
They replied: “We want our eyes to be sweet, your majesty!”
And He put them beside Jesus, and they who had been blind since birth began to see, and they followed Him.
Chapter twenty-one Jesus enters Jerusalem
Millions went to Jerusalem and arrived at Dar Beit Fajji, near Mount Zion, where Jesus met two of his disciples.
Listen: "For the dizziness you see before you, you will find a donkey tied up, with a whip attached to it. Bring it here."
Otherwise, tell them one thing, something: God needs them, and He is a little merciful.”
All of this happened in order to verify the words of the Prophet who said:
“Paulo of Zion: Here comes your king, humble and riding on a donkey, and beating his donkey boy.”
They went together and did what Jesus told them to do.
The donkey and the camel were saddled, and they put their belongings on them, and Jesus rode on top of them.
A huge group of people were on the road, cutting down the branches of others' trees and leaving them on the road.
And those groups of people who preceded Jesus and followed him said: “Glory #21:9 Glory. Literally: We proclaim the Son of David! Praise be to God who is coming in the name of the Lord! Glory to God in the highest!”
What does this have to do with Jerusalem? All the city's residents and they started to whisper: "Who is this?"
And the groups of people answered them: “This is Jesus the Prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.” Jesus was traveling through the markets and the fairs from the House of God.
And Jesus entered the house of God, and he turned over the money changers who were selling and buying, and he overturned the tables of those who were counting the money, and he turned the stools of the water sellers.
They say: “You write in the Book of God, so your house will be called the House of Prayer, but we changed its name to a sandalwood shed!”
And they came to him at the House of God, blind and lame people, and He healed them.
But the religious leaders and scholars were worried when they saw the miracles Jesus performed, and when they heard the boys die in the temple and say, “Praise be to the son of David!”
And he asked them: “Do you hear what they are saying?” And Jesus answered and said, “Yes, have you never read in the Book of God: ‘From the mouths of little children and from the mouths of those who are nursing, came forth words of praise’?”
And after he left them and went out of the city to Beit ‘Ania and slept there. Jesus, may he be cursed, the dignity.
And the morning was like he was returning to the city, hungry.
He saw a grape vine on the side of the road, and walked up to it, finding nothing in it except the leaves. He turned to Jesus and said, “The harvest will not always be in you!” And at that moment, the vine withered.
Melli saw that student fall, he was amazed and asked: "How did he drop the cup so lightly?"
And he answers them, Jesus and then: “I tell you the truth, unless you have faith and do not doubt, you will not receive even a single thing that you ask for. But when you ask, you do not receive what you want because you ask with wrong motives.” Matthew
“The need you ask for in prayer, you will receive it, if it is in accordance with God’s will.” Who gave Jesus authority?
And Jesus came to the house of God, and He knew that they were there, so He came to Him the heads of the men of the Pharisees and the elders of the people, and they said to Him: “By what authority do you do these things, and who has given you power to do them?”
And Jesus answered them, “I will ask you one question, and if you answer it, I will tell you what authority I have to do this.”
Where was John's baptism? Was it from God or from people?». And they consulted each other and prayed: “If it came from God, he would have told us: Why did you not believe in John?”
Otherwise, people would come from everywhere, we'd be afraid of the masses because they're counting on John the Baptist.
And they answered Jesus and said to him: “We do not know.” He said to them: “Even I do not tell you what power I do this with.” The parable of the two sons.
Here's the translation: "It was noon, and a man had two sons. He went to the older one and said: 'Take care of my vineyard today.'"
He responded, and his son said to him: I don't want it. But he regretted it in the end and walked away.
And the boy walked to the second child and said to him as he said to the first, and he replied saying: Even if you are my master! But he didn't go.
“Who is in this group, in this gathering?” They said to him: “The one.” He said to them, “We will tell you the truth: the tax collectors and the sinners will go before you into the kingdom of God.”
John the Baptist # 21.32 Here we speak of John the Baptist. He came to you announcing the way of salvation, but you did not believe in him. But you paid the taxes and tolerated the corrupt, and you believed in him. And even after seeing this, you did not regret it and did not believe in him. Luke 3:12; 7:29,30 The parables of the vineyard and the fig tree
I heard a story from a neighbor: This man has land, he planted vineyards and built a wall around it, and he dug a wine press and built a tower, and he didn't care for any vineyards and left.
The time has come for the grape pickers to go to the vineyards, so that the master can take his harvest.
And he flogged the female slave, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
And Saif al-Abidin returned to the region more than the others, and they followed him as he had followed them to the region.
And then the old summer, his son, and Gail said: “They will respect my son.”
But when he saw the midwife of Moul el Ghanan, he said between them: This is the one who will be killed! Let's kill him and take his corpse!
And they tightened him and took him out to the outside of the gardens of the grapes, and killed him.
Yes, but it’s the grape paradise, what does the woman do for that paradise?
And he replied: “Those buyers will end up with a bad fate, and he will give the grapes of paradise to another vineyard worker who will deliver the harvest on time.”
Jesus, please: "Haven't you ever read in the Book of God: The room that the builders didn't want is the foundation? This comes from the Lord, and it's amazing in our eyes!"
Here's the translation: I'm telling you this: God's kingdom is going to be taken from your hands and given to the people who deserve it.
“Whoever falls on this room will be crushed to pieces, and whoever the room falls on will be crushed.”
They heard the words of the heads of the religious leaders and the Pharisees about him, and they understood that he was speaking against them.
And they began to wonder how to turn things around, but they were afraid of the people, no longer counting on being revered.
Chapter Twenty-Two of the Wedding Ceremony
And Jesus spoke again in the Torah, before the people and all:
It is like the kingdom of the heavens, the palace of one king for his son's wedding.
The assistants to the slaves, the Diya'h, are crying over the displayed items, but they don't want to come.
And summer returned to Sidi Bouzid and Ghala to them: “For the displayed items: I found the wedding and hunted the sheep and the fat cattle and everything is there, yes, come to the wedding!”
But they didn't fulfill it, some of them went to that plot of land, and some of them went around selling and buying.
And two others from among those displayed enslaved them and beat them and killed them.
The king worried about the commander, the soldiers, and those who perished in battle, burning their city.
He tells the slaves of his: the wedding is here, but those who offered us [things] don't deserve it.
Yeah, Sergio was asking about the wedding and they found each other on the way and presented them to everyone, finding them for the wedding.
Get the slaves out to the two roads and collect all that you find, neither the good people nor the hopeless ones, and repair the wedding house with hospitality.
The king only wanted to see the wedding festivities, a man appeared who wasn't wearing the wedding attire.
He tells her: “Why did you go and talk to your friends and come in here without wearing your wedding clothes?” The man fell silent because he had nothing to say.
He says to the servants, "Cut off your hands and feet, and throw yourselves out into the darkness, and where will your weeping and your ravings be?"
“The mullet is widely exposed, but the ones it chooses are few.” The tax summary for the Caesar.
The Pharisees met to discuss Jesus and accuse him of wrongdoing in his words.
And they were arguing with their students about the Herodians and said to him: “O Lord, we know that you are true, and that you teach the way of God in truth, and you do not act according to appearances, because it does not please you to treat a person as he deserves.”
Oh, tell us what appears to you? Should we pay the Caesar's tax or not?
And Jesus exposed their hypocrisies and told them: “Why do you test me with these hypocrites?”
“I gave you the money to cover the taxes!” And they gave him a dollar.
“Who took this picture and wrote this on the money?”
“Caesar’s, Caesar’s! Whatever belongs to Caesar should be given to Caesar, and whatever belongs to God should be given to God!”
They heard it, they were amazed, and they dismissed him and left. The question is about the belongings of the dead.
I will give you my soul for the day you came to Jesus with two of the Pharisees who were dis¬puting, and he said to them: “Why are you arguing?”
“My lord, *Gal Moussa*: He died a man and did not leave sons, he must marry his wife so that he can have children in his brother’s name.”
We had seven brothers, the girl got married to one of them and died, and she didn't have children, so she left her brother to marry her.
This happened again and again, even to the seventh.
And after they all died, the woman died too.
Yeah, who is this seven who will be a man of this woman on the day she was married? Because they were all her men.
And Jesus replied them: “You are all mistaken, for you do not know the Book of God nor the power of God.”
Dolphin in the day of the sale, people didn't marry them and they didn't marry them, but they would be like angels in the sky.
As for the merchandise of the dead, haven't you read the word of God that says:
Am I God of Ibrahim and God of Isahak and God of Yaqub? God is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
They heard the groups of people say this, and they were amazed by the education. The Great Saying.
The Pharisees and Sadducees were arguing about Jesus, and they gathered together.
One of them was a scholar of the law, and Jesus began to test him, saying:
“My Lord, what is the Great Testament in Islamic law?”
And Jesus replied to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.”
This is the second and largest will.
The second will be like you want your head, how your close one wants his.
“And on these two commandments does the whole law and the prophets depend. Luke 10:25-28 The Messiah and the Prophet David.”
The Pharisees had gathered together, and said to Jesus:
Who is the Son of God? Who is David? And they answered: “David!”
He allows them: “Yes, how did David, with the divine inspiration of God, call out to the Lord when God spoke to him when he said:”
O Lord, my Lord: My wealth, my possessions, until I prostrate myself beneath your feet.
Yes, but if David is giving the Messiah his Lord, how can the Messiah be his son?
Not even one person responded to him with a word, and not even one of them that day allowed him to ask other questions.
Chapter twenty-two: Jesus instructs his disciples to be wary of the Pharisees and Sadducees
And Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
Wa al-ʿilma fi al-sharʿi wa al-furisiyyin hum allathi qadama bi al-ḥaqq li-yufassirū sharʿa Musa.
Yes, do what they tell you and follow it, but don't do what they ask you to do, because they don't do what they say.
They pack bundles, heavy and burdensome on people's backs, but they don't even lift a finger to carry them.
Otherwise, he went somewhere to do something so that people could see them, and to hide the gangs in their shadows and behind their faces, and to ignore their pleas.
And they will be the last places at the parties, and the designated places for prayer.
Kebghio will greet people in the market and shout at them: “O my lord.”
But we will not let anyone shout at you: “My Lord, because you are all brothers and you have one master.”
How you call a person in this world, because you have one father who is the Father in the heavens.
And don't let anyone cry out to you: O the Teacher, because you have one teacher, who is the Messiah.
And the biggest among you shall be their servant. When
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted. Luke 14:11; 18:14
Woe to you, O scholars, hypocrites, and Pharisees! Verily, they have sealed the kingdom of the heavens upon the faces of men, neither do they enter, nor do they allow anyone to enter who wishes to enter.
Woe to you, O scholars, hypocrites, and Pharisees! You devour the sustenance of deceit and prolong your quarrels, only to be revealed. The punishment for you will be severe, more so than for others. # 23‏.14 This verse is not found in many ancient manuscripts.
Woe to you, O scholars, Pharisees, and hypocrites! Indeed, if you cut down the trees of the earth and the seas, in order to bring back one Jewish man, when he is found, you shall repay him a hundredfold, more than twice as much!
Woe to you, you blind officials! The promise made in the name of God is not accepted, but the promise made in the name of gold for God’s house must be fulfilled.
O you fools and blind! But as for Hassan, is gold or the House of God more sacred?
He who swore by the butcher's knife is not believed, but he who swore by the gift above him, especially Wafi, fulfills his oath.
O people of the faith! Why is my beauty good? Is the sacrifice, or the one who receives the sacrifice, sacred?
A dolphin that swears by the butcher's block swears by it and the whole of what's above it.
And he swore by God's house, swearing by God who dwells within it.
And he swore by God, by the throne of God, and by God himself, that the one upon whom he placed his hand was right. Matthew 5:34
O you scholars, Pharisees, and hypocrites! You feast on mint, basil, and cardamom, while neglecting the important matters of the law – truth, mercy, and faith. You should have done this without leaving things to chance.
Oh, you're swatting at mosquitoes, but you're strangling whales.
Woe to you, O scholars, Pharisees, and hypocrites! You have emptied the cup and the flask from the outside and made the inside full of that which came to you from theft and greed.
Oh, blind Freecian! Purge the cup and the bowl from within, so that you may be cleansed even from the outside.
Woe to you, O scholars, Pharisees, and hypocrites! The graves, adorned from the outside, but filled with the bones of the dead and all foul things. Deeds
And so it continues until we are complete, they write to the people from outside, fearing God, but from within you are filled with hypocrisy and sins.
Woe to you, O scholars, Pharisees, and hypocrites! They inscribed the graves of prophets and adorned the gardens of the righteous.
Wektgolou: As long as we lived according to our limits, as long as we didn't share in the battle of the prophets.
And thus you bear witness with your necks that we are the sons of those who slew the prophets.
Yes, finish what your ancestors started.
Oh, the birds, Tarek al-Lafa'i! How are you going to escape the torture of hell? When?
They will tell you prophecies and judgments and scholars of the Sharia, some of whom will be killed, some will be crucified, and some will be beaten in front of your prayers, and they will flee from city to city.
Let the scourge descend upon you, the punishment for every innocent blood shed, pure blood spilled upon the earth—the blood of Abel, who was fearing God—and the blood of Zechariah ben Berechia, whom you slaughtered between the sacred place and the altar.
I’m telling you the truth: this punishment will all fall on this generation! Jesus’ love for Jerusalem.
Jerusalem, O Jerusalem! You who killed your prophets and persecuted your messengers. How many times did you want to gather your children as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you did not?
Here is your translation: “Behold, your house remains a ruin for you.”
And I told you: you won’t see me from now on until you say: “Congratulations for what’s coming in the name of the Lord.”
Chapter twenty-four, Jesus prophesied that the temple would be destroyed.
Jesus left and walked to the House of God, and his disciples were following him to show them the design of the House of God.
Jesus says: “Have you seen all this? I tell you the truth: it will not be here until heaven is upon heaven.” Signs of the End Times
Jesus was sitting with his disciples on the Mount of Olives, they came to him and asked him, “Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”
And he answers them Jesus and then: “Let someone make a mistake among you!”
A giant octopus will take many people and their names, and will say: “I am the Messiah! Many people will be mistaken.”
When you hear about the war and war news, and when you forget about it! Because all of this will happen, but this won't be the end of time.
A people will attack another people, and a kingdom will attack another kingdom, and famine will come, and an earthquake will strike in many places.
But all of that is just the wandering of pain.
The clockmaker Gislamoukoum to those who will count you and kill you. And the peoples of the world all hate you because of the name of his name. When
Many people abandon their faith and sell their belongings, and they hate each other.
Guebano bzzaf d l'nbya l'kdadibn w ghighalto bzzaf d l'nas.
And the more sins there are, the colder the love of many becomes.
But what remained steadfast, even to the darkest heart, gave him ginger. When
And He will announce this message of the Kingdom of God throughout the whole world, and it will be a testimony for all the people of the world, and that hour will come, the end of time. The great tribulation.
And you see the filth in the holy place that the prophet Daniel spoke about—the one who reads, understands!—
The clock that's in the land of the Jews who flee to the mountains,
And whoever is on the roof doesn't come down except to take what is on its roof. Luke
And he used to go to get his clothes from them.
Woe to the women who carry and the women who suckle for those few days.
Don't you run away from the winter or from Saturday.
I offer my time in exchange for a great disaster that has never been like this since the time God created the world, and it will never recur after this. The vision.
And may God not fail us. On that day, not even one person will survive among humans, but because of those whom God chose that day will be diminished.
He will only give you that hour to meet one person: The Messiah is here, or is he not? Do not doubt it.
The Gospels say that some were John the Baptist, and others who said, "The Messiah is here," and others prophets, and they did not show signs or miracles, so that they might be mistaken unless they believed those whom God had chosen.
Yeah, Hani has told you before.
Except I tell you: he is in the desert! Don't go out, or he is in the residential houses! Don't trust them. Luke.
A dolphin that strikes the lightning in the east and remains in the west, this is the birth of a human child.

And I will give you the clock, which will bring the sign of the son of man in the sky, and then they will walk all the tribes of the earth, and they will see the son of man coming from the clouds of the sky with great power and great glory. The vision.
The angels, Dihale and with them a powerful voice, to gather those whom they choose from all four corners of the earth from every position under the sky. The olives of generosity.

And so it goes until we achieve it, until you see all these things aligning, then you’ll realize it’s coming, it’s right by the door.
I'm telling you the truth: this generation won't go anywhere until these things are all agreed upon.
The path of heaven and earth is given to me, but my words have never given me. The day and the hour that are unknown.
But that day and that hour, none knows them, neither the angels of heaven, nor the sons of men, except the Father alone.
As with Noah’s time, so it will be for the coming of the son of man.
Before the Flood, people were like that, they ate and drank and got married and got married, even until Noah entered the ark.
They didn't even know that God was going to create, until the flood came and overwhelmed them all. Then the birth of the Son of Man will happen.

Chapter twenty-five of the ten lodges
And I would have saved you time, the kingdom of the heavens would be like ten fortresses, their drums beating and they went out to meet the groom. Luke.
They were five of them crazy, and five others rational.
And those five guys who lost their five-o'clock shadows without bringing oil with them.
The five old women all had their brass bracelets and oil flasks.
The groom collapsed, and everyone started attacking him until he fell asleep.
And as the night falls, you hear one voice shouting: “The groom is coming, go out to meet him!”
And they rise the nests all, and they find their little ones.
Andalusia's flirtatious whispers: Give us a little of your oil, because our fans are about to shut off.

They were going to buy oil, and the groom arrived, and they went in with him, and those who were there for the wedding position entered and closed the door.
And after the singles returned to others and the wine: Oh my Lord, oh my Lord, release us! Luke
But the groom replied: “Actually, I don’t recognize you.”
Yeah, about this thing they’re keeping quiet about, because you don’t know whether the day or the hour [when the son of humankind] # 25:13 the ending of this verse isn’t found in many ancient manuscripts
And he resembled the kingdom of the heavens to a man who would travel, and he cried out to his slaves and entrusted them with his money, Luqa. The sources of the money.
He gave one person five dirhams, another two, and the third one a single dirham, each according to their effort. And he is traveling.
That guy who got five sacks of money started selling and buying with them, and earned another five sacks.
And he gave him who had brought two dates, and he himself won two more dates.
That man who took a single box, left and dug a hole in the ground and hid the box that his master gave him.
And after a long time, the master of those slaves returned and accounted for them.
He came to see them, the ones who cheated five dinars and paid them another five dinars, and said: "Yes, my lord, you gave me five dinars, yes here are the five others I won, plus."
My esteemed sir: I have nothing to ask you, you are a very good and trustworthy slave! I was trustworthy with little, and now I will entrust you with much, yes, come and rejoice with your master.
And then, he who brought the two dates, even he and Ghail said: "Yes, my lord, you gave me two dates, yes, here are two more that I won, and they are more."
My esteemed sir: I have nothing to ask you, I am a humble and trustworthy servant! I was trustworthy with little, and now you will ask me for a lot, yes, come and rejoice with your master.
And then, he came to him with that which he had hidden, even he said to him: “My lord, I have realized that you are a cruel man, you reap what I did not sow and you gather what I did not do.”
And that's it, I crouched down and hid your jar on the ground, and now this is your fortune.
He replies to his master and ݣال says to him: "Make me your ugly slave and a disgrace! Now you’ve recognized me? You’re harvesting what I didn’t plant and gathering what I didn’t do?"
Yeah, you had to put your money with those money merchants, so when I return, I take it with the profit.

And the peoples would gather before him, and he would separate them from one another like he separates sheep from goats.
And the sheep are on the banks of the Leeman River, and the goats are on the banks of the Uisar River.
And after the King spoke to those on his left: “Come, those who have blessed him!” He established the kingdom of God for you since the day the world was created.
I was hungry and they fed me, and thirsty and they quenched me, and I was a stranger and they comforted me.
We were naked and covered, a sick person visited me, and I was imprisoned and came to me.
The clock is not responding to this one who did Murad Allah and says: “Oh God, when did you leave us, hungry and feed us? Or thirsty and drink us?”
Why did we heal you, stranger, lacking? Or did we undress and clothe you?
We were worried about you, sick or in prison? Did we come to you?
And the king replied and said to them: “I tell you the truth: whoever did this thing to one of my sons who is young, you have done it to him!”
And tell him about this one who is destined for hell, after him to those cursed ones for the eternal fire that exists for Satan and the angels with him.
A shark was hungry and didn't feed it, and it was thirsty and didn't give it to drink.
And you were a stranger to me, and you did not visit me, and naked and you did not clothe me, and sick and imprisoned and you did not come to me.
And you, the clock, will answer them and explain: Oh my God! When did you see them well or thirsty, or a stranger or naked, or sick or imprisoned, and did you not help them?
And the King and the Judge replied: We tell you the truth: because you did not do this for those whose concern is small, you do not do it for you.
These are games for the eternal wisdom, and whoever entered Murad is a game for the eternal life.
Chapter 26: Why did the Jews conspire to kill Jesus?
And Jesus finished all this speech to his students:
You know that Easter is starting in two days, and the Son of Man will be handed over to people to be crucified.
Surrender the time to gather the heads of the religious leaders and elders in the house of Caiaphas, the chief priest.
And they conspired with each other to trick Jesus and kill him.
But Galo: “We won’t do this at Christmas, so that the chaos doesn’t rise among the people.” The woman who smells of Jesus is praying.
And Jesus was in the house of Simon at Capernaum, when it was heard that he was sick.
Abbot had a man whose wife had a very expensive perfume and she slapped him on the head when he was sitting at the table eating. Luke
Melli sawfu l-tlamid d-diha hadhi li dart, ma’jebhumsh l-hal w ghallu: “’Elāsh had d-tḍwiʿ?”
This scent, this fish, could be sold for a high price, and its price would vary according to poverty.
Jesus told them, “Why are you troubling this woman? She has done nothing but show you kindness.”
This poverty will always be with you, but I won't always be with you.
And now, this scent on my own thing, it's like her bracelet to find me for the grave.
I tell you the truth: wherever people have heard this prophecy in the whole world, they will speak about this thing that this woman did and they will consider her as such. Judas the traitor agrees to submit Jesus.
I’ll give you my best translation, keeping the original formatting: Surrender the time, one of the filthy students that you called Jews Escherouti, went to the heads of the religious men.
They said: "What will you give me if I hand it over to you?" And they agreed with him on thirty silver pieces.
And he waited in Judea so that when Jesus would deliver the meal in which he would be saved, he could turn against him. The evening meal of Passover with the disciples.
And it was on the day of the unleavened bread festival, the students came to Jesus and said to him, “Where do you want us to find you for the Passover meal that you will eat with us?”
And they replied: “Servos for the city to a man and woman said: he says to us our Lord: the hour is near, and I will come to visit you with my students.”
And the medicine was delivered to them, Jesus and they found a feast of Easter.
It’s almost dinner time, Jesus is at the table to eat with the naughty students.
And he said, “I tell you the truth: one of you will betray me.”
And the students were very sad and each of them seemed lonely: "Am I a problem, sir?"
And he replies to them: “Whoever is against me, let him take the shovel, that’s the one who will hand me over!”
A human is destined to die as it is written upon him in the Book of God, but woe to that man who converts a human being, it would be better for him if he had never been born.
And he allowed it by Judas, who agreed to hand him over: “Am I not your master?” And Jesus answered him and said to him: “You have said it.” The Lord’s Supper
And they were eating, Jesus took the bread and gave thanks to God, and broke it and gave it to them, and said, “This is my body.”
And after God, He drank from it and praised Him and gave them, and they said: “They drank from it all.”
This is my blood, the blood of the covenant that will flow on the brows of many people so that sins may be wiped out.
We tell you: from today we will not drink this grape juice until the day that we will drink your new product in the kingdom of Bab».
And after they praised God, they went out and headed towards the Mount of Olives. Jesus prophesied that Peter would deny him.
Jesus, please say: "Tonight, you will all be released, because it is written in the Book of God: 'We will set free the prisoners and let loose the scattered sheep of the flock.'"
But after you have passed through [the] death, I will lead you to Galilee.” Matthew
And Peter replied, and he said to him: “Even if everyone accuses you, I never doubted you!”
And the disciple said unto Jesus: “Lord, if anyone should deny you, three times, let it be known that he is not your disciple.”
And Peter replied, “If we die, we die together! And I will not abandon you!” They all said to him. Jesus was praying in Gethsemane.
I will ransom your time to come, Jesus, with his students, for a man of paradise named Jesus, and I told them: “He is here while we go to pray!.”
And then David went with them, along with Peter and the sons of Zebedee, and he began to feel sadness and grief.
He tells them: “I’m so sad, even until death, they stayed here and kept watch over me!”
And then they waited a little while and knelt down, and he began to pray and said, “Oh my son! If I can overcome this hardship, but not as I want it, but as you want it.”
And after he returned to the students and found them sleepy, he said to Peter: “Why didn’t you stay up with me for just one hour?”
Be careful not to drop the test tube, the soul is strong but the body is weak.
He was walking for the second time and prayed, saying, “Oh, my Lord! How could this calamity be far from me without me tasting it, yes, only if it be your will.”
And he returned and found them sleeping, because sleepiness had overcome them.
And he left and walked away again, and prayed for the third time and repeated the same words.
After that, he went to the students and said to them: "Are you still sleeping and comfortable? The clock is getting close, and the son of man will hand over his hands to the sinners."
We don't explain! Look, that one who will deliver me is coming. Jesus is waiting.
While Jesus was still speaking, the Jews, one of the twelve disciples among them, along with a large group armed with swords and spears, rushed at him. The heads of the religious leaders and elders of the people seized him.
And that man who handed it to you gave you one sign and to us: “The man we’re after is that one, grab him!”
And he gave the hour near Judea to Jesus and then he said: “Peace be upon you, my Lord!” And he bowed.
He says to him, “Why did you come to my friend!” And they drew near to Jesus and seized him.
One of them was like those who were with Jesus, taking up his staff and the sword of his companion, and striking the slave of the leader of the Pharisees, while cutting off his ear.
And to Jesus said, “Turn your sword against yourselves! Whoever opposes the sword will die by it.”
What do you think I can't cry about Baghi and the 14th squadron of the angel army anymore?
But how can we verify the words in the Book of God and what is said that this must be so?
And you, take the hour now, Jesus to the Church: “What are you bringing with swords and spears to bind you like a sheep? I was with you all day long, teaching in the house of God, and you did not bind me! Luke
But all of that happened in order to fulfill what was written in the prophets' books. And at that time, all the students were present and fled. Jesus in the court of the Jews
But those who seized Jesus, they followed him until Caiaphas, the chief priest of the Pharisees, gathered the scholars and the elders.
Peter followed him from a distance, all the way to the house of the head priest, where he was entering and paying the servants to see what was going on in the end.
And they were the leaders of the religious men, and the heads of the court, conspiring against a false testimony of Jesus in order to kill him.
But they didn't find them, even though there were many false witnesses. In the end, two witnesses testified.
And Gholo: “This man, Ghall: I can connect the house of God and a fetus, a newborn.” John
He rises the head of the religious leaders and the disciples of Jesus: “Will you not answer anything at all in regard to what these men testify against you?”
But Jesus remained silent, and said to the chief of the priests, “You did not come to me with the living God, but you said to me, ‘Who are you, that I may believe in you?’”
And Jesus replied, “You have declared it! But I tell you, whoever believes in me will do likewise. For I myself have also done what the Father has taught me, and I am not ashamed. For I am now telling you what the Father has taught me; he himself did not shame me, but he is the one who validates me.”
He bought the watch, the head of religious figures, who said: “This is blasphemy! We have nothing left to do with the witnesses, we will listen to his words of blasphemy.”
“Is that all you’ve seen?” he replied, and Galo said, “He deserves to die!”
And they threw themselves on his face and struck him, and some of them splashed him with water.
Peter asked, “The Lord Jesus foretold this to us, who is it that struck you?”
And Peter Galis was outside, at the doorway of the house, and a maidservant came to him and said to him: “I used to be with Jesus from Galilee!”
And he denied in front of everyone who was present, and Ghallal: “I didn’t understand what you were saying!”
And then, he walked to the entrance of the house and saw another worker and said to those who were pretending: “This one was also with Jesus the Nazarene!”
And Peter denied it again, swearing vehemently: “I don’t know this man!”
And after a little while, those who were standing came and said to Peter: “Without a doubt, one of you is like this, writing against you with your stench!”
And he started cursing and swearing and saying: “I don’t know this man at all!” And at that moment, the chicken squawked.
And Peter thought about the words that Cephas had said to him about Jesus: “Before you proclaim me three times, the rooster will crow and deny me.” And he went out and wept a lot.
Chapter Twenty-seven
Early morning, the leaders of the religious men and elders of the people all agreed that Jesus should be killed.
And he satisfied himself with it and gave it to him, handing it over to the governor, Pontius Pilate. Judas the Galilean drew water.
When Judas saw the chief priests and elders who had handed Jesus over to him, he regretted it and returned thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, as it is written.
He says: "I sinned by saving a person who is innocent." He tells him: "This isn't our business, leave it alone."
Judah threw a silver cock into the temple of God, and afterward he walked and hung up his head.
And the leaders of the religious men said: “I will not put it in the box of God’s house, because it is the price of a man’s blood.”
They agreed to buy a hectare of clay and run a private school.
And that's what people say about this land, even to this day.
And the angel of the Lord told Jeremiah, “Take thirty pieces of silver, the amount that was agreed upon by two of the people of Israel to buy a flask of oil.”
And He said to them, “These four fields of Al-Khwari, as the Lord commanded me.” Jesus before the governor Pontius Pilate
And Jesus stood before the ruler and said, “Who is my kingdom for?” And Jesus answered him, “You say that you know.”
They were accused by the leaders of religion and elders, but he didn't even respond to them.
And Pilate said: “Have you not heard that all these things were testified about you?”
Jesus didn't respond with a single word, and the governor was amazed by that.
And it was customary with the governor that every Easter he would release one of the prisoners that the people wanted.
They had a rooster named Joshua Parabas. He was a famous prisoner at the time.
And so he gathered the people and asked them broadly: “Whoever you want me to divorce for you, should it be Joshua Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Christ?”
Then Pilate, who knew that it was handed over because of jealousy among them, said to Jesus, “Take him away, for he is deserving of death.”
Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, and he told his wife, “This man has done no crime, for I have been troubled by dreams all day long.”
But the heads of the religious leaders and elders stirred up the groups of people to demand that Pilate release to them Barabbas and kill Jesus.
And Pilate said to them, “Which of you wants to kill this man?” And they said, “Barabbas.”
He said to them, “So, who is this Jesus whom you are saying that the Messiah is?” And they all said, “His crucifixion!”
They said: "What bad luck!" but they added and said to him: "Damn it!"
Pilate saw Jesus and that nothing benefited him, and the crowd was not lessening, so he let him go, and washed his hands in front of the people and said, “I am innocent of this man’s blood. You are responsible for it!”
And the whole people respond to him and say: "Don't leave our blood and the blood of our children on you!"
And Philip said to him, “Let us go to the other side, for it is getting dark, and they are in trouble.” Then Jesus said to them, “Come.” And they got into the boat immediately, and that night was dark. The soldiers laughed at Jesus.
The guards of the ruler Jesus gathered at the ruler’s palace, and the entire military force assembled upon it.
Wa'rawah wa labsuhu silah hamr.
And they placed a crown of thorns on his head, and put a staff in his right hand, and began to rock before him and laugh at him and say, “Peace be upon you, O king of the Jews!”
He hit him and then smashed the cane on his head.
And after they mocked him, they took his sandals and dressed him in his clothes and led him away to be crucified. Jesus was crucified.
They were being pursued out of the city, and they met a man from Kairouan named Smaïn, and they needed him to raise the cross of Jesus.
And they reached the position that I called the Jawbone, which means the position of the skull.
And they gave him wine mixed with a herb called the bitter one, and when it entered him, he didn't want to drink it.
They hardened and divided their belongings after they beat them with a stick.
And they kept saying he was a liar to him.
And on the drug, above me, one of the plates was written with the charges against him: “This is Jesus, King of the Jews.”
He had a solid watch with two straps, one on his left wrist and one on his right.
They were the people who were passing by to praise him, and they were covering their faces.
Waqiqlu: “If you dare to desecrate the House of God and rebuild it in seven years, I will descend from the cross and strike you!” Matthew
And they were the leaders of the religious scholars and the jurists and the elders, so that they would laugh at him and say:
They escaped the people, but he couldn't save himself! But if he were the king of Israel, he would descend from above the cross and they would believe in him!
Look, it’s up to God! Yes, he’ll redeem him now, unless he wants to, then he says: “I am God’s son!”
Even the charcoal that was hardened with him was treated like a different kind of ash. Jesus’s death.
Darkness fell upon the entire country due to the intoxication of the day, even until the third hour [of the evening].
With his three o'clock in the afternoon headache, Jesus said in a loud voice: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” Which means: “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?”
They listened to one of those who were standing there and said: “He’s shouting at Elijah.”
One of them ran and grabbed a piece of cloth, soaked it in vinegar, and put it in the head of a reed, spreading it out for him to drink.
And he says to the others: "Let's wait and see if Elijah will come to save him!"
And Jesus repeated once again in a loud voice and died.
The two white veils of God's house, from top to bottom. And earthquakes and the cracking of rocks.
And the graves became sweet, and many of these holy people followed them from death.
Get out of your graves after Jesus came forth from the dead, and enter into Jerusalem the holy city, and there you will be filled with many people.
Melli el-Qa'id el-'askar wa el-'assa'a elli kay'su ma'ah 'ala yeshou, shafu ez-zalzal wa ghay'a daakhi elli jira, tkhallu bezaf wa ghallu: "Fihqiqte haddar el-rajl kan wled Allah."
And there were many women who followed Jesus from Galilee, and among them were women who were speaking against Him, seeing Him from afar. Luke
Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee.
And in the evening, a man dressed in clothes from Ramah came, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus.
And this man entered and approached the governor Pilate, asking him to give him Jesus’s property. And at that hour, Governor Pilate ordered them to give it to him.
And Joseph's shroud and coffin were white and pure.
He placed her in the new tomb he had carved from the rock, and walked away, leaving a large room behind the tomb door.
Mary Magdalene and Mary the wife of Cleophas were beside the tomb weeping.
And the next day, after the day in which the heads of the rabbis and the Pharisees gathered at Pilate
And he said, “My Lord, when he was alive, that liar said that after three years he would send.” When…
Yes, give your order for it to be on the grave until the third day, so that his students don't come out at night to steal it and say to the people: “It has died from the hand of death!” And this lie will be the last one, taken from the hand of the enemy.”
He told them, “You have an ointment. Yes, go, put it on the tomb as you wish.”
He went around the lantern of the tomb chamber and circled it with the flies.
Chapter twenty-two, Jesus followed from the dead.
It was Saturday morning and the first light of the day over the Mount of Olives had appeared. Mary Magdalene and Mary the other came to see the tomb.
In a moment of inattention, a strong earthquake struck, whereupon the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and knocked on the door of the tomb and touched it.
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were like snow.
And the scorpions trembled with fear and became like the dead.
But the angel Ghil for the two women said: “Do not be afraid! I know that you are turning against Jesus who was crucified,”
There's no way here, since he was dead like that. I go to see the place where he was put.
Let me tell you a story about a beautiful and talented student whose life was marked by death, and you’ll soon find yourselves in Galilee, wondering where you’ll find him. Yes, I’m just letting you know.
Get out, you fools, dripping wet from the grave, both scared and overjoyed, and go run to tell the news to his community.
And he meets with them by chance and says to them: “Peace be upon you!” And they added to him, and they prostrate themselves before his feet and bow down to him.
Jesus said, "Don't argue! Go, tell my brothers in Galilee, 'Go to the region of Garima, for there I will be seen.'" The witnesses told them about what had happened.
The women were leaving, some of the grave diggers went to the city and informed the heads of the religious men about what happened.
And you gather with the elders and consult, and you lavish the army with a lot of money.
Please listen: "Someone stole them in the night while we were asleep, because of the communication."
Otherwise, the governor will suppress the news, we will convince him and he won't expect anything good for you."
And as for the money and medicine, they told them how to get it, and this news was mourned by the Jews until this day. Jesus charged his disciples
As for the students, they went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had them
They knelt before him, but only a few of them complained.
And they drew near to Him, and He spoke to them, saying, “My Father has given Me all things, and no one is hindered from coming to Me.”
Yes, Sergio and Dero called from the nations all of them, and they gave them the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Works
And they taught them to do everything you asked them to do, and here I am with you, Liam, all the way to the end of time.”
Chapter One: John the Baptist prepared the way for Jesus.
This is the Bedouin of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah:
The wind howls in the desert and the dunes: “I will make my messenger appear before you, the one who will show you the way.”
And John, when Jesus came to the wilderness, baptized the people and proclaimed to them the baptism of repentance that God would forgive their sins. And they found the way of the Lord, and followed his paths.
And all the people from the lands of the Jews and Jerusalem came upon him, and they were casting votes against him at his hand over the Jordan, and they were confessing their sins before him.
John Kilbs had sticky fingers made of camel hair, and he tied himself with a leather belt, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
And to let people know and to say: “Someone is coming after me, who is stronger than me, and we don’t deserve to bow down just so he can tie our turbans.”
“I have entrusted you with my little one, but he will be entrusted to the Spirit.” – John baptized Jesus
And Philip brought Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee, and John baptized him in the Jordan.
And he sold me the watch he took out of the flood—he saw the sky, it was beautiful, and God descended upon him like a dove.
And you will hear the one voice from heaven saying, “I am the Lord, he is my beloved, with whom I am well pleased.” Matthew 3:17; 12:18; Mark 9:7; Luke 3:22. Satan is trying to tempt Jesus.
I surrender my time to prevent you from going out, may God, Jesus, go to the desert.
And forty days passed, and Satan tested him in it. And the demons were dwelling in him, and the angels were mocking him. Jesus preached in Galilee.
And after John was imprisoned, Jesus went to the country of Galilee to proclaim the word of God.
WGL: “This is the time is finished and the Kingdom of God is near, yes, repent and believe in the Gospel.” Matthew 3:2 Jesus chooses his disciples, John
Jesus was walking along the Sea of Galilee, when he saw Simon and Andrew mending their net. They were fishermen of the lake.
He says to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”
They took the clock from their window and followed it.
He had increased a little while watching Yaqub, a mischievous boy, and Yohanna, his brother, in the boat repairing their nets.
And don't worry about them, Jesus, they're making each other silly with the servants in the boat and following him. Jesus is healing a lying man.
I went to Kafarnahum. And it wasn't Sabbath, so Jesus went to the synagogue and began to teach.
People were amazed by his teaching, because he taught them as if only one person, with authority, not like the scholars of the Sharia.
And he was one of the men who lived in the madhouse, seemed like he was going crazy.
Waqiq: “What do you want from us, Jesus the Nazarene? Why did you come to kill us? I know who is the sacred one of God!”
Jesus rose and said to the man and the woman, “Be silent and come out of the man!”
And he threw the demon to the ground and began to roll, and the demon struggled with all his might and came out of him.
Everyone was astonished and they started gossiping among themselves: “What is this? This is new teaching being taught by the authorities, even madness obeys when they order it!”
The news spread that Jesus was sick in every house in Galilee. Jesus healed Simon Peter and many people.
Jesus went out with James and John from the House of Prayer, walking to the house of Simon and Andrew.
And Nusaiba Semaan was lying in bed with a fever, and they were telling Jesus about her.
She came closer to her and held it to her hand, and he stood up. The heater and their stoves were also brought to her.
And he went to the evening with the setting of the sun, bringing people to Jesus, the sick and those possessed by madness.
The people of the city were gathering by the door.
Jesus healed many sick people of various illnesses, and drove out many demons from people, and he didn't let the demons speak because he knew them. Jesus was teaching.
Jesus had been preparing himself beforehand and went out and sat in a deserted place, and he began to pray.
Samu'an and those who were with him started to turn around.
They found him, pale and weak: "Everyone turns against you!"
He says to them, "Let's go to the square nearby to tell everyone the good news, because I have come for that."
And he walked to announce the good news of their prayer, and to make people go crazy in all the villages of Galilee. Matthew 4:23; 9:35 Jesus was healing a man with a demon.
And Jesus was with a man who had a paralytic, lying on a bed, and he was covered with many diseases. And they said to Him, “Sir, your servant is clean.”
She placed her hand on him and touched him gently: "I want, yes, be pure!"
And that clock turned away from his front and went to Tahir.
And Jesus said much so that people would not believe in him, and he told him in his own words:
Be careful not to say anything to anyone! But go and show your soul to the man and give him the cleansing that Moses commanded, so that it may be a testimony for them.
But that man left and seemed to be telling people about all that had happened. This news, until Jesus was unable to enter any city before the people, and remained outside in the empty places. And people came to him from every direction.
Chapter two, Jesus heals a paralytic
And after that, Yeshu returned to Capernaum, and it was heard that He was in the house.
And a large crowd gathered, until there was no place in front of the door. And he began to teach them the words of God.
They brought him a man, paralyzed from the waist up, a man of men.
They couldn't get close to him because of the crowds of people. They lifted the roof over the place where he was lying, and opened the mattress he was in, and pulled out the paralyzed man.
Matthew saw Jesus healing a paralytic, saying, “Your sins are forgiven.”
And they had learned much of the law, and they put it in their hearts:
Why does this man speak like this, and say blasphemous words? Who can forgive sins without God alone?
Jesus once told John of the Spirit that he knew the thoughts of their heart, and he told them, “Why do you have these thoughts in your heart?”
It's easy, it's said to the paralyzed person: We forgive your sins, or it's said to him: Get up, take your blanket and go?
But you should know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” And to the paralytic he said:
Let him say: Go to your bed and go to your house!
He stood up, shook his bed, and went out in front of the people. And they all were astonished and praised God and said: "We have never seen anything like this!" Jesus chooses when.
And Jesus returned to the shore of the Sea of Galilee, and a crowd of people came to him, and he began to teach them.
Melly was with Daiz who saw a man named Lawi, son of Halfa Gals, in the tax office, and he was telling him: "Follow me." And Wana followed him.
And Jesus was eating with Levi, and people were eating with him and with his disciples, many people from the tax collectors and the sinners, because there were many people among them who followed him.
Melli sawfo l- علما d- l-shara d-l-farisiyeen bley hu kiyakil ma’l-mudnabeen wa malin l-zedaya, ɣalou l-tlamde: «Alash kiyakil ma’l-malin l-zedaya wa l-mudnabeen?»
And Jesus heard them, and Ghal and him said: “It is not the sick who need a doctor, but the patients. I did not come to weep for those who fear God, but for the sinners.” The question of fasting
John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came to Jesus and said, “Why do your disciples and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”
And Jesus answered them, “What can the guests who were invited to the wedding fast for while the groom is with them? The groom is with them, and they cannot fast.”
But there will come a time when the groom will be taken from among them, and by God, that day will be difficult for them.
Even if one doesn't mend an old garment with the edge of a new top, because if they do, the new patch will shrink and the tear will get bigger.
Even no one is making the new wine in leather vats in front, because if anyone does that, the new wine will ferment the vats and the wine and the leather will be lost. But the new wine is kept in leather vats of new leather.” Jesus is teaching on the Sabbath
And one Saturday # 2:23, which is the day of rest and worship for the Jews
The Pharisees came and tested him: “See! Why are your disciples doing things that they shouldn’t on the Sabbath?” Jesus went past them while they were cutting the wheat and going along.
Jesus replied to them, “Didn’t you read what David said when he was hungry and desperate?
And how did he enter the house of God, when he arrived at the one who was the president of the religious men, and both of the bread that they were offering to God, which was not meant to be eaten by anyone except the religious men alone, and did he give some of it to the men who were with him?
Let them say: “On Saturday, the man is treated, not a man who is treated on Saturday.”
“The son of the man is Lord of the Sabbath.”
Chapter Three: Jesus Healing on the Sabbath
And Jesus entered the house again, and there was a man lying sick, paralyzed.
The Pharisees were present, watching Jesus to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath, and to find a charge against him.
Jesus said to the man whose hand was paralyzed: “Rise up and walk!”
He says to the Pharisees: “What is permissible on the Sabbath day, do we do good or do evil, do we set ourselves free or do we kill ourselves? And they remained silent.”
And he looked at them, angry, and he was very sad about the hardness of their hearts, and he said to the man: “Extend your hand!” and he extended his hand and it was corrected perfectly.
The elders and the Pharisees went out and began to consult with Herod, how they might kill him. Many people were following Jesus.
Jesus went out with his disciples to the shore of the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd followed them from Galilee and from Jerusalem.
And from Jerusalem and Edom, and from the eastern region of the Jordan Valley and from Galilee as far as Sidon and Tyre. All these people had come to Jesus because they had heard about the things he was doing.
And for the supplies for them to exist a boat so that people do not crowd on it, Mark.
Many of them had recovered, and now all the patients were starting to dispute him, wanting him to treat them.
And those afflicted with madness, who saw Jesus falling at his feet and cried out to him: “He is the Son of God!”
But Jesus commissioned them and insisted upon them not revealing to anyone who he was. Jesus chose the disciples.
And he went out to a mountain and shouted at the men who had been chosen for him, as they were coming to him.
Choose twelve messengers whose names are Paul, that they may go with him and preach the gospel
And they have the authority to exorcise possession.
This is what it says: Simon who Jesus called Peter.
And Jacob Zebdi and his brother John, whom they named Jesus Bartholomew, which means sons of thunder.
Andrew and Philip and Bartholomew, Matthew and Thomas, James and Jude and Theodore and Simon, nicknamed the Zealot.
And the Essene Jew who is going to betray Jesus. Jesus and Beelzebul.
And after that, Jesus walked to one of the houses, and a crowd gathered around him, a company of people, until he and his disciples were no longer able to eat.
The family brought the news about Jesus, and they came to take him because they said, “He’s completely lost it!”
And the scholars of the Law who came from Jerusalem said: “There is Baal Zebul, and there he drives out the madness of the master of demons.” Matthew
And Jesus cried out at the scholars of the law and spoke with them about the disciple and told them: “How can a demon cast out a demon?”
Except for one kingdom that was divided and they began to fight among themselves, that kingdom wouldn't be able to stay stable.
Otherwise, there’s a family that’s splitting up and they’re starting to fight among themselves; that family won’t be able to stay together.
