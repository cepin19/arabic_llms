Who is the greatest?
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”
Then Jesus called a child and stood him among them.
He said, “Truly, I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.”
Therefore, whoever is humble like this little child shall be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
“Whoever accepts a child like this as their own, accepts me.” – A warning against stumbling.
Whoever finds one of these little faithful believers in me, it would be better for him if a stone of the grindstone were placed around his neck and thrown into the sea, so that he would drown!
Woe to the world for these stumbles that must come, but woe to those who cause them!
Therefore, if your hand or your foot is drawing you toward sin, cut it off and throw it away! It is better to enter eternal life, having cut off your hand or your foot, than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into eternal fire.
And though your eye drives you to sin, pluck it out and cast it far from you! For it is better to enter life with one eye, than to have two eyes and be cast into hellfire. The lost sheep.
And Jesus said, “Beware that you do not despise one of these humble disciples. For I tell you that the angels entrusted with guarding them see the face of the Father in heaven always.”
For the Son of Man came to seek and save those who are lost.
What do you say about a man who has a hundred sheep, loses one of them, and does not leave the ninety-nine sheep on the mountain so that he may go and find the lost one?
I tell you the truth, when he finds him, he will be happier with him than with the ninety-nine lost cows.
Also, your father in heaven does not want one of these humble disciples of mine to perish. Your brother is well.
If your brother is wrong, go to him and speak to him privately. If he listens to you, you have won your brother.
But if he does not listen to you, then take one or two with you, so that a matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. #two or three. 16:18 See Deuteronomy 19:15.
If you refuse to listen to them, tell the church. If you refuse to listen to the church, then you must treat him as you treat an idolater and a tax collector.
I say to you the truth, that all that you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and all that you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
I tell you the truth, if two of you agree on anything by prayer, that my Father in heaven will grant you what you ask for.
Because if two or three are gathered together in my name, I am among them. Forgiveness without limits.
Then Peter came to Jesus and said to Him, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother who trespasses against me, until seven times?”
Jesus said to him, “Not seven times, but seventy times seven.” #seventy… times. 22:18 That is, without limit.
Therefore, the kingdom of the heavens can be likened to that of a king who has decided to settle his accounts with his slaves.
And when he began to clear his accounts, a man arrived who was owed a huge sum of money. #a huge sum. 24:18 Literally: “Ten thousand talents or quintals, which amounts to approximately 300,000 kilograms of coins used at that time.”
And since he had nothing to pay his debt with, the gentleman decided to sell his debtor along with his wife and children, and all that he owned, and use the proceeds to pay off the debt.
Then the servant prostrated himself before the king, knelt on his knees, and begged him, saying, “Have mercy on me, and I will pay you back every debt.”
The gentleman felt pity for him, and completely canceled his debt, letting him go.
As he was going, he found one of his companions was a slave, and he owed him a small sum. He seized his neck and began to strangle him, saying to him, ‘I have no debt to you.’
The servant prostrated himself at his Lord’s feet, and beseeched Him, saying, “Have patience with me, and I will pay what is due to me.”
But he refused that, instead taking him and throwing him into prison until he paid every penny.
When the slaves saw what had happened, they were very saddened, and they went to tell their master everything that had occurred.
“So her mistress called her and said to her, ‘You evil slave, haven’t you forgiven me all that you owed me because you begged of me.’”
But didn't you have to show mercy to your fellow slave as you showed me?
And his wife was very angry, and he surrendered her to be punished so that she would pay back all her debt.
“Your father Samawi will treat you in the same way, unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart.”
Union in marriage
After Jesus had finished speaking about these things, he left the region of Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan River.
And he followed him by a large crowd of people, and they were healed there.
Some Pharisees came to Jesus trying to test him, and said, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”
And Jesus answered and said, “Did you not read in the Scripture that God from the beginning made them male and female? #created … and female. 4:19 From Genesis 1: 27, 5: 2.
Then he said, “For this reason a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and they become one flesh.” #He leaves…one. 5:19 from the Book of Genesis 2:24.
And by this, they will not be two after this, but one. No one should separate those whom God has joined together.
They said to him, “Why, if Moses commanded that a woman should receive a divorce certificate, #divorce certificate. 7:19 See the book of Deuteronomy 24: 1. should you divorce her?”
Jesus replied, “Moses allowed this because of your stubborn hearts, but it was not so at first.”
Therefore, I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for her fault of adultery, and marries another, commits adultery.
His students said to him, “If this is the case between a husband and wife, then it is better not to marry!”
Jesus said to them, “Not everyone can accept this teaching unless God gives them the ability to do so.”
There are men who cannot marry because they were born without the ability to marry. There are men who cannot marry because people have taken away their ability to marry. There are men who have chosen not to marry for the kingdom of heaven. Whoever accepts this teaching, let them accept it. Jesus welcomes children.
Then they brought to him children, that he might touch them and bless them. But his disciples rebuked them.
And Jesus said to them, “Let the children come to me; do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.”
Then Jesus laid his hands upon them, and he departed from there. The Rich Man's Burden
And a man came to Jesus and asked him, “Teacher, what good deed must I do to obtain eternal life?”
Jesus replied, “Why do you ask me about what is good? Do you not know that there is no one good except God? But if you want to be eternal life, you must do the work of the commandments.”
The man said, “What commandments are these?” Jesus replied, “Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal.”
Do not bear witness to falsehood, honor your father and mother. › #Do not murder… and your mother. 19:19 From Exodus 20:12-16 and Deuteronomy 5:16-20. And ‹Love your neighbor as yourself.› #Love… yourself. 19:19 Referring to the Gospel of Luke 10:25-37, we understand that by ‘neighbor’ is meant every person in need of help. As you love yourself. › #Love… yourself. 19:19 From Leviticus 19:18. »
The young man said to him, “I obey all these commandments; what more is required of me?”
And Jesus said to him, “If you would be complete, sell all that you have and give it to the poor. Then you will have a treasure in heaven. And come, and follow me.”
And when the young man heard that, he went away sorrowful, for he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly, I tell you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.”
I tell you again that it is easier for a needle to pass through a needlehole than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
And when his disciples heard these things, they were amazed, and said, “Who then can be saved?”
Jesus looked at them and said to them, “Nothing is impossible for those who believe.”
Then Peter said to him, “Look, we have left everything and followed you! What will we have then?”
Jesus said to them, “Truly, I say to you, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne in the new age, you who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones, to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.”
Whoever leaves a house or brothers or sisters or a father or mother or children for My sake and the sake of the Word, I will give them a hundredfold in return, and I will grant them eternal life.
Many are the first people who will become the last, and many are the last people who will become the first.
Like the workers of the vineyard
It is like the kingdom of the heavens, as a man who owns an estate, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
I agreed with the workers to pay them one dinar for each day, and then sent them to work in his vineyard.
The owner of the generosity left around nine o'clock and saw some men standing in the market area doing nothing.
He said to them, “Go and work in my vineyard, and I will give you the wage you deserve.”
They went to work in the Carmel. “And he left again around noon, and also around three, and hired more workers.”
Around five o'clock, he went out again, and found others standing in the market area. He asked them, “Why did you stand here all day without doing anything?”
They said to him, “No one has hired you.” He said to them, “Go work in my vineyard yourselves.”
At the end of the day, the benefactor said to his agent, “Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last one to arrive and ending with the first one.”
They arrived at five o'clock, and each of them took a dinar.
Then came those who had been hired first, and they thought they would take more, and each of them took a dinar as well.
They took it, and they began to complain about the generous man.
They say: ‘Those who rented the last shift only worked one hour, and they paid them as much as they paid us, even though we worked all day in the sun!’
He said the owner of the generosity to one of them: “I have not wronged you, my friend! Didn’t we agree to work for one dollar?”
Take your reward and go. I want to give to the one you hired by the end of the day, the same reward I gave you.
Am I not entitled to do whatever I want with what I own? Or are you jealous of me because I get along with others?
“Thus it becomes that the first people are the last people, and the last people are the first people.” Jesus announces his death and resurrection.
While Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, he took the twelve aside and said to them:
Here we go to the city of Jerusalem, where the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes, who will condemn him to death.
They will hand him over to the non-believers so that they may mock him, flog him, and crucify him. But on the third day he will rise again from the dead. The Greater One serves
Then her son Zibdi’s mother came to him with her two sons, and she prostrated herself before him to ask him for something.
Jesus said to her, “What do you want?” She said to him, “Grant that these two sons of mine may sit in your kingdom, one at your right hand and the other at your left.”
Then Jesus said, “You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink my cup?” #The cup. 22:20 That is, the cup of suffering and anguish. Also in verse 23. They said to him, “Yes, we can.”
He said to them: “You shall drink my cup, and you shall sit beside me on my right hand and on my left hand; and whoever you wish to invite to me, let him come.”
And when the ten remaining heard this demand, they were very angry with the two brothers.
Then Jesus called them and said to them, “You know that the rulers of the nations exercise absolute dominion over them, and their great men have power over them.”
But this should not be between you, but whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant.
And whoever desires to be foremost among you, it is for him that he be a servant of the rest.
And the Son of Man came to serve, not to be served, and to give his life as a ransom for many. Jesus heals the blind.
As they were leaving the city of Jericho, they were followed by a large crowd of people.
And there were two blind men sitting by the road. And when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!”
The people were angered at them and ordered them to be silent, but they raised their voices even more: “O Master, O son of David, have mercy on us.”
Jesus stopped and said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?”
He said, “Sir, open our eyes.”
Jesus opened his eyes, and touched them, and saw clearly and followed him.
The king lives.
And when they drew near to the city of Jerusalem, and came to a village called Bethpage, near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,
He said to them, “Go to the village in front of you. You will find a small donkey tied with its mother beside it, put them on and bring them to me.”
And if one of them says to you something, say to him: “The Lord needs it, and He will return it to them soon.”
This happened in order to fulfill what the Prophet said.
Tell the beloved Zion city: #The beloved Zion. 5:21 Literally “Daughter Zion.” ‹If your king comes to you, humbly and riding on a donkey, a small donkey, a beast of burden prepared for work.›”
The students went and worked as Jesus said.
Then they came to him with a small donkey and his mother, and he sat on them.
Most people were spreading their blankets on the road. But others were cutting branches from trees and laying them on the road.
And the crowds among those who were walking before him and behind him were shouting, “Long live the King! #Long live the King. 9:21 Literally: “Hoshua-na.” And its meaning in Hebrew: “Now خلص.” And it is most likely here a shout of praise for the worship of God and his King Messiah. Repeated in chapter 15. Long live son of David. “Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.” Long live the King in his glory.”
When Jesus entered the city of Jerusalem, the whole city trembled. And the people were saying, “Who is this man?”
And the crowds that followed were saying, “This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth, a town in Galilee.” Jesus in the Temple
Then Jesus entered the court of the temple and drove out all those who were selling and buying in the court of the temple. He overturned the tables of the money changers and scattered the cushions of the pigeon sellers.
He told them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer’ #MyHouse…prayer. 13:21 from the book of Isaiah 56: 7. But you are turning it into ‘a den of thieves!’ #DenOfThieves. 13:21 from the book of Jeremiah 7: 11.”
And some blind and lame came to him in the court of the temple, and he healed them.
And the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonders he was doing, and they said nothing, but to astonish themselves and the crowd, for they could not pronounce anything good about him, and he said to them, “Why do you question me? If I cast out the Spirit, I will cast out demons; but if I do not cast out the Spirit, he will not leave this house. For this is what happened in the prophet Elisha when he cried out, ‘Elias, father of the prophet, my lord!’ And the Lord called the spirit into the body of Elisha, and Elisha prophesied. Now, see that the child is not demon-possessed, but that he is as your brethren.”
And Jesus answered, “Yes, but did you read in the Scripture, ‘From the mouths of infants and sucklings you have prepared for us repentance’?”
Then Jesus left them and went out of the city to the village of Bethania, and spent the night there. The power of faith
And as he was going early in the morning into the city, he was hungry.
And he saw a fig tree by the roadside, so he went to it, but he found only leaves on it, and he said to it: “You will not bear fruit afterward.” Immediately the fig tree withered.
And when the disciples saw this, they were amazed and asked him, “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?”
He replied to them, “Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only be able to do what I did with the fig tree, but if you say to this mountain, ‘You shall be lifted up and cast into the sea,’ your word will be done.”
And whatever you ask in prayer, having faith, you will receive. Doubting Jesus’ authority
Jesus went to the vicinity of the Temple, and the chief priests and elders came to him while he was teaching, and said to him, “What is your authority to do these things, and who gave you power?”
And Jesus answered them and said, “I will also ask you, answer me. Tell me, by what authority do you perform these things?”
“Where did John’s baptism come from? From God or from men?” And they began to discuss it among themselves and say, “If we say it came from God, they will ask us, ‘Why did you not believe in him?’”
And if we say that she is one of the people, then we fear the people, for they all consider John a prophet.
Therefore they answered Jesus and said, “We do not know.” Then Jesus said to them, “Neither do I tell you any authority by which I do these things.” Like the two sons.
And Jesus said, “What do you say of the following parable: A man had two sons. He went to the first and said to him, ‘Son, go into my vineyard.’ ”
“The son replied, ‘I don’t want to go.’ But he wasn’t bothered and went anyway.”
Then the father went to his other son and asked him himself. The son replied, “Yes, sir, I will go.” But he did not go.
“Which of the two brothers did the father want? They said, ‘The first.’ He said to them, ‘I tell you the truth, my collectors of taxes and customs officials will overtake you to the kingdom of God.’”
John the Baptist came to show you the way of righteousness, but you did not believe in him. But tax collectors and sinners believed in him. And when you saw what they did, you did not repent and believe in him. Like the son of the wealthy man
And listen to another parable: There was a man who owned a field, and he planted vines and surrounded them with a fence and dug a wine press, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to some farmers and traveled far away.
When the time came to harvest the grapes, he sent his slaves to the farmers to obtain their share of the grapes.
But the peasants seized their slaves, beat one of them, killed another, and stoned another.
So the owner sent slaves more than he had sent in the first time. And the peasants treated them the same way.
Finally, his son sent him, and he said to himself, “They will respect my son.”
But when the peasants saw that this was the master’s son, they consulted among themselves and said, ‘This is the heir, let us kill him so that we may seize his inheritance.’
They seized him and threw him out into the field and killed him.
“What do you think the owner of the estate will do with those peasants when he returns?”
They said to him, “He will destroy them in a terrible way because they are wicked, and then he will give generosity to other peasants who give him fruit in the harvest season.”
And Jesus said to them, “Did you not read what was written: ‘The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone’?” Then Jesus said to them, “This was done intentionally, that the word of God might be fulfilled.”
Therefore I say to you: the kingdom of God is taken from you, and is given to a nation that yields fruit meet for the kingdom.
Whoever falls on this stone is shattered, and whoever makes the stone fall on him is crushed!
When the chief priests and Pharisees heard such things as Jesus said, they knew that he spoke about them.
So they tried to arrest him, but they were afraid of the people who considered Jesus a prophet.
Like a wedding feast
And Jesus spoke to them again with parables, saying:
It is like the kingdom of the heavens is a king holding a wedding feast for his son.
And the king sent his servants to summon the guests to the wedding feast, but they did not want to come.
Then the king sent out other slaves and said to them, “Tell those invited that the banquet is ready. My fattened cattle and my fine cream have been slaughtered. And everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.”
But the guests didn't care, and each of them went on their way. One went to work in his field, and another to his trade.
The rest of them, seize the king’s slaves and strike them, kill them.
Then the king was enraged and sent his army to kill those murderers and burn their city.
Then the king said to his servants, “The wedding feast is ready, but those guests did not deserve it.”
So go to the street corners and invite everyone you find to attend the wedding feast.
They went out into the streets, and gathered all whom they found, whether evil or good, until the hall of the banquet was filled with guests.
And when the king entered to see the guests, he saw a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
The king said to him: “My friend, how did you enter here without wearing wedding clothes, but the man remained silent.”
The king said to his servant: “Bind his feet and hands, and cast him out into the darkness, where people weep and gnash their teeth.”
Many claim, but only a few choose. The Pharisees are trying to trap Jesus.
The Pharisees went away and gathered themselves together to consult how they might trap Jesus by what he said.
So they sent to him their disciples with some of the Pharisees from the party of Herod, and they said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and that you walk in the way of God with all truth. And that you do not condone anyone, because you do not look at the status of men.”
“And tell us your opinion, is it permissible to pay taxes to the Caesar, or not?”
But Jesus knew their evil intent, and said to them, “You unbelievers, why do you try to catch me?”
Show me the currency you are using. Then they brought him a denarius.
He said to them, “To whom does this painting and this name engraved on the coin belong?”
They said to him, “These are for the Caesar.” He said to them, “If they give Caesar what is Caesar’s, and God what is God’s.”
And when they heard his answer, they were very astonished, and they left him and went on their way. The Sadducees were trying to trap Jesus.
On that day, some Sadducees came to him, who said that there would be no resurrection, and they asked him:
“Moses said, ‘Hear [O Israel], and heed!’ 24:22 See Deuteronomy 25:5, 6. If a man dies without children, his widow shall marry his brother, to preserve the name of his father in his inheritance.”
There were seven brothers among us, and the first one married and died. Because he had no children, his brother married his widow.
And that happened to the brother and the second and the third and even the seventh.
After they all died, the woman died too.
Who will be the wife of the Seven in the Day of Judgment? They have already married her to all of them.
And Jesus answered them and said, “You are mistaken, for you do not know the Scripture, nor the power of God.”
Understand that in eternal life after the resurrection of the dead, people will not marry or marry their daughters, but will be like angels in heaven.
As for the resurrection of the dead, haven’t you read what God has said?
I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. #I… Jacob. 32:22 From the Book of Exodus 3: 6. And God is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
And when the people heard this saying, they were very astonished by his teaching. The greatest commandment.
And when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had answered the Sadducees and silenced them, they gathered themselves together.
And I will ask a religious scholar, trying to trap him, and he said:
“Listen, what is the greatest commandment in Islamic law?”
And Jesus said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.” #You shall love the Lord… your mind. 37:22 From Deuteronomy 6:5.
This is the first and greatest commandment.
The second will also be like the first: ‘You shall love your companion #صاحبك. 39:22 Referring to the prophecy of Luke 10: 25-37, we understand that by ‘companion’ is meant every person in need of assistance. As you love yourself.’ #love your companion … yourself. 39:22 From Leviticus 19: 18.
“The entire Sharia and the books of the prophets relate to these two testaments.”
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them:
“What do you think about the Messiah? Who is his father?” The Pharisees replied: “He is the son of David.”
He said to them: “How did David call [the Lord] ‘Lord’ when he was being led by the Spirit?”
The Lord said to me, “Sit beside me until I make your enemies lie beneath your feet.”
If David calls Christ Lord, how can he be his son?
No one was able to answer him, and no one dared to ask him any more questions after that.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
He said, “The teachers of the law and the Pharisees overtook Moses in interpreting the law.”
And keep all that they say to you, but do not do their deeds. For they say one thing and do not do it.
They burden people with difficult burdens, but they have no desire to put in any effort to follow them.
All the good deeds they do, they do so that people may see them. And they display their piety, increasing the size of their bands #theirbands. 5:23 Some Jews would write certain passages from the Bible and put them in small leather pouches, then tie them with cloth bands to the forehead or the left arm, thus displaying their strictness of faith, and lengthening the lashes of their robes.
They love to sit in the best seats at feasts, and in the front rows at assemblies.
And they like people to greet them with special greetings in the markets, and to call them: ‹Oh, teacher.›
But do not call yourselves 'disciples'. For you have one Master, who is Christ. And all are brothers and sisters, in Christ.
And do not say on earth, ‘My father!’ For you have an Father in heaven.
And do not call anyone your master, except Him who is the Christ.
The greatest among you shall be a servant of your group.
Whoever elevates his status, Allah will raise him; and whoever is humble, Allah will raise his status.
Woe to you, the Pharisees and teachers of the law, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven before your faces; you neither enter yourselves, nor do you allow those who would enter to enter.
Woe to you, you Pharisees and teachers of the law who claim to worship but make yourselves orphans! For you give a tenth of your mint and anise but neglect to give a tenth of your love. Woe to you, you have sat over people’s houses and plotted against them, deceiving widows alone in their homes.
Woe to you, you hypocrites and Pharisees who claim to interpret the law! Because you travel both by sea and by land to win over one disciple. And when you have done this, you make him worthy of hell twice as much as you are worthy yourselves.
“Let it be your doom, you deep guides, those who say: ‘If one swears by the pillar, he is not bound to keep his oath; but if he swears by the gold in the pillar, he is bound to keep it!’"
You fools, O deep ones! Which is greater: the gold in the Temple, or the Temple that sanctifies the gold?
And they say: ‘He is bound by the sacrifice. He is not obliged to keep his oath, but if he swears by the altar, then he is obliged to keep it!’
O blind man! Which is greater: the advancement on the altar, or the altar that makes the advancement sacred?
For if one swears by the altar, he swears by the altar and by all that is upon it.
And if one should swear by the framework, then he swears by it and by that which dwells within it.
And if anyone swears by the heaven, then he swears by the Throne of God and by Him who is seated upon it.
You hypocrites and Pharisees who claim to interpret the Law! You give ten percent of everything to the Temple, even mint and rue. [Matthew 23:23] Mint and rue were used as spices and for medicinal purposes. And cumin, but you have neglected justice and mercy and faithfulness. You should have done these things, without neglecting the rest.
You wise elders, you are removing the gnat from your cup, but you swallow the camel!
Woe to you, you Pharisees and teachers of the law who claim to be righteous! For you cleanse the outside of the cup or the dish, but you fail to cleanse the inner rot of your hearts.
O you Pharisees, the depth of your understanding, first wash thee within the laver, so that which is outside may also be made clean.
Woe to you, the Pharisees and teachers of the law, hypocrites! For you are like tombs gleaming white, yet inside are death and decay, a world of bones and all manner of foulness.
You are like this as well; you appear righteous outwardly, but within you are filled with hypocrisy and evil.
And curse you, you Pharisees and teachers of the law, hypocrites! For you build tombs for the prophets and decorate graves for the righteous.
And you say: ‘If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have participated in the killing of the prophets.’
And with this, you confirm that you are the descendants of those who killed the prophets.
Complete what your ancestors began.
O serpents and sons of vipers! How can you escape the judgment of hell?
Therefore, I tell you that I will send to you prophets and wise men and teachers. And you will kill some of them, and you will crucify some of them, and you will flog others in your gatherings, and you will pursue them from city to city.
Therefore, you will be held accountable for the blood of every innocent person killed on the earth: from the blood of Abel, an innocent man, to the blood of Zechariah ben Berechiah, #Abel… Zechariah. 35:23 The first and last who were killed according to time and the text of the books of the Old Testament. (See Genesis 4: 8, and Chronicles II 24: 20) The one who killed between the temple and the altar.
I say to you the truth, that the punishment for all these crimes will fall upon this generation. Jesus warns the people of the city of Jerusalem.
O Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, who kills her prophets and slaughters her messengers! How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings! But you have rejected it.
Your house will be left to you empty and abandoned!
Because I say to you, you will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.’ #Blessed…The Lord. 39:23 From Psalm 118: 26. »
Jesus announces the destruction of the Temple.
And Jesus left the Temple area. And as he was walking, his disciples came to him, because they wanted to show him the buildings of the Temple.
Jesus said to them, “Do you see all these buildings? Truly I tell you, not one stone will remain upon another, all will be destroyed!”
And while Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, His disciples came to Him privately, and said to Him, “Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming and the end of the age?”
And Jesus answered them and said, “Beware that you are not deceived.”
Many will come and assume my name, saying, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and many will be deceived.
You will hear about wars and revolutions, so do not be afraid. These things must happen, but they will not be the end of the world.
Because one nation will rise against another, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes and famines.
But all of this will be the first pains of labor.
They will hand you over to punishment, and will kill some of you. And all the nations will hate you for my name.
At that time, many will abandon their faith, some will hand others over to the authorities, and some will hate each other.
False prophets will appear and deceive many.
And because of the increase in hardship, many of the believers will become cooler in their love.
But whoever remains faithful to the end will be saved.
The gospel of God’s kingdom will be announced throughout the world as a testimony to the Gentiles, and then will come the end.
«And when you see ‘The Defiled Scourge’ #TheDefiledScourge. 15:24 See Daniel 9: 27, 12: 11, and also Matthew 11: 31. Which Daniel the prophet indicated, standing in the holy place – so that the reader understands this saying,—
Then let all who are in the territory of Judea flee to the mountains
And he does not descend from the roof to take his belongings from the house.
And the field worker does not go to his house to take his cloak.
The conditions of pregnant and breastfeeding women were so difficult during those times!
But pray that your escape not be in the winter or on a Saturday.
And it will be a great distress in that time, like which there has been none since the beginning of the world, and there will be none like it.
Even if God did not decree the shortening of those days, no one would remain alive. But for His chosen people, God will shorten those days.
If someone says to you, “Here is the Messiah, here he is!” or “Here he is there!” do not believe his words.
Because more than one false Christian will appear, and more than one false prophet. And they will perform miracles and wonders to deceive those whom God has chosen, if they were able to.
I told you everything before it happened.
Someone might say, “Here is the Messiah in the wilderness,” do not go there. Or, “Here he is in a room,” do not believe him.
As the lightning comes from the east and shines in the west, so too will the Son of Man appear.
Where you find the corpse, you also find the vultures.
Immediately following the distress that will occur on those days, ‘the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be disturbed.’
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. And all the tribes of the earth will weep, and they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
And his angels will be sent with a loud horn blast accompanying them, gathering those whom He has chosen from the four corners of the sky, from its farthest reaches to its farthest reaches.
Learn from the fig tree. As soon as its branches become tender and its leaves appear, you will know that summer is near.
Also, when you see all these things, you will know that the time #the time. 33:24 Compare with Luke 21:31. It is near at hand.
I tell you the truth: this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place.
The heaven and the earth shall pass away; but my words shall never pass away. Only the Father knows them.
But no one knows when that day or hour will be, neither the angels in heaven nor the Son, but the Father alone knows it.
“And as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be when the Son of Man comes.”
Before the days of the Flood, people were eating, drinking, and marrying, and they were marrying off their daughters, until the day that Noah entered the ark.
They did not know what would happen until the Flood came and took them. It will be the same in the coming of the Son of Man.
At that time, two men were working in a field, and one was taken and the other left.
And there were two women grinding the grain on a millstone, one was taken and the other left.
Arise then, for you know not the day of your Lord.
Make sure that if the owner of the house knew which hour of the night the thief intended to come, he would have awakened and prevented him from breaking into his house.
Therefore, be ready yourselves, for the Son of Man is coming at a moment you do not expect. The righteous slave and the wicked slave.
“Who is the faithful, discreet servant whom the master appoints governor over his estate, to whom he entrusts his food and his drink?”
Congratulations to that servant who, when his master comes, finds him fulfilling his duty.
I tell you the truth, he will entrust all his possessions to him.
The wicked server says to himself, “My lord will be delayed.”
He begins by hitting his servant companions, and starts eating and drinking with the drunkards.
And the master of that servant will come upon him in a day he does not expect, and at an hour he does not know.
And he will punish him and put him with the hypocrites, where people weep and cling to their hands.
Like the ten girls
Then it was like the kingdom of heaven, ten maidens who had taken their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them are stupid, and five of them are intelligent.
They took their silly pillows, but they didn't take any extra oil with them.
The intelligences took extra oil for their lamps.
And the groom was delayed, so all the girls fell asleep and dozed.
But in the middle of the night, someone cried out: “The groom is coming, hasten to meet him.”
Then the girls awoke and prepared their aprons.
And the fools said to the bees: ‹Give us some of your honey, for our lamps almost go out.›
“And the wise women replied, ‘We cannot, for it is not enough for us, but. So go to the merchants and buy oil for yourselves.’”
As they were going out to buy oil, the groom arrived. And the bridesmaids were ready, so they entered with him into the wedding feast. Then they closed the door.
Finally, the rest of the girls came and said, “Lord, Lord, open for us.”
But he said, “I say to you the truth, I do not know you!”
Therefore, be alert, for you do not know the day or the hour when the Son of Man is coming. Like servants
Thus, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who was going to travel, so he called his servants and entrusted them with all his possessions.
So he gave to one of them five sacks #five sacks. 15:25 Literally “balances or measures,” and a balance equals approximately 27 to 36 kilograms of gold or silver or copper. From the coins, and he gave to the second two sacks, and to the third one sack. Each gave according to his ability. Then he traveled immediately afterward.
He who took the five bags immediately invested them in trade, earning five more bags.
And he did what he had taken the bags with, and earned two more bags.
The one who took one bag went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money in it.
And after a long time, the master of those slaves returned and began to reckon with them.
He took the five sacks, and gained five more, saying, “My lord, you gave me five sacks, and these are five more that I gained.”
His mistress said to him, “Well done, you faithful and trustworthy slave. You were trustworthy with little, therefore I will entrust you with much. Enter and share in your master’s joy.”
Then came the one who took the two bags, and said, “My lord, you gave me two bags, and these are two other bags that I have earned.”
His mistress said to him, “Well done, you faithful and trustworthy slave. You were trustworthy with little, therefore I will entrust you with much. Enter and share in your master’s joy.”
Then came one who took a single bag and said, “My Lord, I know you are a harsh man, for you reap from a harvest you did not sow, and you gather from fields you did not cultivate.”
And I was afraid of you, so I went and hid your purse on the ground. Take your money.
She replied, “You are a wicked and lazy slave. Since you know that I reap from a harvest I did not sow, and gather from fields I did not till,”
Why didn't you deposit my money in the bank, and when I returned, you were taking my money with interest?
So take the bag from him, and give it to the owner of the ten bags.
Because more will be given to him who has, and it will overflow for him, but that which he has not will be taken from him, even what he possesses.
And that unprofitable slave, cast him out to the outside, into the darkness, where people weep and press down upon their teeth. For behold, Man is the judge.
And when the Son of Man comes in glory with all his angels, he will sit on the throne of his glory.
Then He gathers all the nations before Him. And He will sort some from others, just as a shepherd sorts sheep from the flock while grazing.
He will put rams on his right hand and goats on his left hand.
Then the king will say to those on his right: «Come, you who your father blessed. Take the kingdom that he prepared for you since he created the world.»
Because I was hungry, you fed me. I was thirsty, you quenched me. I was a stranger, you sheltered me.
I was naked, so you disrobed me. I was sick, so you cared for me. I was imprisoned, so you visited me.
They will reply: ‘Our Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and quench your thirst?’
When you saw us as strangers, you sheltered us, or as naked, you clothed us?
And when you see us ill or imprisoned, then visit us.
The king says, “I tell you the truth, whatever you have done for one of these lesser brothers of mine, you have done for me.”
Then the king said to those standing on his left: “Stay away from me, you cursed ones, and go to the eternal fire prepared for Satan and his angels.”
Because I was hungry, you did not feed me. I was thirsty, you did not quench my thirst.
I was a stranger, you did not receive me. And I was naked, you did not clothe me. And I was sick and imprisoned, you did not visit me.
The Evil Ones Answer: ‘O Lord, when did we see you hungry and did not feed you, thirsty and did not quench your thirst, a stranger and did not welcome you, naked and did not clothe you, sick and did not care for you, imprisoned and did not set you free?’
The king said, “I tell you the truth, when you neglected to do that for one of our weak brothers, you neglected to do it for me.”
And so the wicked go to eternal punishment, while the righteous go to eternal life.
Jewish leaders are planning to kill Jesus
After Jesus had finished speaking, he said to his disciples:
You know that Easter is the day after tomorrow, and the Son of Man will be delivered to his enemies to be crucified.
The chief priests and elders of the people had gathered in the palace of High Priest Caiaphas.
And they plotted to seize Jesus with deceit and to kill him.
And they were saying, “We should not do this during the Feast, to avoid unrest among the people.” A woman pours perfume on Jesus.
While Jesus was in the village of Bethsaida, at the house of Simon the Pharisee,
A woman came to him, carrying a precious perfume in a marble bottle, and poured it on his head while he was eating.
And when their disciples saw this, they were angry and said, “What is this extravagance?”
This perfume could have been sold for a large sum of money given to the poor.
And Jesus knew what they were saying, and He said to them, “Why are you troubling this woman? She has done what she could.”
The poor will always be with you, #the poor… always. 11:26 See Deuteronomy 15:11. But I will not always be with you.
I sprayed the perfume on my body to prepare it for burial.
I tell you the truth: wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the world, what she has done will also be told as a testimony to her. Judas the betrayer will betray Jesus.
Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,
He said to them, “What will you give me if you hand over Jesus to me?” And they offered him thirty pieces of silver.
And from that moment, Judas began to seek a suitable opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. At the table of the Passover.
On the first day of Unleavened Bread, Jesus said to them, “Where do you want me to prepare the Passover meal for you?”
Then Jesus said, “Go to such a man in the village, and say to him, ‘The Teacher says: the appointed time is near, and I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples in your house.’ ”
The students did as Jesus told them to, and prepared a Passover meal.
As evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with his twelve disciples.
While they were eating, he said to them, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me.”
They murmured and began to ask him one after the other: “Am I, my Lord?”
And Jesus answered and said unto them, He that smiteth me before the cup cometh hither by the way.
The son of man is at his weakest according to what is written about him, but woe to that man who betrays the son of man. It would have been better for him if he had never been born!
And Judas said to Him, “Is it I, Master?” Jesus said to him, “You are indeed.” The Lord’s Supper
While they were eating, he took bread, and blessed it, and broke it and gave it to the disciples and said, “Take it, eat it, for this is my body.”
Then he took a cup of wine, thanked, and gave it to them saying, “Drink from this all of you.”
For this is my blood, the blood of the covenant, shed for many for the forgiveness of their sins.
And I say to you that I will not drink this wine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of my Father.
Then, they recited some psalms, and went out to Mount Olivet. Jesus announces Peter’s denial.
Then Jesus said to them, “You all will deny me before the rooster crows three times.” For it is written, “Whoever denies me, let him be denied.”
But after I have risen from the dead, I will make you go to Galilee.
And Peter answered and said, “Though all men should perish except you, yet I would not perish.”
Jesus said to him, “Truly I tell you, before the rooster crows three times, you will deny me three times.”
Peter said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you!” And all the disciples spoke like this. Jesus was praying alone.
Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples, “Stay here while I go over there to pray.”
He took with him Peter and his son Zebe, and began to feel sadness and discomfort.
Then he said to them, “My grief is so great that it almost kills me! Stay here and keep watch with me.”
And Jesus withdrew a little from them, and kneeling, his face turned to the ground, began to pray: “Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me. #The cup. 39:26 That cup of suffering and distress. Repeated in verse 42. . But not as I will, but as you will.”
And he came to his disciples, and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, “You do not keep watch at all, do you?”
Stay awake and connect so that you may not be tested. Your spirit yearns for it, but your body is weak.
And he stepped back a moment to pray, and he said: “My father, if it was not possible for me to cross this cup, I should drink it, let your will be.”
Then he returned a second time and found them asleep, for sleep had weighed down their eyes.
He left them and went again for the third time to pray, and he said the same words he had said before.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting as I did? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.”
Come, let us go. Here comes the man who betrayed me. Arrest Jesus.
As he still spoke, Judas, one of the twelve, appeared with a large company bearing swords and clubs, whom they had sent from the chief priests and elders.
The traitor had given them a signal and said, “The man I accept is the wanted man, so arrest him.”
Now I approached Jesus and said to him, “I do you greet, my teacher!” and kissed him.
Jesus said to him, “Friend, do what you came to do.” Then they came up and seized him, and took Jesus away.
One of those who were with Jesus extended his hand, drew his sword, and struck the servant of the chief priest, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him, “Return your sword to its scabbard. For every one who fights with the sword, will perish by the sword.”
Don’t you realize that I can call the Father, and he will send me more than twelve legions of angels right now?
But, if you do, how will the books that announced these things would happen this way be verified?
And at that moment Jesus said to the crowds, “Do you come at me with swords and clubs, as those who seek to harm me?” I was sitting daily in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me!
But this happened so that what the prophets wrote might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples and Jesus withdrew.” Jesus stood before the chief priests and the council.
Then, they drove him to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the Pharisees had gathered.
But Peter followed from a distance and entered the courtyard of the house of the chief priest. He entered and sat with the guards to see what would happen in the end.
The chief priests and all the council of elders were seeking a false witness against Jesus, so that they might put him to death.
But they didn't find it, even though many false witnesses testified and spoke lies about him. Finally, two men stepped forward,
And they said, “This man #this man. 61:26 That is, Jesus, for his enemies avoided even speaking his name! He said, ‘I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’”
The head priest stood up and said, “Won’t you defend yourself against all the accusations these two men are making against you?”
Jesus remained silent. Then said the chief priest, “I command you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?”
Jesus answered, “Truly, truly I say to you, as I have said before, as I now say, unless you keep seeking, you will not find me. And I say to you, from this day forward, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of God, coming on the clouds of heaven.”
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “You have defiled the Holy One, requiring no further witnesses. You have now heard the insult offered to Him.”
“So, what do you rule over?” they replied. “It deserves to die.”
Then they spat on his face and struck him with their fists and beat him.
And they said unto him, “You shall prophesy to us, O Christ, who struck you?” Peter denied Jesus.
Meanwhile, Peter was sitting in the courtyard outside. Then the servant of the high priest came to him and said, “You were also with Jesus of Galilee.”
But Peter denied this in front of everyone and said, “I don’t understand what you’re saying!”
Then he went to the gate of the courtyard, and another maidservant said to those who were there: “This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.”
Peter denied it again, and swore, saying, “I do not know this man.”
Shortly afterward, those standing there approached him and said to him, “You are indeed one of them; your accent reveals that you are a foreigner.”
Then he began to curse #curse. 74:26 That is, he swears an oath of damnation upon himself if he is lying! And he swears and says, “I do not know this man.” And immediately the rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered the words Jesus had said to him: “You will deny me three times before the rooster crows.” So he went out and wept bitterly.
Jesus before Pilate
And in the morning following that, the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered, and they consulted to kill Jesus.
They crucified him and handed him over to the governor, Pilate. Judas killed himself.
And when Judas, who had betrayed Jesus, saw that they were determined to condemn Jesus to death, he regretted what he had done. And he returned thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He said to them, “You have wronged me by handing over an innocent man to be killed.” They said to him, “This has nothing to do with us. Deal with this yourself.”
And Judas cast the silver into the temple and departed, and went away and hanged himself.
Then the chief priests took the money and said, “It is not permitted for us to put this money into the treasury, for it is the price of a man’s life.”
They decided to buy the field of al-Fakhari to be a burial ground for strangers.
And for this reason, the field is still known as "Field of Blood" to this day.
And thus was fulfilled what God said through the prophet Jeremiah: “Take the thirty pieces of silver, which is the price agreed upon by the sons of Israel.”
And buy from the field of Fakhari, as the Lord commanded me. #Take… the Lord. 10:27 See the book of Zechariah 11: 12-13, and the book of Jeremiah 32: 6-9. Jesus before Pilate
And Jesus stood before the governor, and he asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus said, “You yourself said it just now.”
When the high priests and elders complained about him, he said nothing.
Then Pilate asked him, “Do you not hear the many accusations they are bringing against you?”
But Jesus did not give Pilate an answer to any of the accusations leveled against him. Pilate was amazed by his silence. Pilate failed to release Jesus.
The governor used to, on Easter, release a prisoner he would choose for the people.
And there was a prisoner famous for his appearance, whose name was Barabbas. #Barabbas. 16:27 or “Jesus Barabbas” as in some Greek versions.
And when the people were gathered, Pilate said to them, “You want me to release to you Jesus, who is called the Christ, or Barabbas?”
Pilate had come to realize that they had handed Jesus over to him out of envy.
While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message saying: “Do not do evil to this innocent man, for I have been troubled all night by a dream concerning him.”
But the high priests and elders persuaded the crowd to ask for the release of Barabbas, and for the death of Jesus.
The governor said, “Which of the two do you want me to name?” They replied, “Barabbas.”
Pilate asked them, “What shall I do with Jesus, the Christ?” They replied, “Let him be crucified.”
Pilate said to them, “Why? What crime has he committed?” But they shouted louder: “Let him be crucified.”
And when Pilate saw that there was no advantage to be gained by arresting Jesus, and that tumult began to arise, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, and said, “I am innocent of this man’s blood; ye are responsible that he be crucified.”
And the whole people cried out, “Let his blood be upon us and upon our children.”
Then Pilates gave orders to the soldiers, and they should flog Jesus, and hand him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
Then the governor’s soldiers led Jesus to the governor’s palace and gathered a company of guards around him.
They took off his clothes and then dressed him in a crimson robe. #dressed him… color. 28:27 Or purple, as a mockery, for this is the color of a king’s robe.
They argued him a crown of thorny branches and placed it on his head, and they placed a fortress in his right hand, and they prostrated themselves before him mocking and saying, “Long live the King of the Jews!”
Then they spat on him, took the staff from his hand, and began to beat him on the head.
And when they had finished mocking Him, they took off His robe, and dressed Him in His own clothes, and led Him out to Pilate to flog Him.
And when they had departed, they found a man from the town of Caesarea whose name was Simon, and they compelled him to bear his cross.
When they arrived at a place known as “Gehenna,” that is, “a place of skulls,”
Give Jesus a wine mixed with gall to drink. When he tasted it, he refused to drink.
And when they had crucified Jesus, they divided his garments among themselves, and cast lots by lot.
Then they sat there guarding it.
And they hung a sign above his head, reading, “This is Jesus, King of the Jews,” as their accusation.
Hardening with Jesus, criminals, one on his right and one on his left.
And the Maronians were reviling him, and shaking their heads.
They say, “You, who destroy the house and build it in three days, if you are the Son of God, save yourself, and come down from the cross!”
And the elders of the priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders said to him:
Let others finish, but he cannot finish himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him descend from the cross now so we may believe in him!
Put his trust in God, so God will deliver him now if He truly wants him. Didn’t he say, ‘I am the son of God’?
And the two criminals who were crucified with him were cursing him with similar words. The death of Jesus.
From twelve noon, darkness fell upon the entire earth until three in the afternoon.
Around three o’clock, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” #Eli, why have you forsaken me? 46:27 From Psalm 22:1. That is: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”
And when some of the donors heard it there, they said, “He is calling Elijah!” #calling Elijah. 47:27 The word “Eli” in Hebrew and “Elo” in Aramaic, resembles the name “Elijah,” which is the name of a well-known prophet who lived around the year 850 BC.
Then, one of the people standing there hurried forward, took a sponge and soaked it in vinegar, placed it on a long stick, and offered it to him to drink.
The rest of them were saying, “Let’s wait and see if Elijah will come to rescue him!”
Then Jesus cried out again, and surrendered his spirit.
The partition curtain of the structure tore #partition curtain. 51:27 The curtain that separated the “Holy of Holies” from the rest of the Jewish Temple. And the Holy of Holies represented the divine presence. It tore in two from top to bottom, and the earth shook, and the rocks cracked.
And the graves opened, and the bodies of many of the righteous faithful who had died were raised.
And after Jesus had done many things, the bodies were taken out of their tombs, and entered into the holy city, and were shown to many.
The Roman officer, #Roman officer. 54:27 literally “centurion.” And the guards who were guarding Jesus’s body, when they saw the earthquake and the other events, were very frightened and said, “Truly this is the Son of God!”
And there were women who stood at a distance, watching, and who had followed Jesus from Galilee to serve him.
And among them were Mary Magdalene, and the mother of James, and the mother of Joseph, and also the mother of the sons of Zebedee. #the sons of Zebedee. 56:27 James and John. They buried Jesus.
As evening came, a rich man named Joseph came to the city of Jerusalem, he was from the town of Ramat Gan. He was also a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked him for Jesus’ body. Then Pilate ordered that the body be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in new linen cloth.
Then he placed it in its new grave, which he had dug in the rock, then he rolled a large stone onto the entrance of the grave and went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. They were watching over Jesus’ tomb.
The following day, after the end of the Sabbath, the chief priests and the Pharisees came to Pontius Pilate.
They told him: “Sir, we remember that this deceiver said before he died: ‘I will rise from the dead after three days.’”
Issue an order to guard the tomb until the third day, so that his disciples may not come and steal the body, and then say to the people, ‘He has risen from the dead.’ That would be a greater deception than the first.’
Then Pilate said to them, “Take some guards and go, and search thoroughly for yourselves.”
They departed and secured the tomb. And they placed a seal on the stone, as they established guards from the army upon it.
The resurrection of Jesus
And after the Sabbath was finished, being the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, to the tomb.
And at that moment, a powerful earthquake occurred, for the angels of the Lord descended from heaven, went to the tomb, and rolled away the stone from the door, and then sat upon it.
And the sight of him was brilliant as lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.
The guards feared him greatly and became like corpses.
The angel said to the two women: “Do not be afraid, I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.”
It is not here, he has risen from the dead as he said. Come and see the place where he was.
Then go quickly to his disciples and say to them: “He has risen from the dead, and will meet you in Galilee; and you will see him there.” Behold, I have told you.
Then the two women quickly left the tomb, and their fear had mixed with great joy, and they ran to inform Jesus’ disciples of what had happened.
Suddenly, Jesus met them, and said, “Peace be with you.” They bent down and took his feet in their hands and kissed them.
Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid, go and tell my brothers that they go to Galilee, there they will see me.” False report
While the two women were on their way, some guards went to the city and told the high priests everything that had happened.
The high priests gathered with the elders, and they consulted among themselves, then they gave the soldiers a little money.
They told them, “Spread this rumor among the people that Jesus’ disciples came at night and stole his body while you were sleeping.”
“If this news reaches the governor, we will convince him and keep you safe.”
And the soldiers took the money, and did as they were commanded. And this story spread among the Jews until this day. Jesus speaks to his disciples.
The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they prostrated themselves before him, even though some of them had doubts.
And Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.”
Go therefore and teach all the nations, and baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
And teach them to obey all that I command you. And remember that I will always be with you, until the end of time.”
John the Baptist
This is the beginning of the announcement of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah: “Behold, I send my messenger before you, to prepare the way.”
A man’s voice calls out in the wilderness and says, “Prepare the way of the Lord. Make the roads straight for him.”
John the Baptist was baptizing in the wilderness, and he was calling for people to be baptized as a symbol of their repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the inhabitants of the villages of the Judean region, and the city of Jerusalem, came out to him, and he would baptize them in the Jordan River after they had confessed their sins.
His clothes were made of camel hair, and a leather belt was around his waist; he ate locusts and wild honey.
And he would announce and say: “A man greater than I will come after me, and I am not worthy to bow down and tie his sandals.”
You are his anchor in the water, but he will be your anchor in the Holy Spirit. Jesus’ baptism
And in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth, a town in the Galilee region, and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
As he emerged from the water, he saw the heavens opened, and he saw the Holy Spirit descending upon him like a dove.
And a voice came from heaven: “This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.” A trial of Jesus
And the Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness alone.
And there remained forty days in confrontation with the experiences of Satan. There were with the wild animals, and the angels served him. Jesus chose some of his disciples.
And after John was arrested, Jesus came into the region of Galilee, and began to preach the gospel of God.
He says, “The time has come, and the kingdom of God is near; repent and believe in this gospel.”
While walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, Simon and his brother Andrew were casting their nets into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”
They left their nets there and followed him.
Then he walked a little while, and saw Jacob ben Zebadi and his brother John, preparing the nets in their boat.
Jesus called them, so they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the crew and followed him. Jesus casts out a demon.
Then they went to Capernaum, and Jesus entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach.
They were astonished by his teaching, because he taught them as one who has authority, not as the teachers of religious law.
And there was a man in the assembly with a defiled spirit. Then the spirit cried out:
What do you want from us, Jesus the Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, you are the Holy One of God.
Jesus said to him, “Be silent and come out!”
He cast the unclean spirit into a fit of convulsions, then screamed a loud scream and it was expelled from him.
Everyone gasped, and they began to say to one another: “What is this new teaching? It commands the unclean spirits to obey its behest.”
The news about him spread quickly throughout the Galilee region. Jesus was healing many people.
Then they left the assembly, and went with Jacob and John to the house of Simon Peter and Andrew.
Gethsemane was hearing Simon in bed, suffering from a fever. They told Jesus about her.
He approached her, took her hand, and made her sit. She recovered from the fever and began to serve them.
That evening, as the sun set, they brought many patients to him, including souls possessed by evil spirits.
All the residents of the city gathered at the gate of the house.
Jesus healed many who were afflicted with various diseases, and He cast out many demons. But Jesus did not allow the demons to speak, for they knew He was the Christ. Preparation for the proclamation of the Gospel
And in the early morning, before the sun rose, Jesus went out alone, and went to a secluded place to pray.
Simon and those who were with him went out to search for him.
And when they found him, they said to him, “Everyone is searching for you!”
And Jesus answered them, “Let us go to the neighboring villages that I may preach there also. For I came to that end.”
He went to all corners of the Galilee region, preaching in synagogues of the Jews, and casting out evil spirits. Jesus healed a leper.
And a leper came to Jesus, and fell prostrate before him, and begged him, saying, “You are able to make me clean, if you will.”
Jesus opened his mouth, and stretched out his hand, and touched saying, “Yes, I desire, be ye cleansed.”
The leprosy was removed from the man, and he became clean.
Then Jesus warned him strongly before dismissing him.
He said to him, “Do not tell anyone what happened to you, but go and present yourself to the priest. #Go… to the priest. 44:1 The priest was the one who would decide, according to the law, when a leper was considered clean. And he offered a sacrifice for his purification as Moses commanded, #as Moses commanded. 44:1 See Leviticus 14: 1-32. So that people may know that you have been healed.”
But the man departed and began to spread the news of his healing in every place, so it became difficult for Jesus to enter publicly into any city, but he stayed in secluded places, and people came to him from all around.
Jesus heals a paralytic
After several days, Jesus returned to Cana, and news of his return spread.
A great many people gathered until there was no room for anyone, not even outside the door. And Jesus was speaking to the people with the Word of God.
They brought him to him, carried by four men.
But they could not get it to Jesus because of the crowd. They made a hole in the roof over where Jesus was, and opened the roof, and lowered the bed on which the paralytic was lying.
And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Your sins are forgiven.”
Some of my religious teachers were sitting there, and they were thinking to themselves:
Why is this man speaking in this way? He is insulting God with his words! Who, except God, can forgive sins?
And Jesus knew the thoughts of their hearts, and said to them, “Why do you think about this in your hearts?”
Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise up and bear your bed and walk’?
But I will show you that the Son of Man has authority to forgive sins.” And he said to the paralyzed man:
I'm telling you, get up and take your bed and go to your house!
He rose and carried his butterfly immediately, and walked in the sight of everyone, and all were astonished and praised God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this before!” Laui (Matthew) follows Jesus.
And Jesus returned again to the lake. And he was teaching the crowds who followed him there.
While he was walking, Levi was sitting at the tax collector’s place. He said to him, “Follow me!” And he rose up and followed him.
And while Jesus was seated at the house of Levi, at a meal, there were many tax collectors and sinners eating with him and with his disciples. For there were many who were there when Jesus called Levi, so they followed him.
And when the Pharisees and the teachers of the law saw him eating with tax collectors and sinners, they asked him, “Why do you eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
And when he heard them, Jesus said to them, “Healthy people do not need a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.” Question about fasting
It was a time of fasting for the disciples of John and the Pharisees, and some people came to Jesus and asked him, “Why are the disciples of John and the Pharisees fasting, while your disciples do not fast?”
Jesus said to them, “Should the guests of the bridegroom fast as the bridegroom fasts? For as long as the bridegroom is with them, they cannot keep themselves holy.”
But there will come a time when the groom will be taken from them, and then they will fast.
No one patches an old garment with a new piece of fabric, because the new fabric will shrink and tear the antique garment, making the hole even worse.
No one puts new wine into old leather bottles, for the wine would burst the bottles, and the bottles break, the wine spilling out. Therefore, new wine is put into new bottles. Jesus: Lord of the Sabbath
On one of the Sabbath days, Jesus was going through the fields, and his disciples were harvesting the grain as they followed him.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, “See! Your disciples are doing what is not permitted to be done on the Sabbath!”
He said to them, “Haven’t you read in the Book what David did when he needed it and was afflicted along with his men?”
He entered the house of God in the time of the priest Abiathar, and ate of the loaves of bread presented to God, and gave also to those who were with him. Although no one is permitted to eat that bread except the priests. #26:2 See 1 Samuel 21: 1-6.
Then Jesus said to them, “God made the Sabbath for man, not man for the Sabbath.”
And thus the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.
Jesus heals on the Sabbath
Jesus went back to the synagogue again, and there was a man whose hand was paralyzed.
Some people were watching him closely to see if he would recover, and to find a reason to accuse him.
He said to the man with the paralyzed hand: “Stand up and come here!”
Then he said to them, “Is it permissible to do good or to inflict harm on the Sabbath? Is it permissible to save a human life or to kill it?” They remained silent.
Jesus looked around at them with anger, and sorrow at the hardness of their hearts. Then he said to the man, “Extend your hand,” and he did, and it was restored to health.
The Pharisees went out and began to conspire with the followers of Herod to find out how they might kill Jesus. Many are following Jesus.
And Jesus went away with his disciples to the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd from Galilee and from Jerusalem followed him.
And from Jerusalem and Adomite and east of the Jordan, and the regions around Sephor and Edom, they were a great multitude. And all of them had come to him because of what they had heard about his works.
Jesus asked his disciples to prepare a boat for him, so that it would not be crowded by people.
Since Jesus had healed many, everyone suffering from an illness would try to reach him to touch him.
And the foul spirits were tossing about before Him, screaming: “You are the Son of God!”
He warns her strongly not to reveal who he is. The selection of the twelve.
Then Jesus went up the mountain and called to him those who were coming and followed him.
And Jesus chose twelve men and called them apostles, to be with him, and to send them forth to different lands.
And they give them a power to drive out evil spirits.
And: Simon, whom Peter called Simon.
Jacob ben Zbad and his brother John, whom Jesus called “Porphyrogennetos” – that is, “sons of thunder.”
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the brother of John, Simon the Legal, #Legal. 18:3 From an Aramaic word meaning “the zealous.” That is, it refers to a Jewish political party resisting Roman rule, called the “Zealous.”
Judah the betrayer, who betrayed Jesus. The power of Jesus is from God, and Jesus returned to the house.
And the people gathered around him again, and around his disciples, to the point that they didn't find time to eat.
And when the family of Jesus heard about his coming, they came to take him with them, because people were saying he was crazy!
The Sharia teachers who came from Jerusalem would say: “It contains Baalzebul, #Baalzebul. 22:3 It is one of the names of Satan. And he drives out evil spirits with the power of the Chief of the Evil Spirits.”
Jesus called them and began to speak to them in parables, saying, “How can one persuade an evil spirit to depart?”
Because if a kingdom splits and its people fight amongst themselves, it will not endure.
And if a house splits in two, it will not endure.
