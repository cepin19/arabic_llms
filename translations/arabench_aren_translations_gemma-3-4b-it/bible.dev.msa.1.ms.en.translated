The significance of Jesus Christ
The Gospel Book of Jesus the Messiah, son of David, son of Abraham:
Ibrahim ولد إسحاق. And Isaac ولد يعقوب. And Jacob ولد يهوذا and his brothers.
And Judah was born to Serah and Zerah from Tamar. And Serah was born to Eshton. And Eshton was born to Aram.
And Aram had two brothers, Aminadab, and Aminadab had Nahshon, and Nahshon had Salmon.
Salmon was born of Rahab. And Boaz was born of Edom. And Edom was born of Esheba.
Wasa bint Dawud the king. And David the king was the son of Solomon from Bathsheba.
And Solomon was born to Reubem. And Reubem was born to Nahor. And Nahor was born to Asa.
And Joshua, the son of Yeoshua. And Yeoshua, the son of Yoram. And Yoram, the son of Eliashama.
And عزيا comforted Yoatham. And Yoatham was the son of Aziah. And Aziah was the son of Haggai.
And Josiah was born of Memnon. And Memnon was born of Amun. And Amun was born of Joshua.
Joshua and his relatives were born in Babylon and among its people.
And after the captivity of Babylon, Kennya, son of Sheltaiiel, was born. And Sheltaiiel was born of Zerbabel.
Zarababel was born of Ahab. And Ahab was born of Igal. And Igal was born of Azor.
And Azaz son of Sadduq. And Sadduq son of Akheem. And Akheem son of Elyud.
And Aliod was the son of Eliezer. And Eliezer was the son of Methan. And Methan was the son of Jacob.
And Jacob was the son of Joseph, a man of Mary the wife of him who was called Jesus, whom they called the Christ.
And from all the generations of Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the Babylonian captivity fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian captivity to the Messiah fourteen generations. The birth of Jesus the Christ.
And the birth of Jesus the Messiah was as follows: When Mary his mother was betrothed to Joseph, before they had come together, she was found with child by the Holy Spirit.
He covered his wife's feet, for he was a righteous man, and he did not wish to reveal her to anyone, desiring to keep it secret.
But reflecting on these matters, if the angel of the Lord had appeared to him in a dream and said, “O Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary your wife, for he who is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.”
“And you will be born and call his name Jesus, for he will save your people from their sins.”
And all this was so that what was said by God through the prophet might be fulfilled:
Behold, the Virgin conceives and gives birth to a son, and they call his name Emmanuel, which means: God is with us.
And when Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife.
She didn't know him until she gave birth to her first son. And he named him Jesus.
Visit of the Magi
And when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold, magi from the east came to Jerusalem
They say, “Where is the newborn King of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the East and have come to do homage to him.”
And when Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, together with all Jerusalem.
He gathered all the heads of the priests and the scribes of the people, and asked them: “Where is the Messiah to be born?”
They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for because he has come to pass that it is written, ‘A child is born to us, in the Lord.’”
And you, Bethlehem, the land of Judah, are not small among the chiefs of Judah, for from you there shall come forth the one who will rule and lead the people of Israel.
Then Herod summoned the Magi secretly, and when the time of the wise man had come, which was told him by an astrologer.
Then he sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search diligently for the child. And when you have found him, come back to me so that I may also go and pay my respects to him.”
And when they heard from the king, they departed. And if the star that they had seen in the east, went before them until it came and stood over, where the boy was.
And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with a very great rejoicing.
And they came to the House, and they saw the boy with Mary his mother. They rejoiced and prostrated themselves before him. Then they opened their treasures and presented to him gifts: gold and frankincense and myrrh.
Then, when it was revealed to them in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they took another way to their retreat. Escape to Egypt.
After they had departed, if the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream saying: “Arise and take the boy and his mother and flee to Egypt, and be there until I tell you. For Herod is set on seeking the boy in order to destroy him.”
He took the boy and his mother at night and went to Egypt.
And there was until Herod’s death. In order that the saying of God might be fulfilled which the prophet had spoken: “Out of Egypt have I called my son.”
Then, when Herod saw that the Magi had mocked him, he was very angry. So he sent and killed all the boys in Bethlehem and in all its surroundings, from two years old and down, according to the time that the Magi had ascertained from the astrologers.
Then it was done as was said of Jeremiah the prophet, who declared:
A sound was heard in Ramah, a great cry of Noah and wailing. Rachel wept for her children and did not want to be comforted, for they were not there. Return to Nazareth.
And when Herod died, then an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
He said, “Go and take the boy and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the boy are dead.”
He took the boy and his mother and came to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus possessed the kingdom instead of his father Herod, he feared to go there. And when an angel told him in a dream, he withdrew to the regions of Galilee.
And he came and settled in a city called Naserah, so that what was said about the prophets might be fulfilled: “Behold, Nersah will be called.”
John the Baptist is preparing the way.
And in those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea
He said, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.”
And this is what was said about him by Isaiah the prophet, who declared: “A voice cries out in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of the Lord.’ Make all his valleys clear and smooth.”
And John wore a garment woven from the hair of camels, and about his loins was a sash of leather. His food was honey and green figs.
And then Jerusalem and all the Jews of the province, and all the surrounding countries came unto him.
And rely on Him in Jordan, acknowledging their sins.
And when many of the Pharisees and Sadducees came to the baptism, he said to them, “You snakes! From the wrath that is to come?”
Cultivate fruits befitting repentance.
And do not think in your hearts: “For us alone have we Abraham.” I say to you that God is able to make descendants of these stones for Abraham.
And now, I have placed the axe at the root of the tree, so every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
I offer you water for repentance, but that which comes after me is stronger than I, one whom I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
which he will wipe with his hand, and purify with his threshing-floors, and will gather his wheat into the granary, and as for the chaff he will burn it with a fire that will not be extinguished.” The baptism of Jesus Christ
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to be baptized by John.
But John forbade him, saying, “I need you to depend on me, and you come to me!”
And Jesus answered him and said, “Be it done now, for this day is needful for us, that we may finish this offering.” Then he allowed him to do it.
And when Jesus had been baptized, he ascended from the water, and immediately the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and it came to pass that a certain voice said to him, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”
And a voice from the heavens said: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I delight.”
Jesus faces the ordeal
Then Jesus ascended into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by Satan.
After he fasted for forty days and forty nights, he finally became hungry.
He then presented the sorcerer and said to him: “If you are the son of God, say that these stones shall become bread.”
And he replied, “It is written: ‘Not by bread alone does man live, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.’”
Then Satan took him to the Holy City and set him on the wing of the temple.
He said to him, “If you are the son of God, then throw yourself down to the depths, for it is written that He commands His angels to protect you, and in their hands they will carry you so that you may not strike your foot against a stone.”
Jesus said to him, “It is also written, ‘You shall not make mockery of God.’”
Then Satan also took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said to him, “I will give it all to you if you fall down and bow to me.”
And Jesus said to him, “You shall go out with the devil! For it is written, ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.’”
Then Satan left him, and if angels came, they served him. The beginning of his service was in Galilee.
And when Jesus heard that John had been delivered up, He departed into Galilee.
And he left Nazareth and came and settled in Capernaum, which is by the sea, at the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali.
In order to fulfill what was said by the prophet Isaiah:
The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, beside the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.
The people who were sitting in darkness have seen a great light, and those who were sitting in the pit have seen a bright light.
From that time on, Jesus began to preach and say, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” The call of the first disciples
And as Jesus was passing by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two men: Simon, who was called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, they were fishermen.
He said to them: “Come with me, and I will make you catch men.”
At that time, they left the window and followed him.
Then he passed by them and saw two other brothers: Yaqub ibn Zibdi and his brother Yuhanna, in the boat with their father Zibdi mending their nets, so he called them.
As they sailed away, they left the ship and their father, and followed after. Jesus was teaching and healing the sick.
And Jesus was going through all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching good news, and healing every sick one.
His fame spread throughout all of Syria. So they brought to him all the sick, afflicted with various diseases and pains, the insane, the chained, and the epileptic, and he healed them.
And followed him vast crowds from Galilee and the Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and those who came from beyond the Jordan.
The Sermon on the Mount - Beatitudes
And when he saw the crowds going out to him, then he sat down and his disciples came to him.
He opened his mouth and told them:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the makers of peace, for they are the sons of God, called.
Blessed are the exiled, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Blessed are you if they curse you and drive you out, saying against you every evil word, for my sake, and falsehoods.
Rejoice and be happy, for your reward is great in the heavens, for they have expelled the prophets who were before you in this way. You are the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt loses its flavor, what then shall it do? It is not poured out to season anything any longer, but is trampled underfoot, awaiting disposal.
You are the light of the world. A city that is hidden cannot be made manifest.
And they do not light a lamp and put it under a bowl, but on the lampstand, it shines for all who are in the house.
Let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. Fulfillment of the Law.
Do not think that I have come to destroy the prophets or the lawgivers. I have not come to destroy, but to finish it.
And I solemnly tell you: until the heaven and the earth pass away, not one letter or one dot will be removed from the Law until the whole is complete.
And whoever breaks one of these minor commandments and the people know it, is called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does and teaches, is called great in the kingdom of heaven.
Verily I say unto you, that unless your righteousness exceedeth that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Wrath.
You may have heard that it was said to the ancients: “Do not kill, and he who kills is deserving of judgment.”
And as for me, I say to you: whoever is angry with his brother in vain is deserving of judgment, and whoever says to his brother, “Raca,” is deserving of compilation, and whoever says, “You fool,” is deserving of the fire of Hell.
And when you present a sacrifice in the altar, and there remember a debt you have to your brother,
Leave your offering before the altar, and go first to make up with your brother, and then come and offer your sacrifice.
Be accommodating to your opponent quickly while you are with him on the road, lest your opponent hand you over to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the police, and you receive a prison sentence.
I tell you the truth: do not leave there until your last dinar is spent! Adultery
You may have heard that it was said to the ancients: Do not weigh.
And as for me, I say to you: whoever looks at a woman with lust has already committed zina (fornication) in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it away from you; it is better for you to have one eye than both to be thrown into hell.
And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and cast it away, it is better for you that one of your limbs be cut off that all your body not fall into hell. Divorce.
And it has been said: If any of you divorce your wives, give them their dowry [Mahr].
And as for me, I say to you: Whoever divorces his wife except for some reason of impurity, may she commit impurity, and whoever marries a divorced woman, he is a slanderer. [He is a fornicator].
You also heard that it was said to the ancients: Do not falter, but fulfill the Lord's covenants.
And I say to you, do not swear at all, by heaven, for it is the throne of God.
And neither in the heaven, for it is beyond their reach. Nor on earth, for it is their resting place.
And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black.
Let your words be: yes yes, no no. And anything beyond that is from the evil one. Revenge.
You heard that it was said: eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.
And I say to you, do not resist the evil. But when someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to him also.
And whoever desires to dispute with you and take your garment, let him take it only, and leave you your cloak.
And whoever mocks you with one finger, go with him with two.
Whoever asks you, answer him; and whoever wants to borrow from you, do not refuse him. Love your enemies.
You have heard that it was said: You should love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
And I say to you: love your enemies. Bless those who curse you. Do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you.
In order to be sons of your God in heaven, He sends His sun shining upon the wicked and the righteous, and He rains upon the righteous and the unrighteous.
If you love those who love you, what reward have you? Did not the tax collectors also do so?
And if you greet only your brothers, what goodness do you do? Do not the unchaste among them also do so?
Be complete as your father in the heavens is complete.
Charity
Beware that you do not fabricate lies before people in order that they may look at you, otherwise you will have no reward from your father in the heavens.
When you give a charity, do not stand before it with a trumpet, as the sailors do in the assemblies and in the alleys, in order to glorify the people. I tell you truly: they have received their full reward!
As for you, when you give charity, you do not know your left hand what your right hand is doing.
In order for your sincerity to be in secret. Your father who sees in secret is the one who will reward you publicly. Prayer.
And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray standing upright in public places and in the alleys of the streets, so that people may see you. I tell you the truth, they have received the full reward for their deeds!
As for you, when you pray, enter your chamber and close your door, and turn to your father who is hidden. For the father who is hidden will reward you openly.
And when you come to it, do not repeat the vain words of the people. They think that by their abundance of speech they will be answered.
Do not imitate them. For your father knows what you need before you ask him.
Disconnect yourselves like this: Our Father in the heavens, hallow your name.
Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Our bread is enough for us, give us today.
And forgive us our sins, just as We forgive those who do sin against us.
And do not let us be tested in [regard to] a trial, but We have delivered [them] from evil. For it is the King’s right, the power and the glory, forever. Amen.
For indeed, if you forgive the faults of the people, your Lord will forgive you.
And if you forgive men their faults, your Lord will forgive you your faults. Fasting.
And when you fast, do not assume a pretentious expression, like the hypocrites. They change their faces to appear to others as if they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have fulfilled their reward.
As for you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face.
In order not for people to see that you are fasting, but for your Father who is hidden; your Father who sees you in secret will reward you publicly. Treasures in heaven.
Do not treasure earthly treasures where rust destroys and thieves rob.
Verily, We have reserved for you treasures in the heavens, where no rust or decay exists, and where no thieves or robbers can reach.
Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
Sura-j sad is al-ayn, fa'inna kana 'aynu-ka basītan fa-jasadu-ka kulluhu yakūnu nīran.
And if your eye is evil, then your whole body will be darkened; if the light within you is darkness, how much more the darkness!
No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate one and love the other, or he will commit himself to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon. God takes care of us.
Therefore I say to you: do not worry about your life about what you eat and what you drink, nor about your bodies about what you wear. Does life not surpass food, and does the body surpass clothing?
Look at the birds of the sky: they do not sow or reap, nor do they store in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not better than them?
Who among you, if he were given a length of one arm, could add to his height an additional arm?
And why do you care about clothing? Consider the wildflowers in the field, how they grow! They don’t tire, nor do they spin.
But I say to you: it was no more than Solomon in all his glory wore a garment like one of these.
If the grass of the field which exists today and is thrown into the fire tomorrow, God clothes it in this way, is it not much more likely that He clothes you, O little believers?
Don't worry about those who say: What shall we eat? Or what shall we drink? Or what shall we wear?
And all these things your people ask for. For your exalted father knows that you need all of these.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and these things also will be given you.
Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow cares only for itself. Today is enough with its troubles.
Condemning others
Do not judge, lest you be judged.
For as you judge, you will be judged; and by the standard you use, it will be measured to you.
And why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, while you do not notice the log in your own eye?
Or how do you say to your brother, “Let me take the splint out of your eye, and there is a log in your eye”?
O you of little faith, first cast out the beam from your own eye, then you will see clearly that the mote is cast out of your brother’s eye!
Do not give the Holy City to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they crush you with their feet and turn back to tear you apart. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, you shall receive. Seek, you shall find. Knock, and it shall be opened to you.
Anyone who asks receives, anyone who seeks finds, and anyone who knocks will have the door opened to him.
Would any of you people, if your son asked you for a loaf of bread, give him a stone?
And if a fish asks him, should he give it to him alive?
If you are evil and know that you should give your children good gifts, how surely does your father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!
And whatever you wish that people should do to you, do the same to them. For this is the law and the prophets. The narrow gate
Enter through the narrow gate, for it is wide, and the way is broad and straight, leading to destruction, and many enter through it.
How narrow are the minds and how difficult is the path leading to life, and few are those who find it! The tree and its fruit.
Beware of the false prophets who come to you clothed in garments of wool, but they are from within ravaging wolves!
By their fruit you will know them. Do they gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
As every good tree produces good fruit, and as a bad tree produces bad fruit.
A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
And by their fruits you will know them.
Not everyone who says, “Lord, Lord!” will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, “Lord, Lord!” They will say, “Was it not by Your name that prophets prophesied?” And, “Was it not by Your name that demons were cast out?” And, “Was it not by Your name that many mighty works were done in our name?”
Then I declare to them: I never knew you! Go away from me, you doer of sin! The wise builders and the foolish builders.
“And whoever hears my words and acts upon them, I make him like a wise man, who has built his house upon the rock.”
The rain fell, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and it fell upon that house, but it did not collapse, because it was founded on rock.
Anyone who hears my words and does not act upon them is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
The rain fell, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and that house was struck, and it fell, and its fall was great!
And when Jesus had finished saying these things, the multitudes were amazed at his teaching.
Because he taught them as one with authority, not like a scribe.
Leprosy cure
And when they departed from the mountain, a great multitude followed them.
And if a fool came and prostrated himself before him, saying, “O my Lord, if you are able, you may purify me.”
Jesus extended his hand and touched him, saying, “You shall be cleansed. Be free from this disease!”
Jesus said to him, “Do not tell anyone. Rather, go and take your own oath to the priest, and offer the sacrifice that was commanded by Moses as testimony for them.” The centurion’s faith.
And when Jesus came to Capernaum, a centurion came to him,
He says, “O master, my slave is lying in the house, abandoned, suffering greatly.”
Jesus said to him, “I am coming and I will heal him.”
And the centurion answered and said, “My Lord, it is not fit for me to enter under your roof; nevertheless, tell your servant by your word, and he shall release him.”
Because I am also a human under Sultan. I have an army under my command. I say to one: “Go!” and he goes, and to another: “Come!” and he comes, and to my servant: “Do this!” and he does it.
And when Jesus heard it, he was amazed, and said to those who followed him, “Truly I say to you, I have not found faith in the region of Israel like this one.”
And I say to you: Many will come from the east and the west, and they will recline with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens.
As for the sons of the kingdom, they are cast out into the external darkness. There, weeping and gnashing of teeth take place.
Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go, and as you believe, it will be done for you.” And immediately the sick man was healed. The healing of Peter’s mother-in-law and other sick people also took place.
And when Jesus came to the house of Peter, he saw his mother in law lying sick and feverish.
When she touched her hand, she left her in fever, so she served them.
And as evening came, many madmen were brought to him, and he cast out the spirits with a word, and all the sick he healed.
In order for what was said by the prophet Isaiah to be fulfilled: “He took upon himself our illnesses and bore our diseases,” the price of submission.
And when Jesus saw a great multitude gathered unto him, he commanded that they should sit down on the grass.
And the writer stepped forward and said to him: “Teacher, I follow you wherever you go.”
And Jesus said to him, “As for foxes, they have dens, and as for birds, they have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”
Another of his disciples said to him, “Sir, allow me first to depart and bury my father.”
Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and let those who are being buried among the dead bury their dead.” Calm the storm.
And when they entered the ship, his disciples followed him.
And if a great disturbance had occurred in the sea, until the waves covered the ship, and he was sleeping.
And their students rushed forward and awakened him, saying, “Lord, save us, for we perish!”
He said to them, “Why are you afraid, you little of faith?” Then he rose and cursed the winds and the sea, and a great calm ensued.
And the people were amazed, saying, “Who is this who commands the winds and the sea, and they obey him?” He cast out the demons.
And when he came to the land of the Georgians, madmen emerged from the graves, excited beyond measure, so that no one could pass that road.
And if they cried out, saying, “What is this for, O Son of God? Did you come here before your time to torment us?”
And there was a large herd of pigs grazing far from them.
The devils said to him, “If you are indeed doing a thing, then grant us permission to depart to the flock of pigs.”
He said to them, “Go.” And they went and went to a herd of pigs, and behold, the entire herd rushed from the cliff to the sea, and died in the water.
The shepherds fled and went to the city, and they reported everything, and about the madness.
And if every city had come out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they asked him to depart from the regions around them.
Healing for a paralyzed person
He entered the ship and crossed over, and came to his city.
And if a paralytic came to him lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Be strong, son of David, and be healed.”
And if some people from the scribes say to themselves: “This is transgression!”
And Jesus knew their thoughts, saying, “Why do you think evil things in your hearts?”
It is easier to say: Your sins are forgiven, or: Get up and go?
But in order that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” when then he said to the paralytic, “Arise, take up your bed and go home!”
He went and proceeded to his house.
And when they saw the armies, they were astonished and glorified God who has given men such power. Matthew’s saying.
As Jesus was passing by, He saw a man sitting at the place of collection, whose name was Matthew. And He said to him, “Follow Me.” So he rose up and followed Him.
And while he was sitting at the house, there came two hundred men and publicans and sinners, and they sat with him and with his disciples.
And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, “Why does your Master eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, “A healthy person does not need a doctor, but only the sick.”
Go and learn what is: “Indeed, I desire compassion, not sacrifice, for I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.” A question about fasting.
And when Jesus had finished saying this, he departed from there and saw a tax collector named Levi at the door tending his belongings. He said to him, “Follow me.” And Levi got up and followed him. Then the tax collector, being a man of above average means, got up and followed him.
Jesus said to them, “Can the sons of the wedding feast weep while the bridegroom is with them? But it shall be in the days when the bridegroom is taken away, that they will fast.”
No one puts a patch on an old garment, for the full takes from it, and the tear becomes worse.
And they make no new wine in a narrow alleyway, lest the alleyway crack, for wine causes the alley to collapse and be destroyed. But they make new wine in a new alleyway, so that it is preserved in all its entirety. The establishment of Jairus’s daughter and the healing of the woman who had blood flow
And as he spoke to them in this way, a chief came and prostrated himself before him, saying, “Your daughter has just died, but come, put your hand upon her that she may live.”
Jesus rose and, with him were his disciples.
And if a woman had been bleeding for twelve years and had come behind him, and her hair was as dark as her cloak,
Because she said to herself: “If I just touched his clothes, I would be healed.”
Jesus turned and saw her, and said, “Woman, your faith has healed you.” And at that very moment, the woman was made whole.
And when Jesus came to the house of the president, and the singers and the crowd were making a commotion.
He told them, “Turn back, for the girl has not died, but is sleeping.” They laughed at him.
And when the crowd went out, he entered and seized her hand, whereupon the girl rose up.
That news spread throughout that land. Healing for the blind.
As Jesus was passing by, two blind men cried out and said, “Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!”
And when he came to the house, the two blind men approached him, and Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They said to him, “Yes, Lord!”
And then he touched their eyes and said, “According to your faith, let it be.”
Their eyes opened. Jesus rebuked them, saying, “Behold, you know nothing!”
But they went out and spread it throughout all the land. A cure for the mute.
As they were outside, a mad mute man was brought to him.
And when Satan withdrew, the mute spoke, and the crowds were amazed, saying, “Never has such a thing been seen in Israel!”
The Pharisees said, “He casts out demons by the prince of the demons!” A few were astonished.
And Jesus was going through the towns and villages, teaching in synagogues and among them, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing all who were sick in every kind of disease.
And when He saw the crowds, oppressed and exhausted, lying down like sheep without a shepherd.
Then he said to his disciples: “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.”
“Ask your Lord to send down a blessing upon your harvest.”
Sending the twelve
Then he called the twelve apostles and gave them authority over demons, to cast them out, and to heal all kinds of sickness and weakness.
As for the names of the twelve apostles, they are these: Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother. James, son of Zebedee, and John, his brother.
Phillips, and Barthalomew. Thomas, and Matthew the Tax Collector. James son of Joseph, and Lebaeus the Stylite.
Simعان al-Qānūwī, wa Yahūdha al-Iskhryūṭī alladhī assaltamahu.
These twelve He sent forth, saying, “Do not enter the way of the Gentiles, nor enter any city of the Samaritans;”
Go, and let the people seek the lost sheep of Israel.
And as you go forth, cry out: “The kingdom of heaven is near!”
Heal the sick. Cleanse the lepers. Raise the dead. Cast out demons. Freely you received, freely give.
Do not purchase gold or silver or copper in your areas.
And no provision for a road, nor clothing, nor shoes, nor a staff, for the doer is entitled to his food.
“And whenever you enter a city or settlement, search it thoroughly, and establish there [a settlement]; Allah knows what you implant in the earth and what you seek.”
And when you enter the house, greet him.
If the house is worthy, let your peace be upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.
And if they refuse you and do not listen to your words, then leave that house or that city, and wipe off your feet.
I tell you, the state of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment will be more probable than that of that city.
Here I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise like the serpent and simple like the dove.
But beware of people, for they will hand you over to assemblies, and in their gatherings they will skin you alive.
And you follow before rulers and kings for their certificates and for the nations.
When they surrender to you, do not care how or what you speak, because you will give what you speak about at that time.
You are not the speakers, but the spirit of your father speaks in you.
He will deliver his brother to death, and the father his son, and the sons will oppress their parents and kill them.
And you are hated by everyone for my name. But he who endures to the end is saved.
And when they drive you out of this city, flee to another. Truly, I say to you, you will not finish the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.
The student is not better than the teacher, nor the slave better than his master.
A student is enough if he is like his teacher, and a slave is enough if he is like his master. If they have called the master of the house Baal Zebul, how much more its family!
Do not fear them. For the hidden will not be concealed, and the secret will not be revealed.
What you say in the darkness, say it in the light, and what you hear in the ear, proclaim it on the housetops.
And do not fear those who kill the body, but do not fear those who kill the soul; be afraid of Allah alone, who has the power to destroy and give life, and who has no fear and does not rely on anyone.
Are two doves sold for a drachma? And one of them does not fall to the ground without your father.
And as for you, even the feeling of your heads all are counted.
Don't be afraid! You are better than many birds!
Anyone who testifies to me in front of people, I also testify to him before my God in the heavens.
But whoever denies me before people, I deny him too before my Lord in the heavens.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
Verily, I have come to make man rebel against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the son-in-law against his mother-in-law.
And a man’s enemies are his family.
Whoever loves their father or mother more than me does not deserve me, and whoever loves their son or daughter more than me does not deserve me.
And he who does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
Whoever found his life wasted because of me, and whoever wasted his life for me, finds it.
Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me.
Whoever accepts a prophet by the name of a prophet receives the reward of a prophet, and whoever accepts a righteous person by the name of a righteous person receives the reward of a righteous person.
And if anyone gives one of these little ones a cup of cold water merely in the name of a student, I tell you, his wage will not be lost.”
John the Baptist and Jesus
And when Jesus had finished the work assigned to Him for the twelve, He departed from there to teach and preach in their cities. Jesus and John the Baptist
But John, when he heard in prison of the works of the Christ, sent two of his disciples,
He said to him, “Are you the one coming, or do we wait for the last one?”
And Jesus answered them and said, “Go and tell John the things which you have heard and seen.”
The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise, and the poor preach.
And blessed are those who do not stumble in.
And while these two were gone, Jesus began to say to the multitudes about John: “What are you going out into the wilderness to look at? A fortress that is moved by the wind?”
But what did you come to look at? Are you looking at men wearing fine clothing? Behold, those who wear fine clothing are in the palaces of kings.
But what did you come to look at? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and someone better than a prophet.
And this is what he was written about: Behold, I send my angel before you to prepare your way.
I tell you the truth: among all men born, not greater than John the Baptist was there ever one; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven is being plundered, and the thieves are snatching it away.
For all the prophets that have been spoken of, and the Law, the angels which minister, unto them, herald[ed] unto Jesus.
And if you wish to accept, this is Elijah that is to come.
Whoever has ears, let him hear.
Who resembles this generation? They resemble children sitting in markets, calling out to their owners.
They say: "You danced for us, but you won't dance for us!" "You slapped us, but you won't hit us!"
Because John came and did not eat or drink, they said, “There is a demon in him.”
The Son of Man comes eating and drinking, and they say, “Behold, this is an eater and a drinker, a lover of scoundrels and sinners.” And wisdom disowns her children. Woe to the cities that do not repent!
Then he began to rebuke the cities in which he had shown the most of his strength, because they had not repented.
Woe to you, Corazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if you had done your deeds in the ways of Zion and in the holiness of the mountains, I would have forgiven you.
But I tell you: the images and the Sidonian women are more likely to have a right over you on the day of judgment than you have over them.
And you, O exalted Korhnah, raised to the heavens! You will descend into the abyss. For if the weapons forged in you had been made in Sodom, they would still exist today.
But I tell you, the land of Sodom will have a more certain condition on the day of judgment than you do. Rest for the weary.
At that time, Jesus answered and said, “You are blessed, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for these things are hidden from the wise and intelligent, but are declared to little children.”
Yes, Father, for such is good in Your sight.
Everything my father has given me, and no one knows the son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the son, and anyone who wants the son to reveal himself to him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Carry me with you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble of heart, so you may find peace for your souls.
Because Neri Hein and light load.
Sabbath
At that time, Jesus went out to the countryside on the Sabbath, and his disciples were hungry and began to gather wheat and eat.
The Pharisees, when they saw this, said to Him, “Your disciples are doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath!”
He said to them: “Have you read what happened to David when he and those with him were starving?”
How did He enter the House of God and eat the unleavened bread that was not permitted for Him nor for those with Him, but only for the priests?
Or what you read in the Torah that the priests on Saturday in the temple defile the Sabbath and are innocent?
But I tell you: here is greater than the temple!
If you know what is: I desire mercy, not sacrifice, lest you judge the innocent!
Then the son of man is also Lord of the Sabbath.
Then he turned away from there and came to their gathering.
And if a person’s hand is dry, they will ask him: “Is remission permitted in the place?” in order to complain about him.
He said to them, “If any of you has a sheep, and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not take it up and set it free?”
Man is surely better than the sheep! “If an act of good is done in a place!”
Then he said to the man: “Extend your hand.” So extend it. And it returned as right as the left. A favored son of God.
Then the Pharisees went and consulted together that they might put him to death.
And Jesus knew, and went away from there. And a great crowd followed Him, and He explained all to them.
And I instructed them not to show it.
In order to fulfill what was said by the prophet Isaiah:
Behold my servants whom I have chosen, my beloved whom I have devoted my soul to. He will declare to the nations the truth.
He doesn't argue or shout, and no one hears his voice in the streets.
A besieged fortress that cannot be breached, a smoldering wick that cannot be extinguished, until the truth emerges in victory.
And in his name, the hope of the nations is established. Jesus and Baal Zebul.
Then He brought to him a madman, blind and mute, and He gave him speech, so that the blind mute spoke and saw.
And all the crowds said, “Could this be David’s son?”
The Pharisees having heard it, said, “This is done only by Beelzebub, prince of the demons.”
And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself will fall, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.”
If Satan causes Satan to emerge, then he has divided himself against himself. How does he establish his kingdom?
And though I, Gabriel, cast out demons, your sons with whom do you cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges!
But if I, in the spirit of God, cast out demons, then the kingdom of God will come upon you!
Or how can anyone enter the house of the strong and plunder his possessions, unless the strong has been bound first, and then plundered his house?
Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not join me separates from me.
Therefore I say to you: every libel and slander that is found will be forgiven to the people, but as for slander against the Spirit, it will not be forgiven to the people.
And whoever utters a word against his brother, it will be forgiven for him, but as for he who utters against the Spirit of God, it will not be forgiven, neither in this world nor in the next.
Make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for from the fruit you know the tree.
You snakes! How can you speak of good things when you are evil? For from the dregs of the heart comes the speech of the mouth.
A good person brings forth good things from their good heart, and a bad person brings forth bad things from their bad heart.
But I tell you: every idle word that people speak will be repaid to them on the day of judgment.
“For as you bring up yourselves by your words, so will you be brought down by them; for you justify yourself with your words and condemn yourself.” - Jonah 1
Then came scribes and Pharisees, and said unto him, “Teacher, we wish to see a sign of you.”
And he answered them and said to them: “You are a generation that asks for a sign, and no sign will be given to you except the sign of Jonah the prophet.”
For as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, so too is the son of man three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
The men of Nineveh will repent in the faith with this generation and condemn it, because they have turned with a shout like Jonah, and behold, greater than Jonah is here!
Queen of Tihaman will arise in the time of this generation and its religion, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, it is greater than Solomon here!
If the foul spirit departs from the human, it passes through places where there is no water, seeking rest and finding none.
Then he says: “Return to your house from which you came out. And he comes and finds it empty, bare, and furnished.”
Then he goes and takes with him seven other evil spirits with him, and they enter and dwell there, so that he becomes the last of that human being more wicked than his beginnings! Thus it is also for this wicked generation. God’s will was done.
And as he spoke to the crowds while his mother and brothers stood outside asking him to speak to them.
One man said to him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, asking to speak with you.”
And he replied to the one who said to him: “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”
Then he reached out towards his students and said, “Here is my mother and my brothers.”
“For he who makes his brother’s will, who is in the heavens, is my brother and my sister and my mother.”
Like the farmer and his interpretation
On that day, Jesus went out from the house and sat by the sea.
Large crowds gathered, so much so that he entered the ship and sat down. The entire crowd remained on the shore.
And he spoke to them much, saying, “Behold, the husbandman went out to sow.”
As he was planting, some fell on the road, and the birds came and ate them.
He fell upon the barren places, where there was little soil, and sprouted a rush, for he had no depth of earth.
But when the sun rose, it burned, and as it had no root, its throat dried up.
He fell upon the thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked him.
The last one fell on the good earth and gave a fruit, some hundred and the last sixty and the last thirty.
“Whoever has two ears, let him listen.”
And the students approached him and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”
And He answered them, saying, “Because you have been given the secret of the kingdom of heaven, but it will not be given to those who are outside.”
Whoever has has given to him and increased, but as for he who has not, that which he has will be taken from him.
For this reason I am speaking in parables to them, because they are seeing but do not perceive, and hearing but do not understand.
The prophecy of Isaiah says: “You have heard, but you have not understood; you have seen, but you have not perceived.”
Because the heart of this people has grown hardened, and their ears have grown heavy with hearing, and they have closed their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn back to be healed.
But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
Verily, I say unto you that many prophets and righteous ones desired to see what you see, and did not see, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear.
Hear you, like a planter:
Anyone who hears the word of the Kingdom and does not understand, then the evil one comes and snatches up what has been planted in his heart. This is what is planted on the way.
The planted crop is the one that hears the word, and it readily accepts it with joy.
But it has no root in itself, but is only until. And if distress or persecution occurs for the word, then he stumbles.
He who plants a tree among thorns is the one who hears the word, and this is the world and the arrogance of wealth that stifle the word, so that it bears no fruit.
As for the planted on good land, it is he who hears the word and understands. And he who brings forth fruit, making some hundred and others sixty and others thirty. Like wheat and barley.
Give them one more example, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who planted a good seed in his field.”
While people were sleeping, his enemy came and planted melons in the middle of the wheat and departed.
And when the plant grew and produced a fruit, then also appeared the beasts.
Then came ‘Abid, the master of the house, and they said to him: “O master, is it not a good crop you planted in your field? From where does he get his wool?”
He said to them: A man, an enemy, has done this. The slaves said to him: Do you want us to go and gather him?
He said: “No! Lest you uproot the wheat with the chaff while you are gathering it.”
Invite them to grow together to the harvest, and at the time of the harvest I say to the harvesters: “First gather the wheat and bundle it tightly to burn, and as for the barley, gather it to my granaries.” Like a mustard seed and like yeast.
Give them one more example, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field.”
It is the smallest of all the visitors. But when it sleeps, it becomes the largest of the legumes, and it becomes a tree, even if the birds of the sky come and take shelter in its branches.
He said to them, “For as the yeast is added to the dough of the loaves, so my word is to be received.”
All this he was saying to the multitudes in parables, and without a parable he did not say anything to them.
In order to fulfill what was said about the Prophet who said, “I will open with the examples of my mouth, and speak of things that have been silent since the establishment of the world,” interpret it like wheat and chaff.
Then Jesus dismissed the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him, saying, “Interpret for us the parable of the tares.”
He replied to them: “The sower of a good seed is the son of a man.”
And the field is the world. And the good harvest is the sons of the kingdom. And the beasts are the sons of the evil one.
And the enemy he sowed is that of Satan. And the harvest is the end of the world. And the harvesters are the angels.
As those who gather and are burned with fire, so it will be at the end of this world:
The son of humankind sends his angels, who gather from his kingdom all transgressions and perpetrators of sin.
They cast them into the furnace of fire. There, there is weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their father. Let those who have ears, hear. Examples of the treasure and the pearl and the net.
Also, the kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and concealed. And, from his joy, he went and sold all that he had and bought that field.
It is also like the kingdom of the heavens, a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls.
And when he found one pearl of great price, he sold all that he had and bought that pearl.
It is also like the kingdom of the heavens, a network cast into the sea, and a university of every kind.
And when it was full, they launched it on the shore, and they sat down and gathered the camels into basins, and as for the worthless ones, they threw them out.
Thus it will be at the end of the world: the angels will appear and will separate the wicked from the righteous.
They cast them into the furnace of fire. There, weeping and teeth-gritting.
Jesus said to them, “Do you understand all of this?” They replied, “Yes, Lord.”
He said to them: “For all the learned scribe in the kingdom of the heavens is like a man of the house who goes out from his treasure of great worth and has freed slaves.”
And when Jesus had finished these illustrations, He departed from there. Nazareth rejected Jesus.
And when he came to his homeland, he was teaching them in their gathering until they were astonished and said, “From where has this wisdom and might come to him?”
Isn't he the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother named Mary, and his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Are all of his sisters with you? Where did this come from for all of them?
They would stumble upon him. And Jesus said to them, “No prophet arises mighty in his own land, and in his own house.”
There were not many forces created because of their disbelief.
The beheading of John the Baptist
At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard concerning Jesus.
He said to his servants, “John the Baptist has risen from the dead! And therefore, mighty powers are at work.”
Then Herod had John arrested and bound, and cast him into prison.
John was saying to him, “It is not permitted for you.”
And when he intended to kill him, he feared the people, for they regarded him as a prophet among them.
Then when the birth of Herod had come, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and Herod was enraged.
Then he promised that whatever you asked for, he would give it to you.
Then, when she had received from her mother, she said, “Give me here on a dish of John the Baptist.”
The king was concerned. But for the portions and the ornamented ones with him, an order was given to be granted.
So he sent and cut off the head of John in prison.
So he brought his head on a plate and pushed it to the basin, and she brought it to her mother.
And their students came and lifted up the body and buried him. Then they came and told Jesus about the feeding of the five thousand men.
And when Jesus heard it, He departed thence by ship into a solitary place. Then the multitudes, following Him, came unto Him from cities around.
And when Jesus went out, He saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion for them, and He healed their sick.
And when evening came, his disciples approached him and said, “The place is deserted and the time has passed. Send away the crowds, so they may go to the villages and buy food for themselves.”
Jesus said to them, “They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.”
They said to him: “Here we have only five loaves and two fish.”
He said, “Bring it here to me.”
Then he commanded the crowd to sit on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to give to the crowd.
I ate everything and they became full. Then they raised twelve baskets filled with the remainder.
The eaters numbered about five thousand men, excluding the women and the children. The miracle of walking on water
And so Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him on the other side to the shore, while he himself was sending the multitudes away with the boats.
And after the crowds dispersed, he ascended the mountain individually to pray. And when evening came, he was alone.
As for the ship, it had become afflicted in the midst of the sea with the waves, because the wind was opposing it.
In the fourth hour of the night, Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.
And when the disciples saw the boat being lowered, they were troubled, saying, “It is merely a conjuring trick!” And they cried out in fear!
As Jesus was saying to them, “Be encouraged! I am he. Do not be afraid.”
And Peter answered and said, “Lord, if you art he, then bid me to come unto thee on the water.”
He said, “Come.” So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water to come to Jesus.
But when he saw the wind violent, he feared. And as he began to sink, he cried out, “O my Lord, rescue me!”
And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, and said, “O you of little faith, why did you have doubt?”
And when they entered the ship, the wind calmed.
And those who were on the ship, they came and prostrated themselves before Him, saying, “Verily, you are the Son of God!”
And when they had crossed, they came to the land of Gennesaret.
Then he sent men to that place. So he sent to all that surrounding area and brought all the patients to him.
And they asked him to just touch the grey hair of his cloak. And all who touched it were healed.
The pure and the impure
Then came unto Jesus scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem, saying
Why do your students imitate the elders, and do they not wash their hands when they eat bread?
He replied to them: “And you too, why do you exceed God’s command because of your imitation?”
And God said, “Establish reverence for your parents. And whoever curses or reviles their father or mother, say to him, ‘Surely hell awaits you with your father and mother.’”
And you say, “Who told his father or his mother, ‘A sacrifice is that with which I gain benefit’?” Do they not honor their father and mother?
You have invalidated God’s will because of your imitation!
Hear ye, hear ye! Isaiah prophesied of you saying:
This people approach me with their mouths, and honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me, far away.
And they worship me, while they know the teachings which are the commandments of mankind.
Then he called the assembly and said to them: “Listen and understand.”
It is not what enters the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth this defiles the person.
Then His disciples approached and said to Him, “Teacher, when the Pharisees saw Your words, they were amazed, and they lost their count.”
He replied, “Every seedling that was not planted by my father, the Semawi, is uprooted.”
Leave them. They are blind leading the blind. And if one blind man leads another, they both fall into a pit.
And Peter answered him and said, “Explain to us this parable.”
And Jesus said, “Are you still not understanding?”
Don't you understand that everything that enters the mouth goes to the stomach and is expelled from the exit?
As for what comes out of the mouth, it proceeds from the heart, and that defiles the human being.
For from the heart come wickedness, murder, impurity, licentiousness, theft, false witness, and blasphemy.
This is what defiles a human being. And as for eating with unclean hands, it does not defile a human being. The faith of the Canaanite woman.
Then Jesus went out from there and departed to the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon.
And if a Canaanite woman, coming from those mountains, cried out to him and said, “Please, my lord, O son of David, my daughter is tormented by a malicious spirit.”
She didn't answer a word. Then her students came forward and asked her, “Please, send her away, because she’s crying behind us!”
And he answered and said, “I have not sent except to the stray sheep of Israel.”
And she came and prostrated herself before Him, saying, “My Lord, give me strength!”
He replied and said, “It is not good to take the bread of the children and throw it to the dogs.”
She said, “Yes, sir! And dogs also eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ tables!”
Then Jesus answered her and said, “Woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you wish.” And immediately the girl was healed, and many other things were healed also in that region. Feeding of the 4000
Then Jesus went from there and came to the side of the Sea of Galilee, and He went up the mountain and sat there.
Then a great multitude came unto Him, and they were carried upon beds, and some were lame, some blind, some deaf, and speechless, and many others besides, and they cast them down at the foot of Jesus. Then He healed them.
And they were amazed, the crowds being astonished as they saw the mute speaking, the lame walking, the crippled leaping, and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel.
And Jesus, seeing the crowds, was moved with compassion, for they had been three days without food, and he said, “I have compassion for these people, because they have now been three days with an empty stomach. I do not want to send them away hungry on the road, lest they faint.”
His disciples said to Him, “Where are we to buy enough bread for these people to eat? For there are five thousand men.”
Jesus said to them, “How much bread do you have? They replied, ‘Seven loaves and a few small fish.’”
He commanded the troops to lie down on the ground.
And he took the seven loaves and the fish, and gave thanks and broke them, and gave the loaves and the fish to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the multitude.
I ate everything and they became full. Then they raised seven baskets filled with leftovers.
The eaters were four thousand men, excluding the women and the children.
Then he dispersed the people and went up to the ship and came to the outskirts of Magdala.
Ayat requested
And the Pharisees and the Sadducees came to test him, so they asked him to show them a miracle from heaven.
He replied to them: “If it is evening, say: clear, for the sky is red.”
And in the morning: today is winter because the sky is crimson with anger. O, messengers! You know how to discern the face of the sky, but you cannot recognize the signs of the times!
A generation of wicked, corrupt people seeks a sign, and no sign is given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet. Then he left them and went on his way. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
And when their disciples came to the plain of Moab, they forgot to take bread.
And Jesus said to them, “Behold, take care of yourselves from the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
Think to themselves saying: “We haven’t taken any bread.”
And Jesus said to them, “Why do you say that I must perform a miracle? Do not doubt, little ones, that I want to take bread?”
Do you still not understand? Do you not remember the five barley loaves that fed the five thousand, and how many pails of bread you took?
And seven loaves and four thousand mouneh, how many loaves did you take with you?
“Can you not understand that I did not speak about bread? I told you to beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
Then they understood that he had not said to them to guard themselves against the yeast of bakers, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter’s Confession of Christ
And when Jesus came to the vicinity of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, “Who do you say that I am?”
They said, “Some say: John the Baptist, and others: Elijah, and others: Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
He said to them, “And you, who do you say that I am?”
Simon replied to Peter and said, “You are the Messiah, the Son of God, the living God!”
And Jesus answered him and said, “Blessed art thou, Simon son of Jonah, that thou hast hidden mine own word in thy heart; and I shall no more hide it from thee.”
And I also say to you: You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, for whatever is bound on earth is bound in heaven; and whatever is loosed on earth is loosed in heaven.”
Then, his disciples advised him not to say to anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus announces his death and resurrection.
From that time on, Jesus began to show Himself to His disciples, and He said to them, “You must go to Jerusalem, for it is written of Him that He will suffer the indignation of men and will die, and on the third day He will rise again.”
And Peter took him to Jesus, and began to rebuke him, saying, “Stay away from our Lord! Surely not for you!”
And He turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are setting me upon a trap because you care about people’s opinions more than about God’s.”
Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.”
Whoever desires to save himself will harm himself, but whoever saves himself will harm me.
What does the human gain if he wins the whole world and loses himself? Or what does the human give in exchange for his own life?
And the son of man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then He will recompense each one according to his works.
Verily I say unto you, there shall arise a people among you who will not taste death until they see the son of man coming in His kingdom.
Manifestation
And after six days, Jesus took Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain in a solitary place.
And its appearance changed before them, and his face was illuminated like the sun, and his clothes became white like light.
And if Moses and Elijah appeared to them speaking with him.
And Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, be glad that we are here! If you wish, we will make three tabernacles for you, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
As he spoke, if a generous cloud shaded them, and a voice from the cloud said: “This is my beloved son, in whom I rejoiced. Let them hear his name.”
And when the disciples heard it, they fell face down and were afraid.
Jesus came and touched them and said, “Rise, do not be afraid.”
And they lifted up their eyes, and behold, they saw only Jesus alone.
As they were going down the mountain, Jesus said to them, “Do not tell anyone that you have seen me, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.”
And he would ask his students, saying: “Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
And Jesus answered them and said, “First Elias must come and restore all things.”
But I say to you: Elijah has come, and they did not recognize him, but they did everything he wanted. So too will the Son of Man suffer from them.”
Then the students understood that he had told them about John the Baptist. A boy was healed of a demon.
And when they came to the assembly, a man hastened forward to him.
And he said, “O my lord, have mercy on my son, for he is dying and suffering greatly, and he falls frequently into the fire and frequently into the water.”
