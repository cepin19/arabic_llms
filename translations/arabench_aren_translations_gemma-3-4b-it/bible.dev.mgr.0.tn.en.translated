The Origin of Jesus Christ (Luke 3:23-38)
This is the lineage of the family of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham:
Ibrahim gave Isaac. And Isaac gave Jacob. And Jacob gave Judah and his brothers.
And Judah brought forth a vine and a staff from Tamar. And the vine bore figs. And the figs bore grapes.
And Aram brought with him Efnadab. And Efnadab brought with him Nahson. And Nahson brought with him Salmon.
And Salmon brought Boaz from Ramah. And Boaz brought Obed from Ruthe. And Obed brought Jeshua.
Wasaa brought King David. After that, David took Solomon from the maid who was taking him, Uriah.
And Solomon followed Rehoboam. And Rehoboam followed Abijah. And Abijah followed Asa.
And Asa begat Jehoshafat. And Jehoshafat begat Yooram. And Yooram begat Obed.
And Aziah went to meet Uzziah. And Uzziah went to meet Amaziah. And Amaziah went to meet Zechaiah.
And Jehoachin brought Mansa. And Mansa brought Amun. And Amun brought Yoshias.
Joshiya, his cousin, and his brothers were Jews exiled in Babylon.
And after the period of their exile had passed in Babylon, Kinaya brought a question. And Shallteel brought a reply.
Worsabbal jab abihood. Wa abihood jab aliyaqeem. Wa aliyaqeem jab aazour.
And a gazelle brought Sadouq. And Sadouq brought Akhim. And Akhim brought Aliyud.
And Elias took Eliaszer. And Eliaszer took Manasseh. And Manasseh took Jacob.
And Jacob brought Joseph, the husband of Mary, who gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Messiah.
And thus we find forty generations from Abraham to David, forty generations from David until the dispersion of the Jews into Babylon, forty generations, and a time of exile of a hundred and twenty years of their possessions in Babylon, until Jesus came. The birth of Jesus Christ (Luke 2:1-7)
Wow how was Jesus born: When Mary, his mother, was engaged to a man named Joseph, before they got married, she conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit.
Yusuf decided that his fiancé should stay away from him without revealing her, out of respect, because he was a man who feared God.
And he was still pondering the story, when a messenger appeared from God in his dream, and said: “O Joseph, son of David, do not fear to marry Mary. She is with great power of the Holy Spirit.”
And when you have a child, you name him Jesus, for his people to be cleansed from their sins.
And this is all done to fulfill what God said through the Prophet saying:
Zechariah 7:14 The virgin is with child and she will bear a son, and she will call his name Emmanuel. (For he is God with us).
Wuttali Yusuf woke up, dressed as if he were an angel from God, and went to his wife’s house.
But he didn't sleep with her until she gave birth to the child, and he named him Jesus.
The wisdom of the wise
When Jesus was born in Bethlehem in the land of the Jews, in the days of King Herod, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.
They said, “Where is the King of the Jews who was born? We have seen the star appear in the East, so we came to prostrate ourselves before him.”
And the King Herod heard this thing, and he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him.
The prophets and scribes questioned all the Jews about the place where the Messiah was to be born.
Answer: “In a house in Bethlehem in the region of Judea, where the wise men wrote in the book of the prophet:”
# Micah 5:2 And though you are little among the cities of Judah, O settlement of Bethlehem, in the land of Israel; you shall come out possessed and ruled over—the Prince of the house of David shall rule over the house of your father.
And Herod said to the wise men, without hearing from anyone, and he established for them the time when the star appeared.
And he sent them to Bethlehem and said to them, “Go and behold the child. When you have found him, say to him, ‘Rejoice, great is he who is come of you.’ And in that house, I know that he is.”
After they heard the King's words, they went. And when they were on the way, the star they had seen before in the east started walking in front of them until it reached and stopped above the place where the child was.
And when Watli saw the star, they rejoiced greatly.
And they entered the house and found the child with Umm Maryam. They just landed on their camels, prostrated before him, solved his problems, gave him gold and incense and musk.
My Lord warned me in a dream that they should not return to Herod, or that they had found another way and gone to their own country. Escape from Egypt.
After they went to the wise men, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said: “Behold, depart for Egypt with the child and his mother, and stay until you are out of the reach of Herod. For he will seek to destroy the child.”
Ya'ki qam Yusuf wa hazz al-tifl wa ummuhu fi al-layl wa masha li Misr.
# He was 11:1; the donkey 4:22 and dwelt there until he died Herod, that the thing which the Lord said by the mouth of the prophet might be done. And they killed the young ones in Bethlehem.
Waqtli saw Herod, who was very wealthy and mocked him, and he ordered that all the small children in Bethlehem and in the places that he desired, as long as they were two years old or less, according to the time that the wise men told him.
Man, the thing the prophet Jeremiah said has been done.
# It was in Ramah they heard a cry, And weeping and wailing, Rahael is weeping for her children And she does not want to accept consolation, And Homa is not here. Returning from Egypt to Nazareth
And when Joseph was in Egypt, God revealed to him in a dream that Herod, King of the Jews, had killed his beloved wife.
And they said, “People! The child and his mother were beaten and returned to the land of Israel, because those who loved him wanted to kill him, and he died.”
He got up and shook the child and his mother and returned to the land of Israel.
But as he had heard of Archelaus, who was king of the Jews in Herod’s place in Perea, he feared that he would seize them. Indeed, God warned him in a dream, so he went to the region of Galilee.
And he walked to a city called Nazareth and resided there so that he would fulfill what the prophets had said: “That it should be called Nazareth.”
John the Baptist's preaching (Mark 1:1-8; Luke 3:1-18; John 1:19-28)
And in those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness and in the Jewish regions, preparing the way.
He says, “Repent, the Kingdom of the Heavens is near!”
John 4:3 and this is what the prophet Isaiah said: “Hearken, a voice crying in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, and make straight paths for Him!’”
And John was wearing clothing made of camel hair, and he was equipped with a leather belt, and his food was locusts and honey from the comb.
And people were coming to him from Jerusalem and all of Judea and the regions surrounding the Jordan.
And they will confess their sins, and their chief place is in the valley of Jordan.
Wotley saw a lot of prisoners and conspirators coming to try to deceive him, and he said to them, “You, sons of the righteous! Who alerted you to flee from God’s impending wrath?”
Do something that makes you confess.
You're saying in your hearts, "We are the children of Ibrahim." I'm taking you, God is able to make stone into children of Ibrahim.
The sap is stuck in the veins of the trees; the tree that doesn't produce a good yield is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I will baptize you with water, but after that, the Strong One is coming who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
And he shook the pack of planks in his hands and sorted the grapes in the hall, he threshed the grain in the storehouse, as for the straw, he was burning it with a fire that would not be extinguished. John baptized Jesus (Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21-22)
Jesus went from the region of Galilee to the Jordan on purpose to dip John’s hands.
But John didn't let them, and they said to him, "You must rely on us, how do you come to us?"
But Jesus answered, “Let this happen as you have planned. By doing this, you will fulfill all your righteous purposes.” John agreed.
When God told Jesus, water came out, and the heavens darkened, he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and laid it upon him.
And a voice from the sky says: “This is my son whom I loved, and I am happy for him.”
Satan tempts Jesus (Mark 1:12-13; Luke 4:1-13)
And the Holy Spirit led Jesus away from Satan, who was testing him.
Man, I fasted for forty days and forty nights until I was starving.
Come and try it, they said, “If you are the son of God, say to this stone, ‘Be bread.’”
# 8:3 Jesus answered and said, “The scripture says, ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word of God.’”
And they cast dust upon the holy city, and stood upon the threshold of the house of the Lord.
# Verse 91:11-12 and they said, “You are the son of God, cast your patriotic spirit, as written in the Bible: your angels advise you, and they shake you before their faces so that you do not strike yourself in the chamber of your foot.”
Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘You shall not make other gods in my image.’”
He built a huge castle and placed it on a high mountain, and behind it were all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
They said, “We will give you this calf, if you descend upon your mount and prostrate yourself before me.”
# Matthew 6:13; Mark 8:33 Then the devil answered Jesus and said, “Depart from me, you hypocrite! It is written that God alone is to be worshipped.”
And he abandoned himself to the devil and strayed, and the angels came and began to serve him. Jesus preached in Galilee (Mark 1:14-15; Luke 4:14-15)
And Jesus heard from John that he returned to the region of Galilee.
And Naassarah left and walked and settled in Kfarnaim, which is on the sea, in the possessions of the regions of Zebulun and Naftali.
As the thing that the prophet Isaiah said:
# Area 9:1-2, the territory of Nathanyah and the territory of Zabulon, on the sea, on the road to Jordan, Galilee, the land of the other peoples!
The people who were in darkness saw a great light, and in the shadow of the land of death, those who were there were illuminated by the light.
At this time, Jesus began to preach and say, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.” Jesus called his disciples (Mark 1:16-20; Luke 5:1-11).
Yeshua was walking on the shore of the Sea of Galilee when he saw two of his brothers, Simon who was calling out to Peter and Andrew, throwing nets in the lake, as they were fishermen.
He said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishermen of men’s goods.”
And they followed him with their nets and their belongings.
As he was sailing, Malgadi saw two other brothers: Yaqub, son of Zibdi, and his brother Yohanna, in the boat with their father Zibdi repairing the nets, and they called out to him.
And while they were in the boat, he was troubled with a fever, and so they followed him. Jesus taught and preached and healed the sick (Luke 6:17-19).
And Jesus was in all Galilee, teaching in the synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and healing all kinds of diseases and all kinds of infirmities among the people.
And they published news in all of Syria. And the patients came to them, with all kinds of diseases and convulsions, and those who lived among them, the afflicted, the paralyzed, and the disabled—they healed them.
And many people followed them from Galilee and the region that is called the Ten Cities, and Jerusalem and Judea, and the region on the other side of the Jordan.
The Sermon on the Mount (Luke 6:20-23)
And Jesus went up to the mountain and sat there, and during this time his disciples came to him.
And he began to teach them, saying:
May the poor have peace in their souls! They will take possession of the kingdom of the heavens.
Condolences to you! They should also offer their condolences.
Health to the good people! They will inherit the land.
Health craves the vessels and the thirst for the truth! They will surely be satisfied.
Health to those who deserve it! They will surely show mercy.
May their health be with those whose hearts are pure! They are the faces of God, for Him to see.
Health belongs to those who reconcile people! Let them be God's children so that they may be called.
Health to those who suffer for the sake of truth! The kingdom of the heavens will take them.
May God protect you, may people argue with you and abuse you and say hurtful things to you, all for my sake!
Rejoice and leap for joy because your reward is great in heaven. Thus were the prophets punished before you. The salt and the light (Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34-35)
You are the salt of the earth, but what if the salt is no longer in a restaurant, how do you get it back? It's no longer good for anything, even things that were meant to be thrown away and people would spoil them.
You are the light of the world. There isn't a city built on a mountain that doesn't shine.
There isn't one person who lights a lamp and puts it under a pot, but rather he puts it in a high place and shines it on the whole house.
May your light shine before people, so they may see your magnificent deeds and praise you in the heavens.
It doesn't occur to you that I came to abolish the Sharia and the prophets, I didn't come to abolish them, but to complete them.
You conveyed the truth: Even when the heavens and the earth passed away, it did not yield until a single letter or a single dot was missing from the Sharia [Islamic law] until everything was completed.
Anyone who does not obey one of the smallest commandments of these and teaches people to be like him, so that he is called a small in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever obeys them and teaches them to be called a great in the kingdom of heaven.
I am telling you, if you are not more righteous than the merchandise of the Jews and the Pharisees, you have never entered the kingdom of heaven. Deceit.
“You have heard me say to the magistrates: ‘Do not kill, and whoever kills shall be subject to judgment.’”
But I tell you, if anyone sleeps with a man, the court must judge him, and if anyone says to his brother, “You are ignorant,” the Jewish council must judge him, and if anyone says to his brother, “You are a beast,” he must go to hell.
Lean on me, kill me, you advance in your offering at the altar and remember the problem you have with your brother.
Leave your offering before the altar and go. First, reconcile with your brother, and then offer your offering.
And if someone complained about you, you should reconcile with him in a short amount of time, and you both go to court so he doesn't complain about you to the judge, and the judge tells the police, and you go to prison.
Move the truth: You mustn't leave until you pay the last cent. Prostitution.
# Heard saying to your virgins: "Do not commit adultery."
But I told her that anyone from the Khazar who wants her, she is cheating on him in his heart.
If your eye makes you make mistakes, cut it off and throw it away. It's better to lose a piece of your body than to have your whole body thrown into hell.
And if your hand causes you to err, cut it off and throw it away; for it is better that you should lose a part of your body than that your whole body go into hell. Divorce (Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11-12; Luke 16:18)
# Rev 24:1-4 “And Zera said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife shall give her her writing of divorce.’”
But I tell you: whoever divorces his wife for a reason other than adultery makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman will commit adultery.
“And you have heard the saying of those who oppress you, ‘Do not swear by God, lest your oaths be void.’ But as for what you swear by, be quick to fulfill it. Let not anyone be ashamed of his word and of his oath, but let him fulfill it for fear of God.”
But I tell you, do not swear by the whole earth, nor by God's throne for it.
# Psalm 66:1; Zechariah 7:49; Zechariah 48:2 And not in the land as he desired, nor in Jerusalem as he longed for, the city of the King's great treasure.
And you don't swear on your head, you won't even reply with a white or black hair.
Let your words be what they are, and nothing more than that; anything beyond that is not good. “Revenge” (Luke 6:29-30)
# Heard this saying: "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
But I tell you: don't seek revenge if they do evil with you. But if someone hits you on your right cheek, give him the other also increased.
He loves to argue with you to take your purse, let him take your child as well.
And if someone forces you to go with them a kilometer, go with them two.
To anyone who asks you for something, give it to him. And whoever wants to borrow from you, do not grant him. Love your enemies (Luke 6:27-28, 32-36).
Have you heard the saying: "Love your neighbor and hate your enemy."
But I tell you: love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.
Be as you wish for your children in the heavens. May it make the sun shine upon the wealthy and the needy, and give rain to the righteous and the wicked.
What reward do you deserve if you love those who love you? Seriously, do those who work in taxes do that with their own hands?
What do you say if others tell you that if you didn't respect them, it was to your sisters? Seriously, who doesn't know God wouldn't do such a thing with their own hands?
You must be whole, just as He is full in the fullness of heaven.
Charity
Respond with your hands, do good in front of people so they see you, you didn't have a wage with your father who is in heaven.
If you donate to one person, you don't ring a bell like hypocrites in assemblies and streets so that people praise you. We expose your deceit: they have taken their reward.
But you, if you kill yourself, you won’t let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Give to the needy secretly, and the Lord will reward you. - Luke 11:2-4
“When you pray, don’t be like the hypocrites, who stand and pray in the mosques so that people see you. Let me tell you the truth: they have taken their reward.”
But you, go, pray and enter your private home, and lock the door and pray to your father who doesn't show himself. And your father who sees in secret to reward you.
And don't keep repeating yourselves with empty words like the other people who only say what they think God wants them to say, a lot of talk.
You shouldn’t be like them, on the whim of your ego knowing what you need before asking for it.
Here’s the translation: Imla shlyo haka: Ya bona el fi el samā’, khalli ismak yitqaddas.
Make your kingdom flourish as it does in the heavens, let your will be strong as it is on earth.
Every day we give ourselves enough bread.
Forgive our sins, as we forgive those who wrong us.
We didn't get into the experience, and we were saved from it.
And if you forgive the faults of others, God will forgive your sins.
But if you forgive others their faults, just as God forgives you for your faults, then do not presume to [forgive] your Lord. Fasting
And as for fasting, don't show sadness on your faces like hypocrites do, turn your faces down so you show people what you're fasting for. You've taken your reward: they've taken it.
But you, you have to fast, comb your hair and wash your face.
Make fasting a joy for you, not a burden. Let it not be seen by others, but rather be seen by God who sees all your hidden deeds. Keep your actions secret that you may be rewarded for them. Wealth (Luke 12:33-34).
Their treasures in the earth will rot with mold and corruption, and thieves will dig them up and steal them.
But treasure your hearts in heaven, which are not corrupted by moth or rust, nor do they decay like earthly treasures, nor are they plundered by thieves, nor defiled.
Where is your treasure? Where is your heart? – Nur Al-Badan (Luke 11:34-36)
The eye is the light of the body. If your eye is healthy, then let your whole body be filled with light.
But if your eye is diseased, then your body’s kidneys must be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, then how much more will the darkness grow! “God rather than money” (Luke 12:22-31; 16:13)
No one can serve two masters, he either must hate one and love the other, or obey one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.
I'm telling you, I'm letting you know what you shouldn't be worrying about in your life – whether it's to eat or to drink, or about your clothes. Why should life be about food, and clothes about clothing?
Look at the birds of the sky, how they don't plant or harvest or store in a granary, and they have God who feeds them. Aren't you all better than them in many ways?
Who among you thinks he could gain an extra hour of age?
Why are you worrying about the clothes? Ask Nour about the sheep in Bouqroun how it grows: it doesn't get tired and it doesn't spin.
But I tell you: even King Solomon, in all his majesty, didn't wear one like her!
If God wears hashish like this, then let the hashish grow today and be thrown into the flames of the Tabernacle tomorrow, how can you claim that you are worthy to wear what your faith is weak!
Why do you doubt and say: What do we eat? Or what do we drink? Or what do we wear?
Anyone who enters all these things, those who are not believers, and those who desire what is in the sky know what you need.
But you entered at first into the kingdom of God and of riches and pleasures, and those things were supplies to sustain you.
That’s why you shouldn’t worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow is the day you can worry about yourself. Every day is enough with its troubles.
Do not judge by appearances (Luke 6:37-38, 41-42)
You can't control people so as not to be controlled by them.
The person who judges people based on what they accuse them of, and the scale they weigh them with, is the one who will ultimately control them.
Why do you look at the straw in your brother's eye, but not at the nail in your own?
And how can you say to your brother, "Let me pull the straw out of your eye"? Do you have a painting in your eye?
You hypocrite! Take the plank out of your eye, for you are going to see that the log is in your own eye first, and then you will remove the straw from your brother’s eye.
“Do not give the holy things to the dogs, and do not throw your precious pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet and turn and attack you.” Ask and take (Luke 11:9-13)
Ask and take, assist and receive, call to dismantle you.
He who asks receives, he who seeks finds, he who knocks will be opened.
Who among you is asking for a child to be given a room,
And if you ask him to give it to you?
If you are the evil ones who know how to give your children good things, then how much do you have in heaven so that he can give good things to those who ask him?
Imala, do with people the things they wish to do with you. This is what the law and the prophets say. Luke 13:24
Enter the narrow gate. Upon the edge of the door of destruction, wide and easy, let them enter into it in abundance.
But he made the well narrow and the road hard. “Go out and strike the land, for the people are rebellious and have not yielded their land.” (Luke 6:43-44)
Answer with your hands, what do the liars of the prophets say? They mock you while wearing fine clothes, and their hearts are full of softness, and they won't be spared.
They've lost their belongings, they know them. Isn't it so that the grape brings the thorn, or the fig brings the caromberry?
As a good tree bears good fruit, so does a bad tree bear bad fruit.
Neither a magnificent tree yields a meager harvest, nor a meager tree yields a splendid harvest.
Not every tree yields a fine harvest that is picked and thrown into the fire.
“So that you may know their wealth.” The saying and the deed (Luke 13:25-27)
Someone tells me: "Oh God, oh God," so that he may enter the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does the will of the father in heaven is the one who will enter.
On the Day of Reckoning, a great many people will say to them, “O Lord, O Lord, why did you not foretell us your name? And did we go astray in your name? And did we perform great wonders in your name?”
And Ana, I tell them: “I never knew you. Stay away from me because of what you do in evil!” Like these two houses (Luke 6:47-49).
Anyone who hears my words and acts upon them will be like a wise man who built his house on a foundation of stone.
The rain fell and floods came, and the wind blew strongly against the house. This house is sturdy, its foundation built on stone.
May Allah hear my words, and may he not act upon them as a foolish man builds on sand – he lays it down and it crumbles.
The rain fell, floods came, and the wind blew on the house. It completely collapsed, and nothing remained of it.
And Jesus said this word, people were amazed at the teaching.
Honestly, if he had told them how someone has authority, not like their books.
The leper is healed (Mark 1:40-45; Luke 5:12-16)
Jesus descended into the valley, and a great number of people followed him.
And a crazy guy came close, and he knelt down and said, "My lord, if you want, you can heal me."
And his hand and his tongue said, “Anna, we love, be healed!” And at that time, Malphas was healed.
# 14:2 And Jesus said to them, “Do not tell anyone that you have seen me, rather, let him go, and tell him, ‘The priest is waiting for you, and you must present the offering that Moses commanded for this sin, as a testimony to him.’” The servant of the chief priest was rejoicing (Luke 7:1-10; John 4:43-54)
And Jesus entered Capernaum, and found a vessel of soldiers' water and it was covered and he said:
My Lord, my slave is lying paralyzed in the house and is suffering greatly and cannot move.
And Jesus said to them, “Come, the man is not yet dead.”
But the custodian of the house replied: “My lord, I do not deserve that you come and enter under the roof of my house. But say a word, and my slave may be healed.”
I am a man. I have those who govern me, and I control them with an army. When I say "Go!" to one, he goes. To another, "Come!" he comes. To my slaves, "Do this!" and they do it.
Listen, they heard Jesus say to those who followed him: “Truly I tell you, not even in all of Israel have I found a greater faith than this one.”
You’re bringing a lot of people from the east and the west to sit at the table with Ibrahim, Ishaq, and Yaqub in the kingdom of the heavens.
But the children of the kingdom are about to throw themselves into the darkness, and the one who will be should be crying and full of years.
And Jesus said to the steward of the vineyard, “Go, and make him the hundredth part and give it to him who is wanting.” And the servant was healed just at that time. Nysibis, Peter, rejoiced (Mark 1:29-34; Luke 4:38-41).
When Wotili entered Jesus’ house to Peter’s, he saw that Peter had left Peter sleeping by the stove.
She took it from her hand, by God, the heat was etched on her face. And she got up and started serving him.
That evening, he brought a large number of people who lived nearby, and the spirits came with one word, and he healed all the sick.
# Psalm 53:4 And this thing happened as the thing the prophet Isaiah said: “He shall feed us with His words and revive our inner strength.” Jesus and the world (Luke 9:57-62)
And when Jesus saw a great crowd coming to him, he told his disciples to go to the other shore.
And there was a wealthy owner of Jewish merchandise who said: “O Master, let us follow you wherever you go.”
And they said to Jesus: “Foxes have their dens, and birds have their nests, but I, the Son of Man, do not have a place to rest my head.”
Another student said: "Oh my Lord, let's go first and bury Dad."
But Jesus said, “Follow me, and let the dead bury the dead. Do you want to be made well? Then do not sin.” (Mark 4:35-41; Luke 8:22-25)
It turned out that Jesus was in the boat, and his disciples were confused about him.
And a strong wind blew into the lake until the waves covered the boat. As for Jesus, he was sleeping.
And they taught their students and evaluated them, and they said: “Oh Lord, you prevented us, we are about to be destroyed!”
And Jesus said to them, “Why are you so frightened, you have little faith?” Then he got up and ordered the storm and the sea to quiet down, and they obeyed him instantly.
And the people were amazed, and said, “What is this man, that even the wind and the sea obey him!” The casting out of demons and the drowning of the demons (Mark 5:1-20; Luke 8:26-39)
And where is Jesus for the other side of the region of the plague? They displayed him to two men who lived nearby and were very close, exiting the latrine, and they had washed a lot, until no one dared to cross this road like that.
And they were shouting: “Ash bina wibina, ya ibn Allah? Ya khi jit lehna bash te’dibna qabl el waqt?”
And they had a large herd of sheep grazing in a distant place for them.
And they sent him to the outskirts and said, "If we depart, send us to the governor!"
They said, "Go away!" Then they ran out and went into the ravine, and they lowered the entire ravine from the edge of the mountain to the sea and drowned in the water.
They escaped from prison and entered the city, and they said everything, and there was a large number of their long-time residents running.
Man, the people in the city all came out to meet Jesus. And they begged him to leave their area.
Jesus heals a paralyzed man (Mark 2:1-12; Luke 5:17-26)
And Jesus got into the boat and went across the lake to his town.
And they brought him a paralytic lying on a bed, and Jesus, the Savior of their faith, said to the paralytic: “Be brave, my son, your sins are forgiven.”
And there was a group of Jewish writers who said in their hearts, "This man is an infidel!"
But Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he said, "Why are you reading evil in your hearts?"
Is Anna the easiest? It’s said: “Your sins are forgiven,” not “Get out and go?”
But know this, you sons of men, I give you authority over the earth, to forgive sins.’ And then he said to the paralytic, ‘Get up! Roll away your bed and go to your house.’
Man, you got up and go to the house.
When people saw what happened, they were afraid and praised God who gave authority to the king. How could this be for mankind? Jesus was instructing Matthew (Mark 2:13-17; Luke 5:27-32).
And Jesus passed by, and saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s office. And he said, “Follow me.” So the man got up and followed him.
Jesus was sitting in Matthew's house, resting and eating, when a lot of people came, the sinners and tax collectors, and they sat with Jesus and his disciples.
And when Uthaylī saw the Pharisees doing this, he said to his disciples: “Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”

John's disciples came to Jesus and said, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast so much, while your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them, “The invited guests are weeping, and the groom hasn’t even presented them? So they’ll come days later, and the groom will be far away, and this time is for fasting.”

And Jesus passed by, and there were two blind men following Him, and they cried out, “Son of David, have mercy on us!”
When I entered the house, I found two blind men. Jesus said, “What do you wish I could do for you?” They said, “Yes, Lord!”
And Jesus withdrew from them, and said to them, “Do it as your father does.”
Their eyes shone. And Jesus warned them: “Hold fast, none of you knows!”
But they went out and spread the news throughout that entire area. Jesus healed a man from Capernaum.

Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew, James and Jacob, and Eldas.

The student is not greatest if the teacher is not wealthy, and the servant is not greatest if the master is not honorable.
The student should be like the teacher’s possessions and the servant like the master. If the master of the house is called Baal Zebul, then what should his family be called?” Fear God (Luke 12:2-7)

John the Baptist’s disciples (Luke 7:18-35)
And when Jesus had finished instructing the two disciples, he departed to that place so that he might teach and preach in the cities of that region.
John heard while he was in prison for the sufferings of the Messiah, they had sent him with his disciples
They asked: “Are you the one who’s coming, or are we waiting for another one?”
She answered, “Go and tell John that you have seen him.”
The blind see, the lame walk, the sick are healed, the mute speak, and the dead rise, and the poor are comforted with the Gospel.
And health, why does anyone who doesn't doubt?!
They asked Jesus while he was talking to the people about John, and he said, “What made you go out to see him in the latrine? Is he someone who blows in the wind?”
What did the sun reveal so you could see it? Was it a man wearing expensive clothes? It’s the ones who wear expensive clothes in the palaces!
What did you lean the sun out to see it? To see it for all of you, do you want? Yes, and we tell you: greater than a prophet.
# Psalm 3:1; Verse 1:2 This is what you write in the Bible: "We send before you our messenger, who will prepare the way for you."
You didn't bring forth justice until one of the women brought them forth, not even greater than John the Baptist. But he is the least in the kingdom of heaven, greater than him.
From the days of John the Baptist to this day, and from the kingdom of heaven’s foundation advancing with power, the strong people shall prevail in it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John was born.
And if you believe, then he is Elijah who is coming.
He has two ears, let him hear!
What kind of generation is this? How are these kids just hanging out in the market and yelling at each other?
You didn't stray from your path, and we didn't cry.
John does not eat or drink. They said, "He is a demon."
I came, I am the son of humankind, we eat the food and drink the drink. You said, “Ah, he is a man drunk and staggering, and he associates with those who are caught in sins and transgressions.” But her wisdom testifies to her children. The cities that do not keep (Luke 10:13-15).
And Jesus began to accuse the cities in which he had performed great miracles and worked mighty deeds, that they did not repent.
He said, “Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Beit Saida! If the great miracles that are done in the midst of you were done in Tyre and Sidon, then they would have repented and put on sackcloth and ashes, and they would have lamented in the dust.”
But I tell you: the condition of the city of Sour and Saida should be better than your condition on the day of reckoning.
And you, Kafr Nahum! Why are you trying to reach the sky? You’re about to fall into the abyss. Just like the great miracles that were done to you, they were done to the city of Sodom, and it’s still like that today.
But I tell you: the condition of the land of Sodom will be better than your condition on the day of judgment. Jesus rejoices (Luke 10:21-22)
Jesus spoke at this time and said, “Thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for hiding these things from the wise and the intelligent and revealing them to little children.”
Yes, Dad, it was your will.
Dad gave me everything. And even one doesn't know the son was the father, and even one doesn't know the father was the son, and everyone chooses the son to show him off.
I'm seeing that you're tired and you're carrying a heavy burden, and I want to help you relax.
I've weighed my words and learned from me. I am kind and my heart is humble, and you will soon find peace in your souls.
The way I'm leaving my possessions won't be resin, and my burden is light.
Saturday (Mark 2:23-28; Luke 6:1-5)
At this time, Jesus was passing through the middle of the wheat field on the Sabbath day, and his disciples were harvesting wheat. They began to bind it in bundles and eat.
But they told me they saw the Pharisees doing this, and they said, “See! They are your students doing something that is not permitted so that they can work on the Sabbath day.”
# I Psalm 21:1-6; 24:9 Jesus said to them, "What did David do when they persecuted him and were with him and killed him? He was hungry?"
How did he enter his master’s house, and ate the bread of the sacrifice? The bread he ate was not consecrated to him, nor to those with him; but was consecrated to be eaten by the priests, Akaho?
# 28:09-10 Seriously, I didn't read it in the Sharia. How do the soothsayers in the Temple break the Sabbath commandment on Saturday, and why can't anyone blame them?
But he said: There is one here greater than the structure.
# It is 6:6; Matt 9:13 And if you know what this verse means: "We love not for sacrifice." You have not judged yourselves that you do not agree.
I am the son of man, and I am the Lord of the Sabbath. The man whose hands are crippled mocks (Mark 3:1-6; Luke 6:6-11).
And Jesus walked to that place and entered into their meeting hall.
The man was once a paralyzed man. People asked him: "So, how is it that one heals on Saturday?" in order to find something to accuse him of.
Jesus said to them, “If any of you have a neighbor’s fig tree and its yield drops figs in the Sabbath day, will you not first take away the branches and throw them into the pool?”
Man is how much more valuable than anything! So why is it permissible to do good on Saturday?
Jesus said to the man, “Stretch out your hand!” And the man stretched it out, and it returned whole, just like the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and discussed among themselves how they could kill Jesus. Jesus is the servant who chose God.
And Jesus knew this thing and went to that place. And many people followed him and all of them understood.
And they were ordered not to tell anyone about it.
And this thing happened as the Prophet Isaiah said:
# Psalm 42:1-4 My strength, my help, whose name is the Lord, my God, in whom I put my trust! He teaches me righteousness and truth. It is he who restores me to life, who leads me on the path of everlasting righteousness.
It doesn't make a sound, nor does it bark, and even someone on the street can't hear its voice.
The fortress of Marredah cannot be broken, and the smoking wicks cannot be extinguished. Even Lin allows the truth to prevail.
And the people who desire their names to be called Jesus. Jesus and Beelzebub (Mark 3:20-30; Luke 11:14-23; 12:10)
And at this time, they brought him a blind man, and Bouchak settled into a devil. And Jesus’ lips, and he turned to speak and see.
And all the people were astonished and said, “Is this leadership of David’s son?”
But the Pharisees and their killing heard this saying, and said, “Beelzebub comes out with demons to kill people.”
And Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he said to them, “As a kingdom that is divided against itself, it falls; and a city that is divided against itself will not stand.”
If the devil drives out the devil, it must be divided by his soul, otherwise how do you master it to hold it?
And if Anna goes out with Beelzebul, what do you give your students? This is why they are the ones who will judge you.
But if I go out with the spirit of God, then the kingdom of God reigns over you.
And how does someone enter the house of a powerful man and remove his belongings, unless he has the powerful man's shoulder in the first place, and then he can remove the things in his house?
He's not with me, he's against me, and whoever doesn't stick with me, he leaves.
This is why I brought you, to atone for people’s sins and their blasphemy, which they eat, so that He may forgive them. But the blasphemy of the Spirit is not forgiven.
And anyone who says to another, ‘You owe me!’ is lacking love. But whoever says, ‘Your fault is forgiven,’ finds forgiveness. (Luke 6:43-45)
“Either let the tree be healthy and its yield be good, or let the tree be weak and its yield be weak. The tree recognizes its yield.”
My sons of the blacksmiths, how can you say beautiful words when you are evil? Words are born from what is in the heart.
The radiant man brings forth fine things from his splendid possessions, like those of the magnificent Mallonz, which reside in his heart. And the disheartened man brings forth the painful things from his desolate heart.
Your words: Every empty word people say will be accounted for on the Day of Judgment.
“With your words you appear innocent, but with your words you are accusing yourself.” The Pharisees demand a miracle (Mark 8:11-12; Luke 11:29-32).
This time, a group of scribes and Pharisees said to Jesus: “Teacher, we want a miracle from you.”
But their answer was: “A generation of wicked and sinful people who will claim a miracle, even if a miracle, what would make them stop? It is the miracle of the prophet Jonah.”
# Jonah 1:17 And how Jonah was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, behold, I will also live three days and three nights.
# Jonah 3:5 Amali Ninوى Bash يقوموا مع الجيل هاذا في يوم الحساب ويحكموا عليه، على خاطرهم تابوا وقتلي نبههم يونس، وهاو ثمة شكون هنا أعظم من يونس.
# I 10:1-10; II Chronicles 9:1-12 and the Queen of the South comes to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and she comes from the ends of the earth to witness and judge him, as it pleased her to come in the days to come to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and here is one greater than Solomon! Return of the Transgressor (Luke 11:24-26)
When a soul departs from a person, it wanders in the places where there is no water, seeking rest, but finds no place to settle.
This time says: "We will return to my house from which I left." And if he returns to find it empty and clean and organized.
July went walking and brought with him seven other souls; he was disappointed by them and entered into this man and they dwelt within him, and his condition became as it was before. And so he increased that he might run in this evil generation.” Or, “And Jesus and his brothers (Mark 3:31-35; Luke 8:19-21).
And when Jesus was still speaking to the people, came Ammu and her brothers and they stood outside and they wanted to talk with him.
There was a saying: “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to talk to you.”
But it was the answer of the man who said: "She is my mother, and they are my brothers?"
And he stretched out his hand upon his pupils’ faces and said, “Ah, my father and my brethren!”
Anyone who has the will of my father, who is in the sky, is my brother and sister and mother.
Like a hired man (Mark 4:1-9; Luke 8:4-8)
And Jesus went out and walked in the daytime with his hand, and sat by the side of the lake.
They piled on top of me a huge number of people, until they got into a boat, and everyone stood on the shore.
And they had a lot of proverbs with them: "The farmer went out to plant."
Waqtli is planting, some seeds fell in the furrow, and the birds and their nests came.
And there’s another seed that fell into ground full of stone, there wasn’t much soil, you know, it sprouted little by little with the time, depending on how much soil it had.
But then I found out the sun was burning and drying up her heart; she has no veins.
Another thorn fell in the midst of the thorns, and the thorns choked it.
And there was another seed that fell into fertile soil and brought forth sprouts, there was one that brought forth brackish water to those who plant, and there was one that brought forth sixty, and there was one that brought forth thirty.
He has two sons, and he wants one to go to the vineyard. Why does Jesus speak in parables (Mark 4:10-12; Luke 8:9-10)?
These students went to Jesus and asked him, “Why do you speak in parables to them?”
And they replied, “You seek to know the secrets of the kingdom of the heavens, but they do not reveal them to you.”
He who has, wants to stop more and has a lot. As for those who don't have, even what they have is enough to break it down.
That’s why I talk about them with examples so they don’t understand and don’t see and don’t hear.
Prophecy was fulfilled in them, as it is written in the prophecy of Isaiah, which says: “You will not understand, and you will lie.”
This people has dried up his heart, and he has become drunk and deaf, and closed his eyes so that he does not see with his eyes, nor hear with his ears, nor understand with his heart, and returns to me so that I can dry him.
But you are right to value her peace of mind above your own, and to listen to me because of her.
You carried the word of truth: many prophets and righteous people desired to see what you see and did not see it, and to hear what you hear and did not hear it. Interpretation of the parable of the farmer (Mark 4:13-20; Luke 8:11-15)
Imala, listen! What does the saying "the farmer" mean?
If anyone hears the word of the Kingdom of God and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches it up from their heart, that which they have sown in their heart.
Whoever plants a seed in the ground that contains stone, is the one who hears the word and accepts it with joy at the right time.
But we don't have veins inside us, it will last a little while and eventually a difficult time or persecution for the sake of a word will come, and it will fall in time.
Whoever plants a word in the midst of thorns is the one who hears the word. Whereas the worries of the world and the love of wealth suffocate the word and there is no seed in it.
And whoever plants in the fertile soil, is the one who hears the word and understands it, and answers with a lot of seedlings. And whoever answers with water once, to the one who plants, and another sixty, and another thirty. Like a melon.
And Jesus said to them like this: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who planted good seed in his field.”
People told me they were sleeping, but the enemy stole their goods and planted melons in the middle of the wheat field and then left.
And when Watley Zrigia sprouted and the wheat was sown, the wild onions came with it.
The servants came to the owner of the land and said, "O our Lord, why did you plant fine seedlings in your land? From where did this come from?"
They said, "One of my enemies has done this deed." The servants replied, "If you want us to walk and gather the debris?"
But he said, "No, Bash, don't you remove the wheat and you all gather in the courtyard."
“Let the wheat and the vetch grow together until the time of harvest, and at that time you shall say to the reapers, ‘First gather the vetch, and burn it, and then harvest the wheat and gather it into barns.’” Like mustard seed and yeast (Mark 4:30-32; Luke 13:18-19)
And he gave them as He had given to the other, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field.”
It’s the smallest of all date palms, and when I was little it grew bigger and bigger, and it wasn’t even a tree, to the point that birds of the sky would come and nest in it.
And another saying: “The Kingdom of the Heavens is like yeast that was kneaded with water and salt and put into three measures of fine flour, until it became like the dough of loaves.”
This thing, the Lord said to the people through parables. And He didn't tell them anything except through examples.
# 78:2 This was precisely what the Prophet said: "Let my tongue speak in parables, and reveal the mysterious secrets when the world was created." Interpretation of the metaphor of the strange thing.
This time, Jesus left the people and went into the house, and his disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the rich man.”
She answered: "He who plants the radiant seeds is Anna, son of humankind."
The seed is the world, and the bright seed is the offspring of God’s kingdom, and the foul seed is the offspring of the wicked.
The enemy who sows is Satan, and the harvest is the end of times, and they are both angels.
Specifically, how the scum burns and is consumed by fire, like that, so that it falls at the end of time.
Anna, son of humankind, let the angels of my being be sent, and let them gather the wicked and make them do evil, unless the kingdom of mine is established.
Verwöhnen in der Mitte des Feuers, der Gadi, um zu weinen und von den vielen Jahren gezeichnet.
And this time, the righteous ones, so that they shine like the sun in the land of Buhoum. Whoever has a listening ear, let him listen! Like a treasure and a diamond and a net.
The Kingdom of the Heavens is like a buried treasure in a desert, which a man found, hid it, and then, overjoyed, sold everything he had and bought that desert.
They raised the kingdom of the heavens, like a merchant raiding a precious essence.
I found a valuable gold piece, so I walked and sold everything I had and bought it.
They established the Kingdom of the Heavens, resembling a net they cast into the sea, and retrieved it filled with a multitude of types of goods and whales.
They told him to go fishing by the beach, and they set off with the magnificent whale in crates and threw the rest away.
And so it will be in the end of times: the angels will come and sort the wicked from among the righteous.
Verwöhnen in der Mitte des Feuers, und Gadi, der weint und die Jahre sind zahlreich. Neu und Alt.
And Jesus said to his disciples, “Do you understand this thing that I am saying to you?” They replied, “Yes, we do.”
He said to them, “This is why every writer is a student in the Kingdom of Heaven, like the master of the house who takes the treasures from the king’s store and transforms them into new and old things.”
Wotley kamel yusuf al-mithl haza, masha ba'id 'ala al-balasa hazaika.
And where is the country that began to teach them its goods, by God, they were amazed and said: “This man, where did this wisdom and these miracles come from?”
Man, isn't this the carpenter's son? And isn't her name Mary? And aren't her brothers Jacob, Joseph, Simon, and Judah?
“Do all of my female cousins have this with them? Where did this man get this stuff?”
And so they complained about him. Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not rejected in his own land, nor does he welcome his own."
Nothing amazing happened, but people didn't believe in it anyway.
The death of John the Baptist (Mark 6:14-29; Luke 1:5-9)
This time, the King Herod heard news of Jesus.
He said to the servants, “This is John the Baptist, who was raised from the dead. And that other one is performing miracles.”
Before Herod had John arrested and thrown into prison because of Philip’s brother, Herodias, Philip, the brother of Herod,
John said, "It's a shame you're taking them."
And love kills, but he feared for their sake, as they considered John a prophet.
But I told him it was Herod's birthday, a Herodian girl slipped into the party, and Herod liked her.
That's why he promised her and swore to give her whatever she asked for.
And his mother said to Herod: “Give me John the Baptist’s head in a dish!”
The king was saddened, as he had commanded the servant to give her the thing he loved, and he regretted the oath he had taken and the guests.
And someone sent, to imprison John’s head.
They shoved themselves into a plate and gave it to the structure, seriously making her mother furious.
They went and gathered disciples of John, and cast out demons and healed many; and they went and told Jesus. Jesus came and saw a crowd of people, and he was moved with compassion, and he healed their sick. (Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-14)
Jesus heard about this, so he left that place in a boat and sailed to the place where they were gathered. But when the people heard about it, they followed him on foot into the city.
A felucca landed among a crowd of people, and by God, we healed them and their illnesses.
As dusk fell, Java told his students: “The day is over, and this place is empty. Send people to the villages to buy something to eat.”
Jesus said, “They don’t need to go. Take something for them to eat.”
They said, "We had five loaves of bread and two little fishes."
Jesus said, “Bring it here to me.”
And they ordered people to sit on hashish and take the five loaves of bread and the fish, and he gazed at the heavens and blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
Everyone ate and got full. And they carried three large sacks filled with crumbs.
The people who followed him to Capernaum were about five thousand men, not counting the women and children. Jesus walking on water (Mark 6:45-52; John 6:15-21)
And then, precisely, his students’ order to get in the boat and precede him to the opposite side of the lake until he sends people to go.
After the people had risen, he went alone to the mountain to pray. And after the sun had set, it was time for him to go alone.
At that time, the small boat was far out at sea, overwhelmed by the waves, and the wind was reflecting it.
And before dawn, Jesus came walking on the water.
But the students were afraid and saw him walking on the water, and they said, “This is a mirage!” And they began to cry out, overcoming their fear.
But Jesus spoke to them at the time and said to them, “Be courageous. I am he, do not fear!”
And Peter replied, “Lord, if you are he, command me to come forward and walk on the water.”
Jesus said, “Be here.” Philip went with Peter in the boat across the sea and Jesus came to him on the shore.
But the spotlight was strong, hidden, and suddenly began to sink, and it cried out: “Oh God, save me!”
As Jesus was calming down, he said to them, “Because your faith is weak, why did you doubt?”
And they set off in the calmer boat.
And they were saying to the boatman, “Behold, you are Son of God!” Jesus was healing the sick among them, many were being healed (Mark 6:53-56).
And Jesus and his disciples went to the region of Gennesaret.
And when people in the land knew that Jesus had come, they spread the news throughout that region, and people who were sick came to him.
And they asked him to make them touch even the edge of his belly. And everyone who did it, they healed.
The customs of the elders (Mark 7:1-13)
The Pharisees and the scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying:
Why don't your students respect the elders' customs? And why don't they wash their hands before eating, after you tell them to?
She replied, “And why don’t you obey God’s command and are you building right traditions in your customs?”
# God spoke, saying, “Honor your father and mother, that your name be not cursed among the people.”
But you guys say if someone says he has acquired something or is married: "I helped you with that, and I gave it to him, he doesn't need to honor me."
And thus you have invalidated the word of God with your customs.
You hypocrites, be silent and listen! Thus says the prophet Isaiah: “Upon you he has decreed:
