The first chapter of the genealogy of Jesus Christ
These are the poisons of the blood of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham:
Ibrahim ولد إسحاق, Isaac ولد يعقوب, Yaqub ولد يهودا and his brothers,
And Judah was born to Serah, and Zerah was born to Tamar, and Serah was born to Esrah,
And Aram had two brothers, named Danab, and Danab had two brothers, named Hashshun, and Hashshun had two brothers, named Salmon.
Salmon was born of Rahab, and Rahab of Tubal-Caish, and Tubal-Caish of Jush.
Wasa Walda David the King. And David was born to Solomon from the woman whom Uriah was married to.
And Solomon, and Solomon was the son of Reubem, and Reubem was the son of Joab, and Joab was the son of Asaph,
And Asaph was born to Yehuphat, and Yehuphat was born to Uram, and Uram was born to Aziah.
And Aziah, and Yotham, and Yotham, the son of Aziah, and Aziah, the son of Haggai.
And Azqiyya was born of Mansa, and Mansa was born of Aamaos, and Aamaos was born of Yoshiya.
Joshua was born in Yemen and his family was living when they were Jewish exiles in the land of Babylon.
And after they returned to the Jews from Babylon, came Ben-Shealtiel, and Ben-Shealtiel was born to Zerubbabel.
Zarbael was born to Abihoud, and Abihoud was born to Elyakim, and Elyakim was born to Azor.
And Azaz son of Sadduq, and Sadduq son of Akheem, and Akheem son of Elyud.
And Jael, daughter of Azaz, and Azaz, son of Matan, and Matan, son of Jacob.
And Jacob was the son of Joseph, a man of Mary, who bore Jesus, who is called the Christ.
All of them are from Ibrahim, even David ben Yishar, and from David until the time that the Jews were exiled to Babylon, David ben Yishar. And from the time that the Jews were exiled to Babylon until the birth of the Messiah, David ben Yishar. The birth of Jesus Christ.
And it came to pass that the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: while Mary was betrothed to Joseph, and before he had married her, she was found with child by the Holy Spirit. Luke
And Joseph was her husband, a man fearing God and unwilling to expose her, and he decided to separate from her in secret.
When he wondered about this, he saw in a dream one of the angels of God and it was told to him: “O Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to marry Mary, for the one she carries is from the power of the Holy Spirit.”
And he said, “Call his name Jesus: for he will save his people from their sins.” Luke
All of this happened so that the words of the Lord would be fulfilled through the lips of the prophet who said:
“Here’s the village will bear, and give birth to a son, and his name will be Emmanuel,” which means: God is with us.
Yusuf awoke from his sleep, as the Lord’s angel had commanded, and married Mary.
But she had not even given birth to a son, and they called him Jesus. Luke 2:21
Chapter two of the scholars of the stars are coming to see Jesus.
And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men, while he was in Nazareth, in the land of the Jews. On the word of King Herod, they went to Bethlehem to search for him.
Keselo: “Where is the king of the Jews who was born in the east? We saw that star and came to prostrate ourselves before him.”
King Herod heard that, and he was afraid, and all the people in Jerusalem were afraid.
The heads of religious scholars and scientists of the law, and their messengers asked: “Where is Jesus?”
And they replied, “A manger was made in the land of Judea, as he had written the prophet Micah about it.”
And in Bethlehem of Judea, you are walking on a small road in the land of Judea, from where you will come out as the president of your people in Israel.
And after Herod’s summer on the stars, the secret of the heavens, and verify them on the time when the star appeared.
And after their summer to Bethlehem and Ghal, they said: “He has a good heart for the boy. And when they found him, come tell me so that I can go and bow down to him.”
They heard the king's words, and they went. And she appeared to them like the star they had seen in the east, and continued to go ahead of them until she reached the place where the boy was and stopped.
Wakhir shafu n-najma, farhu بزاف.
As they entered the house, they saw the boy and Mary, and while they knelt and prostrated themselves before him, they opened their chests and presented him with gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
And he led them away in dreams so that they would not return to Herod, they took a different route and returned to their country. The family of Jesus fled to Egypt.
And after the scholars consulted, it became clear to the angel of the Lord to Joseph that the dream and the vision were about him: “Arise and take the child and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod will seek to destroy the child.
Yusuf had matured and Khadija and the child went and stayed at night and traveled to Egypt.
And so it was fulfilled what Herod the king said to verify the word of the Lord, which was spoken by the prophet, saying: “Out of Egypt I called my son.” Herod kills the young children.
Melli saw Herodius play with the scholars of the stars, he was very worried and ordered that all the unborn and their surroundings be killed from the age of two down, because that is how long had passed since he knew the time from the scholars of the stars.
And thus was the word of the Lord fulfilled through the mouth of the prophet Jeremiah, Liam:
From Ramat, you can hear wailing, a lot of crying, Rachel wept for her children and didn't want anyone to comfort her, her children have died. Jesus’ family is returning from Egypt.
And there was a man in Egypt who dreamed a dream, like the dreams of Joseph, concerning Pharaoh, and concerning all Egypt.
And he said: “Get the boy and his brother and return to the land of Israel, because those who wanted to kill the boy died.”
Yusuf and Khadija and the child and Meh and returned to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus had come to rule Judea in Herod’s place, he feared to return to Jerusalem. And God warned him in a dream, so he went to Galilee.
And he came to a city and named it Nazareth, and he stayed there, in order to fulfill what was spoken by the prophets of saying: “The virgin will bear a son, and they will call his name Emmanuel.” Mark 1:24; Luke 2:39; John 1:45
Chapter three John the Baptist that there may be a way to Jesus
And he sent Liam, to John the Baptist, in the desert of the land of the Jews, to proclaim the people.
“Topo, the time of the Kingdom of the Heavens is near.” When
This is the man that the prophet Isaiah spoke about: “A great sound in the desert, a shout saying, ‘The way of the Lord is open and he calls to it.’”
John’s clothing was made of fine camel hair, and he wore a belt of leather, and he lived on locusts and wild honey.
And people were coming to him from Jerusalem and from all the regions of Judea, and from the districts along the Jordan.
They deliberately entrusted Fawas al-Arduni to their hands, and they are acknowledging their own wrongdoing.
Melly saw John with a lot of people from the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to him to have him baptize them. Then he told them: “Truly, I say to you, who is he who fears the Lord and turns from evil?”
Yeah, Pino, your repentance through your good deeds.
You don't need to think too much about it: my name is Ibrahim. I tell you: God is able to have children from this stone. John
And the figs are piled on the tree trunks, and every tree doesn't give a good harvest to cut and throw away generously. When?
I will baptize you with water to be made new, but what comes after me is the power of the Spirit, and we do not deserve to remove even his foreskin. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
And she used it to guide her in her studies, and he would collect the chaff and burn it with great intensity, it would never be extinguished. John knelt to wash Jesus’ feet.
And after that, Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan by the side of John to be baptized.
But John didn't let him and said to him: "You need me to ordain you, and you are coming to me to ordain you?"
Jesus responded and said to him, “Since this has been permitted, it is incumbent upon us to fulfill God’s will.” And he allowed John to deliberately sin.
And Jesus, without intending it, came out of the water, and the heavens were rejoicing and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and resting upon him.
And you hear a voice from the heavens saying, “This is my beloved son with whom I am well pleased.” Matthew 12:18; 17:5; Mark 1:11; Luke 9:35
Chapter Four: Satan Tempts Jesus
And after the spirit of God Jesus to the desert, that Satan might try him. Hebrews
Wesam had been wandering for fourteen days and fourteen nights, and now hunger had set in.
Iblis said to him, “If you were a son of God, say that this stone will become bread.”
And Jesus replies to him: “It is written in the book of God: do not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from God.”
And then, Satan came to the holy city of Jerusalem, and he set him upon a high place above the house of God.
“But if you are the son of God, let your head be thrown to the ground, indeed it is written in God’s book that God will order His angels to be upon you, and they will strike you so that your foot does not hit the stone.”
Jesus replied: “It is written in the book of Moses, ‘Do not covet.’”
And after Iblis’s descent to the high mountain, and his establishment of the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
And he said: “All this I give to you only when you bow to me and worship me.”
And he replies to him, Jesus: “Go your own way, you devil! Indeed, it is written in the Book of God: To the Lord your God you shall bow down, and worship Him alone.”
And after that, Satan did it, and angels came to mock him. Jesus preached in Galilee.
Jesus heard that John the Baptist was arrested, and he returned to Galilee. Matthew
And Jesus went with his disciples to Nazareth, and they walked along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, in the land of Zebulun and Naphtali. John
And thus is fulfilled what the Lord said to the Prophet Isaiah:
A land of Zebulun and a land of Naftali, By the way of the sea, beside the shore of the Great Sea, [there is] a people of Israel.
The people of Iraq who were in darkness saw a great light, and a light shone upon those who lived in the land of death and within it, east of them.
And who made Jesus to wait so long to tell the people and to say: “Repent! The time of the kingdom of heaven is near.” Matthew 3:2 Jesus is choosing his disciples, John and Andrew.
Jesus was going along by the Sea of Galilee, and he saw two boats by the shore, left there by the fishermen, Simon Peter and Andrew, his brothers. They had thrown their nets into the sea, and they were working alone.
Jesus said, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
They took the clock from their window and followed it.
And after that, he walked past Tam and saw two other boats, namely Jacob bin Zebdi and his brother Yohanan, with their Zebdi companions in one boat to repair their nets. And he did not call out to them.
And they took the boat and followed Him, and He taught them as they sailed by.
And Jesus walked throughout all Galilee, preaching in the synagogues of Judea and declaring the gospel of God’s kingdom, and healing all who were sick from every disease and every weakness. Matthew
Saying goodbye to the news from all over Syria, and they brought all the patients who were suffering because of the disease: the possessed, those with winds, and the hemorrhages, and they heal them.
And after them came a great number of groups from Galilee, Judea, Jerusalem, the Ten Tribes, and from the other side of the Jordan River.
Chapter 5: Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount
Melly saw Jesus the groups of people go up to the mountain, and those students came to him.
And he began to teach them and explain:
Blessed are the poor of the spirit, for they possess a kingdom of heaven.
Sadaat illi keipkio, hiit Allah gadi yuwasihim.
The contentment of the humble, where the earth will be turned.
These are the ones who are hungry and thirsty for the obedience of God, who will be satisfied by going there.
These are the ones who are merciful, because God will be merciful to them.
These are the ones whose hearts are pure, who will see God.
These are the people who help others live a good life, so they are called the children of God.
These are the ones who, having been disengaged from their sinful desires, receive the reward of the eternal life. 1 Peter 3:14
And may blessings be upon you, but the people are against you and plotting against you, and they have spoken falsehood about you, saying, “Let’s see what misfortune will befall him,” upon them. 1 Peter 4:14
Rejoice and leap for joy because your reward is great in the heavens, for it is through this that you will surpass the prophets who were before you. Acts 7:52 The urgency of the earth and the light of the world
The soil is barren, and if the ground is barren, what will return to it? It is no longer fit for anything, except that it lies outside and is trodden underfoot by men. Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34,35
We are the light of the world, who are unable to enter a city set on a hill. John
There is no one who lights a lamp and puts it under a basket, but rather on a stand, so that it may shine for all who are at home. Mark
And so, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good works and glorify you in the heavens. 1 Peter 2:12 Scripture
I don't calculate for you that I came to abolish the law of Moses and the writings of the prophets, I did not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
We tell you the truth: the heaven and the earth will pass away, but not one word or even one dot of the Law will pass away until everything that is in it is accomplished. Luke
Whoever did not do any of these small recommendations and taught people to do it themselves, will be the youngest in the kingdom of the heavens. And whoever did them and taught them to others, will be the elder in the kingdom of the heavens.
And I tell you: unless your obedience is greater than that of the scholars of the Torah and the Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.”
Have you heard of the "Little People of the Land" saying: "Do not kill, and whoever kills must be held accountable."
But I tell you: whoever worries about his brother should control him, and whoever says to his brother: “You are useless,” should control him in the Great Court. And whoever says to his brother: “You are foolish,” deserves the fire of hell.
Otherwise, I’ll take your gift and put it on the butcher’s block, and you’ll regret it because of your brother.
Give your gift in front of the slaughterhouse and go make up with your brother, then come back so I can give you your gift.
Make peace with the one who’s been bothering you. Don’t let it go to court, before they take you to the judge, and the judge will put you in Moroccan prison, and the Moroccan will send you to jail.
I'm telling you the truth: you won't get out of this until you pay the last debt you owe. Corruption
“And I told you, don’t mess with it.”
But I tell you: whoever has seen himself in a mirror to admire himself, has corrupted his heart with him.
Otherwise, your eye would be right, hitting you in the butt, throwing it at you and breaking it, because God will lose a part of his wealth and not throw his wealth into hell. When
Or your hand would be your right hand, causing you to fall into the pit, cutting it off and throwing it upon you, “Lo, you would lose a part of your inheritance, and you would not throw your inheritance into hell.” Matthew 18:8; Mark 9:43
“And then he says: Anyone who has left his wife, especially should give her her heat. When?”
But I tell you this: the man who divorces his wife for sexual immorality and marries another woman, he commits adultery. And the man who marries a divorced woman is an adulterer. Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11, 12; Luke 16:18; 1 Corinthians 7:10, 11
“And I’m telling you again, daughters of your mothers: If you swear, do not bend, but fulfill your promise to God with your oath.”
As for me, I tell you: you never lie, not even in the sky, because it is God's throne, Jacob.
And neither in the earth beneath His feet, nor in Jerusalem, the city of the great King.
And he doesn't even swear by his head, he can't even return a single hair of it, whether it's black or white.
But if it’s true, what is your saying, ݣolo: Yes. And if it’s not, ݣolo: No. And the words beyond that are from Satan.” Revenge
“You scratch my back, and I’ll scratch yours.”
But I tell you this: don't quench the fire, but if someone spilled honey on your face, show it to him as well.
If anyone wants to take you to court to get your compensation, let them bring their screws.
Otherwise, one thing, a thousand steps you’ll take with him, two thousand.
And if someone asked you for something, give it to them, and if someone wants to borrow from you, don't respond to him, be firm. They want to pass you by.
“And I told you, Tighal: want what's near to you and hate your enemy.”
But I tell you: they want to get rid of you, and pray with those who are against you.
May you be the sons of your fathers who are in the heavens. For he is the one who rises with his sun upon the good and the salt, and the winter descends upon those who do good and those who do evil.
If you only want what you want, what's the reward you're getting for that? And what are you filling the tax with for doing that?
Otherwise, you’ll be relying on your brothers alone. What’s the point of improving yourselves if not from others? And what are they doing by worshipping idols that’s like this?
Yes, all knowledge is complete, as is the one in the sky.
Chapter Six: Charity
Hold your hands up, don't show off in front of people so they can see you, or you won't have a reward from your Lord in the heavens. When…
Otherwise, you just give some charity, constantly showing it off to people like the hypocrites do with their prayers and prostrations to be praised by others. I’m telling you the truth: those people have taken their reward from the people.
But I can only give charity if you give me something, for Laysa, your hand is not for giving, you don't know what you are doing with your right hand.
Keep your charity to yourself, and what is in the heavens is hidden from him who seeks it. He will reward you for it. Prayer.
“And you, may your prayer be blessed, don’t behave like hypocrites, who it’s difficult for them to pray standing in the mosque, and seek ways to be seen by people. I’m telling you the truth: those people have taken the reward from the people. Listen.”
But Net Mali prayed, entered your house and locked the door behind you, and prayed for the one in the secret, and for the one that is hidden from you. He is the one who will repay you.
May your journey not stop, but continue with abundant words and a state like those who destroy idols, who count them as if their excessive speech will make God respond to them.
Oh, they're not alone, that's why whoever is in the sky knows what you need before you ask for it.
Here's the translation: “And this is how we offer this prayer: Oh, the one in the sky, we want your name to be sanctified.”
And your kingdom will come, and your desire will be as in the heavens so on earth.
The bread that suffices our provision for today.
And forgive our sins just as You forgive those who wronged us, like we forgive those who wrong us.
And we did it without failing in the experiment, and we escaped the devil.
If God forgives people’s mistakes, He will forgive you for yours in the heavens.
But unless you forgive people for their mistakes, He will not forgive your mistakes “forever.” Fasting.
But they are silent, don't be like those hypocrites who put on a show to make others think they are fasting. We tell you the truth: those people have taken the reward from the people.
But when you fast, wash your hair and wash your face.
A dolphin is going to the people when you need it, it appears fasting, but the one in the secret, and the one that is not hidden from him secrets, he will reward you. Treasures in the sky.
You don't gather treasures on earth, where you'll barter with gossip and falsehood, and where they dig for it with charcoal and steal it. Jacob
But gather for me treasures in the sky, wherever I don't step on the thorns and the weeds, and wherever they don't harvest them for the beetles and don't steal them.
Where is the dolphin? Where is your treasure, it will be your heart. Nour Al-Dat
The eye is a jellyfish of the date. But if your eye is good, everything about you will be bright.
But if your eye is ugly, with all your being it will be dark. And if the light in you is darkness, how difficult this darkness is! God and money.
No one can be a slave to both power and money, that’s why either they will hate one of them and love the other, or they will be loyal to one and fall for the sake of the other. And thus, you are not able to be slaves of God and money. Don’t be overwhelmed by worries.
And this is what I'm telling you: don't burden yourselves with your living expenses – what will you eat or drink, or with your personal affairs – what will you wear? Is life not more important than food, and is a mother more important than clothing?
Look at the birds of the sky, they don't sow, they don't harvest, they don't gather in storage houses, and they are fed by what is in the sky. Yes, how are we better than them?
Who are these people who if they feed them, they can increase even if it's just an hour in their life?
And why do they give the roses to the gardener? See how well the roses grow in an acre, they don't wither and they don't spin.
But I’m telling you the truth: even Solomon, with all his pride and power, never wore a single rose in his hair.
Yes, I have little faith! Except for the spring in the field, which I see today and tomorrow may be thrown into the furnace, God will wear it like this, how can you not wear it? We will not be good.
And for all that, they don't stop asking: What are we going to eat? Or what are we going to drink? Or what are we going to wear?
Even those who don't know God seek all this, and the One in the heavens knows that we need all of this.
But their hearts are on the kingdom of God and His intention, and all of that will increase for you.
They don’t burden themselves with worries for the coming day, let tomorrow’s worries be for tomorrow. And every day he leaves his worries for his own.
Chapter Seven Do not judge anyone
Don't judge anyone, so they won't judge you.
The judges govern, and they will govern over you. The decree dictates, and it will dictate to you. Mark.
Why do you see the tobacco pouch of your brother, and don't turn your mind back to the pouch of yours?
And how are you going to tell your brother let me take the tobacco out of your eyes, and do you have a stick in your eye?
The hypocrite is like a camel that waits until its hump is full before turning back. By the time you see him well, he’ll have taken the tobacco from your brother’s eye.
“Don’t give the sacred thing to dogs so they can desecrate you and cut you to pieces, and don’t throw your essence into the hands of the wicked so they can ruin it with their feet.” Ask, turn, and knock.
Order and take. Heart and find. Knock on the door and it will be opened for you.
To everyone who requested it, it will be given to them. To whoever sought it, it will be found for them. To whoever knocked on the door, a solution will be offered to them.
Who among you who asked his son for bread will give him a room?
And he asked him to give him a boat?
Yes, but if you are those who aren't doing well, you should give your children the good things, how is it that those who are in the sky don't give your children the good things they ask for?
As Jesus was going along, they said to him, “The Teacher, tell your disciples to abstain from [unseemly] foods and to keep themselves safe.” For this reason, he says, “Beware of the scribes, for they do not observe the Law of Moses.” Luke 6:31
Enter through the narrow door, to the door that leads to destruction is wide and the path is easy, and many enter through it.
How narrow is the door, and how aware of the road is the one who carries life, and says what they find in it. The tree knows from its fruit.
Hold onto yourselves from those lying prophets, who come to you wearing sheep's clothing, but from within they are weavers of hooks.
My way of rolling, they know them. Can you pick grapes from thorns, or rue from the cedar?
Just as every good tree bears a good harvest, and every bad tree bears a bad harvest.
The fig tree doesn't give a good yield, and the good tree doesn't give a decent yield.
Every tree doesn't give a good harvest, it cuts and throws in the wilderness. When
“Thus you will recognize them, by their fruits. Matthew 12:33 We must fulfill God’s will.”
He won’t enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but whoever does enter is the one who does God’s will in the heavens.
Spare me the day, all that they will say to me: O Lord, O Lord! Didn't we prophesy in your name? And didn't we go mad in your name? And didn't we perform many miracles in your name?
Fadik, I'll tell them about the watch: I never knew you! And after me, the culprits! The shoes of two doors.
Anyone who hears my words and acts upon them is like a man who built his house on rock.
From where the winter fell and the waters overflowed, a strong wind came and struck the house, it didn't break, because its foundation was built on rock.
Anyone who hears this from me and doesn't take it seriously is like a man who built his house on sand.
From where did the winter fall and the waters overflowed, and a strong wind came and struck the house’s rooster, shattering it and its owner’s heart was strong.
And Jesus finished speaking, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, Mark
He was teaching them about one thing he had authority over, not like the scholars of their law.
Chapter Eight: Jesus healing a man with a hemorrhage
Jesus descended from the mountain, and a great crowd followed him.
And he brought a man from the Maghreb with him, and he knelt before him and said: “My Lord, if you wish, you can restore me to purity.”
He extended his hand and touched him and said, “I want you to be clean!” At that hour the leprosy was healed and he was made clean.
And to Jesus said: "Keep it secret until you tell someone, but go and show it to the man, and give the gift that Moses commanded, so that it may be a witness for them." The guards of the army headquarters were observing
What business does Jesus have with Kafr el-Homa? He went to him, and there was a police officer from the army welcoming him.
And he said: “My servants in the house are lying on the floor paralyzed and being severely beaten.”
He says to him, “I am going away so that he may heal.”
He replied with the military governor: “I don’t deserve it, Your Excellency, to enter under the roof of my house, but tell him just one word and my servants will be forgiven.”
I am also one of those who rules, and I have an army in which I rule, and I tell him: "Go!" and he goes, and I tell him: "Come!" and he comes, and I tell my slave: "Do this!" and he does it."
Jesus was amazed at what Philip had heard and said to those who followed him: “I tell you the truth, not even in Israel have I found anyone with such firm faith.”
Warani ngoul likom bli bazaf d l'nas gadi yijou min l'sharq w l'ghrib w yglusou yaklou ma'a Ibrahim w Ishaq w Yaqub f mamelake s-sama'at. Luke.
Those who needed to be in the kingdom, they slipped out into the darkness, and where will the tears and the flashing of the sword be? When
And then, Jesus told the commander of the army: “Go! You will have whatever you desire, according to your faith.” At that moment, even his servants were healed. Jesus was healing Peter and many people.
What business does Jesus have with Peter's house? He found Peter lying in bed with a fever.
And Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose up and served him.
And the connections of the evening, many people were brought to him, filled with madness, and the madness came out with a word from him, and all the sick were healed.
And thus is fulfilled the word of the Lord, to the prophet Isaiah: “He who afflicted us and tormented us with sickness.” How should those who follow Jesus be?
Malik saw the Jesus people who knew him, and he told the disciples to go to the other side of the sea.
He was approaching a scholar, and said to him: “Sir, I will follow you wherever you go.”
And he replied, “You are troubled and frustrated only about this. But Jonah was troubled and frustrated, and he was in the belly of a whale; but when the Lord calmed him, he was revived. Likewise, I tell you, everyone who looks at the heavens will be troubled with cares, but you do not have any place to rest your head.”
And he said to me one last thing: “My lord, let me go before we bury Ba.”
But Jesus replied, “Follow me, and you will not die. “Do not let the dead keep burying the dead! “I tell you the truth, you do not want to die either.
Millions of people followed Jesus into the boat.
And a wind blew strongly on the sea, until Peter the fisherman capsized the boat, and Jesus was asleep.
Come closer to him, prostrate and kneeling, and tell him: “We are freed, O my Lord, we are dying!”
He says to them: “What’s wrong with you? Why are you afraid, is this a lack of faith?” And then, he stood up and rose with the wind and the sea, as the world was calming down.
The men were astonished and said to him, “Who is this who even the wind and the sea obey him?” Jesus was casting out demons from two men who were possessed.
Jesus arrived at the other side of the Sea of Galilee. Two men, possessed by demons, came out of the Gadarene tombs, and were trembling in fear. They were so violent that no one could say a word to them in the town.
And the non-believers began to die and to speak: “Why have you come, son of God? Why have you come here to punish us before our time?”
And one of the pieces of the talisman was large, sitting in a position near the peak.
And those madmen, Jesus and ݣalu, said: “If you expel us, we will return and enter the piece of the harem.”
He told them, "Go in!" and they went inside, and the entire piece fell from the edge of the mountain into the sea and sank.
They fled the prisons and went to the city, and told of everything that happened, and things began to happen to the men who were driven mad.
Get out all the city residents so they can go to Jesus. And when they saw him, they wanted him to leave their country.
Chapter Nine: Jesus the Healer of the Paralytic
And Jesus got into a boat and began to sail across the lake and returned to his town.
And there were some people with him, a man paralyzed from the waist down, who was lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, “Your sins are forgiven.”
A scholar of Islamic law remarked in his heart: “This man is uttering words of disbelief!”
And Jesus knew how they thought and always: “Why do you think things are hidden in your hearts?”
It's easy, it says: Forgiven be your sins, or it says: Get up and go?
But we will show you that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins.’ And to the paralytic he said, ‘Get up, take your bed and go home.’
The man had matured and walked around his neighborhood.
Melli saw the groups of people that happened, they feared and gave glory to God who gave people power in this way. Jesus chooses when
While Jesus was going from there, he saw a man named Matthew the Tax Collector at the public treasury. And he said to him, “Follow me.” And he followed him.
And after Jesus had finished eating, he went to the house of Matthew, and many tax collectors and sinners followed him along with his disciples. Luke
Malik saw the Pharisees, and asked the Master: “Why is your teacher eating with tax collectors and sinners?”
Jesus heard them and said to them, “Go and show mercy to the poor; go, preach the gospel and heal the sick.”
Yeah, Sergio learned the meaning of this statement: I want mercy, not sacrifice, because I don't cry out to those who fear God, but to the sinners. The question is about fasting.
And then John the Baptist went to Jesus and said to them: “Why do your disciples not fast, while the Pharisees and their teachers of the law fast?”
And Jesus answered them, “How can the servants of the house mourn for the master of the house being taken away, while the master goes with them into exile?”
Even if one doesn't mend an old garment with the edge of a new top, it's not a good idea because the patch will fray and make the stitching bigger.
And no one makes the new wine in leather bags in front, because if they handle them, they will ferment and it will spoil the wine and the bags. But we make the new wine in new leather bags, so that it will not spoil the wine or the bags.” The President’s daughter and the woman who touched Jesus’s things.
He had said this, and the president came and knelt before him and said: “My daughter, God has taken her, but come, put your hand on her and she will live.”
And Jesus, who followed him and was loved by him,
And there was a woman, one woman sick, forty years old and bleeding, she came behind Jesus and touched his garment, his cloak.
Otter thought for a while: "Unless it gets its necessities, we'll make do."
He turned and saw Jesus and said, “You believe, daughter, you are healed. At the hour of your faith, the woman was healed.”
Jesus arrived at the president's house and saw that people were complaining about the currency and the whole crowd was suffering from a headache.
“Get out of here! The girl isn't dead, she’s just sleeping!” and they were laughing at him.
Jesus took them out, and as he was entering, he drew a girl up from the ground, standing her.
Goodbye Al Khabar, you are the whole country's blessing. Jesus heals the two blind men.
And Jesus was amazed, and he followed two blind men, who cried, “Have mercy on us, you sons of David!”
What business does the house have? The blind came to him. And he told them, “Do you believe that I am able to heal you?” And they said, “Yes, Lord!”
And they said to Jesus, “Your eyes are like the sun and your face like the moon! At dawn you are like the light of the morning.”
And they have sweet eyes, and Jesus forbade them: “Don’t tell anyone about it!”
But they left and started spreading rumors throughout that entire neighborhood. Zizoun was recovering.
And those who didn't come to where the blind were being expelled, until they brought a man, Zizoun, possessed by madness.
Jesus had cast out the demons, and the disciples were amazed at him, and said to one another, “Never have we heard such things done!”
The Pharisees said, “This man casts out demons by the power of the Prince of Demons!” Matthew 10:25; 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15 The trial of Jesus
And Jesus was walking along when he saw the scribes and Pharisees teaching, and he was listening to them. And he would ask them questions, and answer them. And he healed all who were sick among them. Matthew
Mali saw the gatherings of people, and upon them, as if they were huddled and scattered like sheep without a shepherd. Mark.
He tells his student: “The harvest is abundant, but the harvest is meager. Luke.”
They asked the owner of the harvest to prepare the harvest for his harvest.
Chapter Ten: Jesus, the Shepherd of His Flock
And then Jesus shouted at his disciples, the unholy ones, and gave them the power to cast out demons and heal people from every disease and every illness.
These are the names of the disciples of Jesus the Nazarene: James, Philip, in them is Simon the son of Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother.
Phillips, and Ptolemy, and Thomas, and Matthew Mol, and Jacob ben Halvi, and Tadeus,
Simon the Zealot and Judas the Galilean who will betray Jesus.
Jesus told them, “Do not go to the Gentiles (non-Jews) or to the Samaritans.
But go to the speckled sheep from the tribe of Israel.
And tell people about the proximity of the time of the Kingdom of the Heavens.
The sick were healed, the dead were revived, the disgraced were purified, and madness was driven out. Take without giving anything in return, give without taking anything in return.
What are you carrying in your pockets—gold, silver, or copper?
No bundles, no pairs of sandals, no staffs, no crutches, the servants deserve their food. 1 Corinthians 9:14; 1 Timothy 5:18
And the city, and the neighborhoods you entered, just ask someone who deserves to invite you, and they even let you go your own way.
Otherwise, you go into someone's house, greet their wife.
Otherwise, they deserved the peace you offer, and that peace should reach them. Otherwise, it wasn't for them, and the peace returns to you.
Unless they accepted you at all, they didn't build anything, or a city, or they hadn't heard of your words, they left Tim and Susso, the dusty area that I showed you. Works
I tell you the truth: The day of judgment will be like Sodom and Gomorrah – they will not be spared from the judgment of God. Luke 10:4-12 The battle to come

Hold onto yourselves, from the people who will take you to court, and the beaters of your prayers, Marcus.
And I will stand before the judges and kings before you, so that you may witness me before them and before the peoples who are not Jews.
Your hands won't help you, neither how nor what you'll say, because at that moment they will tell you what you will say.
It's not important what you're planning to do, but the spirit of your elders in the sky is what will give you the words you'll hear.
The son will hand over his brother so that he will be killed, and the father will hand over his son so that he will be killed, and the sons will rise up against their fathers and will kill them, Mark.
They hate you more than all people because of the name of my family. But you remain steadfast even until the end of the abyss. When
But when they exceed you in a city, they flee to another. I’m telling you the truth: don’t go looking for all the Israelis’ blogs until a human child comes.
The student’s path is better than the teacher’s, nor the servants’ better than their master. Luke.
There was a dispute between the students, just like the teacher's. And the servants were like their master. And they called the owner of the house "Abuzbul," yes, what do they call his other possessions? Matthew 9:34; 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15
Don't be afraid of them, because everything that is hidden will be revealed, and everything that is concealed will appear. Mark 1
And that, which I told you in the night, they are saying in the day. And everything you heard in secret, they are proclaiming it from the rooftops.
Don't be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul, but be afraid of the one who can destroy both body and soul in Hell.
Two pairs of birds cost one dirham! Wait, not even one of them will fall to the ground unless your highness in the sky wants it.

Whoever confesses me in front of people, we will confess him even I in front of those in the heavens.
But whoever makes me an enemy before men, he is an enemy before God, and he has stirred up wrath against us. 2 Timothy 2:12 Do not worry then, but let the sword and shield be yours.
Then they calculated for me that I came to bring blessings to the earth, but I didn't bring blessings, but I brought the sword.

Whoever welcomes me, welcomes me; whoever welcomes me welcomes him who has befriended me. Luke
And whoever welcomes a worshipper of Allah, knowing that he is a worshipper of Allah, will receive a reward like that of the worshipper of Allah. And whoever welcomes a fearful of Allah, knowing that he is a fearful of Allah, will receive a reward like that of the fearful of Allah.
Each one gives one of these little ones, even if it’s just a glass of cold water, it’s actually my student’s, we’ll tell you the truth, it won’t be lost in his reward.”
The chapter recounts John the Baptist preparing his disciples to meet Jesus.
And Jesus fulfilled the commandments that he gave to his disciples, and he walked from Jerusalem to preach and announce the Gospel among the Jews.
John heard what the Lord was saying while he was imprisoned about the plan that the Messiah was putting into effect for him, and he told it to his fellow prisoners.
And what do I do: "Am I waiting for something to come, or am I waiting for something else?"
And Jesus answered them, “Go and tell John everything you have heard and seen:
The blind cannot see, the deaf cannot hear, the young boys are pure, and the mute cannot speak, the dead are alive, and the poor hear the good news.
And Hadsadek Haaak who won't bother you anymore.
They had gone to learn alone with John, and Jesus began to speak with the groups of people about John and said: “Go look in the desert? Does a tower that the wind blows against and brings back?”
Did you come to see? Is there a man wearing fine clothes? Because those who wear fine clothes, they live in the palaces of the kings!
Where did I go out to see you? Is it a prophet? We're telling you, it's a prophet, and more than a prophet.
This is what God has written in his book: I will humble my messenger before you, who has no way to reach you.
We tell you the truth: from among those who were added to the believers, no one is better than John the Baptist, but the little one is better than all in the kingdom of heaven.
And John the Baptist, until today, and the kingdom of heaven increases in power, and the strong are striving to seize it. Luke
The prophets and Moses prophesied, and even until the time of John the Baptist.
Unless you are mistaken, John the Baptist is Elijah who had to come. Matthew
Yeah, anyone who has something to say, listen!
But what is this generation like? It's like kids sitting in the car, shouting at each other and telling each other:
We inflated the price for you in the lira and didn't let it fluctuate, and we gave you everything and you didn't cry!
John said, "I haven't eaten or drunk anything," and he added, "He's like a resident of hell."
And a son of humankind was saying that he would eat and drink, and he was saying: “This is what the wealthy and companions of the tax collectors are like!” but the wisdom of God is good from its harvest. O woe to the blogger who does not obey.
And that hour, Jesus began to write down the miracles he performed, more than others, so that people’s disbelief did not touch them.
Woe to you, O Korazin! Woe to you, O Beit Saida! May the miracles that were performed for you in Sur and Saida be performed also in you, how long will you be in delusion, and may you wear rags and dust yourselves on ashes # 11:21 Wear rags and dust yourselves on ashes: to show their repentance.
But I tell you: the fate of the blogger from صور and صيدا on the Day of Judgment will be lighter than your fate.
Wait a minute, Kfarnaou! What are you even looking at the sky for? You're going to hit the abyss. Because if you had managed to preserve the miracles you have within you, you would be all radiant and timeless, and even beautiful today.
And about this we tell you: the fate of Sodom on the day of judgment will be less than your fate.” Matthew 10:15; Luke 10:12 Come to me and you will rest.
And you, O Clock, speak to Jesus and said: “We thank you, O Father, Lord of the heavens and the earth, for you have shown us the little ones that which you kept hidden in the depths of the intellect and the understanding.”
What is the Father, that is what you desired.
The Father gave me everything, and no one knows the Son except the Father, neither does anyone know the Father except the Son, and whoever the Son wills to make known. John 3:35; John 1:18; 10:15
I'm coming with the things you all brought, and those who carried the heavy burden, and I will give you relief.
I offer you my help and knowledge, learn from me, because I am charming and humble, and you will find peace for your souls there.
My dolphin is easy and my load is light.
Chapter: A nonsense about Jesus knowing on Saturday.
And he said to them, “My peace I give you, but my father’s peace is in you.” Then Jesus went to the hillside of a Sabbatical day, and his disciples were hungry, and they began to cut bundles of wheat and to eat.
The Pharisees told him: “Look at your disciples, they are doing things that shouldn’t be done on the Sabbath!”
Replied to them: “Did you not read what David did, wasting food while he and those with him are hungry?”
And how to enter the house of God, and every bread that is offered to Him, which was not meant for him or those with him, unless accompanied by a religious man alone.
I haven't read the Torah, but I see that these men of religion are like those who serve in God's house on Saturday, they eat and drink on Saturday, and if that's not upon them, what is their fault?
But I’m telling you: there is here, bigger than the house of God.
If you understood the meaning of the verse that says: “I want mercy, not sacrifice, then do not judge those who have no fault.” then everyone should judge those who are not to blame.
“The son of man is the Lord of the Sabbath.” Jesus heals on the Sabbath day.
And he walked for ten minutes to their mosque’s door.
And he found a man whose hand was paralyzed. They were questioning him and asking him: “Is the water allowance on Saturday?” They were asking him to find a charge against him.
And they replied: “Except for one of you who has a sheep, and it fell into a pit on Saturday, would he not have taken it out and shaken it until it came out?” Luke
Yes, a person is worth much more than a sheep! That’s why he did good on Saturday.
And Jesus said to the man whose hand was paralyzed: “Reach out your hand!” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored, just as the other hand.
Get out the Pharisees so they can argue about how to kill him. Jesus is the chosen one by God.
The Gospel of Jesus's feet, he walked from two and followed him many groups of people, and he healed them all.
And I told them not to tell anyone about it.
The words of Elijah and Isaiah will be verified:
Here is my slave whom I have chosen, My beloved whom I delight to please. I will put my soul into him, And make him the news of the nations.
He won't argue and he won't cry, he'll hardly hear his voice in the streets.
A shattered fortress, without a breaker, and a wick emitting smoke that doesn't extinguish, until justice prevails.
“And his name was Gideon, the hope of the nations.” Jesus and Beelzebul
They met some people with Jesus, one blind man, a man named Waseem and he lived next door, and he healed him, and so on, and then he was able to speak and see.
The communities were amazed and asked him: "Is this really Ben David?"
The Pharisees said, “This man does not possess a demon, for if he were, his father would have been dead.” Matthew 9:34; 10:25
And Jesus knew how they thought and considered, and said to them: “Every kingdom is divided and falls, and every city or family that is divided will not stand.”
Yeah, if the devil wants to come out, the devil will be divided and turn against his own head. And if he is divided and turns against his own head, how will his kingdom remain stable?
Otherwise, I would be Baalzebul, and I would drive people crazy, you know? Who is this that you would bring your children up with? Regarding that, your children will be the ones to rule over you.
But if it isn't me, possessed by the Spirit of God, I'll drive you mad. The Kingdom of God has come among you.
How can someone enter the house of a single person honestly and steal his belongings without being caught, and then steal his house as well?
Those who go with me are against me, and those who do not join with me are separating themselves from me. Mark 9:40
That's why we tell you: every sin and every blasphemy that someone says will be forgiven by people, but the blasphemy that is said against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
Anyone who speaks against the child of man will not be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, neither in this world nor in the coming age. Luke 12:10 The tree is known by its fruit.
Planting a good tree and it will give a good harvest, and planting a bad tree and it will give a bad harvest. It is from the harvest that you know the tree. When

A generous man will bring forth beautiful companions from his precious treasure within his heart, and a disappointed man will bring forth bitter companions from his desolate treasure within his heart.
We tell you: everyone is consuming every empty joke, and they will be held accountable for it on the Day of Reckoning.
“If you speak like this, they will use it against you, either by accusing you of being a Christian or by condemning you as a sinner.” The scholars of the Torah and the Pharisees wanted to see a sign.
And the hour-keeper replied to them two from the scholars of the law and the Pharisees, and said to them: “My lords, we wish to see from you a sign.”
He says to them: “A filthy and corrupt generation is asking for a mark! And they won’t give a single mark without the mark of Jonah. When…”
And then Jonah remained in the whale’s belly for three days and three nights, and then he would become the son of man in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
The people of Nineveh will follow you on the day of judgment and testify to it, since they repented when Jonah warned them, and now here is a blessing from Jonah.
The Queen of the South went by to testify with this generation and about it, because she had come from a distant land to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and now here is a descendant of Solomon.
What's a way to get rid of demons from a person who walks through places without water, looking for a place to rest but not finding it?
WikiGol: I'm going back to my house from which I came, and someone is going back to it and finds it empty and smoothed out and ravaged.
And he and Kidi will go with him, seven of the madmen others are worse than him. And when they enter, they will make him sink, and a state of that crazy man will be taken from his crazy state. This is what will happen to this generation that does evil even itself. Brother Jesus and Meh.
Melly was talking with groups of people, and May and her family came out to meet him.
He tells him one of the present people: "Here, your mother and your siblings are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.” # 12‏.47 This verse is not found in many manuscripts.
And Jesus replies to him: “Who is this saying to me? And who are my brothers?”
He was given a hand to the one he was targeting and the salt: “Here are my brother and my cousins,
These are the ones who have a plan with what's in the sky, they are my brother and my wife and me.
Chapter: The dirt of the farmer
I will ransom the day for you, Jesus left the house and went to the shore of the sea.
And they gathered together out of all the companies of people, and with a great crowd the boats came and crowded around it, and all the companies of people stood beside the sea. Luke 5:1-3
And he repeated all these things in Arabic and said: “This man went out to plant,”
Melly was planting, some grains fell on the road and the birds came and ate them.
The grains of sand fell into one place, on a hardened earth lacking much soil, and slowly, the sand began to sprout as the soil was not submerged.
Miles east of the sun, they burned, and wherever there was no wall, they dried up.
The berries fell amidst the thorns, and as the thorns grew, they choked them.
The grains fell down on a good land and gave a good harvest; some gave a hundred, some gave sixty, and some gave thirty.
“Yes, anyone who has something to say, listen!” The purpose of the following
Come closer, bring the supplicant and the blind man: “Why are you speaking to people in verse?”
And he replies to them: “I will give you what you need in order for you to understand the secrets of the Kingdom of the Heavens, but I will not give that to those who would understand them.”
Whoever has, shall give, and it shall increase upon him in proportion. And whoever does not have, from what he has, shall be taken from him. When
And I was talking to them, but now they don't see what they saw, and they don't hear what they heard, and they don't care.
These are the confirmations of the prophecy of Isaiah: And when you hear what you have heard, you understand nothing; and when you see what you have seen, it does not appear to you.
The heart of this people is endurance, their hearing is poor, and their eyes are closed, so that they do not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, and their hearts do not understand, and they return so that I can heal them.
But I keep your eyes shining where you see, and your hearts longing where you hear. Luke
And we tell you the truth: many prophets and righteous people wish to see what you see and hear what you hear, but they do not, and they do not hear what you hear and do not see what you see. The meaning of the verses of the farmer.
Yeah, you heard the meaning of the man's words who is farming:
Anyone who hears the words of the Kingdom of God and doesn’t obey them, the devil comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart, and this is what is compared to seed that has fallen on the wayside.
And he who plants in the stony ground, that is the one who hears the words of God and accepts them with joy.
But the Word of God did not settle well in his heart, and his faith remained for only a little while, and when problems and hostility would occur, it would diminish a bit.
And he is planted amidst thorns, he is the one who hears the words of God, but they are the worldly affairs and love of money that choke the words of God, and it does not yield any profit.
“That which is planted in good soil is the one who hears the word of God and understands it, and it is that which gives the yield. Some risks are a hundred times, and some risks are sixty times, and some risks are thirty times.” The essence of the matter is in the soil.
Jesus gave to them one of the last twelve and said: “Like a man who sows good seed in a field, his crop will be the grain.”
The people were sleeping, when the enemy came and planted his weeds among the wheat, and he went his way.
And the full head of wheat has sprung, and with it the ears of corn.
And the servants of the master of the house came to him and said to him: “O Lord, isn’t this the best seedling you planted on your land? Yes, where did this weed come from?”
He replies to them: This enemy is the one who did this. And they say to him: Do you want to go and remove him?
And they replied immediately: No! They mustn't associate with the wicked with the righteous.
Let the thyme grow with the herbs until the harvest time, and at that hour we tell the harvester to collect the herbs, he is the master and arranges them in bundles to burn them, while the thyme we collect and give it to the storage house’s». The seeds of mustard and the yeast’s ingredients.
And he repeated Gal Lehem the last: “It resembles the Kingdom of the Heavens like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and planted in his field.”
Wakha is the little one in all love, she grows into a tree bigger than all the trees, even the birds come to nest in her branches.
Ata gave them another parable and said: “It is like the kingdom of the heavens, which is like yeast that they took and mixed with three kilos of flour until it leavened all the dough.” Jesus was speaking in parables.
Jesus explained all of this to the congregations of the people, without saying anything to them, without giving them any example.
The saying of the prophet ﷺ: “We speak with those who are knowledgeable and reveal all that was hidden from the day the world was created.” The meaning of the knowledge of the unseen.
He told the clockmaker to take Jesus the people's gatherings and return home, and when they came to him, he told them: "Explain to us the details of the land!"
And they replied: “Only the son of man plants the good seed.”
An acre is the world, the best children are the children of the kingdom of God, and the evil children are the children of Satan.
The enemy who planted the weeds is Satan, and the harvest is the end of times, and the harvesters are the angels.
As things gather and burn with excess, so will it happen in the end of time:
The son of humankind, the angel, will be raised, and he will gather all the things that cause sorrow and those who cause it from his kingdom.
Vermouhem fzoubya d l'aafiia, rah tem fin ghad fi kbaka w tghazzaz ssenan.
But those who obey God are like the sun in the kingdom of their fathers. Yes, whoever has something and wants to share it, listen! The treasure, the jewel, and the network.
And it resembled the kingdom of the heavens, so a man found a treasure buried in an acre of land, and he buried it again. And because of his joy, he walked and sold everything he owned, and bought that acre of land.
It resembled the Kingdom of the Heavens, belonging to a merchant who sought to sift through the purest essence.
He sold everything he had to buy a precious jewel.
And it resembled the kingdom of the heavens, where one network was thrown by the fisherman into the sea, and whales of every kind were gathered.
Melli Omarat, they took him to work as a fisherman by the sea and locked him up, and they began to isolate him. The one who did well put him in a basket, and whoever didn't agree threw him out.
And in the end of time, the angels will isolate the sinners from among those who fear God.
Verreaux's eagle, the eagle of health, where will the tears and the sharpening of the sword be? New and old treasure.
And Jesus, his disciple, said: “Do you understand all this?” And they replied: “Yes!”
He says to them: “Yes, that’s right, every scholar of the law knows the kingdom of the heavens, it’s like a master of the house who brings out everything new and old from his treasure.” Nazareth Beforehand Jesus
Truly, Jesus is the guide, He walked from Tem.
And he returned to his town, Nazareth, where he was teaching the people in the synagogue until they were astonished, and they were saying, “What is the wisdom and the miracles this man is doing?”
Is this not the son of the carpenter? And is this not Mary who you named Miriam, and her brothers Jacob, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Where are all my sisters living in our city? “Yes, how did all this happen?”
It wasn't surprising to them, but Jesus said to them, “The prophet is respected in every place, not only in his own country.” John 4:44.
The only thing that circulated about you was the place, because it was full of miracles, since they didn't have faith.
Chapter 44 of John the Baptist's death
I give you my time, Herod the King heard news of Jesus.
He says to the servants: “This is John the Baptist sent from death, that is why miracles are done through him.”
John the Baptist was a Hebrew-speaking Egyptian and he took him (John) and put him in prison because Herodias, Philip’s brother, wanted to see himself in a mirror like a reflection. Luke
John’s uncle told him: “It’s not permissible for you to marry her.”
And Baqi wanted to kill him, but he feared the people because they believed he was a prophet.
And the party was Herod’s Christmas party, a girl from Herodias’s rambling at the party, and Herod was pleased.
That's why he swore he would give her what he asked for.
She was exhausted from carrying, Herod said, "Bring me John the Baptist's head in a boat!"
The king was saddened, but he ordered that the sweet one who swore and the people present be given what they asked for.
Whoever beheads John in prison.
He gave it to a man named Tabseel and gave it to the girl, and took it to Maha.
John's students came, and they took his garment and covered the Lord with it, and then they went and left Jesus. Jesus ate five thousand.
Jesus heard these things, and he got out of the boat and walked on the bare ground alone. And when the people saw that he was going on the land, they came to him on foot.
He stepped off the boat and saw a large group of people, and they looked at them and healed their sick.
In Melligat el-ʿashiyya, they gave him some water and told him: “It’s not going well while we’re in this heat, yes tell the people to go to the souks to buy their food.”
But Jesus said to them, “Don’t worry about anything, give them something to eat, and I want you to see that they have enough.”
He says: "Here we only have five loaves of bread and two tuna."
They say: "Show me here!"
He commanded groups of people to pray for spring. And he took those five loaves of bread and the two fish, and he looked at the sky and thanked God. And when he cut the bread, he gave to his disciples, and the disciples gave to the groups of people.
Both of them were full, and after that they gathered a basket full of fragrant bread loaves that they had spread.
And they were those who ate five thousand men, without the women and the children. Jesus was walking on the water.
And order Jesus’s disciple to go and take another clock on the boat and overtake them for another side, as the people themselves say.
He spent the afternoon in the heat, he went up to the mountain alone to pray. And he stayed alone until evening arrived.
The small fishing boats were many in the middle of the sea and the Maghreb fishermen had managed to catch them, so the wind was against them.
And when the dawn came, Jesus was with his disciples, walking on the sea.
Melly saw the students walking on the water, they forgot and said: "This is a vision of a genie," and they cried out from too much fear.
And he said to the disciples, “Be encouraged, I am he, do not fear!”
He tells Peter: “Sir, if you are the one, command me to come to you walking on water.”
And Jesus said to him, “Come!” And he heeded Jesus’ command and went down from the boat with Peter walking on the water toward Jesus.
But when he saw the strong wind tearing and began to drown, he cried out: “Release me, my Lord!”
And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to them, “My beloved children, why do you doubt?”
They went out to the boat, the wind calmed down.
And those who were in the boat knelt and said to him, “Truly, he is the Son of God.” Jesus was healing many sick people in Capernaum
Jesus and his disciples went down to the town of Bethsaida, and he stayed there. Then they went to Galilee, near the lake.
And they knew him well throughout the country, and they valued his knowledge dearly, everyone of them, and they brought all their sick people to him.
And they asked him to do it, even if it was just to clean it. And everything that was touched would heal.
Chapter 18: Discussions on the Custom of the Elders
And after that, they came to Jesus alone two of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law from Jerusalem, and they said to Him:
Why do your teachers not follow the tradition of the elders? Because they don't wash their hands before eating.
But he replied to them: “Why do you continue to defy God’s commandment so that you may follow your custom?”
God Ghit said: "You are a disgrace to your father and mother, and whoever insults your door or your property should be killed."
But I’m still Ketkolo: either the white or the black; that’s what I need to help you with, I gave a gift to God.
I won’t be obligated to amuse myself anymore. And thus, His word has been canceled so you can follow your customs.
The hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you all:
This people only thank me with their mouths, but their hearts are far from me.
It's pointless for them to worship me, because they know the teachings that are not the commands of people.” The things that trouble a person.
And he shouted at the crowd and told them: “Listen and understand!”
What goes into the mouth is what makes a man, but what comes out of the mouth is what fouls him.
And then Joshua came to him with the students and said to him: “Do you know that the Pharisees are troubled when they hear your words?”
And they replied: “Whoever did not plant the date palm in the sky will wither.”
Let them go! Those guys are blind, they're saying they're blind, and if the blind say the blind are blind, they'll fall into two pits together.” Luke
Peter asked us: "Explain the meaning of this text!"
He replies: “Until we finish, are you still not understanding?”
I don't know what happens to everything that goes into a human's mouth and goes to their stomach, and then comes out?
But what comes out of the mouth, comes out of the heart, and that is what conquers a person. When
It’s painful to see the heartbreaking ideas—like a terrible situation, corruption among married couples and those who aren’t, theft, forgery, insults.
“That is what makes a man, but food that has not been washed does not defile a man.” The faith of the Canaanite woman.
And Jesus went out of there and walked to Capernaum and Caesarea Philippi.
And she came to him with a Canaanite woman, like those who worship idols, and she said, “Have mercy on me, O lord of my husband, for my daughter is tormented by a demon.”
But he didn’t answer her with a word. They approached her, pleading with her and asking her: “Let her be alone, because she’s our sister and she’s going to forget us!”
And Jesus answered and said: “God has not given me except for the foolish goats of the nation of Israel.”
But the woman said to him and prostrated herself before him and said, “Help me, my Lord!”
And she replied: “It’s not reasonable to take the boys’ bread and throw it to the dogs.”
And the woman said: “Oh my lord! But even the dogs are eating from the gutters that fall from their balconies.”
And Jesus answered and said: “Your faith is great indeed, O woman! You shall have what you ask for.” And that hour her daughter looked at her. Many people were looking at her daughter.
And after that, Jesus walked from the vicinity of the Sea of Galilee, and went up to the mountain and sat down.
Large groups of people came to him, along with the disabled, blind, mute, and many others, and he placed them at his feet and healed them.
The communities of people were amazed to see the prophets speaking, the demons being cast out, the scoffers walking, the blind seeing, and glory given to God, the God of Israel. Jesus ate with four thousand.
And Jesus cried out to his disciples and to all those present: “Stay in this place, for surely these three days the famine here is not for them, and they have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they stumble on the way.”
And he asks her: "Where are we going to get enough flour for this bread that will feed a large group like this?"
Jesus asked, “How much bread do you have?” They replied, “Seven loaves and a few small fish.”
And command Jesus the people of mankind to sit on the earth.
And God blessed those seven loaves and the fish, and they gave thanks to God and broke them, and He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the people.
Both of them were full, and they danced seven times with seven bags full of bread crumbs that they had spread.
They were the people who ate forty thousand without any fillings or children.
Melly spent the summer, Jesus, the groups of people, boarded the boat and went to Magadan.
Chapter 13 Signs of Time
And some of the Pharisees came to Him, testing Him, and said, “Rabbi, by what sign do you perform your miracles?”
But he replied to them: “When the sun sets, he says: The weather will be clear, even though the sky is red.”
Good morning, Ketlou: Today it will be winter, that’s why the sky is red and dry. Do you know how to interpret the weather conditions, but you can’t interpret the signs of time!
A wretched and corrupt generation that asks for a mark, and would not give it even a mark unless it were the mark of Jonah. And after He had let them go, He departed, and they went on their way. Matthew 12:39; Luke 11:29
The students arrived at the other side of the sea, and they realized they had forgotten to bring bread.
“Cast out the worthless ones, cleanse your minds from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!” – Luke
And they say, “It’s not right for them to say this to us – they didn’t take bread with them.”
And Jesus saw how they were thinking and said to them: “Why do you suddenly have little faith? Do you not yet have a barley loaf?”
Are you still not understanding? Have you not thought about the five loaves of bread that were divided into five thousand units, how much dough have you collected from the crusts of the bread? When
He couldn't believe seven loaves of bread that were divided into a quarter of a thousand units, how much dough did he gather? When
How could you not understand what I meant by the bread? Clear your minds of the yeast of the Pharisees and the hypocrites!
And that hour, they understood that it was meant to lead them to purify their own minds from the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees, not from the yeast of bread. Peter testified that Jesus is the Messiah.
And Jesus came to Capernaum, where he was being watched by his disciples. And they said to him, “The Teacher, who is the son of man?”
And he answered and said, “They say to him, ‘John the Baptist, or saying, ‘Elijah the prophet, and others say, ‘Jeremiah or one of the prophets.’” Matthew
Soulham: “Who are you, and what do you want from us?”
Simon Peter replied, “It is He, the Messiah, the Son of God, the living God!” John
My beloved Jesus: “Blessed are you, Simeon ben Jonah! Although no human being behind you knows this truth, the Father in the heavens knows it.”
And I am telling you: I am Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the power of death will not have power over it.
And I will give you a watch of the Kingdom of the Heavens, everything you will connect to the earth will be connected to the heavens, and everything you will solve on earth will be solved in the heavens. When
And after Jesus’ disciples had heard what he said to someone, they all understood that he was the Messiah. Jesus prophesied his death and resurrection.
And about that hour, Jesus began to say to him, “Let us go into Judea, that people may eat of my flesh and drink my blood, and so their lives will be saved.” He said this meaning that he would give up his life for them. Then he said to them again, “I am sure that none of these will die if they eat my flesh and drink my blood.” Then it began to be known among the Jews that he was going to give up his life for him. So they began to say, “This man will not also be raised to us.” Then they began to inquire about his behalf, that is, concerning where he was going to be raised. Therefore, the Jews were saying to him, “Stay here and be raised to us.” But he told them, “You know that I am in your midst because of your word, and by the word that I spoke to you, you know who is the resurrection of the dead.” But again, they were divided, and they sent to the chief priests, saying, “We found him saying these things, but you yourselves ask who he is? We are not answering you, for if we say that you are the Christ, you will not believe us, and if we do not say that you are the Christ, you will be ashamed of him.” But they said, “What person is this who says you will raise the dead?” Then they said to him, “You cannot raise anyone from the dead; you give us a sign, even without reference to the dead.” He replied, “Truly, truly, I say to you, that you want to be raised; but you do not believe that you are able to be raised. Do you make me also a subject for your judgments?”
Peter pulled him aside and began to argue with him and to say: “May God not let this happen to you!”
He turns to Peter and says: “I ask you for the devil! You are cursing my ancestors, you only think about people’s affairs, not God’s.”
He says Jesus to his disciples: “If anyone wants to follow me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.”
If anyone wants to save his life, he will waste it, but whoever wasted his life for me will find it. When?
Would I gain the entire world if I benefited a person, but lose my own life? Or would I give a person my life's worth as compensation?
As a son of humankind will come with his angels in the high heavens, and each one will be judged according to his deeds. When
We tell you the truth: there is among the present here someone who will not die until he sees a son of mankind coming to his kingdom.
Chapter 76, Jesus is the master of his own destiny.
And after six days, Jesus took Peter and James and his brother John, and took them up a high mountain by themselves.
Their changed appearance, their faces turned as bright as the sun, and their belongings were like eggs that could be arranged like light.
It appears to them as Moses and Elijah speaking with Jesus.
Peter to Jesus: “How good it is for us to remain here with you, Lord. If you wish, I’ll stay three hours, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
And at that time, he was speaking falsehoods to them. One cloud, a bright cloud, spoke, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my beloved son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him!” 2 Peter 1:17, 18
They heard this news, they fell on their faces and were very afraid.
And Jesus drew near to them and touched them: “Arise, do not be afraid!”
And they wiped their eyes and saw only Jesus.
And as they were descending from the mountain, Jesus met them and said to them, “Do not tell anyone this that you have seen, until the son of man is risen from the dead.”
Wsoloh tledah: “Iwa ‘lāsh kīġġūwl l-ʿulamā d-sharaʿ blī f-l-lūl khāṣ n-nabbī ʾīyīya yijī?”
And they replied: “In truth, Elijah will come and he will fix everything.”
But I tell you: it has come to Elijah and they did not know him, and they wanted to harm him, and so does a son of man, even he will be tormented by their hands. When
They told the clock that they understood the communication, as if he was talking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus was healing a child possessed by a demon.
And Jesus and his disciples came to the people, and there came a man and fell down before him.
WGL: “My son, oh my lord, I wish he wasn’t exposed to the winds and beaten a lot, and he fell many times in his health and his food.”
I fed him and he didn't get better."
And Jesus answered and said, “O you generation of stone! When will you have faith? Until when will we be with you? Until when will we bear you? Bring this child here!”
Jesus rose and the demons went out, and he was healed at that hour.
Bring the implements to Jesus and ask them to mediate between them and Him, and say to them: “Why are we not able to drive out demons?”
Listen closely: "Because of your lack of faith! And I tell you the truth: unless you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain: 'Move from here to there, and it will move.' You will say anything is possible for you."
This type of madness only comes out through prayer and fasting. # 17:21 This verse is not found in many ancient manuscripts; Matthew 17:21; Mark 11:23; 1 Corinthians 13:2 Jesus prophesied again about death and his resurrection
And they were gathered together in the land of Galilee, and they said to Jesus, “The Son of Man is handed over to the hands of men.”
And they killed him, and on the third day he was resurrected. And the students were very sad. Jesus paid the tax for the house of God.
Jesus and his disciples returned to Capernaum, and when they had entered the house, he began to ask them about taxes. Then they said to him, “Look, the people come and pay the temple tax to Caesar.” He said to them, “Show me the coin used for the temple tax, and show me the head of Caesar. Then I will tell you whom we should pay.”
And they answered him, “Hey, it’s going to be finished.” And whoever went into the house preceded him and Jesus said to him, “Have you believed that I am the Son of Man? Who is he that takes taxes from kings and the tribute of the nations?”
Peter replied: "Because I am a foreigner." He says to Jesus: "These are their children, and they are exempt from taxes."
But in order not to cause them any trouble, go to the sea and cast your line, and when the whale pulls it, open its mouth and you’ll find a lot of dollars inside, take it and go pay for it, for yourself and for others.
