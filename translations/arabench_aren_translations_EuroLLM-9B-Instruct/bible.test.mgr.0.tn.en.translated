Who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven? (Mark 9:33-37; Luke 9:46-48)
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and said, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
And Jesus called a little child and had him stand among them
He said, "You are right: if you do not know how to raise young children, you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven."
He who humbles himself and becomes like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
The one who accepts a little boy like this because of my name accepts me.
And if it were to cause a problem for one of the unborn children who wish him well, a large millstone should be tied around his neck and he should be thrown into the sea.
Oh Woe to the world, what are the things that make people commit sins! These things must come, but oh Woe to the human who brings the things that make people commit sins!
If your hand and leg prevent you from committing sins, cut them off and throw them away. If you enter eternal life with your hand cut off and no defect, it is better for you to enter hell with your hands and legs intact.
And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. For it is better that you enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the hell of fire. The lost sheep (Luke 15:3-7)
"Return them to you, do not belittle one of the children of this man. I tell you: the angels are always looking at them in the sky, looking at the face of the Lord in the sky."
# 18:11 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: I, the Son of Man, have come to save the lost.
What do you think? If a man has a water skin and one of them is lost, would he leave the other 99 in the mountain and go look for the lost one?
You're right, if he finds it, he'll be happier with it than the 99% that didn't get lost.
Imala Raho Buya, who is in the sky, does not like it when one of the brothers is destroyed." Allowance between brothers (Luke 17:3)
"If your friend is wrong about you, go and tell him about his mistake between you two, and if he listens to you, you have won your friend."
But if he did not hear your words, shake one or two others with you, so that two or three witnesses may testify to every word spoken.
If he doesn't listen to their words, tell the church, and if he doesn't listen to the church's words, figure out how someone who is not a believer or a kafir.
You have the right: the thing you tie to the earth so that it is tied in the sky, and the thing you untie on earth so that it is untied in the sky.
I'll translate it again: If two of you agree on something they want on earth, the father in heaven will do it for them.
"Where do two or three gather in my name, I am there among them." Like the servant who does not forgive.
This time, Peter came and said to Jesus, "Lord, how many times will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Will it be up to seven times?"
They said to Jesus, "We will not forgive you seven times, but seventy-seven times."
This is why the kingdom of heaven is like a master of love who accounts for his servants.
Kabda yahasab fihim, Jabalo wahid yasaluf lus bi-hijab.
As we finish, Sido orders that he, his wife and children, and everything he owns, should be sold to get money.
Brother, the servant fell on his back and said, "My lord, my lord, be patient with me and we will finish everything for you!"
Sidou and Sibou were foolish and forgave him for his debt.
So this servant came out and found another servant like him asking for some money. My brother strangled him and said, "Pay me back the money you owe me!"
Brother, the other guard fell on his horse and was wounded. He said, "Be patient, I will save you."
What, he was arrested, taken away, and put in prison until the debt he owes is paid.
The other servants found out what had happened, they were very worried and informed their master that the whole thing had happened.
This time, Nadalou said to Sidu: "Oh wicked servant! I forgive you this debt, for your sake I have covered you."
"And you have no right to pity the servant who is your friend, how can I pity you?"
Sido cheated, and he handed over to the prison official until he pays off his debt.
"Haka Zada Baba in the sky should work with each one of you. If he doesn't forgive his brother from his heart."
Marriage and Divorce (Mark 10:1-12)
As Jesus finished speaking, he left the region of Galilee and went into the region of Judea on the other side of the Jordan River.
A lot of people followed him, and they were healed.
A group of Pharisees approached him and asked him to test him: "Brother, is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
"Answer them: 'My friend, you didn't read that the one who created them in the beginning created them male and female.'"
# Gen 1:27; 2:24; Eph 5:31; 1 Cor 6:16 He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh."
Imala are not two, but one body. This is why when God gathers them, He does not separate man."
# Matt 24:1-4 The Pharisees said, "Why did Moses say that a man should give his wife a certificate of divorce and then divorce her?"
Jesus said to them, "Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning."
And I will tell you: anyone who divorces his wife for a reason other than adultery and marries another is committing adultery."
The students said, "If this is the man's condition with his wife, then it's better if he doesn't get married."
And he said to them, "Not everyone will accept this message, but only those whom God allows to accept it."
There are some who cannot get married when they are born from their mother's womb, and there are some whom people have done something to them that they are not able to get married, and there are some who do not want to get married for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let him who can do this thing do it." Jesus blesses the little children (Mark 10:13-16; Luke 18:15-17)
They brought the little children to Jesus so that he might lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked the people who brought them.
And Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven."
And he laid his hands on them and went away from there. The rich young man (Mark 10:17-31; Luke 18:18-30).
One of them said, "Teacher, what good things must I do to receive eternal life?"
Jesus said, "Why do you ask about the expensive things? Is there one expensive thing? If you want to enter eternal life, keep the commandments."
Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20 They said, "What are the commandments?" Jesus said, "Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness,
# 19:18 Honor your father and your mother, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself."
The boy said, "We're all working on these things, what's still missing?"
They said to Jesus, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you own and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
As the boy heard this, he walked sadly on his thoughts, he had a lot of things.
Jesus said to his disciples, "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven!"
And I'll translate it again: "It's easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
When the students heard this, they were very surprised and said, "Who can possibly succeed?"
And Jesus rebuked them, saying, "This kind can come out only by prayer and fasting."
This time, Peter replied, "Hannah, we left everything and followed you, what should we take?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly, I say to you, when the Son of Man is lifted up, then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own, but speak just as the Father taught me. And he who sent me is with me. The Father has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him." As he spoke, many believed in him. Jesus said to the Jews who believed in him, "If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free." They answered him, "We are descendants of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone. How can you say, 'You will be set free'?" Jesus answered them, "Very truly, I tell you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin. The slave does not have a permanent place in the household. The Son has a permanent place in the household. So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. I know that you are descendants of Abraham. Yet you want to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen; I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen. I know that you are descendants of Abraham. Yet you want to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen; I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen. I know that you are descendants of Abraham. Yet you want to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen; I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen. I know that you are descendants of Abraham. Yet you want to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen; I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen. I know that you are descendants of Abraham. Yet you want to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen; I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen. I know that you are descendants of Abraham. Yet you want to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen; I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen. I know that you are descendants of Abraham. Yet you want to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen; I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen. I know that you are descendants of Abraham. Yet you want to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen; I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen. I know that you are descendants of Abraham. Yet you want to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen; I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen. I know that you are descendants of Abraham. Yet you want to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen; I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen. I know that you are descendants of Abraham. Yet you want to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen; I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen. I know that you are descendants of Abraham. Yet you want to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. I speak on behalf of my Father, and you do not listen; I speak on behalf of my Father, and you
And whoever leaves his home, his brothers, his sisters, his father, his mother, his children, or his land for my sake, he will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
"And some people should turn to the others first, and the people who are at the end should turn to the first ones."
Like the servants of the grape press.
"The one who is heading to the kingdom of the heavens is like the lord of the house who goes out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard."
And agreed with the servants on a silver platter during the day and sent them to the vineyard.
And he went out with the nine, man, he saw another group standing in the market and unemployed.
He said to them, "You go and pick the grapes, and we will give you your share, my friend."
He went out again around mid-day, and again at the three o'clock in the evening, and did the same thing.
He went out around 5 pm with his five friends, and found other people sitting there, and he said to them, "What are you doing sitting here all day?"
They said, "Even one of us won't stop us from serving." He said to them, "You, go and serve in the vineyard."
Evening agencies, Mualla al-Unab said to the lazy servants: Call the servants and finish them, show them the other two until they reach the governor.
The group went to start serving with the five of the evening and each of them took a silver plate.
And when the elders came, it occurred to them that they should take more than the others, each of them taking a share of the silver.
And when they finish, they cheat on the Lord of the grapes.
They said, "The other men here didn't serve for an hour, and you finished them off like we did, who served the whole day in the heat!"
One of them replied: "My friend, I didn't cheat you. Didn't we agree on a piece of silverware?"
Take your helmet and leave. I wanted to give this other guy the same treatment we gave you.
"Hey, don't I have the right to do what I want with my money? Are you jealous of me because I'm generous?"
Jesus said, "The other nations will honor you, and you will be honored by the other nations." Jesus speaks a third time about his death and resurrection (Mark 10:32-34; Luke 18:31-34).
And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,
"Hannah is going to Jerusalem, and Anna the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes of the Jews, and they will condemn him to death."
And he said, "Let me be delivered to the Gentiles, that they may mock me, scourge me, and crucify me. And on the third day I will rise again." The things that he asked of James and John (Mark 10:35-45)
And she went to Jato once with her children, and she prostrated before him and asked him for something.
Jesus said to her, "Whom do you love?" She said to him, "Lord, whoever you are, you have washed my feet, and given me my drink." Jesus said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."
So Jesus answered, "You don't know what you're asking. Can you drink the cup that I am going to drink?" They said to him, "We can."
He said to them, "You, drink my cup, but I am not the one who decides who will sit on my right and on my left, for it is my father who has brought people to this place."
And when the other ten students heard this, they cheated on the two brothers.
And Jesus called them to him and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them. But it shall not be so among you; but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave; even as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many."
But you must not have this thing among you. But whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.
And he loves you, O Allah, in you, let him be a servant to all people.
Even I, Anna, the Son of Man, did not come to be served, but to serve and to give my life as a ransom for many." Jesus heals two blind men (Mark 10:46-52; Luke 18:35-43)
And when Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
Two blind men were sitting by the side of the road and when they heard Jesus passing by, they began to shout, "Oh, our Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
Brother, people shouted at them to be quiet. But they shouted even more: "Our Lord, son of David, have mercy on us!"
And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?
They said, "Our Lord, we would like to return and see!"
And Jesus looked up at them and said, "Have faith in God." At that moment, their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. They followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem (Mark 11:1-11; Luke 19:28-40; John 12:12-19)
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples ahead,
He said to them, "Go to the village opposite you, and you will find a tied-up animal with a foal. Untie them and bring them to me."
And if anyone asks you for something, answer them: "The Lord has their needs." And then return them in time.
This thing happened so that what the Prophet said would come true.
"Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your King is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'" (Zechariah 9:9; Isaiah 62:11)
The disciples went to the villages and did as Jesus had instructed them.
They brought the beast and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them.
Most people laid their carpets on the road, and others cut tree sticks and placed them on the road.
Mk 11:26; Lk 2:14; Mt 21:15; 23:39; and the crowds that went before him and those that followed were calling out, "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"
And when Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in turmoil, asking, "Who is this?"
They said, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee." Jesus drove the money changers from the temple (Mark 11:15-19; Luke 19:45-48; John 2:13-22).
Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.
# Isa 56:7; 7:11 And He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of robbers!"
The Jawa of the blind and the deaf is for the structure, and their lips are for their mouths.
When the chief priests and scribes of the Jews were deceived and killed, they saw the miracles that Jesus worked and how the little children called in the temple: "Hosanna to the son of David!"
# Psalm 8:2 They said, "Brother, what are they saying?" Jesus said, "Yes, brother, have you never read this verse: 'Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings you have ordained praise'?"
And leaving them, he went out of the city to Bethany, and he lodged there. Jesus cursed the fig tree (Mark 11:12-14, 20-24).
And when he returned to the city in the morning, Jesus was hungry
And he saw a vine on the side of the road, my friend, and he didn't find anything in it but paper, and he said to it, "You will never bear fruit forever!" And the vine withered over time.
The students were amazed, they pointed at the thing that had happened and said: "Why did the vine dry up at once?"
Jesus answered them, "Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' and it will be done.
"Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it." The authority of Jesus (Mark 11:27-33; Luke 20:1-8)
And when Jesus entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered them, "I will ask you one question. If you answer it, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things:
"Where did John's baptism come from? Is it from heaven or from men?" They discussed it among themselves, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?' But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, because they know that John was a prophet."
"But if we say, 'From men,' we fear the people, for all hold John as a prophet."
They answered Jesus, "We do not know." Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
What do you think? A man with two sons went to the first and said, "My son, go and work today in the vineyard."
Brother, the son answered, "I don't know what's going on." But he regretted it and left.
And he walked to the other boy and said the same thing he said to the first boy, and the boy replied, "Hani is gone, sir!" But he didn't go.
"Annaho Malzouz brothers, what is the thing that your father likes?" The elders said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth: those who are in the taxes and corrupt women are sitting in front of you to enter the kingdom of God."
Jack's John how a man of the bar ya khi ma amnetu biya ama ya yalmou in the taxes and corrupt women amnou biya. Wa hatta waktili shattou al shay' haadaka ma tabtou wa ma amnetou biya." Like the servants of the vineyard of Sania (Mark 12:1-12; Luke 20:9-19)
"Listen to another example: There was a man who planted a vineyard, surrounded it with a wall, built a press in it, and made a watchtower and a distance marker for the Khamsah community and traveled to another country."
And as soon as the time came when the grapes were ripe, the servants sent his belongings to the Khamsah so that they would send him the harvest.
And they tied the servant's hands and feet and beat one of them, killed another, and stoned another with stones.
And the master of the grapes sent the servants again, more than the number he had sent the first time. They did the same thing to them.
Mubaa'd ba'athum waladwa wa'ladda qal: "Tu yaj'aru waladi."
When the five men saw the boy, they said to each other, "This is the one who will inherit! Let's kill him and take his inheritance!"
They tied him up, took him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
"Imala waktili yagji mawla al-saniya mat'aal al-'inab ash bas yad'am fi al-khamsah haadhukum?"
The Jewish elders said, "Let the wicked be killed and give his vineyard to five other men so that they may give him the harvest of the grapes in its time."
# Ps 118:22-23; Acts 4:11; I Pet 2:7 Jesus said to them, "Did you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the chief corner stone. The Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes.'"
This is why we are transferring you: so that God's kingdom can be divided and given to the people who will work its fruit."
# 21:44 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: I am the Son of Man, I have come to save the lost.
And when the chief priests and Pharisees heard these parables, they understood that He was speaking about them.
But when they tried to arrest him, they were afraid of the people, because they considered him a prophet.
Like the king's party (Luke 14:15-24)
And Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:
"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who attends a wedding party for his son."
The servants were sent to call the guests for the wedding party, but they did not come.
And he sent other servants again, saying, "Tell those who are invited, 'Behold, I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage feast!'"
But they didn't account for the night and went to their homes, one went to his farm, and one went to his shop.
And the others tied up their servants and killed them.
The king cheated and sent his soldiers to kill the criminals and burn their city.
And Mubaa'ed said to his servants, "The night is here, but the guests who were invited do not deserve it."
"Imalah, don't go to the streets and invite as many people as you can for the wedding night."
And these servants of yours went out to the road and brought all the poor and the wasted, and the house of the wedding was filled with guests.
So when the king came to see the guests, he saw a man not wearing a robe. They said, "Brother."
How did you enter here and what's the wedding dress? The man remained silent.
Then the king said to the servants: "Take him by his hands and legs and throw him into the darkness outside, and let him cry and weep for years."
"Many were called, but few were chosen." Paying taxes to Caesar (Mark 12:13-17; Luke 20:20-26)
This time the Pharisees also came and began to question him as to how he was able to speak with a word.
And the disciples sent their belongings with a group from Herod's party and said to him, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful, and you teach the way of God in truth, and you do not care about anyone, and for your sake you do not live in the people's positions.
"Tell us, what do you think? Should we pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
But Jesus, perceiving their wickedness, said to them, "You hypocrites, why do you test me?"
"Give me the money for taxes!" said Jigolo with a silver coin.
Jesus said to them, "What is this image and inscription?"
They said, "The things of Caesar!" My brother said to them, "No, give the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God!"
And they were astonished when they heard this, and left him and went away. The Resurrection of the Dead (Mark 12:18-27; Luke 20:27-40)
In the daytime, the Sadducees came to Jesus, who said that there is no resurrection after death, and asked him a question.
# 25:5 And they said, "Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up children for his brother.'"
And there were seven brothers between us, and the first brother's wedding passed away without having children, and his brother took her.
The same thing happened for the second, third, and seventh.
And the more they were banished, the more the woman died.
In the day of judgment, may these women be the ones that everyone marries because of them."
Jesus answered them, "You are wrong, because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God."
On the Day of Judgment, they will neither marry nor be married to them, just as the angels in heaven are.
You are like the dead on the Day of Resurrection, my brother, you have not read what Allah has told you:
# Ex 3:6 Is he the God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”
And when the people heard this, they wondered what kind of teaching he had. The greatest commandment (Mark 12:28-34; Luke 10:25-28).
And when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
And one of them, a scholar of Islamic law, asked a question to test them:
"Teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the law?"
# Matt 6:5 Jesus answered, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind."
This is the first and greatest commandment.
# Leviticus 19:18; Matthew 19:19; Galatians 5:14; Romans 13:9; James 2:8 and the second commandment, love your neighbor as you love your soul.
The whole Torah and the Prophets are based on these two commandments." Christ and David (Mark 12:35-37; Luke 20:41-44)
When the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question.
"What do you think of the Messiah? Who is he?" They said, "The son of David!"
He said to them, "How is it that David calls him 'Lord,' saying, 'The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet'?"
# Ps 110:1; Acts 2:34-35; Heb 1:13; 10:13. The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.
If David calls him "Our Lord," how can he be his son?"
And not one of them could respond with a word. And from that day on, not one of them dared to ask any question.
Jesus rebukes the scribes and Pharisees (Mark 12:38-40; Luke 11:37-52; 20:45-47)
And Jesus said to the people and his disciples:
"The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat,"
Imalla, do not work and remember everything they tell you. Whatever they do, if they do not work, they will say so and do not work.
They put a heavy burden on people's shoulders, even though they don't touch it with their finger.
They do things so people can see them, they grow in their amaym and lengthen in their thraabl clothing.
They like to sit in the first rows in the evenings and the first chairs in the gatherings.
People like to greet them in the markets, calling them: "O teachers!"
But you will not let anyone call you "teacher," for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
And do not say to anyone on earth "O our Lord," because you have a Lord who is in the sky.
And don't let anyone call you "master" because you have one master, who is Christ.
And let your leader serve you.
He who rises from his soul descends, and he who humbles himself is exalted.
Oh woe to you, you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You drink in the kingdom of heaven in the faces of the people, you do not enter and you do not let those who are entering enter.
# 23:14 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: Woe to you, you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You devise ways to cheat women whose husbands are dead, and you take their houses, and you think that your prayers are long, this is why your account will be great before the Lord.
Oh, welcome, you Jewish books and hypocritical Pharisees! You break the law and the sea so that one of you can enter your religion, and if he enters, you will send him to hell twice as much as you deserve!
Welcome, you elders, you blind ones! You say, "He who swears by the temple is not bound by his oath, but he who swears by the gold of the temple is bound by his oath."
Anna, who has more value, you fools and blind? Gold or the structure that returns gold sacred?
And they say, "The one who swears by the altar is not bound by anything, but the one who swears by the sacrifice that is on the altar is bound by his oath."
Anna, who has more value, you blind ones? The Eucharist or the altar that makes the Eucharist sacred?
Imala, who swears by the altar, has sworn by it and by the thing above it, the whole!
And he swears by the temple, he swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.
And he swears by the sky, swears by the throne, and by Allah who sits on it.
Oh, you hypocrites of the Jewish scriptures and Pharisees! You pay the tithe on mint, dill, and cumin, but you have neglected the more important things of the law—justice, mercy, and faith. You should have done these without neglecting the others.
You lead people, you blind ones! You filter water for mosquitoes and swallow camels.
Welcome, you Jewish books and hypocritical Pharisees! You wash the cup and the plate from the outside, but inside they are full of greed and avarice.
O Pharisee, you blind one! First, wash the inside of the cup and the plate, so that from the outside it may become clean.
Oh, welcome, the books of the Jews and the hypocritical Pharisees! How the graves that are painted white, from the outside they look decorated, but from the inside they are full of dead bones and all sorts of things.
And when you grow up, from the outside you appear to people as righteous, but from the inside you are full of hypocrisy and evil.
Oh, the books of the Jews and the hypocritical Pharisees! You build in the graves of the prophets and adorn the domes of the righteous saints.
And they say, "Jina were present at the time of our ancestors, so we did not participate in the killing of the prophets."

You are right: the ungrateful ones, they all have to come to this generation!" Jesus' love for Jerusalem (Luke 13:34-35)
"O Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone the messengers sent to you! How often I wanted to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!"

And when I was sitting on Mount Olives, his students came to him and said, "Tell us when this thing will happen and what is the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered them, "Give them what they want, and don't let anyone deceive you."
A lot of people come to me in my name and say, "I am the Messiah!" and they are very wrong.

"Who is the trustworthy servant and knows how to behave and who will give them their food on time?"
Why does Haka al-Khadim return to Sido and find his servant serving him.
You are right: he should be in charge of all the properties.
But if this servant turned out to be evil, he would say to himself, "My master, let me go back home."
And he began to strike the other servants and eat and drink with the drunkards.
Sidoo, come back to us during the day, it comes to my mind at an hour I don't know.
"Let them cut it up and put it in the place where the hypocrites are going. And how will they cry and lament for years."
Like the Sabaya.
"The kingdom of heaven is like ten maidens who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom."
Five of them were fools and five knew how to behave.
When the fools shook their lanterns, they didn't shake the oil with them.
Those who know how to behave, shake their oil lamps with their lanterns.
And as the groom slept, everyone was overcome with sleep and fell asleep.
At midnight, they heard a shout: "The groom has arrived, let's go out to meet him!"
Brother, all the girls got up and lit their lanterns.
The ignorant said to those who knew how to behave: "Give us some of your oil money, so that our lamps can be extinguished."
Those who knew how to behave answered: "Maybe not to make us and you enough, go to those who sell oil and buy what you need."
And when they were about to leave, the groom arrived. They entered the house with him, where the wedding was taking place, and the door was locked.
And the bridegroom's other friends increased and said to the bridegroom: "Our lord, our lord, we have opened the door!"
He replied, "Your information is correct: I don't know you."
Imala, return home, for your sake, do not know neither today nor the hour." Like the parable of the money changers (Luke 19:11-27)
"Reaching the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who loves to travel, my friend, he called his servants and gave them money."
He gave each one according to their ability, one five gold bars, another two gold bars, and another one gold bar and left.
The five jars he took went well and he traded them, my friend, he earned five more jars.
I bought two boxes of candy, and I won two more.
A man took a sack, walked, dug in the ground, and hid the money of Sido.
After a long time, the master of the servants came back and counted them.
He went to the five jars, and brought five more jars, saying, "My lord, you gave me five jars, now I have won five more jars."
Saidou said, "I woke up, oh servant, oh Salah and oh Thika! I was Thika in a little, Hani so that we can get on the boat: enter the paradise of your master."
Well, the two of them played cards, and he won, and he said, "My lord, you gave me two cards, and now I have won two more."
Saidou said, "I woke up, oh servant, oh Salah and oh Thika! I was Thika in the small group, Hani so that we can get on the boat: enter the paradise of your master."
I took a handful of seeds and said, "My lord, I know you are a hard man, you reap what you did not sow, and you gather what you did not plant."
"Man, I was scared, so I walked away and hid your purse in the dirt, and that's your money."
Ahmad replied, "Oh servant, oh wicked one, and oh fool! I know that we reap what we did not sow and we gather what we did not plant."
You should have put my money in the bank, and we would have taken it back with interest.
He said to his servants, "Take the purse from him and give it to the one who has the ten purses."
He who has something, let him give it up and let him have a lot. But he who has nothing, even he who has something, let him give it up.
And the servant who has no use, throw him out into the darkness. And how can there be crying and the lamentations of the years."» On the Day of Judgment

"I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me."
At this time, the righteous will answer me: "O Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you a drink?"
And when did you see you strange and naked? Or when did you put on clothes?
"And when did you see you were sick and tied up and you visited me?"
And I, the king, replied to them: "Your transfer of rights every time you did this thing was also with one of my younger brothers, this time, you did it with me!"
And let me say to those on my left, "Take me away, you cursed ones, go to the fire that was prepared for Belis and his angels forever."
Rani, I was hungry and didn't eat, I was thirsty and didn't drink.
"And I was a stranger and not a native, naked and not clothed, sick and bound and not visited."

And I would answer them: "Your transfer is right every time you didn't do this thing with one of my younger brothers, this is not what you did with me, I am."
"So that the wicked may walk in torment forever, but the righteous may walk in eternal life."
The Jews tried to kill Jesus (Mark 14:1-2; Luke 22:1-2; John 11:45-53).
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he said to his disciples, "You know that after two days the Passover will begin, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."
"Do you know when Easter will come, so that it will be two days later, and I, the Son of Man, so that I will be handed over to be crucified?"
And at this time the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the house of Caiaphas, the high priest.
And they conferred with one another that they might by some stratagem bring Jesus under their power and kill him.
And they said, "We do not want to cause a disturbance during the feast." So she poured the perfume on Jesus' feet (Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8).
While he was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper, in Bethany.

When the students saw it, they cheated and said, "Why this waste?"
"This perfume used to cost a fortune, and it was given to the poor!"
And when Jesus knew this, he said unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? The damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying. And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise. And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment. And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.
The poor are always with you, but I can't always be with you.
And if she poured the perfume on my body, she would make me go to the grave.
You have the right: And how can he preach the gospel in the whole world, so that he can talk about his work with these women, so that people always remember her." Judas' betrayal (Mark 14:10-11; Luke 22:3-6)
This time, one of the twelve disciples, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
Ex 21:32; Zech 11:12 And he said to them, "What shall I give you, and what shall I do for you?" And they said to him, "Give us three score pieces of silver."
And from that time he began to seek opportunity to betray him. The Passover Supper with the Disciples (Mark 14:12-21; Luke 22:7-23; John 13:21-30)
And on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and said to him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
He said to them, "There is one in the city. Go and tell him, 'The teacher says, My time has come, so that we may eat the Passover meal with my disciples in your house.'"
And the disciples did as Jesus had instructed them and prepared the Passover meal.
In the evening, Jesus sat down to eat with his twelve disciples.
And while they were eating, Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
They were very sad and started saying to each other, "My God, is it me?"
"Tell them: 'The one who puts his hand in the dish with me is the one who will betray me.'"
# Psalm 41:9 I, the Son of Man, will die as it is written in the Holy Book, and woe to the man who betrays me! That man would be better off if he had never been born."
They asked Judas, "Who is it, Lord?" Jesus answered, "It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread." And when He had dipped the bread, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. (John 13:26) After the morsel, Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, "What you do, do quickly." (John 13:27) Now no one at the table knew why He had said this to him. For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus was saying, "Buy what we need for the Feast," or that he should give something to the poor. (John 13:28-29) So after he had taken the morsel, he went out immediately. And it was night. (John 13:30) Therefore, when He had received the morsel, he went out immediately. And it was night. (John 13:30) It is also written that the Lord, after He had given thanks, said, "Take, eat; this is My body." (1 Corinthians 11:24) And He took a cup, and when He had given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you; for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. (Matthew 26:26-28) But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom." (Matthew 26:29) And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. (Matthew 26:30)
And while they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
Take a cup, thank them, and say: "Drink from it all of you."
This is my blood, the blood of the covenant that was made for the sake of many, so that their sins may be forgiven.
We say to you: we will no longer drink from this grape juice until this day comes, and we will drink with you something new in Baba's kingdom."
And the disciples sang praises to the Lord and went up to the Mount of Olives. Jesus tells Peter to deny him (Mark 14:27-31; Luke 22:31-34; John 13:36-38).
# Zech 13:7; Jn 16:32 And Jesus said to them, "All of you will be offended because of me tonight, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'
After we rise from death, we will be ahead of you in the Garden of Eden."
Brother, Peter said, "Even if everyone leaves you, I will never leave you."
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
Peter said, "We will never deny you, even if we have to die with you." And all the disciples said the same. Jesus prayed in Gethsemane (Mark 14:32-42; Luke 22:39-46).
And Jesus and his disciples went to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
And Peter and the sons of Zebedee shook hands with him, and he began to feel sad and worried in his heart.
This time, he told them, "I feel my soul is very sad, almost to death. Wait here and stay awake."
And he prayed over them, then he fell on their backs and prayed: "O Father, if it is possible, take this cup away from me. But let it be what you want, not what I want."
He went back to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, "My friends, can't you keep awake with me for one hour?
"Stay awake and pray so that you don't have an experience. The soul wants to be strong, but the body is weak."
And again he prayed, saying: "O Father, if this cup cannot be taken away from me, and I must drink it, let your will be done, not my will."
He went back and found them lying down, because they couldn't shake their heads due to the sleep.
The Imam left again and after he prayed for the third time, he resumed speaking.
Mubaa'id came to the students and said to them, "Brothers, are you still sleeping and resting? This hour has come and I, the Son of Man, am about to be handed over to the hands of the sinners."
Come on, let's go! Who's going to betray me?" Jesus' arrest (Mark 14:43-50; Luke 22:47-53; John 18:3-12)
And while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, and with him was a large crowd with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Wali Khan gave them a sign, and said, "Whoever touches this, that's him, take him!"
And as they walked along, Jesus said to him, "Peace, teacher!" And he kissed him.
They said to Jesus, "My friend, we have come to do the thing that we have been sent to do." At that time they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized him.
And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice; and he fell on his face at his feet, giving him thanks.
And at this time, Jesus said, "Return your sword to its place. Those who take up the sword will perish by the sword."
Hey, what's going on in your head? I don't think we should ask Dad, and at the same time, he sends me more than 2000 angel soldiers?
"So how can the holy books that say this thing is necessary be true?"
Jesus said to the people: "My brother, they have made me a criminal. I came with swords and clubs? Every day we sat and taught in the temple, and you did not arrest me."
"But this thing happened so that the Scripture would be fulfilled which is written in the prophets." At that time the disciples were alone and fled. Jesus was in the council of the Jews (Mark 14:53-65; Luke 22:54-55, 63-71; John 18:13-14, 19-24).
And they led Jesus away to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders of the Jews had gathered.
Peter followed from a distance until he reached the middle of the house of the chief priest. He went inside and sat with the guards to see what would happen.
And the chief priests and the scribes were in the council, and all of them were looking for someone to testify against Jesus falsely, so that they might kill him.
So how did we do it, despite so many people coming forward and testifying falsely. And then two people came forward as witnesses.
They said, "This man said, 'I will destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
The highest of the chief priests said, "Brother, what do you have to say? Brother, what do you hear from these men, how can they testify against you?"
But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us: Are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
Jesus said, "You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power of God and coming on the clouds of heaven!"
The top priest, Dabshou, cut his head and said, "Rahu is blasphemy! My friend, we still need witnesses? Here, you just heard it as blasphemy."
"Who ordered him?" They answered, "He must die!"
And they spat on him and struck him with their fists, and some of them struck him.
They said, "Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?" Peter denies Jesus (Mark 14:66-72; Luke 22:56-62; John 18:15-18, 25-27)
And at this time, while Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, a servant girl came to him and said, "You were also with Jesus the Galilean!"
Ahma stood in front of them all and said, "I don't really understand what you mean."
And when he went out to the outer gate, another servant saw him and said to those who were there, "This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth!"
Peter denied it again, swearing, "I don't know the man!"
A little distance away, the people who were present came and said to Peter, "By the truth, you are one of them, on your account you speak like them!"
This time he began to swear and shake his head, "I don't know this man." And at that moment, the Sardok spoke.
And Peter remembered Jesus' words, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And Peter went out and wept bitterly.
Jesus before Pilate (Mark 15:1; Luke 23:1-2; John 18:28-32)
In the morning, the priests and the elders of the people all agreed on Jesus to kill him.
And they took him, and when they had led him away, they took him to Pilate the governor. And it came to pass, that when Judas, which betrayed him, saw that he was condemned, he repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that. And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself. And the chief priests, when they had received the pieces of silver, said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value; And they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me. And Judas, which betrayed him, stood also with them. (Acts 1:18-19)
And when Judas, who betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
He said to them, "I committed a sin, I sold the blood of an innocent man." They said to him, "We don't care. Take care of yourself."
He threw the silver into the temple and went out, and he walked with his head down.
The chief priests scoffed at the silver and said, "It is not right to put this into the treasury, since it is the price of blood."
Imalla, they didn't understand and they bought the land from the pottery seller so that they could make a cemetery and bury the Brainians there.
This is why the people of Sania call it Sania al-Dam to this day.
# Zech 11:12-13; Jer 32:6-15; 18:2-3; Haka, the thing that the prophet Jeremiah said: "They shook the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the one they were told by the people of Israel, the price of a man."
And gave them permission to buy a stonecutter. Whatever the Lord has commanded me." Pilate asks Jesus (Mark 15:2-5; Luke 23:3-5; John 18:33-38)
And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."
But when the chief priests and elders accused him, he answered nothing.
And the centurion said to Pilate, "Sir, I have not had to deal with such a thing before. How do you want them to testify against you?"
They could not get any answer from him, so the governor was greatly amazed. The verdict: Jesus must die (Mark 15:6-15; Luke 23:13-25; John 18:39-19:16).
And every Eid, the governor would leave for the people one of the m'rabet they love.
And at that time, there was a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
And when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release to you: Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
On his mind, he knew why they had handed him over because of jealousy.

And a group of the scribes of the Jews were with the people, and they began to reason in their hearts:
"Does this man talk like this? He's blaspheming! Who but God alone can forgive sins?"
And Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?
