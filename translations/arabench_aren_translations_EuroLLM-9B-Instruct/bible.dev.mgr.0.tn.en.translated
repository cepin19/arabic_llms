And Salmon begat Boaz by Rahab. And Boaz begat Obed by Ruth. And Obed begat Jesse.
Ussia begot Jotham; and Jotham begot Ahaz; and Ahaz begot Hezekiah. After this, Hezekiah begot Manasseh from the woman he had taken from Uriah.

And Asa begat Jehoshaphat. And Jehoshaphat begat Joram. And Joram begat Ahaziah.
Uzziah begat Jotham. Jotham begat Ahaz. Ahaz begat Hezekiah.
Hezekiah begat Manasseh. Manasseh begat Amon. Amon begat Josiah.

And after the time of their exile in Babylon was over, they were called Jebusites. And Shelah was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zorobabel begat Abihued. And Abihued begat Eliashib. And Eliashib begat Joazar. And Joazar begat Jonathan. And Jonathan begat Jaddua. And Jaddua begat Jonathan. And Jonathan begat Azor.
And Azor begat Sadoc. And Sadoc begat Achim. And Achim begat Eliud.
Alyod gave Alyeazar. Alyeazar gave Matan. Matan gave Yaakov.
And Jacob brought Joseph, Mary's husband, who gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
And from the descent of Abraham to the descent of David are fourteen generations; and from the descent of David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations. The birth of Jesus Christ: when his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit. (Luke 1:26-38)
And how was Jesus Christ born: At the time Mary, his mother, was betrothed to a man named Joseph, and before they were married, she conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit.
Brother, Yusuf decided to break up with her without exposing her, because he was a man who feared God.
He still dwells in the story, it appeared to him an angel from the Lord in a dream, and said: "O Joseph, son of David, do not fear to marry Mary. She is pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit."
And you will give him the name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."
And all this happened so that the words that the Lord said through the Prophet who said:
# Isa 7:14 The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel" (which means "God with us").
And when Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did as the angel who came from the Lord had said, and he took her to his home.
We did not sleep with her until she gave birth to a child, and he called him Jesus.

When Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They said, "The king of the Jews, where was he born? We saw his star in the east, so we came to worship him."
And when Herod the king heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
And the chief priests and scribes of the Jews had all of them, and asked them about the place where the Christ would be born.
They replied: "In Bethlehem, which is in the Judean region, because of what the prophet wrote in the book:
# 5:2 And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.”
Walee 'Ayt Herod for the wise men without hearing anyone and confirmed from them on the time when the star appeared.
And he sent them ahead to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and make sure of the child. And when you find him, come back and tell me so that I may go and worship him also."
After they heard the words of King Mocha, and when they were on their way, the star they saw in the east before them began to move ahead of them until it stopped and stood above the place where the child was.
And when they saw the star, they were very glad.
They entered the house and found the child with Mary's mother. My brother, they dismounted their horses and prostrated themselves, and they opened their bags and put in them gold, incense, and myrrh.
And their father was warned in a dream not to return to Herod, so he took another route and went to his own country. Escape to Egypt
And after the wise men left, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up! Take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Brother, Yusuf got up, shook the baby, and went to Egypt at night.
# 11:1; Exodus 4:22 and he stayed there until Herod's death, so that what the Lord had spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, "Out of Egypt I have called my son." The two boys were killed in Bethlehem
And when Herod saw that the wise men had tricked him, he became very angry and ordered the killing of all the little children in Bethlehem and its surroundings who were two years old and under, according to the time the wise men had told him.
Brother, it is the thing that the prophet Jeremiah said:
# Jer 31:15 "In Ramah they heard a voice, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be comforted for her children, because they were no more." Return from Egypt to Nazareth.
And when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, "Arise, take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the young child's life are dead."
"They said, 'O people! Shake the baby and its mother and return to the land of Israel, for the sake of those who were killed because they wanted to kill him.'"
Brother, he stood up, shook the baby, and went back to the land of Israel.
When he heard that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as king of Judea, he was afraid to go back there. But God warned him in a dream, so he went to the district of Galilee.
He walked to a city called Nazareth and lived there so that what the prophets said would come true: "So that he would be called a Nazarene."
The Gospel of John the Baptist (Mark 1:1-8; Luke 3:1-18; John 1:19-28)
And in those days, John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He says, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near!"
Isaiah 40:3 And this is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke, saying, "A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"

And the people were walking from Jerusalem and all Judea and the regions around the Jordan.
They confess their sins, and they are in the valley of the Jordan.
And when he saw a lot of Pharisees and Sadducees coming to him to be baptized, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"

He shakes the sheaf in his hand, sifts the grain in the hall, gathers the wheat in the granary, and the chaff he burns with a fire that will not go out." John baptizes Jesus (Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21-22)
Jesus came from the region of Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
And John also said, "I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?"
And Jesus answered, "Let it be just this way, for in this way we will fulfill all the good things." And John agreed.
And when Jesus was baptized, the heavens opened and the Holy Spirit descended like a dove and rested upon him.
And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."

And the Spirit drove Jesus out into the wilderness that He be tested by the devil.
Brother, he fasted for forty days and forty nights until he was starving.
"Go and have them try it," he said. "If you are the Son of God, tell this man to make bread from this stone."

And they threw stones at the Holy City, and they stood on the edge of the roof of the Temple.
# Psalm 91:11-12 And they said, "You are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written in the Holy Scriptures: 'He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'"

And he left and went away, and the angels came and ministered unto him. Jesus preached in Galilee (Mark 1:14-15; Luke 4:14-15).
And when Jesus heard that, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.
And he went out of Nazareth, and came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali:
Let it be as the prophet Isaiah said:
# Isa 9:1-2 The land of Naphtali and the land of Zebulun, by the sea, by the way of the Jordan, Galilee of the nations!
The people who were in the darkness saw a great light, and those who were in the shadow of the land of death, the light shone upon them.
And from that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. And he called the disciples, and began to send them forth by two and two; Mark 1:16-20; Luke 5:1-11.
And Jesus was walking by the sea of Galilee, and he saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
He said to them, "Follow me and I will make you fishers of men."
And when they had emptied their nets, they followed him.
He was walking along the sea and saw two other brothers, James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were mending their nets in the boat with their father Zebedee, and called them.
And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples. And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth. Give us day by day our daily bread. And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil. (Luke 6:17-19)
Jesus's home in the whole Galilee region teaches in their synagogues, preaches the gospel of the kingdom of God, and heals all the diseases and ailments of the people.
The news is published in all of Syria. And the patients, who have crossed the threshold of all kinds of diseases and afflictions, and their residents, the crippled and the paralyzed, oh my God, heal them.
And a lot of people followed him from Galilee and the region called the Ten Cities and Jerusalem and Judea and the region on the other side of the Jordan.
Sermon on the Mount (Luke 6:20-23)
Jesus called the people to him and went up on the mountain with his disciples.
And he began to teach them, saying:
"Poor souls, may they be healthy! May they enter the kingdom of heaven."
Peace be upon the mourners! Let them be comforted.
Good health to the good people! May the earth be their inheritance.
Health to the hungry and thirsty for justice! Let them be satiated.
Health to those who show mercy! May they be shown mercy.
Peace be upon those whose hearts are pure! May they see the face of Allah.
Health to them to reconcile people! They are God's children so let them be named.
Health to those who suffer for the sake of truth! May the kingdom of heaven take them.
Health to you. People will mock you, torture you, and say empty words about you. They will talk about me!
Rejoice and leap for joy, for your reward in heaven is great. For this is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you." Salt and light (Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34-35)
"You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt loses its taste, how can its flavor be restored? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled underfoot by people."
You are the light of the world. There is no city built on a mountain that is not seen.
And there is one who lights a lantern and puts it under a bowl, just as he puts it in a high place and shines it on the house so that everyone in the house can see it.
Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” The Law
"What's on your mind? I came to fulfill the law and the prophets, I didn't come to abolish them, I came to complete them."
You are right: until the sky and the earth, not a single letter or point of the law will be moved until everything is done.
Whoever does not obey even the least of these commandments and teaches others to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever obeys them and teaches them to do so will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

Aman, I will tell you: whoever hits his brother, the court must judge him, and he must say to his brother: "You fool, the council of Jews must judge you," and he must say to his brother: "You beast, you must enter hell."
Emal, when you kill me, you offer your sacrifice on the altar and remember the one you have a problem with your brother.
Leave your sacrifice in front of the altar and go first to reconcile with your brother, then separate from him and offer your sacrifice.
If one complains about you, you and him should reconcile. If not, kill him. Then go to the court, so he won't complain to the judge, and the judge will talk to the police officer, and you will be imprisoned.
You are right: don't leave until you finish the last millimeter." Adultery
Exodus 20:14; Deuteronomy 5:18 "You have heard that it was said to your ancestors, 'You shall not commit adultery.'
Aman, I will take you to anyone who wants her and desires her, he has sex with her in his heart.

If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away, for it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell." Divorce (Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11-12; Luke 16:18)
# 24:1-4 "And the husband said, 'Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.'"
"So I'm telling you: anyone who divorces his wife for a reason other than adultery is causing her to commit adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman is committing adultery."
# 19:12; Num 30:2; Deut 23:21 "And you have heard the admonition to your fathers: 'Do not swear falsely, but keep your oaths to the Lord.'"
Amen, I swear to you, do not swear by everything, not by the sky for the sake of God's throne.

What salary do you deserve if you love those who love you? My friend, don't those who evade taxes do this thing?
And what is the reason for them to do this to you if they did not surrender? Is it that those who do not know God would do this thing?
You must be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect."
Charity
"They will repay you by making you look good in front of people, so they can see you, you will not have any reward from your father in heaven."
When you give to someone, don't blow the trumpet like the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that people will praise them. I tell you the truth: they have already received their reward.
And you, when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.

And when you pray, enter your house, and pray to your Lord, who does not see. Your Lord who sees in secret, so that He may reward you.
And if you don't stop talking nonsense, the other nations will not listen to you, for they are not concerned with what God hears, so they will say a lot of things.
Don't be like them, because you know what they need before you ask for it.
Hallowed be thy name.
Let your kingdom come, let your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Every day we gave our bread, which was enough for us.
Forgive us our sins, no matter how we forgive those who wrong us.
We did not enter into an experiment, and from evil we were saved.

Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." The Light of the Body (Luke 11:34-36)
"The eye is the lighthouse of the body. If your eye is healthy, your body will be full of light."

If God wears cannabis like this, despite cannabis growing today and tomorrow to be thrown into the fire of the oven, how much more should you wear it, whose faith is weak!
This is why we don't think and say: What to eat? What to drink? What to wear?
These needs are for all people, even those who are not believers, and only He in the heavens knows what you need from them.
But you first must enter the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and these things will be added to you.
This is why we don't pray for tomorrow, tomorrow's day is enough to pray for his soul. Every day is enough for the evil he has."

Why do you see the straw in your friend's eye, but not the plank in your own?
And how can you say to your friend: "Let me point out the straw in your eye" and then say that your friend's eye is a painting?
O hypocrite! Take the painting out of your eye first, and then you will see the beam and remove the straw from your brother's eye.
Do not give what is holy to dogs and do not throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn to attack you." Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you." (Luke 11:9-13)
"Ask and take, seek and receive, knock and it will open for you."
Rahu, everyone who asks takes, everyone who seeks finds, and everyone who knocks is answered.
Who among you would ask for a child in bread, he gives him a room.

Neither a beautiful tree bears a disappointing yield, nor a disappointing tree bears a beautiful yield.

Brother, get up and go to the doctor.
And when the people saw what had happened, they feared, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men. Jesus gave to Matthew (Mark 2:13-17; Luke 5:27-32).
And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. He said to him, "Follow me." So he arose and followed him.
When Jesus was in the house of Matthew, eating, a large crowd of people who were tax collectors and sinners came and sat with Jesus and his disciples.
And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
# It is 6:6, go and learn what this verse means: "We love mercy, not sacrifice." And I have come to call the sinners, not the righteous." Fasting (Mark 2:18-22; Luke 5:33-39)
John's disciples came to Jesus and said, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them, "Those who are invited to the wedding feast should not mourn, for the bridegroom is still with them. When the bridegroom is taken away from them, then they will fast."
What if someone patches an old garment with new cloth, so that the cloth can absorb and eat the old garment and the cut will be bigger.
And no one would put new wine into old wineskins, or the skins would burst, the wine would run out, and the skins would be ruined. Instead, they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved." The little girl lived, and the woman who had been possessed by the demon was healed (Mark 5:21-43; Luke 8:40-56).
When Jesus was speaking to them, one of the leaders of the Jews came and knelt before him and said, "My daughter has just died. Come and put your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus stood up, and followed him, and his disciples.
There was a woman who had been bleeding for 10 years, she came from the village of Debshu and touched the edge of the cloth.
For her sake, she said in her heart, "Namslu Dbshw Brk Too Ntshfai."
Jesus's house and its lantern said to her, "My daughter, your faith has healed you." And at once she was well.
And when Jesus arrived at the Jewish leader's house and saw the crowd humming in the courtyard and people making a commotion,
He said, "Get away! The structure is not dead, it's just lying down."
And when the worshippers left, he entered and grabbed the structure from her hand, oh brother, she stood up.
The news about this thing is published in this place, which is the whole place. Jesus heals two blind men.
And as Jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When I entered the house, the two blind men came to Jesus. Jesus asked them, "My friends, what do you want me to do for you?" They replied, "Lord, grant us the ability to see."
A shareholder of Jesus looked at them and said, "Let it be done to you according to your faith."
Their eyes were opened. Jesus warned them, "Tell no one!"
They went out and spread the news of it throughout that whole region. Jesus heals a man who was blind.
And when the two blind men were outside, there was a group of Jabulani people who were dancing, living like demons.
Jesus, Satan, and Bakoush left and continued to speak. People were amazed and said, "We have never seen anything like this in Israel!"
And the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons." Jesus had compassion on the people.
Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
When I saw the people, they were worried and troubled about the sheep that didn't have a shepherd.
He said to his students: "The injury is a bit, just like the harvest is a bit."
"Imalah, do not ask the Lord of the Sabeans to send servants of the Sabeans for his belongings."
Athanasius the Apostle (Mark 3:13-19; Luke 6:12-16)
And he called to Athanasius, a disciple, and gave them authority over the expelled spirits to cast them out and to heal people of all diseases and hunger.
And these are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew, James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John, Philippians 2:25-30
Phillips, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
And Simon who betrayed his country, and Judas Iscariot who was to betray Jesus. Jesus sent the twelve apostles (Mark 6:7-13; Luke 9:1-6).
Jesus sent the twelve out, instructing them: "Do not go to any Gentile territory, and do not enter any Samaritan city."
Amen, go and look for the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
And when you see it happening, proclaim: "The kingdom of heaven is near."

What shakes neither gold nor silver nor copper in your belts.
No saraw, no two pairs of socks, no sandals, no stick, for the sake of the servants, it is worth eating.
And any city or village you enter, look for someone who deserves that you enter their house and stay with them until you leave.
And when you enter the house, greet the people in it.
And if the people of this house deserve it, let your greeting come to them, but if they don't deserve it, your greeting is for you to return.
And if anyone does not accept you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet and go out, neither into this house nor into this city.
You are right: the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment will be better than the fate of this city!" The persecution that will take place (Mark 13:9-13; Luke 21:12-17)

The father should surrender his son to death, and the son should kill his parents, and the children should go after their parents and kill them.

And when they persecute you in this city, flee to another. For truly I say to you, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.
The student is not the greatest unless his teacher is, and the servant is not the greatest unless his master is.
"It is enough for the student to be like his teacher and the servant like his master. If the master of the house had called him Beelzebub, what would his family call them?" Fear of the Lord (Luke 12:2-7)
"Don't be afraid of them. There is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing concealed that will not be known."
And tell them in the darkness, tell them in the light. And if they tell you in whispers in your ears, shout it from the rooftops.
And do not fear when they kill the body, and do not think that they can kill the soul, as they fear when He is able to destroy both the soul and the body in hell.

Iman, if you acknowledge me in front of people, we acknowledge you in front of the Lord in heaven.
"But whoever denies me before men, I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven." Jesus and the World (Luke 12:51-53; 14:26-27)
"What's on your mind, I came to bring peace to the land, I didn't come to bring peace but to bring a sword."
We can easily distinguish between a boy and his father, a girl and her mother, and a daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law.
And the enemies of man are to be his wishes.
He who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. And he who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
And he who does not carry his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
He who loses his life for my sake will find it. He who gains his life will lose it. (Mark 9:36-41)
"He who accepts you accepts me, and he who accepts me accepts the one who sent me."
The one who accepts a prophet on his mind so that he may receive the reward of a prophet. And the one who accepts a barber on his mind so that he may receive the reward of a barber.
"And he will not give one of these little ones even a cup of cold water on the head of my disciple, you are right, he is a worker who will not be lost."
Disciples of John the Baptist (Luke 7:18-35)
And when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan. And large multitudes followed him, and he healed them there. And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?" tempting him. And he answered and said, "What did Moses command you?" They said, "Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce, and to send her away." Jesus said to them, "Because of the hardness of your hearts, he wrote you this commandment. But from the beginning of the creation, 'God made them male and female.' For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh, so that they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate."
And John heard in prison the works of Christ, and sent two of his disciples,
They said, "You are the one who is coming, and we don't need another one?"
Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you have heard and seen:
# Isa 35:5-6; 61:1; Luke 4:18-19 The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise, the poor have the gospel preached to them.
And what's wrong with him that he doesn't even doubt it!"
When the disciples of John had died, Jesus began to tell the people about John, and he said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
What did you go out to see? To see a man wearing expensive clothes? The ones who wear expensive clothes are in the palaces of kings!
What did you go out to see? To see a prophet? Yes, and I tell you: greater than a prophet.
# Mal 3:1; Mark 1:2 This is what is written in the Bible: "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you."
Your translation is correct: "You have not brought forth one greater than John the Baptist, but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
From the days of John the Baptist until today, the kingdom of heaven is advancing with power, and the strong people are drawn to it.
All the prophets and the Torah prophesied until the coming of John the Baptist.
And if you want to donate, he is the one who will come.
He who has ears, let him hear!
What does this generation look like? It's like kids standing in the marketplace and throwing things at each other.
Zamranakum wa ma shatkhtosh, wa noohanakum wa ma bkitoosh.
John the Baptist neither ate nor drank, and they said, "He has a demon."
"When I, the Son of Man, come to eat and drink, you say, 'What a gluttonous man! What a drunkard! A friend of tax collectors and sinners!' But wisdom is vindicated by her deeds." The towns where he did not do these things did not repent. (Luke 10:13-15)
And Jesus began to rebuke the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent.
"Woe to you, O Tyre! Woe to you, O daughter of Sidon! If the great miracles that you work in your midst were done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, and put on sackcloth and sat in ashes."
So that I can convey to you: the situation in the cities of Tyre and Sidon will be better than your situation on the Day of Judgment.
And you, O Kafr Naḥḥām! O brother, how can you look up to the sky? You must descend to the abyss. Because if the great miracles that were performed in you were performed in the city of Sodom, they would still be there today.
"And I tell you, it will be more tolerable on that day for Sodom than for that city." Jesus rejoiced (Luke 10:21-22).
Jesus spoke at that time and said, "We thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for hiding these things from the wise and the intelligent and revealing them to little children."
Yes, Papa, this is your will.
Papa gave me everything. Even one who didn't know the son was the father, and even one who didn't know the father was the son, and everyone chose the son to show them.
Eyguli, you guys are tired and your load is heavy, and I want to relieve you.

"My pregnancy is not serious and my baby is light."
Saturday (Mark 2:23-28; Luke 6:1-5)
At this time, Jesus had passed through the middle of the wheat field on Saturday, and his disciples were hungry. They began to pluck the ears and eat.
And when they saw this, the Pharisees said to him, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
# I Sam 21:1-6; Num 24:9 Jesus said to them, "My brothers, have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry, and how he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for him to eat nor for those with him, but only for the priests?
How did he enter the house of God, and the bread of the sacrifice, which I did not eat, was it not lawful for him and those with him, just as it was lawful for the priests to eat it?
# Verse 28:9-10 O people, have you not read in the Torah how the priests in the Temple on the Sabbath break the Sabbath commandment and yet no one blames them?
Here is the translation: "And I tell you: there is one here who is greater than the temple."
# It is 6:6; Matt 9:13. If you knew what this verse means: "We love mercy, not sacrifice." Then you wouldn't condemn those who don't get along.
Rani "Anna, the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath." The man with the withered hand is healed (Mark 3:1-6; Luke 6:6-11).
And Jesus walked to this place and entered their synagogue.
The next day, there was a man with a crippled hand. People asked him, "Brother, is it permissible for a person to be healed on Saturday?" So that they may find something to accuse him of.
Jesus said to them, "Whoever of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."
And man has more value than the jinn! Is that why it is permissible to do good on Saturday?
And Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand!" And the man stretched it out, and it was restored, whole as the other.
And the Pharisees went out and began to plot against him, as to how they might kill him. Jesus was the servant whom God had chosen.
Jesus knew this and went to that place. A lot of people followed him and he healed them all.
And ordered them not to inform anyone about him.
And this thing happened so that what the prophet Isaiah said would be fulfilled:
Isaiah 42:1-4: My servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased, I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations. He will not cry or lift his voice, or cause his voice to be heard in the street. A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out. In faithfulness he will bring forth justice. He will not grow faint or be discouraged till he has established justice in the earth; and the coastlands will wait for his teaching.
Urk doesn't work and doesn't bark, and no one on the streets even hears his voice.
A stubborn disease doesn't break it, and a smoking wick doesn't extinguish it. Even a soft one lets the truth prevail.
And the people should have hope in his name. Jesus and Beelzebub (Mark 3:20-30; Luke 11:14-23; 12:10)
And this time, a blind man named Jobulu and a demon-possessed man came. Jesus healed them and they began to speak and see.
And all the people were amazed and said, "Is this the son of David?"
And when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This fellow casts out demons only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he said to them, "Any kingdom divided against itself will fall, and any city or household divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil casts out the devil, how can his kingdom stand?
And if Anna and I go out in the streets with Baalzebub, how will your students go out with them? That's why they will judge you.
But if we go out to the beaches in the spirit of God, then the kingdom of God will rule over you.
And how can someone enter a strong man's house and break his tiles, unless the strong man's hand is first, and only then can he break the things in his house?
He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.
This is why we are being sent, the sins of people and their unbelief so that they may be forgiven, but unbelief in the Holy Spirit is not forgiven.
And anyone who says a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come." The Tree and Its Fruit (Luke 6:43-45)
"Either let the tree be beautiful and its fruit beautiful. Or let the tree be wretched and its fruit wretched. The tree is known by its fruit."
Yaw lawlad al-Lafa'i, kayfa tana'jumma taqulou kalam bahi wa entoma ashara? Raho al-lisan yantaqou bali fi al-qalb.
The beautiful person brings out the beautiful needs from the beautiful heart, and the disappointed person brings out the disappointed needs from the disappointed heart.
You are being told: every empty word people say will be accounted for on the day of reckoning.
"By your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned." The Pharisees asked for a sign (Mark 8:11-12; Luke 11:29-32).
At that time, some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Jesus, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
He replied, "An evil, adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
# Jon 1:17 And as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
# Jon 3:5 May the people of Nineveh rise up against this generation on the day of judgment and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
# I Kings 10:1-10; II Chronicles 9:1-12; and the Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here!" The Spirit returning to the departed (Luke 11:24-26)
"When a person's soul is exhaled, it wanders to places without water, seeking rest, until it finds a place to rest."
This time he says, "Let's go back to my house that I left." And when he goes back, he finds it empty, cleaned, and organized.
Yule walks and takes with him seven other spirits, more wicked than he, and they enter this man and dwell in him, and his condition becomes worse than it was before. And that is why he grows worse in this evil generation." Jesus and his brothers (Mark 3:31-35; Luke 8:19-21)
And while Jesus was still talking to the people, his mother and his brothers came and stood outside, wanting to speak with him.
One said, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, they want to talk to you."
And he replied to the man who spoke to him: "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"
He held out his hand to his students and said, "Ah, my mother and my brothers."
"Rahu, anyone who does the will of the Lord in heaven is my brother, sister, and mother."
Like the farmer (Mark 4:1-9; Luke 8:4-8)
And Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the sea.
And a lot of people gathered around him, until he appeared in Flouka, and all the people stood on the shore.
And they told many things in proverbs: "The farmer went out to plant."
And while he was planting, a seed fell into the cleft, and the birds came and ate it.
Another seed fell on a rocky ground with no soil, but it grew because of the little soil it had.
When the sun came out, it was burned and dried up because it had no veins.
Another seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it.
Another seed fell on good soil and produced a crop, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.
"He who has ears, let him hear!" Why Jesus spoke in parables (Mark 4:10-12; Luke 8:9-10)
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and said to him, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
"And he answered them, 'You are given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.'"
He who has, so that he may give more and have plenty. But he who has nothing, even the little he has, so that he may survive.
This is why I speak to them in parables, so they may not see or hear or understand.
# Isa 6:9-10; Mark 8:18; John 12:39-41; Acts 28:26-27. In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says: "You will hear but never understand, and you will see but never perceive."
This people's hearts are numb, and they are drunk, and their minds are blinded, and their eyes are closed, so that they do not see with their eyes, and they do not hear with their ears, and they do not understand with their hearts, and they return to me so that I may heal them.
But you, for the sake of your eyes, see, and for the sake of your ears, hear.
"You have it right: many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it." Interpretation of the Parable of the Sower (Mark 4:13-20; Luke 8:11-15)
"Don't listen to what they mean by a farmer like this:
When anyone hears the word of the kingdom of God and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches what was sown in his heart. This is what is sown along the path.
And he who sows in the earth where there is a stone, he who hears the word and at once receives it with joy:
But since He has no veins inside, He will endure a little and when the time of hardship and persecution for the sake of the Word comes, He will fall.
And he that soweth in the midst of the thorns, the same is he that heareth the word, and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.
"And the one who is sown on the good ground, this is the one who hears the word and understands it. And he bears fruit and produces: some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty." (Matthew 13:23)
And Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
When the people were asleep, the enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.
And when the seedlings had grown and produced wheat, the weeds also came up.
The servants of the Lord of the Earth came and said to him, "Our Lord, did you not sow good seed in your land? Then where did the weeds come from?"
He said to them, "One of my enemies has done this." They said to him, "Do you not want us to go and gather the weeds?"
He said, "No, don't reap the wheat and kill them, you'll get entangled in the weeds."
"Let the wheat and the weeds grow together until the harvest, and at that time we will tell the reapers to gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but to gather the wheat and put it into my barns.""» Like the mustard seed and the yeast (Mark 4:30-32; Luke 13:18-19).
And he gave them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field, which indeed is the least of all the seeds; but when it is grown it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches."
She is the smallest of all the seedlings, and when I grew up, I was not the largest of all the greenery, and not a tree, to the extent that the birds of the sky come and nest in it."
Another parable he said, "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened."
This is what Jesus said to the people in parables. He would not tell them anything except in parables.
# Psalm 78:2 This was to fulfill what the prophet said: “I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.” Interpretation of the Parable of the Tares
This time Jesus left the people and entered the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds."
"Tell them: 'The one who sows the beautiful seed is I, the Son of Man.'"
And the sowing is the world, and the good seed is the children of the kingdom of God, and the tares are the children of the wicked one.
The enemy who planted them is Belial, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels.
And just as the darnel is gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of time.
Anna Ibn Al-Insan bash nabeshal malayka mata'i, wahu ma bash yalmu al-mufsidun wali ya'malu fi al-sharr malmal-malakuta mata'i.
They will throw them into the middle of the fire, which will cause them to cry and weep for years.
And in this time, the righteous shall shine like the sun in the kingdom of Buwam. Let him who has ears hear!" Like the treasure, the diamond, and the net.
"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure buried in a field, a man found it, he hid it, and with the joy he went and sold everything he had and bought this field."
The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant who searches for precious pearls.
Like a precious piece of gold, he walked and sold everything he had and bought it.
The kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and gathered up every kind of fish.
When they were tired, the fishermen took the fish to the shore, sat down, and put the good fish in boxes, and threw the bad one away.
And how it will happen at the end of time: the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous.
They will throw them into the middle of the fire, and the one who goes will cry and weep for years." The new and the old.
Jesus said to his disciples, "Brothers, do you understand this parable?" They said, "Yes, Lord."
He said to them, "This is why every scribe who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure new and old things."
And as Jesus finished this parable, He went away from there.
And when the people of the town began to learn about them in the gathering, they were amazed and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these miracles?"
Hey, isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother named Mary? And aren't his brothers named James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
"Are all his girlfriends here with us? How did this guy get this thing, the whole thing?"
And they were accusing him. Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house."
And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith in him.
The death of John the Baptist (Mark 6:14-29; Luke 9:7-9)
This time, King Herod heard the news about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist risen from the dead; and therefore he has power to work miracles."
Before Herod, John was arrested and put in prison because of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother.
For John's sake, they said, "You had to take it."
And love kills them, because the people were afraid of them, they thought John was a prophet.
When it was Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced at the party and Herod was impressed.
This is why she promised and swore to give her anything she asked for.
As her mother's advisor, she said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter!"
The king was sad, as he had to break the thing he had promised, because of the oath he had sworn to the guests.
And Shacun sent John's head to prison.
They put his head in a plate and gave it to the woman, oh brother, they shook his head for his mother.
And the disciples of John, mocking the corpse, buried it, and went and told Jesus. Jesus sent out five thousand men (Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-14).
When Jesus heard this, he left that place and went to a deserted area near the town of Bethsaida. As the people heard about him, they followed him on foot from the city.
Khubbat Malfouka saw many people, brother, he cared for them and cured their illnesses.
In the evening, Jawa's students said to him, "It's night, and this place is empty, send people to go to the villages and buy something to eat."
Jesus said, "They don't need to go. Give them something to eat."
They said, "We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish."
Jesus said, "Bring them here to me."
And he ordered the people to sit on the grass, and take the five loaves and the two fish, and he raised his eyes to heaven, and blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
And they all ate and were filled. And they shook out a sack full of leftovers.
And the people who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children. Jesus walked on the water (Mark 6:45-52; John 6:15-21).
And exactly, he orders his students to go out to the lake and precede him to the opposite side of the lake so that he can send people to go.
After the people sent the soul, he went up the mountain to pray. After the sun set, he went back home.
At this time, the felucca was far from the shore and the waves were overwhelming it, because the wind was against it.
Before dawn, Jesus came walking on the water.
But the students were afraid and when they saw him walking on water, they said, "This is a fantasy!" And they began to shout out of fear.
And Jesus spoke to them at once, saying, "Take heart; it is I, do not be afraid!"
Peter replied, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water."
Jesus said, "Eiga." Peter came out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus.
As the wind vane was strong, he was afraid, my brother started to drown, and he cried out: "Oh God, save me!"
At that time, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "What do you lack in faith?"
And they went out in the felucca with the wind blowing.
In Phylace, they said, "By the truth, you are the Son of God!" Jesus heals people with many diseases (Mark 6:53-56)
Jesus and his disciples came to the area of Genesaret.
And when the people of this country knew about Jesus, they spread the news about him in this whole region and brought all the sick people to him.
They asked him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak. And as they touched him, everyone was healed.
The traditions of the elders (Mark 7:1-13)
The Pharisees and the scribes who came from Jerusalem to Jesus said, "
"Why don't your students respect the customs of the elderly? And why don't they wash their hands before eating?"
"Answer them: 'Why do you not obey the command of Allah and follow your own desires?'"
Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16; Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9 "Honor your father and your mother, and whoever curses father or mother shall surely die."
And you say if someone says to his father or mother, "What I was helping you with, I gave it to God, he doesn't need to honor his father."
And you have attributed to Allah falsehood with your oaths, after your words.
O hypocrites, Isaiah prophesied your death and said of you:
Isaiah 29:13 This people draweth nigh me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.
"It is in vain that they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men." What is it that makes a man unclean? (Mark 7:14-23)
And Jesus called the people to him and said to them, "Listen and understand."
"Not what goes into the mouth is what defiles a man, but what comes out of the mouth is what defiles a man."
The students went to him and said, "Brother, do you know that the Pharisees cheated when they heard this speech?"
"Tell them: 'No tree that isn't planted by the Father in heaven can be uprooted.'"
Keep away from them! They are blind leading the blind. And if a blind man leads a blind man, they will both fall into a pit."
And Peter said, "Explain this parable to us."
Jesus said, "My brothers, you still do not understand."
Hey, you don't see what goes into your mouth going to your stomach, and what comes out of your body?
But the need to come out of the mouth comes from the heart, and this is what defiles a person.
Malqalb taji alafkar alshariea walqatl walzin walfasad wasraqa washahada alzaur walkufr,
This is not what defiles a person. What comes out of a person is what defiles them." The faith of the Canaanite woman (Mark 7:24-30)
And Jesus walked through this place and went to the city of Tyre and Sidon.
The woman who came from the region shouted, "My lord, son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is possessed by a demon and is being tormented greatly."
But he didn't even answer her. His students came and took him away, saying, "Give her to whoever you want, let her go away from us, she'll walk away from us and shout!"
Jesus replied, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Ahma came and landed in front of him on her equipment and said, "My lord, help me!"
"And she replied, 'We won't take the bread for the children and throw it to the dogs.'"
"She said, 'Yes, sir! Even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table.'"
Jesus replied, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you wish." And her daughter was healed at that moment. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus walked from Ghadi and crossed the lake of the Sea of Galilee, went up the mountain and sat down.
Many people came with them, including the disabled, the sick, the blind, the crippled, and many others, and they placed them in front of his legs as he healed them.
And the people were amazed. The blind received sight, the lame walked, the crippled were healed, and the deaf heard. They glorified the God of Israel. Jesus gave food to four thousand men (Mark 8:1-10).
And Jesus called his disciples and said to them, "Behold, the people are grumbling against me, and they have been with me for three days without food. I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."
The students said, "Where can we get bread in this desert? Is it enough for all these people?"
Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."
And Jesus told the people to sit on the ground.
And he took the seven loaves and the fish, and gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.
And they all ate until they were full, and they shook off seven large, full baskets.
There were four thousand men, excluding women and children.
After the people sent the soul, he went to Al-Falooqah and walked to the Majdal area.
The signs of the times (Mark 8:11-13; Luke 12:54-56)
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus to test him, and they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
Jesus replied, "When I die, it will be evening, and you will say, 'The weather is beautiful, the sky is red.'"
In the morning they say, "There will be rain today, because the sky is dark red." They know how to interpret the state of the sky, but the signs of the weather they don't know how to interpret.
A wicked and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah." And he left them and went away. The disciples of the Pharisees and Sadducees were going out, and one of them came and said to him, "Teacher, I have followed you wherever you went, and I have seen many signs that you do. And he left them and went away. The disciples of the Pharisees and Sadducees were going out, and one of them came and said to him, "Teacher, I have followed you wherever you went, and I have seen many signs that you do.

They took the students to the opposite shore, so they could get bread with them.
Jesus said to them, "Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students discussed with each other and said, "This is because we don't have bread."
And when Jesus knew this, he said, "O you of little faith, why do you reason among yourselves, having no bread?
Hey, guys, you didn't understand? Hey, guys, don't you remember the five loaves that were divided among the five thousand and how many baskets were filled so that there was leftover?
And the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many baskets did you fill?
How can you not understand what I'm saying? Don't you talk about bread? Answer me, what's the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees?"
At this time they understood what he had said to them, that is, to return with the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees, not the leaven of bread. Peter testifies to Jesus as the Christ (Mark 8:27-30; Luke 9:18-21).
When Jesus came to Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that I am, the Son of Man?"
They answered him, "Some say that you are John the Baptist, some that you are Elijah, and others that you are Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
He said to them, "What do you say about who?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus said, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven."
And I tell you: you are Peter, which means a large stone, and on this stone I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
"So that you may give the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and what is bound on earth may be bound in heaven, and what is loosed on earth may be loosed in heaven."
And at this time, He warned His disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Christ. Jesus first spoke of His death and resurrection (Mark 8:31; 9:1; Luke 9:22-27).
And from this time Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised up the third day.
Peter shook Jesus to his side and began to blame him, saying, "Lord, have mercy! This thing shall not happen to you at all!"
"Then Jesus turned and said to Peter, 'Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.'"
This time Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must forget about himself, take up his cross, and follow me."
He who loves to finish his life loses it, and he loses his life for my sake so that he may gain it.
What is the benefit of a human if he gains the whole world and loses his life? And what is the need for which a human sacrifices his life?

You are right: there are those who are standing here not to see death before they see me. I, the Son of Man, am coming to my kingdom."
Jesus shows his disciples his glory (Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36)
After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
And it changed before them, and it shone like the sun, and it turned white like the light.
And Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, how wonderful it is that we are here. If you wish, we can set up three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And while he was still speaking, a cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!"
As the students heard this, they fell on their faces and were very afraid.
And when Jesus came and saw them, he said, "Get up, and don't be afraid."
And when they mocked him, they took off his robe and put his own clothes on him. And they led him away to crucify him.
And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The students asked him, "Why does the book of the Jews say that Elijah must come first?"
"Answer them: 'By right, Elijah is coming and he will fix everything.'"
"So I will take you to Elijah, who they do not know, and they will do to him what they want. And I, the Son of Man, will increase their suffering at their hands."
And at this time the disciples understood the one who was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a demon-possessed boy (Mark 9:14-29; Luke 9:37-43).
And when Jesus and his disciples came to the people, there was a man who was possessed and he fell before Jesus and said:
"Oh Lord, have mercy on my son, on his mind he is falling and suffering a lot and he always falls into fire and water."
And I brought him to your students, but they didn't heal him."
Jesus answered, "O faithless and perverse generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to put up with you? Bring him here to me!"
Jesus cast out the devil, and he came out of him, and the boy was healed at once.
At this time, the disciples of Jesus came to him and said, "Why did we not drive him out?"
He said to them, "Because of your weak faith! If you had faith as small as a mustard seed, you would say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it would move. Nothing would be impossible for you."
# 17:21 There are ancient texts in which this verse is found: This kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting. Jesus speaks again of his death and resurrection (Mark 9:30-32; Luke 9:43-45).
And when the disciples were gathered together in Galilee, he said unto them, "I must deliver myself into the hands of men."
"And they will kill me, and on the third day we will rise." "Brother, don't worry. Jesus pays the temple tax."
Kjao lakfrnahum masha'u il-yilmou fi ad-daraib mata' al-haykal li-Btrs waqalu lahu: "Yakh, al-mu'allim mata'kum yadfuk ad-daraib?"
"Yes, yes," I replied. As I went home, Jesus preceded me in conversation and said, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take taxes and tributes? From their own children or from the Brahmins?"
Peter said, "From the Brainians." Jesus said, "No, the country's children are free."
"But we don't want to cause you any trouble, so go to the lake and cast your line, and when you catch a fish, open its mouth and you'll find enough silver dust to pay for both of us."
