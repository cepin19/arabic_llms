Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh was the father of Amon, and Amon was the father of Josiah.

Jacob was the son of Joseph, the husband of Mary, who gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
The generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the exile to Babylon, fourteen generations; from the exile to Babylon to the birth of Christ, fourteen generations. The birth of Jesus Christ.
And this was the manner of his birth: When Mary was with child by the Holy Ghost, before they were married together, Joseph her husband. Luke
Yusuf, her fiancé, was a man who feared God and would not betray her, and he decided to part with her in secret.
And he was thinking about this, when in his sleep one of the angels of the Lord came to him and said to him: "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit."
And she gave birth to a son, and he was named Jesus, because he was the one who would save his people from their sins." Luke
And all this is so that the words of the Lord may be fulfilled through the prophet who said:
"Ha'azinu, v'et yaldah ben, v'yikra' et-Shem 'Immanuel,' asher yihyeh shmu'o 'Immanuel,' Elokim imenu."
And Joseph being overcome with sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him, and took unto him Mary to wife.
But he had no relations with her until she had a son, and he named him Jesus. Luke 2:21
Chapter 2 The star scientists came to see Jesus
And when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, saying, "Where is he who has been born king of the Jews?"
Kisolo: "Where is the king of the Jews who is to come? For we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
And when Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
And he called together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, and asked them, "Where was the Christ to be born?"
They replied: "It's in Bethlehem, in Judea, where the prophet wrote about it when he said:
Want to Bethlehem, which is in Judea, you are walking Net is the small in the Judean Hills, where you will come out of the head of my people, the people of Israel.
And after the summer of Herod on the science of the stars in the secret, and verified them on the time in which the star appeared.
After their summer in Bethlehem, they came to him and said, "Your heart is good for the boy. When you find him, please let me know so I can go and bow down to him."
And when they heard the king's words, they went. And they saw the star that they had seen in the east, and it went before them until it came to the place where the boy was and stood still.
And those who saw the star were overjoyed.
And when they entered the house, they saw the boy with Maryam, and they bowed down to him, and they opened their bags and presented him with gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
And they, being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, went by another way to their own country. The family of Jesus fled to Egypt.
And after the wise men had departed, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said to him, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Yusuf and Khoda went to Egypt at night.
And so it was fulfilled, what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son." Herod killed the little children.
And when Herod saw that the wise men had deceived him, he was very angry and ordered that all the children in Bethlehem and its surrounding areas be killed, from two years old and under, for this was the time he had been told by the wise men.
And Haka fulfilled the word of the Lord through the mouth of the prophet Jeremiah who said:
"From Ramah you hear wailing, much crying and lamentation. Rachel weeps for her children and refuses to be comforted, because they are no more." Jesus' family returns from Egypt.
And when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
I said to him, "Let's take the boy's head and go back to the land of Israel, where those who wanted to kill the boy are dead."
Yusuf and Khoda's son struggled and returned to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go back, and he went away to the region of Galilee.
One came to the city called Nazareth and lived there, so that the word of God spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, which says, "He will be called a Nazarene." Mark 1:24; Luke 2:39; John 1:45
Chapter 3: John the Baptist to prepare the way for Jesus
Faddiyak liyam, ja Yahya al-Mubtadi'a lalsahra diyal bilad al-Yahud, kayxir lanas,
And he said to them, "Tobou, the time of the kingdom of heaven is near."
And this is the man about whom the prophet Isaiah spoke when he said: "A voice in the wilderness, saying, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.'"
John's clothing was made of camel hair, with a leather belt, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
And the people came to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region around the Jordan River.
Fawad Jordan is on his hands, and they are to confess their sins.
And when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Ewa Binu, your repentance is in your good deeds.
And they did not start by saying with their heads: "We are Abraham." We say to you: "God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones." John
And now the rot is on the walls of the trees, and every tree that does not give good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. When
I will give you the water so that you may drink, but the one who comes after me is stronger than I, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the strap of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
Videh al-madrah ghedri biha darasah wa-ghajam al-gamh fahzaynah, ama at-tubn raha gha-yahrikhu bi-al-afiyah al-li umrha ma gh-tufah. Yuhanna kayamud Yasu.
And after that, Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.
But John didn't leave and told him, "I'm the one who needs you to baptize me, and you're coming to me to baptize me?"
Jesus answered him, "This is not allowed right now, for we must fulfill God's will." He allowed John to baptize him.
And Jesus, not intentionally, went out of the water, and behold, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.
And a voice came from heaven, saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Matthew 12:18; 17:5; Mark 1:11; Luke 9:35
Chapter Four: Devil Kigab tries Jesus
And after that, God sent Jesus into the desert so that he could be tempted by the devil. Hebrews
He fasted for two months and two nights, and then he was overcome by hunger.
And he came upon Iblis who tried and said to him, "Unless you are the son of God, tell this stone to become bread."
Jesus replied, "It is written in the book of God: Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from God."
And thereafter, Satan went to the Holy City of Jerusalem, and stood on a high place above the House of God.
And he said to him: "Unless you are the son of God, throw your head down, because it is written in the book of God: God will command his angels to take care of you, and they will throw you so that your leg does not hit the stone."
Jesus replied, "It is written in the book of God again: You shall not tempt the Lord your God."
And after the emergence of Iblis, he climbed a very high mountain, and behind him were all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
I said to him, "I will give you all this except my two prostrations and my worship."
Jesus replied, "Get out of here, Satan! For it is written in the Scriptures, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.'"
And after this, Satan left him, and behold, angels came to him. Jesus preached in Galilee
And when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee. Matthew
And he left Nazareth and went to live in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali. John
And he will accomplish what is pleasing to the Lord, just as the prophet Isaiah said.
"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, which is by the sea, on the other side of the Jordan, the land of Galilee of the Gentiles, which is not Jews!"
The people who sat in darkness saw a great light, and those who lived in the land of death and in the midst of it, one of the lights came to them.
And from that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Matthew 3:2 Jesus chose his two disciples.
And Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee, saw two of the boats standing by the sea; but the fishermen, having put out of them, were washing their nets. And Jesus getting into one of the boats, that was Simon's, asked him to put out a little from the land. And sitting down, he taught the multitudes from the boat.
And Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
I took the clock out of their window and followed him.
And then he walked on and saw two other fishermen, James son of Zebedee and his brother John, with Zebedee's other son in a boat mending their nets. He did not disturb them.
They left their nets and followed Jesus. Jesus knew and understood.
And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people. Matthew
The news of him spread throughout Syria, and he gathered all the patients who were suffering from the disease: the possessed, those with leprosy, and the crippled, and he healed them.
He was followed by many from Galilee, the ten disciples, Jerusalem, Judea, and the other side of the Jordan River.
Chapter Five The Sermon on the Mount by Jesus
And when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain, and after he had sat down, his disciples came to him.
And he seemed to be teaching them: "Don't be afraid, I am with you."
"Sa'dat al-Fakhra in the spirit, where they have the kingdom of heaven."
Sadats who cry, Allah will console them.
Sadats al-mutatawwi'in, hayth ghadi yurtu al-ard.
Sadates Hadok who are hungry and thirsty for the obedience of Allah, will be satisfied.
Sadates Haadouk, who are merciful, for God will have mercy on them.
Sadates Hadok whose hearts are pure, they will see God.
Sadates Hadoc who help people live happily, where the children of God will be named.
Sadates Hadok who follow the path of truth, have the kingdom of heaven. 1 Peter 3:14
And I rejoice in your sufferings for you, and fill up on my part what is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for His body's sake, which is the church; Ephesians 3:19
Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you." Luke 6:23 The earth is defiled under its inhabitants, because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinances, broken the everlasting covenant.
"The urgent need of the earth, or else what will happen to the salt that has lost its saltiness? It will be of no use, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by people. Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34,35"
We are the light of the world, a city on a hill cannot be hidden. John
And there was no one to light the lamp and put it under the bushel, but to put it in its place so that it would shine on all who were in the house. Mark
"And let the light of your good deeds shine before others, that they may see your fine works and glorify your Father who is in heaven." 1 Peter 2:12 The Law
"I did not come to abolish the law of Moses or the teachings of the prophets, I did not come to abolish them but to fulfill them."
And I give you the right: For the sky and the earth to be limited and not a single letter or point of the law to be limited until everything in it is fulfilled. Luke
The one who does not teach one of these little commandments and teaches people to do so will be the least in the kingdom of heaven. And the one who teaches them and teaches people will be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And I say to you: unless your obedience is greater than that of the scholars of the law and the Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
"You've earned your reputation by telling people the following: don't kill, and whoever kills should be controlled."
But I tell you: everyone who worries about his own brother is in control of him, and whoever says to his brother: "You are useless, you are in control of him in the great court." And whoever says to his brother: "You are foolish, you deserve the fire of hell."
Otherwise, I would have taken your gift and put it on the altar and thought that you were right from your brother's side.
Leave your gift in front of the slaughterhouse and walk until you reconcile with your friend in Al-Lul, then come back and give your gift.
Make peace with whoever owes you, because there are no more of you left on the road to the court, before you hand you over to the judge, and the judge puts you in the fed's custody, and the fed puts you in prison.
"I'll tell you what: you won't leave until you finish paying the last riyal you owe." Corruption
"Did you hear about Tgal: he doesn't spoil."
But I tell you: anyone who sees a woman and lusts after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
Otherwise, your right eye would have fallen into the pit, its edge would have been thrown at you, and as a result, oh God, you would have lost a part of yourself and not thrown your whole self into hell.
Unless your hand is your right hand, it would be better for you to throw it away and cast it into the fire, for it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna." Matthew 18:8; Mark 9:43 Divorce
"Tocgal tani: Ghaal li taqleq martah, khashee y'eediha barratha. Mat'ee"
But I tell you: whoever divorces his wife for reasons other than sexual immorality causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery." Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11,12; Luke 16:18; 1 Corinthians 7:10,11.
"I heard you again say to your grandfathers: unless you swear not to complain, but to offer these vows to the Lord."
And I say to you: You will never swear, neither by heaven, which is the throne of God, nor by Jacob.
And not on the earth, where it is the place of his feet, nor in Jerusalem, where it is the city of the great king.
And you can't even swear by your own beard, since you can't return even one hair of it, neither black nor white.
But if your words are yes, say yes. And if your words are no, say no. Anything more than this comes from the devil." Revenge
"Have you heard the saying: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
But I'm telling you: don't return evil for evil, but whoever spits on your face to the right, turn to the left and show him the same.
And whoever wants to sue you in court to take your cloak, let him take your shirt as well.
Otherwise, one thing is certain: if you walk with him one thousand steps, walk with him two thousand.
And whoever asks you for something, give it to him, and whoever wants to borrow from you, do not turn him empty-handed away." They want your wealth.
"Have you heard the saying: 'You love those who are close to you and hate your enemies.'"
But I say to you: leave your weapons, and leave with those who are passing by you.
May your children be like stars in the sky. Where he shines his sun on the wicked and the righteous, and sends snow on those who do good and those who do evil.
Whereas unless you write only what you want, what is your salary? And what is the tax money you use for this?
Otherwise, you will only receive your friends alone. How can we be good to others? Isn't it like those who worship idols do?
"Ewa, Kono Kamalin, Kama Baakum Al-Sama Kamalin."
Chapter Six: Al-Sadaqah
"Do not do your good deeds to be seen by people, so that you may receive a reward from them. Rather, your reward is with Allah, the One in the heavens."
Otherwise, you want to give something as a charity, don't leave it in the horn in front of people like those who run hypocrites, so that people thank them for prayer and zinaqi. I'm telling you the truth: they got their reward from the people.
But not unless I give you something in charity, especially since your left hand doesn't know what your right hand is doing.
"Let your charity be in secret, and the one in the sky who does not hide anything is the one who will reward you." Prayer
"And you, hypocrites, do not pray standing up in the prayer halls where people can see you, but in the corners of the streets, so that people can see you. I am telling you the truth: they have received their reward from people. Look"
Amat nasa tislili, dhil li-baytik wasad 'alayka al-bab wasalli li-bak al-li fis-sir, wa-bak al-li ma kathafa 'alayhi khafiya huwa al-li ghajiyak.
And if you pray, they will not start talking a lot and empty like those who worship idols, who think that if they talk more, God will respond to them.
"Eiwa, ma tinshukulish bi-halikhom, 'ilahakash baikum al-li fis-sama kayafiq dakash li kittataghoqu qabl ma ttalbuh'."
"And thus we pray: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,
And your kingdom will come, and your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.
The bread that suffices our livelihood today.
And forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us.
We prevented ourselves from being thrown into the test, and we escaped from the devil.
Where you do not forgive people their mistakes, they will not forgive you your mistakes in heaven.
But unless you forgive people their mistakes, so that what is not forgiven for you in the heavens may not be forgiven for you." Fasting
"Unless you are silent, you will not be fasting like hypocrites who pretend to fast in order to show people that they are fasting. We tell you the truth: they have received their reward from people.
But when you get home, oil your hair and wash your face.
Where people go to see if you are fasting, but the one in secret, and the one who does not hide anything from you, He will reward you." Treasures in the sky
"Do not collect treasures for yourselves on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. Jacob
But gather your treasures in the sky, wherever you may find them in the souks and markets, and wherever they may be hidden from the swords and stolen.
"Wherever your treasure is, there your heart will be." - The Light of the Data
"The eye is the candle of the soul. If your eye is beautiful, your soul will be beautiful too."
But if your eye is ugly, your whole body will be dark. And if the light in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!” God and money
"Even one cannot be a servant of Joga Sida, because either one dislikes one of them and does not like the other, nor is one loyal to one of them and does not care for the other. And so even we cannot be servants of God and money. We do not serve them."
And on this, I say to you: We do not provide for you from your livelihood what you eat or what you drink, nor from your clothing what you wear. Is not life more important than food, and clothing more important than clothing?
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow, they do not reap, they do not gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Who among you can increase the burden of sorrow and add another hour to his life?
Why do they give up on clothes? Look at the beautiful rose in the field, how it grows, it doesn't get tired, it doesn't get worn out.
But we tell you the truth: even Sulayman, with all his glory, never wore anything like a rose in them.
Ewa aqlaline l'iman! Illa kan l'rbi3 lli f'alfdan, lli jaytina kensho7u wgallihi kitermi f'lfran kibelbih llah haka, kifas ma yelebsikumch ma hassan?
And on top of all this, we worry and say: What are we going to eat? What are we going to drink? What are we going to wear?
The way until those who do not know God would ask for all this, and those in the sky would know that we need all this.
But their hearts are in the lull of God's kingdom and His will, and this is all for you.
What do not burden the heart for the coming day, leave the worries for tomorrow. And every day is blessed with its own worries."
Chapter 7: Do not judge them by their limits
"Don't judge anyone, so they won't judge you."
Where the rulers are to rule, they will not rule over you, and the words are to express you, they will express you. Mark
Why do you see the straw in your friend's eye, but you don't notice the log in your own eye?
And how are you going to tell your brother to move the bundle of straw from your eye, and your eye has a stick in it?
A hypocrite, once you see the wolf in sheep's clothing, you will know how to distinguish the straw from your friend's eye.
What you give the sacred needs of dogs, they will not trample on you and cut you, and what you throw at the ground, the scavengers will not trample on it with their feet." They asked, turned and knocked.
"Ask and it will be given to you. Knock and it will be opened to you.
The door that is asked for is given to him, the heart that is closed is opened, and the door that is knocked on is opened for him.
Who among you who is not asked by his son for bread, will not give him a room.
And what if a whale asked him to give it to him?
Ewa, except that you guys have done what is not good, how can you expect that the one in the sky will give good things to those who ask for them?
As people write, you manage with them, this is your own, so we can manage with them, for this is how the teaching of the law and the prophets will come about." Luke 6:31 The narrow gate
"They entered through the narrow door, where the door leading to destruction is wide and its path is easy, and many who enter through it."
How many times has the strait of Bab-el-Mandeb been crossed, and how many times has the road that leads to life been traversed, and how many times have those who cross it been seen." The tree knows by its fruit.
"Watch out for the false prophets, who come to you dressed as sheep but are inwardly wolves, ready to pounce."
You know how to get their value. Can you get grapes from thorns, or carob from acacia?
And every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
And a decorated tree cannot give a bad yield, and a bad tree cannot give a decorated yield.
Every tree that does not give good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. When
"And by their fruits you will know them." Matthew 12:33. We must do the will of God.
"I'm going to say what everyone says: 'My Lord, my Lord!' He will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who enters it is the one who has control over what is in the heavens."
Fadaak al-nahar, bzaaf lighayyil ghaydy yghzulu li: Aa sayyidi, aa sayyidi! Washa mashi biismak tanbaana? Wa biismak kharajna al-junoon? Wa biismak darna mujaazat katar?
Fadiq al-saa'a ghadi nghoul lihom: Umrani ma'raftakum! Ba'du minni a'l-mndabin! Al-matal dyal jw djwr
The one who hears my words and does not act upon them is like a man who built his house on sand.
And from where did the snow fall and the waterfalls flow, and a strong wind came and hit the house, it did not shake, where its foundation was built on the rock.
Whoever hears this talk of mine and does not act upon it is like a man who built his house on sand.
"And from where did the snow fall and the waterfalls flow, and a strong wind came and hit the house, and it was strong."
And when Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, Mark
Where he would teach them like one who has authority, not like a scholar of their law.
Chapter 8 Jesus Heals a Paralyzed Man
And when Jesus came down from the mountain, a large crowd followed him.
And a djinn came to him, and he prostrated himself before him and said, "My Lord, if You had not done so, I would have been among the losers."
He reached out to Jesus, touched him, and said, "I want to be pure!" And suddenly he was healed and left him.
And the captain said to him, "Come and go with me, and see what evil thing this man has done." Jesus said, "Do not hold him back, for no one who does a miracle in my name can immediately afterward speak evil of me. Whoever is not against us is for us." The servants of the captain of the guard came to him and said, "What is this that you have done? You went in and out with a drawn sword, as if you would kill us." He said to them, "I was only doing what I was told to do. I said, 'Come and go with me, and see what evil thing this man has done.'" The captain of the guard took him and the elders, and all the captains of the army.
And when Jesus came to Capernaum, a centurion came to him, begging him,
"And he said to me, 'My lord, my servant at home is lying on the bed paralyzed and suffering a lot.'"
He says to me, Jesus: "Hani, we are going to heal him."
The commander of the army replied, "I don't deserve, sir, to have you enter under the roof of my house, but just say one word and my servants will be healed."
"Where even I have someone who rules over me and I have soldiers who rule over me, I say to them: Go! And they go, and I say to the next one: Come! And they come, and I say to my slave: Take this! And they take it."
And when Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed, "Most assuredly I tell you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel."
Waraani ngoul likom beli bzaf d dyalna ghadi yjiw min al-sharq w al-gharb wighlasu ya'klu ma' Ibrahim wa Ishaq wa Ya'qub fmmmalakah al-samawati. Luqa
Hadok, who was supposed to be in the kingdom, went to the edge of the darkness, where the crying and the whistling of the swords would be."
And then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go! As you have believed, so be it done for you." And at that hour the servant was healed. Jesus went with Peter and his companions and, when he arrived, he found the centurion with his friends waiting for him, for he had just heard the news about Jesus.
And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.

And when Jesus saw the crowd, he told his disciples to cross to the other side of the sea.
He brought one of the scholars of the law to him and he said to him, "My lord, we will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
A student said to him, "My master, let me go and bury him."
But Jesus answered him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead!" Then Jesus called one of the twelve, and sent him to the centurion. Jesus was moved with compassion.
And when Jesus had stepped into the boat, his disciples followed him.
The wind was very strong in the sea, so much that it overturned the boat, and Jesus was asleep.
And his disciples came near to him and said to him, "We have freed you, sir, for we are going to die!"
He says to them, "What are you afraid of, these little faiths?" Then he rises and walks in the wind and the sea, and the world is calmed.
The men were amazed and said, "Who is this? Even the wind and the sea obey him!" Jesus healed the two men of leprosy.
And when Jesus arrived on the other side of the sea, in a country of the Gadarenes, two men possessed by demons met him, coming out of the tombs, and they were so dangerous that no one could pass that way.
And Shafouh said to Kigutu and Kigolo: "What's between you and me, son of God? What did you come here for, to make us suffer before our time?"

The Saraha fled and went to the city and told everyone about all the things that had happened and what had happened to the men who were possessed by the devil.
And the people of the city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their country.
Chapter 9 Jesus Heals a Paralytic
And Jesus got into the boat, crossed the sea, and returned to his city.
And some people brought to him a paralyzed man, lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven."
And two of the scholars of Islamic law were afraid of him: "This man speaks the words of disbelief!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said, "Why are you thinking evil things in your hearts?
Sahl says: "Forgive me for my sins," and does not say: "Get up and walk?"
But I will show you that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins." He said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat, and go home."
The man struggled and walked to his house.
And when they saw the crowds, they were afraid, and they gave glory to God, who had given such authority to men. Jesus chose when
And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. He said to him, "Follow me." And he arose and followed him.
And after Jesus had finished speaking, he went to Matthew's house, and a large number of tax collectors and sinners came with him and his disciples. Luke
And when he saw the Pharisees, he said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
And when Jesus heard them, he answered them, saying, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.
Eiwa Sero, learn the meaning of this phrase: I want mercy, not slaughter, because I am not crying for those who are waiting for God, but for the sinners." The question is about fasting.
And after the disciples of John the Baptist came to Jesus and asked him, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus answered them, "How can the groom's friends mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom is taken from them, and then they will fast."
Even one who patches an old garment with the edge of a new one, the patch will shrink and the tear will get bigger.
And one who does not make new wine, the skins of the skin in front, where they are not given to them, and thus the wine is lost and the skins are spoiled. But they make new wine in the skins of the skin, so that neither the wine nor the skins are lost." The president's daughter and the woman who was with Jesus' belongings.
And he said to them, "This is what I told them," and he went to one of the presidents and prostrated himself before him and said, "My daughter, oh my God, has died, but come and put your hand on her and she will live."
And Jesus went after him, and his disciples.
And a woman who had been suffering from bleeding for twelve years, came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak,
Where she thought: "I only need my belongings to get well."
Jesus looked at her and said, "Take heart, daughter; your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed from that hour.
And when Jesus arrived at the president's house and saw the people who were there with the lira and the crowd of people who were causing headaches,
I told them, "Get out of here! The girl is not dead, she's just asleep!" and they laughed at me.
And when they had brought Jesus out, they led him to the place called Golgotha. And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.
The news is sweet, take the whole jewel. Jesus heals two of the blind.
And when Jesus had stayed there for some days, two blind men from Kigoto and Kigolo followed him, saying, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
And when he entered the house, the blind men came to him. And Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to heal you?" And they said to him, "Yes, Lord!"
And Jesus looked at them and said, "According to your faith, it will be done for you."
They were amazed at their eyes, and Jesus warned them, "Tell no one about this!"
But they left and started to spread the news, so the whole story is out. Zizun is exposed.
And where did they take the blind man, until they brought him one, a man named Zizun, who was mad.
And when Jesus had cast out the demon, the mute man spoke. And the crowds were amazed, saying, "We have never seen anything like this in Israel!"
But the Pharisees said, "This man casts out demons only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons!" Matthew 10:25; 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15 Jesus' trial
And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people. Matthew
And when he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Mark
He says to his students: "The harvest is much, but the reapers are few. Luke"
Eiwaa, they asked the owner of the harvest to add the harvest to his harvest."
Chapter 10 Jesus teaches his disciples the Psalms
And after Jesus cursed his disciples, he gave them the authority to cast out demons and heal people from every disease and every sickness.
And these are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon, also known as Peter, and his brother Andrew, James son of Zebedee, and his brother John,
Phillips, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus.
Jesus took the colt and went away, and the two disciples followed him. And when he had gone into the temple, he began to drive out those who bought and sold in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves. And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple. And he taught, saying to them, "Is it not written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations'? But you have made it a den of robbers." And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them. But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children who were crying out in the temple and saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" they were indignant and said to him, "Do you hear what these are saying?" And Jesus said to them, "Yes; have you never read, 'Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have perfected praise'?" And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and he lodged there.
But he went to the flock of sheep that belonged to the people of Israel.
And let people know that the time of the Kingdom of Heaven is near.
Heal the sick, bring the dead to life, return the damned pure, and drive out madness. Take without paying, give without receiving.

The city and the roundabout you entered, ask someone who is worth accompanying you, and stay with them until you leave as you are.
Otherwise, you'll enter a house, greet its owner.
Otherwise, the people who own the house deserve your peace, your peace will reach them. Otherwise, they don't deserve it, your peace will come back to you.
Otherwise, they wouldn't accept you, neither in a village nor in a city, and they wouldn't listen to your words. Leave and blow the dust off your feet. Works

Chapter 6: John the Baptist prepares his disciples for Jesus
And as Jesus fulfilled the commandments that He gave to His disciples, He went out to teach and preach the gospel to the Gentiles.
And when John heard that he was in prison about the things which Jesus did, he sent his disciples to him to say,
I asked him, "Is it you who is coming, or are we going to get another one?"
Jesus answered them and said to them, "Go and tell John all that you hear and see:
The blind will see, the lame will walk, the lepers will be cleansed, the deaf will hear, the dead will be raised, and the poor will have the good news preached to them.
And Sa'adat, that one who doesn't change.
And the multitudes marveling at his works, Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
What did you go out to see? What kind of man is wearing thin clothes? Those who wear thin clothes, they live in the palaces of kings!
What did you go out to see? What do you want? We'll tell you, we want more than we want.
Beyond this is what Allah said in His book: "Hani, the Prophet of my people, who will show you the way."
And I tell you the truth: No one born of woman is greater than John the Baptist, yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force. Luke
The prophets and the law of Moses prophesied even up to the time of John the Baptist.
Unless you are a prophet, John the Baptist is the Elijah who is to come. Mat 11:3
Ewa, whoever has something to say, speak up!
But what about the children of this generation? They are like children who are silent, and the driver shouts at them and says:
We blew it for you in the lira and you didn't cry, and we mourned for you and you didn't cry!
John went his way, eating and drinking nothing, and they said, "This is a possessed man."
And the son of man came to eat and drink, and they say: This is a food and a drink and a companion without taxes and sinners! But the wisdom of God wrote that it is good from the yield of it." Woe to the writer who did not repent.
And when they had the watch, Jesus began to tell the story of the writer who performed many more miracles among them, because their people did not repent.
"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. #11:21 They would have repented in sackcloth and ashes to show their repentance."
But we say to you: the consequences of the photo blogger and the day of reckoning will be less severe than yours.
Want a Capernaum! And what have you prepared for heaven? You're going to hit the abyss. Because you're dealing with the abomination of the miracles that are happening to you, you're dealing with the abomination that has not ended and continues to this day.
And I say to you, the end of Sodom will be more tolerable than the end of you." Matthew 10:15; Luke 10:12 Come to me, and rest a while."
And in that hour, Jesus spoke and said, "I give thanks to you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children."
Our Father, your will be done.
The Father has given everything to me, and even to some extent to know who the Father's son is other than the Father, and who the Father is other than the son of the Father, and that the son of the Father wants to show him to him. John 3:35; John 1:18; 10:15
Come to me, all of you who are tired, and those who are carrying the heavy load, and I will give you rest.
Hey, my dear friends, learn from me, I am humble and courteous, and you will find peace in your souls.
"Where our light is easy and our burden is light."
The chapter of Jesus's head teaches about the Sabbath.
Faddiyak liyam, fawwaan as-Sabt, daaz yasu'u bayn al-faddadn d al-zira'a, wa-kan fat-talamadhi al-jumu', wa-hum yabdaaw kiiqta'u al-sabool wa-kiyakaluu.
And when the Pharisees saw them, they said to him, "Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!"
"They replied, 'And what did you read? What did David do when he was hungry and the people with him?'
How did he enter the house of God, and how did he eat the bread that was offered to God, which was not meant to be eaten by him or the men with him, except for the religious leaders alone.
And have you not read in the Torah that on the Sabbath, the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?
But I say to you: there is here one greater than the temple.
And since you understood the meaning of the verse that says: I wanted mercy not slaughter, since I did not condemn those who are not to be blamed.
Where a man is born is the Lord of the Sabbath." Jesus healed on the Sabbath day.
And he walked on and went to their prayer house.
A man with a paralyzed hand was approached and asked, "What is the halal of the Sabbath on Saturday?" They asked him so that they could find a charge against him.
"He replied, 'There is only one of you who has one sheep and it fell into a pit on Saturday. What would you do? You would shake it and pull it out.' Luke
"Ewa rahe qimat banadam katr baffah min al-khrouf! Wa hadashi 'ala shilah amal al-khair halal nahar al-sabt."
And Jesus said to the man with the withered hand, "Stretch out your hand!" And he stretched it out, and it was restored as sound as the other.
And the Pharisees went out and began to plot how to kill him. Jesus is the chosen one of God.
And the news of Jesus' leg spread, and many people followed him, and he healed them all.
And they instructed them not to tell anyone about it.
Let the words spoken by the prophet Isaiah come true:
"This is my chosen servant, my dear one, in whom I am well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations."

And his name shall be called Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins." Jesus and Baalzebub
And a man who was blind and lame, a resident of Gehenna, came to Jesus, and he healed him, and so he was able to speak and see.
The crowds were amazed and said, "Is this not the son of David?"
And when the Pharisees heard these things, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of devils. Matthew 9:34; 10:25
Jesus knew how they thought and said to them, "Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and any city or household divided against itself will not stand.
Unless the devil was to expel the devil, he would be divided and turned against his head, or else divided and turned against his head, how would his kingdom remain stable?
Otherwise, I'll be Ba'alzebub, the one who brings madness. Who are these people that your children will judge you by? Your children are the ones who will judge you.
But unless I, with the spirit of God, cast out devils, the kingdom of God is come upon you.
How can someone enter someone else's house, steal their belongings without being caught, and then steal their house?

People with good fortune will take out the good things from the good treasure in their heart, and people with bad fortune will take out the bad things from the bad treasure in their heart.
And I say to you: whatever empty words people say, they will be held accountable for them on the Day of Judgment.
"Later, your words will control you, either by God or by your own fault." The scholars of the law and the Pharisees wanted to see a sign.
And two of the scholars of the law and the Pharisees approached him and said, "Sir, we want to see a sign from you."
He says to them: "A generation that is ugly and corrupt, asking for a sign! And you will not give it to them, not even a sign from the sign of the prophet Jonah. When?"
Later, just as Jonah thought the whale would be gone after three days and three nights, so too will man be gone from the heart of the earth after three days and three nights.
People of Nineveh will follow in the day of reckoning with this generation and bear witness to it, because they repented when Jonah warned them, and now one of Jonah's descendants is here.
And the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

Kimchi and Kedi have seven madmen with them, worse than him. And when they enter his house, they will turn his situation from a crazy state to a state of despair. This is what will happen to this generation that will cause evil even to him." Jesus and Mohammad
And he was talking to the people, when his sister and brother came and stood there wanting to talk to him.
One of the attendees said to me, "They and your brother are standing outside, wanting to talk to you." # 12.47 This verse is not found in many of the old manuscripts.
Jesus replied, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"

Where the Hadouks who direct Murad to those in the sky, they are my brother and sister and me."
The chapter on the metal dust of the farmer
By daybreak, Jesus left the house and sat down by the sea.
And the multitudes gathered together unto him: and he entered into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore. Luke 5:1-3
And he said to them with a lot of emphasis: "This man went out to plant, and he came back with a lot of produce."
And when he was planting, he dropped some grains on the way and the birds came and ate them.
And the other grains fell on the hard ground, which had no much soil, and the thorns grew where the soil was not deep.
As the sun rises, they burn, and since they had no walls, they dry out.
Grains fell in the middle of the thorns, and the size of the thorns strangled them.
And they shook the other grains, and the land was fertile and yielded a harvest. Some gave 100, some gave 60, and some gave 30.
Ewa, whoever has something to say, let them speak! The purpose of the translator
And his disciples came near to him and said to him, "Why do you speak to the people in parables?"
He answers them and says, "When we give you the keys to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but they are not given to them to understand them."
Where he has, he will be given and more will be added to him. And the one who does not have, even that which he has will be taken from him. When
And I was talking to them in a language that they wouldn't understand, and when they saw what they saw, and when they heard what they heard, and when they couldn't understand it.
And this is the fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah: "They will look, but not see; they will hear, but not understand."
Where the heart of this people is cruel, their hearing is weak, and their eyes close, so that they do not see with their eyes, and they do not hear with their ears, and their hearts do not understand, and they return to us so that we may heal them.
But we are happy when you see it, and we want you to hear it. Luke
"And I give you the right: many prophets and righteous people wished to see what you see, but did not see it, and to hear what you hear, but did not hear it." The meaning of the parable of the sower.
"Ey, listen, we understand the meaning of this metaphor of the man who is planting:
The one who hears the words of the Kingdom of God and does not understand them, the devil comes and steals what is sown in his heart, and this is what I likened to the seed that fell on the road.
And whoever plants in the barren land, this is the one who will hear the words of God and accept them with joy.
But the word of God did not take root in his heart, and his faith remained only for a short time, and when problems and trials came, he quickly turned away from faith.
And what is planted in the middle of thorns, is what hears the word of God, but the cares of this world and the love of money choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
"As for what is sown in the cultivated land, it is what hears the word of God and understands it, and it is what yields a crop, some shoots a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty." The taral of the weeds is in the middle of the wheat.
And Jesus gave them another parable, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
And when the people were asleep, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.
And when the plant grew and produced grain, the weeds also grew along with it.
They called the servants of the house owner and asked him: "Sir, is it the beautiful seed that you planted in your field?" "Yes, where did this thistle come from?"
He answers them: "This is not the enemy who did this." And they tell him his servants: "What do you want us to do with him?"
And he answered them, saying, "No, lest when ye dig for the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.
The wheat and the weeds grow together until the harvest, and at that time the reapers will gather the weeds, throw them into bundles to be burned, and collect the wheat to be stored in my barn." The value of a mustard seed and the value of yeast
And he told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field.
Waacha is the little one in love, when she grows up she will be a tree as big as the whole garden, and the birds of the sky will come to nest in her branches."
And he gave them another parable, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a woman who took three measures of flour and mixed it with three measures of flour until the whole dough was leavened." Jesus spoke in parables.
And all this Jesus said to the crowds of people in Bethlehem, and without exception He did not say a single thing to them.
Let the words of the prophet be fulfilled: "We speak with the one who created us and tell everything that was hidden from the day the world was created." The meaning of this is the example of the weeds.
And when the disciples came back to him, they said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
"And he answered them, saying, 'He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man."
The field is the world, the good wheat is the children of God's kingdom, and the weeds are the children of Satan.
The enemy who sowed the weeds is Satan, the harvest is the end of time, and the reapers are the angels.
And as the thistle gathers and burns with health, so it falls to the dust of time:
Man will accuse his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom all the things that caused sin and all those who sinned.
They throw them into the abyss of health, for that is where the crying and the gnashing of teeth will be.
But those who obey God will be like the sun in their kingdom. Oh, those who have some devotion, listen!" The metal of the treasure, the jewel, and the net.
"And the kingdom of heaven is like a man who found a treasure hidden in a field, and he went and sold all that he had and bought that field."
And the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant who was looking for fine pearls,
I found a very expensive gem, I sold everything I had and bought it."
"And the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind."
Many years ago, the fishermen took her out to the sea and sat down and began to separate her, the good ones they put in the baskets and the ones that were not good they threw away.
And he will be in the end of time: the angels will come and separate the sinners from those who are waiting for God.
The sinners are thrown into the abyss of misery, where the crying and the gnashing of teeth will be.” The new and the old treasure
And Jesus asked his disciples, "What do you understand all this?" And they answered, "Eh!"
He says to them: "Yes, because of this, every scholar of the law knows the kingdom of heaven, it is like a man who comes out of his treasure everything new and old." Nazareth did not accept Jesus.
And just as Jesus had done, he walked away.
He returned to his hometown of Nazareth, and as people knew him, they would visit him to pray, and they would be amazed and ask, "Where did he get this wisdom and these miracles from?"
Is this the carpenter's son? Is this the one you called Mary, and his brothers are James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
"And are all the other families living in our city?" "Where did all this come from?"
What amazed them was not the situation, but Jesus told them: "The prophet is respected everywhere, not in his own country, and in his family" John 4:44.
And Darash Fadiq is a place with a lot of miracles where they have no faith.
The chapter of the beheading of John the Baptist
Wasting no time, Herod the ruler heard the news about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist, who was raised from the dead. That is why miracles are being performed by him."
Where Herod had John the Baptist beheaded and thrown into prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip. Luke
Later, John would tell me, "It's okay for you to marry her."
And he wanted to kill him, but he was afraid of the people because they believed he was a prophet.
And at Herod's birthday party, Herodias' daughter danced, and Herod was delighted.
This is why he swore an oath to give her what she asked for.
And when Herod's birthday was over, his daughter asked for something, and she said to Herod: "Bring me the head of John the Baptist now, in a plate!"
The king was sad, but before the oath he had sworn and the people who were present, he ordered that she be given what she wanted.
The groom who cut John's head is in prison.
He went to one of the tables and gave it to the girl, and she loved it.
John's disciples, his mother and his brothers came to him, and they stood outside, and sent to him, calling him. Jesus commanded a great multitude of five thousand to sit down on the grass, and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before the multitude.
And when Jesus heard these things, he went away from there into a ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.
And when he came down from the Phulaka, he saw a large group of people, and he went to them and cured their sick.
And when evening came, his students approached him and said, "The situation is bad and we are in this state, so tell the people's groups to go to the villages to buy food for their heads."
But Jesus said to them, "They do not need to go away. Give them something to eat yourselves."
"I said to him, 'We only have five loaves of bread and two fish here.'"
I said to them, "Look at them here!"
He commands the groups of people to sit on the spring. And he took those five loaves of bread and two fish, and he raised his eyes to heaven and gave thanks to God. And when he had broken the loaves, he gave them to his disciples, and the disciples gave them to the groups of people.
And they all ate until they were full, and then they collected twenty large baskets full of bread that they had brought.
And the Hadoukou who ate five thousand, without wives and children. Jesus walked on the water
Jesus told his disciples to get on the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.
And he would go to the mountain alone to pray. He stayed alone until evening.
The fluke of this fish was found far out at sea and it was overpowered by the current, and later the wind was against it.
And early in the morning, Jesus came to his disciples, walking on the water.
And when they saw the children walking on the water, they were terrified and said, "It's a ghost!" And they were afraid because of the fear.
Wafdiyak al-sahra, takallam ma'ahum Isa wa qal: "Tashjidu, Ana huwa, ma takhaffafoo!"
He said to him, "Peter, unless you are he, tell me to come to you while walking on the water."
And he said to him, "Come!" And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when he saw the strong wind, he fell and began to drown, and he cried out, "Rescue me, my Lord!"
And Jesus stretched out his hand, touched him, and said to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
And when they went out to the boat, the wind died down.
Wahdok who were in the Flouka prostrated themselves before him and said: "In truth, he is the son of God." Jesus healed many people from their diseases in Genesareth.
And Jesus and his disciples went to the other side of the sea, and came to the country of the Gerasenes.
They knew him as Malin Deik Al-Bilad, and they all told him about their news, and they brought him all their sick people.
They asked him to touch his brother, who was not a believer. And whoever he touched would be healed.
Chapter 15 discusses the custom of the elders.
And after that, two of the Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem. They asked him,
"Why don't your students follow the tradition of the elders? They don't wash their hands before eating."
But he answered them and said: "And why should we disobey the commandment of God in order to follow your custom?"
Where God says: "Thalia in your back and your pocket, and whoever has no special reason should be killed."
But we say: whoever called for it or asked for it: that's what I wanted to help you with, and I gave it as a gift to God.
What remains is for him to be silent and obey. And this is the word of God so that you follow your custom.
O hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied against you and said:
These people praise me with their mouths, but their hearts are far from me.
And it is useless for them to worship me, for they know the teachings that are not the commandments of God." The things that they teach people.
I shouted at the people and told them: "Listen and understand:
"What goes into the mouth is what makes a man king, but what comes out of the mouth is what makes him a king."
And after that, he went to his disciples and said to them, "What do you think? Why do the Pharisees grieve when they hear your words?"
"And he answered them, saying, 'Whoever does not plant what he has not sown will be reaped from what he has sown.'"
Let them! Hadoc are blind, so if they were blind, blindness would be blind, they would throw two into a pit." Luke
And Gall said to him, "Peter, tell us the meaning of this metal!"
He responds: "And even after we finished, I still didn't understand?"
And don't you know that everything that goes into a man's mouth goes to his stomach, and then comes out of his body?
But the one that comes out of the mouth, it comes out of the heart and it is the one that makes us regret. When
Later, the heart gets rid of bad ideas: like the slain, corruption of the married and the unmarried, theft, false testimony, and slander.
And this is what kings do to people, but food with unwashed hands does not pollute a person." The faith of the Canaanite woman
And Jesus went out from Tyre and entered Sidon.
And a Canaanite woman came from those regions and began to cry out, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely demon-possessed."
But he didn't even answer her with a word. His students approached him and asked him, "Leave her alone, and we'll follow you later and get you out!"
Jesus answered them and said, "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to accomplish His work."
But the woman came and prostrated herself before him and said, "Help me, my lord!"
He replied, "It's not reasonable to give the children's bread to the dogs."
"What?" the woman said. "But even dogs eat from the rivers that they throw from the fields of those who have nothing."
Jesus replied, "Your faith is great. May it be done for you as you wish." And her daughter was healed at once.
And after that, Jesus went from there to the region of Tyre and Sidon, and entered a house, and did not want anyone to know it; but he could not escape notice.
Many people came to him, and they brought the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
The crowds were amazed when they saw the blind receiving sight, the lame walking, the crippled being healed, the blind seeing, and the lowly being lifted up. Jesus gave the good news to the poor.
Jesus turned to his disciples and said to them, "Stay with these people, and the next three days they will be with me, and they have nothing to eat. I don't want to feed them hungry so they don't get lost on the way."
They ask their students, "Where are we going to get enough bread to feed a large group like this?"
And Jesus said to them, "How many loaves of bread do you have?" They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."
And Jesus commanded the multitude that they should sit down on the ground.
Hodadoc gave seven loaves of bread and fish, and he gave thanks to God, broke them, and gave them to his disciples, and his disciples gave them to the crowds of people.
And they all ate until they were full, and the seven doors were filled with the bread they had brought.
And the people who ate were one quarter of the men, not including wives and children.
And Jesus took the people to the other side, and he got on the boat and went to the country of Magadan.
Chapter 5: The Signs of the Times
And there came to him two of the Pharisees and Sadducees, to tempt him, and asked him to show them a sign from heaven. Matthew
But he answered them and said: "When the sun sets, they say: the sky will not be clear, so why is the sky red?"
And in the morning, Bakri Kittolo said: Today it will be cold, that's why the sky is red and cloudy. You can explain the weather, but the signs of the times cannot be explained!
Ugly and corrupt generation that demands a sign, and it will not be given to them even a sign like the sign of Jonah." And after they left Jesus, he went away. Matthew 12:39; Luke 11:29 The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
And when the children reached the other side of the sea, they took the bread with them.
And Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees!" Luke
They say with their heads: "They will tell us this later so that we won't take bread with us."
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them, "Why do you have doubts in your hearts? Do you still have no faith?"
And still I don't understand? And how could you not understand about the five loaves of bread that you distributed to five thousand people, and how many baskets did you collect from the streets of bread? When?
And did you understand about the seven loaves of bread that were divided among four thousand people and how many baskets did you collect?
How could you not understand that I did not mean bread with my words? Free yourselves from the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!"
And behold, the disciples, when they understood, said to the people, "Do not teach the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees, but rather from the leaven of bread." Peter testified that Jesus is the Christ.
And when Jesus came to Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"
They answered him, "Some of them say, 'John the Baptist,' and some say, 'Elijah,' and others say, 'Jeremiah or one of the prophets.'" Matthew
"And they said, 'Who are we that we should help you?'"
And Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!" John
And Jesus said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
And I say to you: Peter, on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
And we give you the key to the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will have been loosed in heaven." When
And after that, Jesus instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus prophesied his death and his departure.
And from that hour, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer greatly at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.
Peter grabbed him by the side and began to argue with him, saying, "God forbid, my lord, that you should do such a thing!"
He glanced at Gal and said to Peter, "After me, this devil! You curse the family, so why do you think about people's affairs, not God's affairs?"
He says Jesus to his disciples: "Only one wants to follow me, especially to allow his thoughts and to shake his cross and follow me, whenever
Later, the one who wants to save his life will lose it, but the one who loses his life for me will save it. When?
What is more beneficial to people than earning the whole world and wasting their lives? And what is going to give people in return for their lives?
The way it will go is that the son of man will come with his angels, and then each one will be judged according to his works.
And I tell you the truth: there are some of those who are here who will not die until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
Chapter 17 Jesus praises the glory of God
And after six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and his brother John, and brought them up onto a high mountain by themselves.
And the shape of it changed before them, and its face became like the sun, and its limbs became like shining light.
It appears to them that Moses and Elijah are speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "How good we are to be here, my Lord. If you wish, we can make three shelters here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And while they were gazing up into heaven at his departure, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; who also said, "Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven." Acts 1:17,18
And when the students heard this, they fell on their faces and were very afraid.
Jesus approached them, touched them, and said to them, "Rise, do not be afraid!"
And they stared at him, and he saw only Jesus.
And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
His students asked him, "Why do you say that the scholars of the law say that only the prophet Elijah can come?"
And he answered them and said: "Truly, Elijah Gigi is the one who can fix everything."
But we tell you: Elijah has come and they did not recognize him, and they did to him as they pleased. And so also the Son of Man will suffer at their hands." Mat 17:12
And behold, the hour came when the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus was revealing a possessed child.
And when Jesus and his disciples arrived at the people's community, a man came to him and bowed down to him.
WGAL: "My son's blessing, my Lord, there are many winds and many times they will fall ill and die."
"His meal for the children and they couldn't heal him."
Jesus answered and said, "O faithless generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring the boy here to me!"
Jesus rose up and the demon went out of the boy, and the boy was cured at once.
And they came near to Jesus and asked him privately, "Why can we not cast out this demon?"
I said to them, "Because of your little faith! I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you." [Matthew 17:20]
"And this kind of madness only comes out in prayer and fasting."] # 17.21 This verse is not found in many of the old manuscripts Matthew 21:21; Mark 11:23; 1 Corinthians 13:2 Jesus prophesies once again about his death and his departure."
The disciples were gathered in the land of Galilee, and Jesus said to them, "Man is delivered into the hands of men."
And they killed him, and the third day he was taken up." And the disciples were very sorrowful. Jesus saved the tax of the house of God
And when Jesus and his disciples returned to Capernaum, they came to Peter and asked him, "Did not your teacher pay the temple tax?"
And he answered them, "Yes, what is it that you are doing?" And when he entered the house, Jesus anticipated him and said, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect tribute or tax? From their own children or from others?"
Peter replied, "From the foreigner." Jesus said, "Then their children are exempt from the tax."
But so that we don't cause them any trouble, go to the sea and cast your line, and the lucky fish you catch will open its mouth, and you will find four dirhams inside, take them and go, it's over for you and for me."
