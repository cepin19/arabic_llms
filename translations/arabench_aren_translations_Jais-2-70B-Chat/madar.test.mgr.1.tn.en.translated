Intrigued by the first part, "Inside by a member," seems to be a mistranslation or a misunderstanding of the original intent. Without more context, it's difficult to provide a precise translation of this phrase. As for the second part, "Tsuride by a piano?", it appears to be a fragment of a sentence rather than a complete thought. "Tsuride" seems to be a misspelling or a non-standard romanization of a Japanese word, possibly related to "tsuredashita" (the past tense of "tsuredasu," meaning "to attach oneself to," "to follow," or "to cling to"). If "Tsuride by a piano?" is intended to convey a meaning similar to the potential interpretation of "Tsuride" as related to "tsuredasu," the sentence might be interpreted as asking whether a piano is following or clinging to someone. However, this interpretation is highly speculative and relies on a series of assumptions about the intended meaning of the phrase "Tsuride by a piano?". In conclusion, without more context, it is not possible to provide a definitive translation of the phrase "Inside by a member. Tsuride by a piano?". The potential interpretations offered above are based on a combination of linguistic analysis, cultural assumptions, and a degree of speculative interpretation.
