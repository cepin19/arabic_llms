Who is the greatest?
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Then Jesus called a child to him and set him among them,
And He said, "Truly I say to you, unless you are converted and become like children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.
Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
"Whoever accepts such a child in my name accepts me." Warning about stumbling blocks.
«But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, would be better off if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.
Woe to the world because of the stumbling blocks which must come, but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes!
Therefore, if your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you! It is better for you to enter into eternal life, having one hand or one foot cut off, than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire.
And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away from you! For it is better for you to enter the life of heaven with one eye, than to have two eyes and be thrown into the hell of fire." The Lost Sheep
Jesus said, "Beware of belittling one of my humble disciples. For I tell you that the angels entrusted with their protection always see the face of my Father who is in heaven."
For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.
What do you think about a man who has a hundred sheep, and out of them one goes astray? Will he not leave the ninety-nine sheep on the mountain and go and look for the sheep that went astray?
I tell you the truth, when he finds it, he will be more delighted with it than with the ninety and nine sheep which have not strayed.
Thus also, your Father who is in heaven does not want to lose one of my humble disciples. Reconcile with your brother.
If your brother wrongs you, go to him and talk to him privately. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.
But if he will not listen to you, then take one or two more with you, that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. #Two or three witnesses. 16:18 See Deuteronomy 19:15.
If he refuses to listen to them, tell the church. If he refuses to listen to the church, then you are to treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
"I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. And whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
I tell you the truth, if two of you agree on any matter that you may pray about, then my Father who is in heaven will do it for them.
Because if two or three gather in my name, I am there among them.» Unconditional forgiveness
Then Peter came to Jesus and said to him, "Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?"
Jesus said to him, "Not only seven times, but up to seventy-seven times! And each time seven times!" #سبعين … مرات. 22:18, that is, without limit.
Therefore, the kingdom of heaven can be compared to a king who decided to settle accounts with his servants.
And when he began to settle his accounts, a man was brought to him who owed him a very large sum of money. #A very large sum of money. 24:18 Literally: "Ten thousand talents or minas, which is equivalent to approximately 300,000 kilograms of the coins used at that time."
And since he did not possess what would cover the debt, the master decided that the debtor, along with his wife, children, and all that he possessed, should be sold, and that the price should be used to pay off the debt.
"Then the servant fell on his knees before the king and pleaded with him, saying, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back the whole debt.' "
The master took pity on him, and completely forgave him the debt, letting him go.
And as he was going, he found one of his fellow slaves, who owed him a small amount of money. So he seized him by the throat and began to strangle him, saying to him, "Pay what you owe me."
The servant fell on his knees before him and begged, saying, "Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything."
But he refused to do that; instead, he took him and threw him in prison until he pays all his debt.
And when the other slaves saw what had happened, they were very sad, and they went to tell their master everything that had happened.
«So his master called him and said to him, 'You wicked slave, I forgave you all the debt that was owed to you because you pleaded with me.
» ألم يكن عليك أن ترحم العبد رفيقك كما رحمتك أنا أيضا؟«
And his master was very angry, and delivered him to be punished until he should pay all his debt.
«This is how my heavenly Father will also treat each of you, if each of you does not forgive his brother from his heart.»
The union in marriage.
And after Jesus finished speaking about these things, he left the region of Galilee and went into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan River.
And great crowds of people followed him, and he healed them there.
And some Pharisees came to Jesus, trying to test him. They said, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for just any reason?"
Jesus replied, "Haven't you read in the Scriptures that from the beginning 'God made them male and female?' #creation ... and female. 4:19 From the book of Genesis 1:27, 5:2.
Then he said: "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall unite with his wife, and they shall become one flesh." #leaves…one. 5:19 From the Book of Genesis 2:24.
And so they are no longer two, but one. No one should separate what God has brought together."
They said to him, "Why then did Moses command to give a wife a certificate of divorce, #divorcecertificate. 7:19 See Deuteronomy 24:1. so she would send her away?"
Jesus answered them, "Moses allowed you to divorce because of the hardness of your hearts, but it was not like that in the beginning."
Therefore I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, unless she commits adultery, and marries another, commits adultery."
His disciples said to him, "If this is the case between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry!"
Jesus said to them, "Not everyone can accept this teaching, unless one is given the ability by God.
There are men who cannot get married because they were born without the ability to get married. And there are men who cannot get married because people have taken away their ability to get married. And there are men who have chosen not to get married for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept this teaching, let them accept it.' Jesus welcomes children.
Then they brought children to him so that he might lay his hands on them and pray, but his disciples rebuked them.
Then Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Then Jesus laid his hands on them, and having left that place, he went up into Galilee. The hindrance of riches.
And a man came to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?"
Jesus answered him, "Why do you ask me about what is good? You know that the only good is God. But if you want eternal life, you must obey the commandments."
The man said, "What commandments?" Jesus said, " 'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal.' "
Do not bear false witness, honor your father and your mother. #Do not kill … and your mother. 19:19 From the Book of Exodus 20:12-16, and the Book of Deuteronomy 5:16-20. And "you shall love your neighbor #your neighbor. 19:19 Referring to the Gospel of Luke 10:25-37, we understand that the meaning of the neighbor is every human being in need of help. As you love yourself." #You love … yourself. 19:19 From the Book of Leviticus 19:18.
The young man said to him, "I have obeyed all these commandments. What more do I lack?"
Jesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor. Then you will have treasure in heaven. And come, follow me."
When the young man heard that, he went away sad, for he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven.
I tell you again, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."
When his disciples heard this, they were astonished and said, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said to them, "This is impossible for people, but with God, all things are possible."
Then Peter said to him, "See, we have left everything to follow you. What then will be our reward?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly, I say to you, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne in the new age, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake, will receive a hundred times more and will inherit eternal life with God.»
Many are the first of the people who will become the last of the people, and many are the last of the people who will become the first of the people.
Like the vineyard workers.
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who was a landowner, who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
And he agreed with the workers that he would pay them one dinar for each day, then he sent them to work in his vineyard.
And the landowner went out at about the ninth hour and saw some people standing in the market place doing nothing.
So he said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will give you the reward you deserve.'
So they went to work in the vineyard. And he went out again about the eleventh hour, and again about the third hour, and he hired other laborers.
And around the fifth hour, he went out again and found others standing in the market area. He asked them, «Why have you stood all day without doing anything?»
They said to him, 'No one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'
And at the end of the day, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager: 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with those who came last, and ending with those who came first.'
So those who were hired came at the fifth hour, and each one of them received a dinar.
Then those who were hired first came, thinking they would receive more. Each of them also received a dinar.
So they took it, and they began to grumble about the owner of the vineyard.
And they say: "Those who were hired last of all, worked only one hour, and yet you paid them the same as you paid us, even though we toiled all day in the scorching sun!"
The owner of the vineyard said to one of them, "I have not wronged you, my friend! Did you not agree with me to work for one dinar?"
Take your pay and go. I want to give the worker I hired at the end of the day the same pay I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with what I own? Or are you jealous because I'm good with others?
«Thus the first shall be last, and the last shall be first.» Jesus foretells his death and resurrection.
And it came to pass, as Jesus went to Jerusalem, that he took the twelve disciples aside privately, and he said unto them:
Here we are going to the city of Jerusalem where the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and teachers of the law, and they will condemn him to death.
And they will deliver him to the unbelievers, so that they may mock him and scourge him and crucify him. But on the third day he will rise from the dead.» The greatest is the one who serves.
Then the mother of my sons, James and John, came to him with her two sons, and she bowed down to him, asking him for something.
Jesus said to her, "What do you want?" She said to him, "Promise me that these two sons of mine will sit in your kingdom, one on your right and the other on your left."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am to drink?" They said to him, "We can."
He said to them, "You will certainly drink from my cup, but as for sitting at my right or my left, that is not mine to give; it belongs only to those for whom my Father in heaven has prepared a place."
When the remaining ten heard this request, they were very angry with the two brothers.
Then Jesus called them to him and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
But this should not be among you; but whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.
Whoever wants to be first among you must be your servant.
Jesus also said, "Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.» Jesus heals two blind men
And as they were leaving the city of Jericho, great multitudes of people followed him.
And as Jesus was passing by, He heard a crowd going before Him. And He said to His disciples, "I tell you the truth, not one of those men who are trying to force Me to become their king will ever see the kingdom of God!" And He said, "The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed; nor will they say, 'Behold, it is here!' or 'There!' for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you." And He said, "To what shall I compare the kingdom of God? It is like a mustard seed, which, when it is sown, is the smallest of all the seeds; but when it is sown, it grows up and becomes larger than any other plant, and puts out large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its branches." And He spoke many other parables. And when He was alone, those around Him, along with the chief priests and scribes, were plotting to arrest Him secretly and kill Him. But they said, "Not during the feast, lest a riot occur among the people." And when Jesus knew that they were plotting to seize and kill Him, He withdrew from that place. And large numbers of people learned about this and followed Him. And Jesus said to them, "I assure you that you are seeking Me, not because you have seen signs, but because you ate the loaves and were filled. Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you, for on Me God has set His seal." And many of those who were now convinced that Jesus was the Messiah, and who had been given power to cast out demons, went out into every city, proclaiming the message of God's kingdom. And they who had believed were baptized, and they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, to fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to prayer. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved. Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, that is, the ninth hour. And while they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple guard approached them, being upset because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus' name the resurrection from the dead. And they arrested them and placed them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening. But many of those who had heard the message believed; and the number of the men who believed grew to about five thousand. And those who had believed were baptized, and they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. And fear came over every soul, for many wonders and signs were being performed by the apostles. And all who believed were together and had all things in common; and they sold their possessions and goods and distributed them to all, as anyone had need. And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
And the people rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they raised their voices even more: "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us."
Jesus stopped and called them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
And they said, "Lord, open our eyes."
Jesus had compassion on them, touched their eyes, and immediately they saw and followed him.
Long live the king.
As they approached the city of Jerusalem and came to the village of Bethphage, near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,
And he said to them, "Go to the village before you. And you will find a young donkey beside its mother, both tied. Untie them and bring them to me."
And if anyone says anything to you, tell him, 'The Lord needs them, and he will send them back soon.' "
This happened so that what the prophet had said would come true:
«Say to the beloved city Zion: #the beloved Zion. 5:21 Literally "the daughter Zion." Behold, your king is coming to you, humble and riding on a donkey, a young donkey the offspring of a beast of burden prepared for work.
So the two disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.
So they brought the young donkey and its mother, and they placed their clothes on them. Jesus sat on the clothes.
Most people spread their cloaks on the road. But others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
And the crowds of people who were walking in front of Him and behind Him were shouting, "Long live the King!" #LongLiveTheKing 9:21 Literally: "Hosanna." Its meaning in Hebrew is: "Save now." It is most likely here a shout of praise to God and His Anointed King. Repeated in verse 15. Long live the Son of David. "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." Long live the King in His glory."
And when Jesus entered the city of Jerusalem, the whole city shook. And the people were asking, "Who is this man?"
The crowds that followed him said, "This is the prophet Jesus, who is from the town of Nazareth in the region of Galilee." Jesus in the Temple
Then Jesus entered the temple court and drove out all those who were buying and selling in the temple court. And he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the benches of those who sold doves.
And He said to them: «It is written: 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' #MyHouse…aPrayerHouse. 13:21 From the Book of Isaiah 56:7. But you are making it into #aDenOfThieves. 13:21 From the Book of Jeremiah 7:11. »
And as he was entering the court of the Temple, some blind and lame people came to him, and he healed them.
And the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did, and the children shouting in the temple area: «Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!» And they were indignant and said to him: «Do you hear what these children are saying?»
Jesus answered, "Yes, but haven't you read in the Scriptures: 'From the mouths of children and infants, you have established praise'?
Then Jesus left them and went out of the city to the town of Bethany, and he spent the night there. The power of faith
And as Jesus was going up early in the morning to the city, he became hungry.
And seeing a fig tree by the roadside, he went to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. And he said to it, "Nevermore shall you bear fruit." And immediately the fig tree withered away.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and asked him, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"
Jesus answered them, "Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you tell this mountain, 'Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' it will be done.
And whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.» Doubting Jesus' authority
And Jesus went to the temple courts, and the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him while he was teaching, and they said to him, "Tell us, by what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered them, "I will also ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things:
From where did John's baptism come? From God or from men?» So they began to argue with one another, saying, «If we say, 'From God,' he will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
And if we say that it is from among the people, then we fear the people, because they all consider John to be a prophet.»
Therefore they answered Jesus and said, "We don't know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." The Parable of the Two Sons
And Jesus said, "What do you think about the following story: A man had two sons. He went to the first son and said to him, 'My son, go and work today in my vineyard.'"
The son answered, "I don't want to go." But he changed his mind and went.
"Then the father went to his other son and asked him for the same thing. The son replied, 'Yes, sir, I will go.' But he did not go."
Which of the two sons did the will of the father?» They said, «The first.» He said to them, «I tell you the truth, the tax collectors and the prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God ahead of you.
Because John the Baptist came to show you the way of truth, and you did not believe in him, but tax collectors and prostitutes did believe in him. And even when you saw what they did, you did not repent and believe in him. Like the son of the vineyard owner.
Listen to another parable: A certain man planted a vineyard, and put a hedge about it, and dug a place for the wine vat, and built a tower. And he leased the vineyard to farmers, and went into a far country. (Note: This translation is based on the World English Bible, a public domain translation.)
And when the time came to gather the grapes, he sent his servants to the tenants to obtain his share of the grapes.
But the peasants seized his slaves, beat one of them, killed another, and stoned another.
So the owner sent even more slaves than he had sent the first time. But the peasants treated them in exactly the same way.
Finally, he sent his son, saying to himself, "They will respect my son."
But when the farmers saw that this was the owner's son, they consulted among themselves and said, "This is the heir; let us kill him so that we may seize his inheritance."
So they seized him and cast him outside the vineyard and killed him.
What do you think the owner of the vineyard will do to those tenant farmers when he returns?
They said to him, "He will deal with them terribly because they are evil, and then he will give the vineyard to other farmers who will give him the fruit in the season of fruit."
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what was written: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"
Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation that produces the fruit of the kingdom.
For whoever falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and if this stone falls on anyone, it will crush him!
And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables, they understood that he was speaking about them.
Therefore, they tried to arrest him, but they were afraid of the people, who considered Jesus to be a prophet.
Like a wedding feast.
And Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.
The king sent his servants to invite the guests to the wedding feast, but they would not come.
"Then the king sent other servants and said to them, 'Tell those who are invited, "The feast is ready. The oxen and the fattened calves have been killed. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast." ' "
But the invited guests did not pay attention to it, and each one went his own way. One went to work in his field, and another to his business.
As for the rest, they seized the king's slaves, beat them, and killed them.
Then the king became angry and sent his army, who killed those murderers and burned their city.
"Then the king said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those invited guests were not worthy of it.'"
Therefore go out into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here everyone you find.
So they went out into the streets and gathered together everyone they could find, both good and bad, until the banqueting hall was filled with guests.
And when the king went in to see the guests, he saw a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
The king said to him, "O friend, how did you enter here when you are not wearing the bridal attire?" But the man remained silent.
The king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet, and cast him outside into the darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"Because many are called, but few are chosen.» The Pharisees are trying to trap Jesus.
So the Pharisees went out and conspired to entrap Jesus with his own words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with some people from Herod's group. And they said to him, "Teacher, we know that you are true and teach the way of God with all sincerity. And that you do not flatter anyone, because you do not look at people's positions."
So tell us your opinion, is it permissible to pay taxes to Caesar or not?»
But Jesus knew their evil intent, and said to them, "You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?
"Show me the coinage you use." So they brought him a dinar.
He said to them, "Whose is this imprint and this name engraved on the dinar?"
They said to him, "They are for Caesar." But he said to them, "Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
When they heard this answer, they were very astonished, left him, and went on their way. The Sadducees Try to Entrap Jesus
And on that day, some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him,
"Teacher," he said, "Moses wrote… #Moses wrote. 24:22 See Deuteronomy 25:5,6. If a man dies without having a child, his brother shall marry his widow and raise up a descendant for his brother."
There were seven brothers among us. The eldest married and died, having no children. His next brother married his widow.
And it happened to the brother, the second, the third, and even the seventh.
And after they all died, the woman died too.
So which of the seven will she be a wife to on the Day of Resurrection? For they all married her."
Jesus answered them, "You are in error, because you do not know the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
Understand that in the eternal life after the resurrection of the dead, people do not get married nor do they give their daughters away in marriage; rather, they are like the angels in heaven.
Regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God said?
"I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." I am Jacob. 32:22 From the Book of Exodus 3:6. "The Lord is not a man, that he should repent; neither is he the son of man, that he should number his generations; for I am the Lord, and I change not." "The living, the living, the living praise the name of the Lord. The dead, the dead, the dead praise the name of the Lord."
When the people heard these words, they were very amazed by his teaching. The greatest commandment.
And when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they assembled together.
And a legal expert asked him, attempting to trap him, saying:
"Rabbi, what is the greatest commandment in the Law?"
Jesus said to him: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind." #You shall love the Lord ... your mind. 37:22 From the Book of Deuteronomy 6:5.
This is the first and great commandment,
The second commandment is like the first: 'Love your friend #your friend. 39:22 Referring to the Gospel of Luke 10:25-37, we understand that the intended friend is every person in need of help. As you love yourself.' #Love your friend… yourself. 39:22 From the Book of Leviticus 19:18.
The entire Law and the books of the Prophets pertain to these two commandments.» Christ the Lord of David
And as the Pharisees were gathered around him, Jesus asked them:
"What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?" The Pharisees answered him, "He is the son of David."
He said to them, "Then how did David call him 'Lord' when he said, being led by the Spirit:
«The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies Your footstool"?»
If David calls the Messiah 'Lord,' how can he be his son?
No one could answer him with anything, and no one dared after that to ask him more questions.
Jesus criticizes the religious clergy.
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds of people and to His disciples.
He said, "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees claim that Moses is their authority in regard to the law."
Therefore, keep and practice all that they tell you, but do not do their deeds. For they say, and do not act according to what they say.
They exhaust people with burdens that are difficult to bear, while they themselves do not wish to make any effort to follow them.
"All the righteous deeds that they do, they do only so that people may see them. And they make a display of their piety, thus increasing the size of their tassels #their_tassels. 5:23 Some Jews used to write certain sections from the Scriptures and put them into small leather bags, which they then fastened with cloth tassels to the front of the head or the left arm, thus displaying their intense devotion. , and they lengthen the fringes of their garments."
They love to sit in the best seats at banquets and in the front rows at synagogues.
And they like people to greet them with special greetings in the marketplaces, and to call them: "Teacher."
«But you, do not let anyone call you: 'Teacher.' For you have one teacher, and all of you are brothers.»
And do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
And do not let people call you 'Rabbi,' because you have only one teacher, the Messiah.
The greatest among you will be your servant.
For everyone who exalts himself, God will humble him; and everyone who humbles himself, God will exalt him.
«Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces. For you neither enter into the kingdom of heaven, nor yet allow those that are entering to go in.
Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law who show off your piety! For you are like unmarked tombs, and people walk over them without knowing it. You are like wells that are newly dug, but people fall in and die because of them.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel across sea and land to win over one follower. And when you have succeeded, you make him twice as much a child of hell as you yourselves are.
«Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, he is not bound to keep his oath; but if he swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound to keep his oath!'»
O blind fools! Which is greater: the gold that is in the temple, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
And you say, 'If he swears by the altar, he is not bound to keep his vow; but if he swears by the offering on the altar, he is bound to keep his vow!'
Unto the Unseeing! Which is greater: the offering upon the altar, or the altar that makes the offering holy?
For if anyone swears by the altar, he is bound to do all that is on it.
If anyone swears by the temple, he is swearing by it and by the one who lives in it.
If anyone swears by the heaven, he is swearing by the throne of God and by the one who sits on it.
«Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe even on the mint and the dill and the cumin, but you have disregarded the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without disregarding the others.
O blind guides, you strain out the gnat from your drink, but you swallow the camel whole!
«Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but are full of decay and death on the inside.
You blind Pharisees! First clean the inside of the cup, so that the outside may also become clean.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside, but inside they are full of the bones of the dead and all sorts of uncleanliness.
You are also like this, appearing righteous outwardly, but your inward parts are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
«Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and you decorate the tombs of the righteous.
And you say, "If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not have been partners in the killing of the prophets."
And in this way you affirm that you are the descendants of those who killed the prophets.
Complete what your ancestors began.
" 'You snakes, you offspring of vipers! How will you escape the condemnation of hell? ' "
Therefore, I tell you, I will pour out my Spirit upon all people. And your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams. Even on my menservants and maidservants, in those days I will pour out my Spirit.
Therefore you will be held responsible for the blood of all the innocent people who have been killed on earth: from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah. #Abel ... Zechariah. 35:23 The first and last of those who were killed according to the time and text of the Old Testament books. (See Genesis 4:8 and 2 Chronicles 24:20) Who was killed between the temple and the altar.
I tell you the truth, the punishment for all these crimes will fall on this generation. Jesus warns the people of the city of Jerusalem.
"O Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone the messengers of God who come to you! How often I have longed to gather your children together, like a hen gathering her chicks under her wings! But you have refused."
Behold, your home will be left empty and desolate for you!
Because I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' #Blessed… Lord. 39:23 From Psalm 118:26.»
Jesus Foretells the Destruction of the Temple.
And Jesus left the temple, and as he was walking, his disciples came to him, because they wanted to show him the buildings of the temple.
Jesus said to them, "Do you see all these buildings? I tell you the truth, not one stone will be left here upon another; for the whole will be torn down!"
While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, His disciples came to Him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of Your coming and the end of the age?"
Jesus answered them, "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
Many will come and claim to be me, saying, 'I am the Messiah,' and they will deceive many.
You will hear news of wars and revolutions; you should not be afraid. These things must happen, but it will not be the end of the world."
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes, famine, and pestilence in various places.
But all these things will be the beginning of the birth pains.
They will hand you over to be punished, and they will kill some of you. All nations will hate you because of my name.
At that time, many will fall away from the faith, and one will betray another to the authorities, and they will hate each other.
False prophets will appear and deceive many.
And because of the increase of evil, the love of many of the believers will cool off.
But the one who remains faithful until the end will be saved.
And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.
"When you see 'the unclean one who devastates,' #theuncleanonewhodevastates. 15:24 See the book of Daniel 9:27, 12:11, as well as Matthew 11:31. which the prophet Daniel referred to, standing in the holy place – let the reader understand this statement –"
Let all who are in the region of Judea flee to the mountains at that time.
And the one on the roof does not go down to take his possessions from the house.
And the worker in the field does not go back to his house to take his cloak.
And how difficult were the conditions of pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days!
But pray that your flight will not be in winter or on a Sabbath.
Because at that time there will be great distress, such as has not been since the beginning of the world, and never will be again.
And if God had not decreed to shorten those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of His chosen people, God will shorten those days.
If anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or 'There he is!' do not believe it.
Because false Messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders, to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
Here I am, I told you everything before it happened.
Someone might say, 'Behold, the Messiah is in the wilderness,' but do not go there. Or they might say, 'Behold, he is in a certain room,' but do not believe it.
For just as lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
And wherever you find the body, you will find the vultures also.
And immediately after the distress of those days, 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.'
"Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then will the tribes of the earth mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
And His angels will be sent with the sound of a loud trumpet, and they will gather His chosen ones from the four corners of the earth, from one end of the heavens to the other.
Learn from the fig tree: as soon as its branches become tender and its leaves appear, you know that summer is near.
Thus also when you see all these things, you will know that the time is #TheTime. 33:24 Compare with the Gospel of Luke 21:31. Near at the doors.
I tell you the truth: not one stone will be left here upon another; and all these things will come upon this generation.
The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
But no one knows when that day and that hour will be, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone knows.
And just as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving their daughters in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark.
For they did not know what would happen, until the flood came and swept them away. So will it be also in the coming of the Son of Man.
At that time, two men will be working in a field; one will be taken and the other left.
And two women will be grinding grain at the millstone, and one will be taken and the other will be left.
Therefore, be alert, because you do not know when your Lord will come.
Make sure that if the homeowner knew what hour of the night the thief intended to come, he would wake up and not let him rob his house.
Therefore, you also must be ready, for the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him. The Faithful and Evil Servants
Who is the trustworthy and wise servant whom the master has made responsible for his other servants, to give them food at the proper time?
Blessed is that servant whom his master finds doing his duty when he comes.
I tell you the truth, he will appoint him over all his possessions.
The evil servant says to himself, "My master will be delayed."
He begins to beat his fellow servants and starts to eat and drink with the drunkards.
So the master of that servant will come on a day when he is not expecting him, and at an hour that he does not know.
He will punish him and place him with the hypocrites, where people weep and grind their teeth.
Like the ten girls.
«Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them are stupid, and five are intelligent.
The foolish women took their lamps, but they did not take any extra oil with them.
The wise women, however, took extra oil in their jars with their lamps.
The groom was late, and all the girls got sleepy and fell asleep.
But at midnight someone shouted, "The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him."
Then the girls woke up and prepared their lamps.
And the foolish ones said to the wise ones: "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are about to go out."
The clever women replied, "We cannot, it is not enough for us. But go to the merchants to buy oil for yourselves."
And as they were going to buy oil, the bridegroom came. And they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast. And the door was shut.
"And finally, the other girls came and said, 'Sir, sir, open the door for us.'"
But he said, "I tell you the truth, I do not know you!"
Therefore, be watchful, because you do not know the day or the hour when the Son of Man will come, just like the three slaves.
«Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who was about to travel. He called his servants and entrusted his possessions to them, each according to his ability. And so he went on his journey. Now, the man who had received one talent went off at once and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money. But the man who had received five talents went off trading with them, and with his master's money made a great deal more. And the man who had received the one talent came back and said, 'Master, I knew that you are a hard man, reaping where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered; so I was afraid and went away and buried your talent; here it is, take it back.' But his master said to him, 'You wicked and lazy servant! You knew, did you, that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered? Well then, you should have put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected not only my own money, but the interest as well. So take the talent from this servant and give it to the one who has ten talents. For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away from him. And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.' »» And Jesus concluded his parables and said, «The kingdom of heaven is like a man who owned a vineyard. He put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he let the vineyard out to tenants and went to another country. When the grape harvest was near, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his produce. But the tenants seized his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another. Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did the same to them. Finally, he said to them, 'I will send my son, whom I love; he will surely get back the vineyard for me.' When the tenants saw the son coming, they said to each other, 'This is the heir; come, let's kill him and take his inheritance.' So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. When the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?' »» And Jesus said, «The kingdom of heaven is like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish and five were wise. The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them. The wise ones, however, took both their lamps and oil. As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep. At midnight there was a loud cry, 'Here is the bridegroom; come out to meet him!' Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. The foolish virgins said to the wise ones, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.' But the wise ones replied, 'There will not be enough for us and for you; go to the merchants and buy some for yourselves.' While they were going to buy it, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut. Later, the other virgins came and said, 'Master, master, open the door for us!' But he replied, 'I tell you the truth, I do not know you.' »» And Jesus concluded his parables and said, «The kingdom of heaven is like a net which was cast into the sea and gathered fish of every kind. When it was full, the men drew the net up to the shore and sat down to sort the fish. They threw the good fish into baskets, but the bad fish they threw away. So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the wicked from the righteous, and throw the wicked into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. »» And Jesus said, «The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is
He gave one of them five bags #five bags. 15:25 Literally "talents or quintals," and a talent is equivalent to about 27 to 36 kilograms of gold, silver, or copper. In money, he gave the second two bags and the third one bag. He gave each one according to his ability. Then he traveled immediately afterward.
The one who had received the five bags began to invest them immediately in trade, and he earned another five bags.
And the one who took the two bags did the same as the first, and earned two more bags.
As for the one who took one bag, he went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money there.
«And after a long time, the master of those slaves returned and began to settle accounts with them.»
So the one who took the five bags came, having earned another five bags, and said, "Sir, you gave me five bags, and here are another five bags that I earned."
And his master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful in a few things, so I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master.'
"Then the one who took the two bags came and said, 'Sir, you gave me two bags, and here are two more bags that I earned.' "
And his master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful in a few things, so I will put you in charge of many things. Come in, you who are blessed by my Lord!'
"Then the one who had taken one bag came and said, 'Sir, I know that you are a harsh man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not winnow.
And I was afraid of you, so I went and hid your bag in the ground. So take your money.
His master answered him, " 'You wicked and lazy slave! So you knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered?
Why did you not deposit my money in the bank, so that when I returned I could take my money with interest?
«Therefore, take the balance from him, and give it to the one who has the ten bags.
For to every one who has, more shall be given, and he shall have an abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has shall be taken away.
As for that useless servant, throw him outside into the darkness, where people weep and grind their teeth. The Son of Man will be his judge.
And when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, He will sit on His glorious throne.
Then all nations will be gathered before him. And he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats in his flock.
He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
"Then the King will say to those on His right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father. Take possession of the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.'
Because I was hungry and you gave me food. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you took me in.
I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you looked after me. I was in prison and you visited me.
Then the righteous will answer: 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?'
And when have we seen you a stranger and given you shelter, or naked and clothed you?
And when did we see you sick or imprisoned, so we could visit you?
The angel will say: "I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me."
"Then the King will say to those who stand on His left, 'Depart from Me, all you who are accursed, and go into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels.'
Because I was hungry and you did not give me food, and because I was thirsty and you did not give me drink.
I was a stranger and you did not take me in. I was naked and you did not clothe me. I was sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.
Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to you?'
"The angel will say, 'I tell you the truth, when you did not do it for one of these least brothers of mine, you did not do it for me.'"
And so the wicked go to eternal punishment, but the righteous go to eternal life.
Jewish leaders are planning to kill Jesus.
After Jesus had finished saying these things, he said to his disciples:
You know that the Passover is two days away, and the Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of His enemies to be crucified.
The chief priests and the elders of the people had assembled in the palace of the high priest Caiaphas.
And they plotted to seize Jesus by deception and kill him.
And they used to say, "We shouldn't do this during the feast, to avoid riots among the people." A woman pours perfume on Jesus.
While Jesus was in the village of Bethany at the home of Simon the Leper,
A woman came to him, and with her was a precious perfume in a bottle of alabaster. She poured it on his head while he was eating.
And when his disciples saw it, they were indignant, and said, "Why this waste?"
This perfume could have been sold for a large sum of money to be given to the poor."
Jesus perceived what they were discussing, and he said to them, "Why do you distress this woman? For she has done a magnificent thing for me."
The poor you will always have with you, #the poor … always. 11:26 See Deuteronomy 15:11. As for me, I will not always be with you.
I poured perfume on my body to prepare it for burial.
I tell you the truth: wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what this woman has done will also be told, in memory of her." Judas Iscariot Betrays Jesus
Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,
And he said to them, "What will you give me if I hand Jesus over to you?" And they made an agreement with him for thirty pieces of silver.
And from that moment, Judas began to look for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. At the Passover meal.
And on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to him and said to him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
Jesus said, "Go to so-and-so in the village and tell him, 'The Teacher says: My appointed time is near, and I will keep the Passover with my disciples at your house.' "
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover meal.
And when evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with his twelve disciples.
And as they were eating, he said to them, "Truly I say to you, one of you will betray me."
They were grieved, and began to ask him one after another, "Is it I, Lord?"
Jesus answered, "The one who dips his hand with me in the bowl is the one who will betray me.
"For just as the Son of Man is destined to go just as it is written about him, woe to the man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for him if he had never been born!»
Judas, who was going to betray him, asked him, "Is it I, Master?" And Jesus said to him, "You have said it yourself!" The Lord's Supper
And as they were eating, He took bread, and having given thanks, He broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is My body."
Then he took a cup of wine, gave thanks, and gave it to them saying: "Drink this, all of you.
For this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
And I say to you that I will not drink of this wine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of my Father."
After that, they sang some hymns and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus foretold Peter's denial.
Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will become a stumbling block to me this night. For it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' "
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you to Galilee."
Peter answered him, "Even if everyone else loses faith in you, I could never lose my faith in you."
Jesus said to him, "Truly I tell you, this very night before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
Peter said to him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you!" And all the disciples said the same thing. Jesus Prays Alone
Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemani, and he said to the disciples, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
And he took with him Peter and the sons of Zebedee, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and keep watch with me."
Jesus withdrew a little distance from them, knelt down, and, with his face to the ground, began to pray: "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup pass from me." #TheCup. 39:26. That is, the cup of suffering and agony. It is repeated in verse 42. . But not as I will, but as you will."
And coming to His disciples, He found them sleeping; and He said to Peter: "Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Even after an hour's worth of work, you still can't stay awake with me for just one hour?"
Be vigilant and pray, so that you are not tested. Your spirit desires this, but your body is weak.»
And He went away again and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, Your will be done."
Then he returned a second time and found them sleeping, because drowsiness had weighed down their eyes.
Leaving them behind, he went a third time to pray, and he spoke the very words he had spoken before.
Then he went back to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold, the time is fulfilled, and the Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of sinners."
Let us go. Here comes the man who betrayed me." Jesus is arrested.
And while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived with a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, having been sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
The traitor had given them a sign and said, "The one I kiss is the man you seek; seize him."
And he immediately came to Jesus and said to him, "Greetings, Teacher!" And he kissed him.
Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you have come for." Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him.
One of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Don't you realize that I can call on my Father, and he will send me more than twelve legions of angels immediately?
However, if you do, how will the books that declared these things would happen in this way be verified."
And at that moment, Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out against me with swords and clubs as you would against a criminal? I used to sit every day in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me!
But this happened so that what the prophets wrote would come true." Then all the disciples deserted him and fled! Jesus before the Jewish leaders
After that, those who had arrested him led him to the high priest Caiaphas's house, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
Peter, however, followed him at a distance. He entered the courtyard of the chief priest's house. Peter went in and sat down with the guards, to see how it would finally end.
And the chief priests and all the council of the Jews were seeking false testimony against Jesus to put him to death.
But they did not find, though many false witnesses came forward and said lies about him. Finally, two men came forward,
And they said, "This man #this man. 61:26 that is, Jesus, for even His enemies avoided uttering His name! said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.' "
The high priest stood up and said, "Will you not answer the charges these men are bringing against you?"
Jesus, however, remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God to tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
Jesus answered him, "I am; and you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of God, and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has blasphemed the Holy Spirit! What further proof do we need? You have heard him blaspheme God."
"What do you judge?" They answered, "He deserves to die."
Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists and reviled him.
And they would say to him, "Prophesy to us, O Christ, who is he who struck you?" Peter denies Jesus.
Meanwhile, Peter was sitting in the courtyard outside. The high priest's servant girl came to him and said, "You were also with Jesus the Galilean."
But Peter denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you are talking about!"
Then he went out to the gateway leading to the inner court, and another maid said to those who were standing there, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Then Peter denied it again, and swore and said, "I do not know this man."
And after a little while, those who stood there came to him and said to him, "You are indeed one of them, for your accent betrays that you are from Galilee."
"Then he began to curse himself. #cursehimself 74:26 That is, he cursed himself if he were lying! And he swore and said, 'I do not know this man.' And immediately the cock crew."
Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him, "You will deny me three times before the rooster crows." And he went out and wept bitterly.
Jesus before Governor Pilate.
And on the following morning, the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled and consulted together to kill Jesus.
So they bound him, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate the governor. Judas Kills Himself
When Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed Jesus, saw that they had decided to condemn Jesus to death, he regretted what he had done. So he took the thirty pieces of silver back to the chief priests and elders,
And he said to them, "I have sinned in that I handed over an innocent person to be killed." And they said to him, "What is that to us? You see to this matter yourself."
Then Judas threw the coins into the temple and left, and he went and hanged himself.
So the leading priests took the coins and said, "It is not permitted to put this money into the treasury of the Temple, because it is the price of a human life."
So they decided to use the money to buy the Potter's Field as a burial place for strangers.
And that is why the field is known as "The Field of Blood" to this day.
And so it happened, just as God had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet: "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price at which the sons of Israel had valued him."
"And they bought with it the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." #They_obeyed_the_Lord. 10:27 See Zechariah 11:12-13 and Jeremiah 32:6-9. Jesus before Pilate
And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And Jesus said, "It is as you say yourself."
And when the high priests and elders accused him, he said nothing in his defense.
Then Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the many charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus did not give Pilate an answer to anything they accused him of. Pilate was amazed at his silence. Pilate failed to release Jesus.
The governor was accustomed during the Feast of Passover to release to the people a prisoner of their choice.
And there was a prisoner of notorious wickedness, named Barabbas. #Barabbas. 16:27 Or "Jesus Barabbas," as in some Greek copies.
When the people gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you: Jesus who is called the Messiah, or Barabbas?"
Pilate knew that they had handed Jesus over to him out of their envy.
And while Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered greatly over him in a dream."
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds of people to ask for Barabbas to be released, and for Jesus to be killed.
So the governor said, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" They said, "Barabbas."
Pilate asked them, "What shall I do with Jesus called the Christ?" And they all answered, "Let him be crucified."
Then Pilate said to them, "Why? What crime has he committed?" But they shouted all the more, "Let him be crucified."
And when Pilate saw that there was no benefit to his attempts, and that chaos had begun, he took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd and said, "I am not responsible for the death of this man, it is your responsibility."
So all the people said, "Let his blood be on us and on our children."
Then Pilate released Barabbas to them and having Jesus flogged, he handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus to the governor's palace, and they assembled the entire guard detachment against him.
They stripped him of his clothes, then they clothed him in a robe of scarlet color. #They_clothed_him_in_a_robe_of_scarlet_color. 28:27 Or purple, and this was mocking him, for this is the color of the robe of kings.
And they braided a crown for him out of thorny branches and put it on his head. They put a reed in his right hand, and they knelt down before him, mocking him and saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
Then they spat on him, took the reed from his hand, and began to hit him on the head.
And when they were done mocking him, they took the robe off him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. Jesus on the cross.
When they came out, they found a man from the city of Cyrene, named Simon. They compelled him to carry the cross.
And when they came to a place called in Hebrew Golgotha, that is to say, The place of the skull,
They gave Jesus wine mixed with myrrh to drink. When he tasted it, he refused to drink.
And when they had crucified Jesus, they divided his garments among them, casting lots for them.
Then they sat there guarding him.
And above his head they put a title: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews," as his accusation.
And two criminals were crucified with Jesus, one on his right and the other on his left.
And the Maronites were cursing him, shaking their heads.
And they say, "You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, if you are the Son of God, save yourself and come down from the cross!"
And so the high priests, teachers of the law, and elders also ridiculed him, saying:
He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the king of the children of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him!
He put his trust in God; let God now save him, if he really wants to. Has he not said, "I am the Son of God"?»
Also, the two criminals crucified with Him were hurling the same insults at Him. The Death of Jesus
And from noon onward, darkness fell over all the land until the third hour after noon.
And about the third hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" #Eli … sabachthani. 46:27 from Psalm 22:1. That is: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
And when some of those standing there heard it, they said, "He is calling for Elijah!" #calling Elijah. 47:27 The word "Eli" in Hebrew and "Elu" in Aramaic, resembles the name "Elijah" which is the name of a well-known prophet who lived around 850 BC.
Then one of those standing nearby quickly went, took a sponge, dipped it in vinegar, put it on a long cane, and offered it to him to drink.
The rest were saying, "Wait and see if Elijah will come to save him!"
Then Jesus cried out again in a loud voice, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!" And with this, he breathed his last.
And the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rocks were split,
And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had been asleep arose.
And after Jesus rose, those bodies came out of their tombs, entered into the holy city, and appeared to many.
As for the Roman officer, #Roman officer. 54:27 Literally "a centurion." And the guards who were guarding the body of Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the other things, they were very terrified and said, "Truly, this was the Son of God!"
And there were women who stood afar off, watching: for they had followed Jesus from Galilee, to minister unto him.
Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, also the mother of the sons of Zebedee. #The sons of Zebedee. 56:27 James and John. Jesus buried
And when evening came, there came a rich man named Joseph, who was from the town of Arimathea. He was also a disciple of Jesus.
So he went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that the body be given to him.
Then Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a new linen cloth.
Then he placed him in his new tomb, which he had dug into the rock. Then he rolled a huge stone over the entrance to the tomb and went away.
And Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb, guarding the tomb of Jesus.
And on the next day, after the day had ended, the chief priests and the Pharisees came with Pilate,
And they said to him, "Lord, we remember that this deceiver said before he died, 'After three days I will rise from the dead.'"
So he issued a command to guard the tomb until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal the body and then tell the people, 'He has been raised from the dead.' And this delusion would be worse than the first delusion.'
Then Pilate said to them, "Take a guard from the cohort and go, and make sure of everything with your own knowledge."
So they went and secured the tomb. They placed a seal on the stone, and they also set watchmen over it from the soldiers.
The Resurrection of Jesus
And after the Sabbath was past, at the dawn of the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
There was a strong earthquake at that moment, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and went to the tomb and rolled back the stone from the door and sat on it.
And his appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.
The guards feared him greatly and became like dead men.
And the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified."
He is not here, for he has been raised from the dead as he previously said. Come and see the place where he was,
Then go quickly to his disciples and say to them, 'He has been raised from the dead, and he will go before you to Galilee; there you will see him.' Behold, I have told you.'
Then the two women left the tomb quickly, their fear mixed with great joy, and they ran to tell Jesus' disciples what had happened.
And suddenly Jesus met them and said, "Peace." And they approached him and clung to his feet and worshiped him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and they will see me there." The False Report
And while the two women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened.
So the high priests met with the elders and consulted with one another, then they gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
And they said to them, "Proclaim among the people, 'The disciples of Jesus came by night and stole His body while you were sleeping.'"
And if this news reaches the governor, we will convince him and keep you safe.»
The soldiers took the money and did as they were told. And so this story has spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus speaks to his disciples
And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain that Jesus had told them to go to.
And when they saw him, they worshiped him, though some of them had doubts.
Jesus approached them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
And teach them to obey all that I have commanded you. And remember that I will be with you always, to the end of the age."
John the Baptist
This is the beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah: "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare the way."
"The voice of a human calling in the wilderness, saying: 'Prepare the way for the Lord. Make the paths straight for him.'"
John the Baptist came baptizing in the wilderness, and he demanded that people be baptized as a sign of their repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the inhabitants of the villages of the Judean region and the city of Jerusalem went out to him. He baptized them in the Jordan River after they confessed their sins.
His clothes were made of camel hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
And he used to declare and say, "After me, a man will come who is greater than I am, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the laces of his sandals."
"I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." The Baptism of Jesus
And in those days, Jesus came from the town of Nazareth, which is in the region of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the River Jordan.
And as he came up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and he saw the Holy Spirit descending upon him in the form of a dove.
And a voice came from heaven: "This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased." The Temptation of Jesus
And the Spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness alone.
And he remained there for forty days, facing the temptations of Satan. He was there with the wild animals, and the angels were serving him. Jesus chooses some of his disciples.
And after John was arrested, Jesus came to the region of Galilee, and began to proclaim the good news of God.
And he says, "The time has come, the kingdom of God is near, repent and believe in this good news."
And as He walked by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of people."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Then he went a little further and saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John, who were in their boat mending the nets.
Jesus called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers and followed him. Jesus drives out an evil spirit.
Then they went to Capernaum, and Jesus entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach.
And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And the spirit cried out,
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, you are the Holy One of God."
Jesus rebuked him and said to him, "Be quiet and come out of him!"
The unclean spirit then entered the man, throwing him into a fit of convulsions, and then crying out with a loud voice, it came out of him.
And everyone was astonished, and they began to say to one another, "What is this new teaching? He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him."
And the reports about him spread quickly throughout the region of Galilee. Jesus heals many.
Then they left the synagogue and went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.
And Simon's mother-in-law was in bed, suffering from a fever. And they told Jesus about her.
He approached her, took her hand and made her sit down. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.
And that evening, at sunset, they brought to Him many who were ill and those who had evil spirits.
So all the people of the city gathered at the entrance of the house.
Jesus healed many who were suffering from various diseases, and he cast out many demons. But Jesus did not allow the demons to speak because they knew who he was. Preparing to Proclaim the Gospel
And very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left alone, and went out to a secluded place to pray.
Simon and those who were with him went out to look for him.
And when they found him, they said to him, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered them, "Let us go to the neighboring villages, so that I may preach there also. For this purpose I have come."
He went throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. Jesus Heals a Leper
A leper came to Jesus, and kneeling down, began to beg him, saying, "You are able to make me clean, if you are willing."
Jesus, moved with compassion, reached out his hand and touched him. "I want to," he said. "Be clean."
The leprosy departed from the man, and he became pure.
Then Jesus sternly warned him before dismissing him.
And He said to him, "Beware of telling anyone about what happened to you. Instead, go and present yourself to the priest." #Go...to the priest. 44:1 The priest was the one who decided according to the law when the leper would be considered pure. And he presented an offering for his purification, just as Moses had commanded. #Just as Moses had commanded. 44:1 See Leviticus 14:1-32. So the people will know that you have been healed."
But the man went away and began to proclaim everywhere the report of his cure, so that it became difficult for Jesus to enter openly into any city; but he remained in desolate places, and people from all over would come to him.
Jesus heals a paralytic.
And after several days, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and the news of his return spread.
A large crowd of people gathered until there was no more space for anyone, not even outside the door. And Jesus was speaking to the people with the word of God.
They brought him a paralytic, who was being carried by four men.
But they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd. So they went up on the roof where Jesus was, and they made an opening in the roof. Then they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "My son, your sins are forgiven."
Some of the teachers of the law were sitting there, and they began to think to themselves:
«Why does this man speak in this way? He is blaspheming God with his words! For who other than God alone can forgive sins?»
Jesus knew their thoughts, so he said to them, "Why do you think these things in your hearts?
Which of the two is easier: to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise, take up your bed and walk'?
But I will show you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.» And He said to the paralytic,
I tell you, get up, take your mat, and go to your home!
He got up, picked up his mat immediately, and walked in full view of everyone. All the people were astonished and glorified God. They said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Levi (Matthew) followed Jesus.
Jesus returned again to the lake. He was teaching the crowds who followed him there.
And as he walked, he saw a Levi sitting at the tax collection place. And he said to him, "Follow me!" And he rose and followed him.
And as Jesus reclined at the table in Levi's house eating, there were many tax collectors and sinners eating with him and his disciples. For many were there when Jesus called Levi, and he followed Jesus.
When the Pharisees and teachers of the law saw that Jesus was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard them, He said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners." Question about fasting
And it was a time of fasting for John's disciples and the Pharisees. Then some people came to Jesus and asked him, "Why do John's disciples and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them, "Can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? As long as the bridegroom is with them, they cannot fast.
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.
For no one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment. For the new patch will shrink and tear away from the old garment, making the tear worse.
No one puts new wine into old leather bottles, because the wine will burst the bottles, spilling the wine and ruining the bottles. That is why new wine is put into new leather bottles." Jesus: Lord of the Sabbath
One Sabbath day Jesus was going through some fields, and his disciples began to pick the heads of grain as they walked with him.
And the Pharisees said to Jesus, "Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!"
He said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?
He entered the house of God in the time of the priest Abiathar, and ate of the showbread that was given to God; and he also gave it to those who were with him. Though it is not lawful for anyone to eat the showbread except the priests.» #26:2 See 1 Samuel 21:1-6.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man's benefit, and not man for the Sabbath's benefit.
And so the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath as well.»
Jesus heals on the Sabbath.
And Jesus went again into the synagogue, and there was a man whose hand was withered.
Some people were watching him closely, to see if he would heal the sick, and thus furnish a pretext for accusing him.
And He said to the man with the withered hand, "Rise, and come forward!"
Then he said to them, "Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath? Is it lawful to save a life or to destroy it?" And they remained silent.
Jesus looked at them all around him, filled with anger, and grieved by the hardness of their hearts. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand," and when he stretched it out, it became restored and healthy.
So the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, to destroy him. But many people followed Jesus.
And Jesus, with his disciples, went up to the Sea of Galilee; and a great crowd followed him from Galilee and also from Judea.
And from Jerusalem and Edom and the region east of the Jordan, and the areas around Tyre and Sidon, there were a great multitude. And they all came to him because they had heard about his works.
Jesus then asked his disciples to prepare a boat for him, so that the crowds would not overwhelm him.
Jesus had healed many, so everyone who suffered from a disease tried to reach him to touch him.
And the unclean spirits were thrown down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
He strongly warns her not to reveal who he is. The selection of the twelve.
Then Jesus went up into the mountain, and called unto him whom he would, and they went with him.
And Jesus chose twelve men and named them apostles, to be with him, and to send them to different places,
And He gave them authority to drive out demons.
And they are: Simon, whom he named Peter,
James (Jacob) son of Zebedee and his brother John, whom Jesus named "Sons of Thunder" (Boanerges).
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, #the Zealot. 18:3 From a word of Aramaic meaning "the jealous one." That is, he belongs to a Jewish political party that opposes Roman rule, called the party of "the Zealots." **Note:** The Zealot is a common translation for "the jealous one" in this context.
And Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. The power of Jesus is from God and Jesus returned to the house.
The people gathered around him and his disciples again, to the point that they had no time to eat.
And when Jesus' family heard about his arrival, they came to take him with them, because people were saying that he was crazy!
Here is the translation of the provided Arabic text into English: The teachers of the Law who came down from Jerusalem were saying, "He has Beelzebul, and, #Beelzebul. 22:3 one of the names of the devil. And he is the one who casts out the evil spirits by the power of the chief of the evil spirits."
Jesus called them and began to teach them by parables and said, "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
Because if a kingdom is divided and its people fight, it will not last.
A house divided against itself will not stand.
