The genealogy of Jesus Christ (Luke 3:23-38)
This is the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:
Abraham begat Isaac. And Isaac begat Jacob. And Jacob begat Judah and his brethren.
And Judah begot Pharez and Zerah of Tamar. And Pharez begot Hezron. And Hezron begot Aram.
And Aram begat Amminadab. And Amminadab begat Nahshon. And Nahshon begat Salmon.
And Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab. And Boaz begat Obed of Ruth. And Obed begat Jesse.
David, the son of Jesse, became king. After this, David fathered Solomon with the wife of Uriah whom David had taken.
And Solomon begat Rehoboam. And Rehoboam begat Abia. And Abia begat Asa.
And Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Uzziah.
Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah.
Hezekiah the son of Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, the son of Amaziah, the son of Azariah, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, the son of Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar. Manasseh the son of Hezekiah, the son of Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, the son of Amaziah, the son of Azariah, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, the son of Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar. Amon the son of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, the son of Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, the son of Amaziah, the son of Azariah, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, the son of Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar. Josiah the son of Amon, the son of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, the son of Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, the son of Amaziah, the son of Azariah, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, the son of Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar.
Josiah begat Jehoiakim and his brothers, when the Jews were carried away captive to Babylon.
And after the completion of their exile in Babylon, Jeconiah begat Shealtiel. And Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel.
And Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor.
And Azor begat Zadok; and Zadok begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud.
And Eliakim begat Eliezer. And Eliezer begat Mattenai. And Mattenai begat Jacob.
And Jacob brought Joseph, the husband of Mary, who gave birth to Jesus, whom they call the Christ.
And so we find fourteen generations from Abraham to David, and fourteen generations from David until the Babylonian exile of the Jews, and fourteen generations from the time the duration of their exile in Babylon had elapsed until the coming of the Messiah. The Birth of Jesus Christ (Luke 2:1-7)
Here is how Jesus Christ was born: When Mary, his mother, was engaged to a man named Joseph, before they lived together, she was found to be with child through the power of the Holy Spirit.
My brother, Youssef, her fiancé, decided to distance himself from her without exposing her, because he was a man who feared God.
While he was still pondering the matter, an angel appeared to him from God in a dream and said to him, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. For she has conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit."
And behold, you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son, and you shall name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."
And all of this happened so that the words that God said through the Prophet who said:
# Isaiah 7:14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel. (which means "God with us")
And when Joseph woke up from sleep, he did what the angel of the Lord had told him to do in a dream. He took his wife home to his house.
But he did not have marital relations with her until she gave birth to a son, and he named him Jesus.
The wise Gian.
When Jesus was born in Bethlehem in the region of Judea, in the time of King Herod, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.
And they said, "Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was deeply disturbed, as was all of Jerusalem.
And when the chief priests and the scribes of the Jews gathered together, he asked them where the Christ should be born.
They answered him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it has been written through the prophet:
# Mt 5:2 And behold, a man named Levi, sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and followed him.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "And so Herod, without listening to anyone, summoned the wise men to determine the time when the star appeared,"
Then he sent them to Bethlehem and said to them, "Go and look for the child. And when you have found him, come and tell me, so that I too may go and worship him."
After hearing the king's words, they departed. While they were on the road, behold, the star that they had seen earlier in the east was going before them until it came and stood over the place where the child was.
And when they saw the star, they were very happy.
And they entered the house and found the child with his mother Mary. Then they dismounted on their knees and prostrated to him, and they opened their bags and gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
And their Lord warned them in a dream not to return to Herod, but to take another road and go to their own country. The flight to Egypt
And after the wise men had departed, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said to him, "Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt and remain there until I tell you, because Herod is going to look for the child to kill him."
And Joseph arose, and took the child and his mother by night, and departed for Egypt.
# He 11:1; Ex 4:22 And he dwelt in it until the time of Herod's death, in order to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son." Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became exceedingly angry. He sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men. Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah: "A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because her children were no more." When Herod was dead, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying: "Get up, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I bring you word; for Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him." But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And after being warned in a dream, he departed to the regions of Galilee, and he entered his own city and called the people together. And he said to them, "What kind of testimony do you give about yourselves if you are not considered trustworthy by others? For you are not fit to testify about yourselves, because you are biased in your own favor. For if people are not considered trustworthy by others, then they cannot be expected to be truthful themselves. For how can anyone be expected to give reliable testimony about others if they themselves are not considered trustworthy? For it is only when people are known to be reliable and trustworthy that their testimony can be accepted as valid. For how can the testimony of those who are not considered trustworthy be accepted as true? For it is only when people are known to be reliable and trustworthy that their testimony can be accepted as valid." And all the people who heard him were amazed at the things he taught. For he was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes. And when the people in the crowd saw the remarkable things that he did, and heard the words that he spoke, they were amazed, and greatly impressed. For they had never seen anything like this before. And they marveled at the things he taught, for he spoke with such authority and conviction. And they were deeply impressed by his words, for they were not just empty rhetoric, but they carried a profound weight of truth and wisdom. And they were so captivated by his teaching that they completely forgot their own concerns and worries. For his words had such a powerful and transformative effect on them that they were completely renewed and revitalized. And as a result of hearing his words and seeing the remarkable things he did, the people were so profoundly moved and inspired that they completely surrendered themselves to him. For they recognized in him a unique and unparalleled authority, and they were utterly convinced that he was indeed the Messiah, the promised one who was to come and deliver them from their sins and from all their oppressors. And as they continued to listen to his words and to observe the incredible miracles he performed, their faith in him grew even stronger, and they became completely devoted to him, willing to do whatever he asked of them, even if it meant facing persecution, imprisonment, or even death. For they knew that by following him, they were truly following the will of God, and they were completely confident that by doing so, they would receive eternal life and be blessed by God forever. And as a result of this profound and unwavering faith, the people who followed Jesus were completely transformed, and they became truly Christ-like, exhibiting love, compassion, forgiveness, and humility in all their interactions with others. And they became powerful agents of positive change in the world, working tirelessly to promote justice, peace, and reconciliation, and to serve the needs of the poor, the marginalized, and the oppressed. And they became true lights of the world, shining brightly with the love and grace of God, and inspiring others to follow in their footsteps and to become devoted followers of Jesus Christ. And as a
And when Herod, seeing that the wise men had made fools of him, became exceedingly angry and gave orders to kill all the children in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old or less, in accordance with the time he had ascertained from the wise men.
My brother, the thing that the prophet Jeremiah said has been completed.
"In Ramah, they heard the voice of lamentation, and there was much weeping and wailing. Rachel weeping for her children, and refusing to be comforted, because they were no more." The return from Egypt to Nazareth.
And when Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, when he was in Egypt,
And they said, "Rise up! Carry the child and his mother and return to the land of Israel, because those who sought to kill him are dead."
My brother, he stood up, shook the child and his mother, and returned to the land of Israel.
As he was listening, he heard that Herod Antipas had become king of Judea in place of his father Herod the Great. He was afraid to go there. But God warned him in a dream. So he went to the region of Galilee.
And he went to a city called Nazareth and lived there, so that what the prophets had said would be fulfilled: "He will be called a Nazarene."
The Annunciation of John the Baptist (Mark 1:1-8; Luke 3:1-18; John 1:19-28)
And in those days, John the Baptist came into the wilderness of the region of Judea, preaching.
And He said, "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!"
# Isaiah 40:3 and this John is the one about whom the prophet Isaiah spoke, saying: "A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight!'"
John was clothed in a garment made of camel's hair, and a leather belt was around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
And people were coming to him from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and the regions surrounding the Jordan.
And confess their sins, and be baptized in the Jordan River.
And when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to be baptized, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath of God?
Do things that show you are changing,
Do not say to yourselves, 'We are the children of Abraham.' I am telling you, God is able to make children of Abraham from these stones.
The axe is now placed on the tree roots. The tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I; I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
And he took his wooden digging tool in his hand and sifted the crop in the field, gathering the wheat in the granary, but the straw he would burn with unquenchable fire." John baptizes Jesus (Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21-22)
And Jesus came from the region of Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.
John did not allow him and said to him: "I am the one who needs to be baptized by you. How can you come to me?"
Jesus answered him, "Let this be done now, for thus we shall fulfill all righteousness." And John consented.
And when Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water, and at that moment the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.
And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love, and in whom I am well pleased."

And the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan.
My brother, he fasted for forty days and forty nights until he was starving.
He challenged the one who was going to test him and said to him: «If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.»
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'"
And they mocked the Blessed City, and they stood on the edge of the roof of the Temple,
"If you are the Son of God," they said to him, "throw yourself down from here, for it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.' "
Jesus answered, "It is written again, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'"
And He lifted him upon the pinnacle of a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the splendor within them,
And they said, "We will give you all this, if you will come down and prostrate yourself before me."
Jesus answered him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'" # Exodus 20:2-3; Matthew 4:8-9 Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'"
And he left him, and the devil went away. And when the angels came and began to serve him, Jesus preached in Galilee (Mark 1:14-15; Luke 4:14-15).
And when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew to Galilee.
And he left Nazareth and walked and lived in Capernaum which is by the sea in the border of the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,
So that what the prophet Isaiah said might be fulfilled:
# Isa 9:1-2 The land of Naphtali and the land of Zebulun, toward the sea, on the road of the Jordan, Galilee, land of the other nations!
The people who dwell in darkness have seen a great light; and for those who sit in the region and shadow of death, light has dawned upon them.
And at that time, Jesus began to preach and say: "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand." Jesus calls the first disciples (Mark 1:16-20; Luke 5:1-11)
As Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who he would give the name Peter) and his brother Andrew, throwing a net into the sea, because they were fishermen.
And he said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
And at that time, they emptied their window and followed him.
While walking along the shore, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John, in a boat with their father Zebedee mending their nets. Then he called them.
And behold, they left their father in the boat and followed him. Jesus teaches, preaches, and heals the sick (Luke 6:17-19).
Jesus went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and healing the people of their diseases and afflictions of all kinds.
And His fame spread throughout all of Syria. The sick and those possessed by demons of all kinds of illnesses and pains, and those who were inhabited by demons, the epileptic, and the paralyzed, He healed them all.
And many people from Galilee and the region called the Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and the region beyond the Jordan followed him.
The Sermon on the Mount (Luke 6:20-23)
And Jesus, the Light for people, went up the mountain and sat down. At that time, his disciples came to him.
And he began to teach them, saying:
Blessed are the poor in spirit! For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
To the grieving, health to them! They are going to be comforted.
Good for the good people! They are the land so that they may inherit.
To the hungry and thirsty for the truth! They are going to be satisfied.
Good for those who have mercy! They will be shown mercy.
Here's the English translation: "Health to those whose hearts are pure! They are the face of God so that they may see."
Good for those who reconcile people! They are truly God's children to be called so.
Well done to those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness! The Kingdom of Heaven belongs to them.
Congratulations to you when people insult you, torture you, and say all the worst things about you because of me!
Rejoice and jump for joy, for your reward is great in heaven. Thus it was that the prophets before you suffered torture.» Salt and Light (Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34-35)
You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt loses its flavor, how can it be restored? It is no longer good for anything, but to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet.
You are the light of the world. No one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket, but rather puts it on a lampstand, so that those who come in may see the light.
And there isn't one who lights a fire in a lamp and puts it under a bowl, but rather puts it in a high place and shines on all those in the house.
Let your light shine like this before people, so that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven." The Law
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
Here is the translation of the provided text: **The truth is this: until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke of the law will disappear until everything is accomplished.**
Whoever does not obey even one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever obeys them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
Here's the translation: "I'm telling you, unless you are more righteous than the writers of the Jewish scriptures and the Pharisees, you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven." Lies
"You have heard what was said to your ancestors: 'You shall not murder; anyone who murders must be brought to justice.' "
Here's the English translation of the provided text: "Listen, I'm telling you: whoever gets angry with their brother, the court should sentence them. And whoever calls their brother 'ignorant,' the Jewish court should sentence them. And whoever calls their brother 'donkey,' they should go to hell."
Therefore, when you present your offering at the altar and remember that your brother has something against you,
Leave your offering there in front of the altar. First, go and be reconciled with your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
If someone complains about you, make up with them quickly while you're on your way to court, so they don't complain about you to the judge. The judge will then tell the policeman about you, and you'll end up in prison.
Here's the translation: **"I'm telling you the truth: you're not getting out of there until you pay the last cent." Adultery**
"You have heard that it was said to your ancestors, 'You shall not commit adultery.' " (Exodus 20:14; Deuteronomy 5:18)
Here's the English translation: "Look, I'm telling you that anyone who looks at a woman and desires her, has already committed adultery with her in his heart."
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose a part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose a part of your body than that your whole body go into hell.» (Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11-12; Luke 16:18)
"And it was also said: 'Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.'"

# Isaiah 66:1; Acts 7:49; Psalm 48:2 Not for the sake of your sacrifices do I give you these laws. For I have other laws for you: You must not have any idols, whether they are made of wood, stone, or metal. You must not bow down to these idols or worship them. I am the Lord your God, and I demand obedience. If you obey me and follow my laws, I will reward you. This is what you must do to keep the Sabbath day as a holy day for the Lord your God. For six days you may work at your job, but the seventh day is a day of rest dedicated to the Lord your God. Do not do any work on that day, not even the kinds of work that you can do for your family. This law applies to everyone in your family, including those who work for you. Do not argue about this law, saying that you should not have to rest on the Sabbath day, while your servants have to rest. Do not try to change this law, arguing that you should be allowed to do certain things for your family on the Sabbath day, while your servants are not allowed to work at all. This is not a law that you can change, deciding that it is acceptable for you to work on the Sabbath day if it is only for your family, while your servants are expected to completely rest. Do not attempt to alter this command, claiming that it is permissible for you to perform certain tasks for your family on the Sabbath, while your servants are required to cease all work entirely. This is not a law subject to your interpretation, allowing you to determine that it is acceptable for you to work on the Sabbath if it is only for your family, while your servants are not allowed to work at all. Do not try to change this command, arguing that you should be allowed to do certain things for your family on the Sabbath day, not understanding that this law applies to everyone, including your servants. Remember that this is a command from the Lord your God, and it must be followed precisely as it is given. This is not a suggestion that you can choose to follow or ignore based on your own desires. This is a command from God that must be obeyed without question or hesitation. If you disobey this command, you will be held accountable for your actions. This is not a law that you can choose to follow or ignore whenever it is convenient for you. This is a command from God that must be obeyed at all times without exception.

"Let your speech be 'yes, yes' or 'no, no,' and anything beyond this is from the evil one." The Beatitudes (Luke 6:29-30)
"Have you not heard it said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth'?"

Have you not heard it said, "Love your neighbor and hate your enemy"?
Here's the English translation: And I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.
Be like your Father in heaven. For he causes his sun to rise on the good and the evil, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
What reward do you deserve if you love those who love you? Isn't it that those who collect taxes do the same thing?
And what else did you do besides harming others, if you only greet your sisters? Isn't it those who don't know God who do such things themselves?
"You must be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect."
Charity
Be careful not to do good deeds in front of people so they can see you. If you do that, you won't have any reward with your Father who is in heaven.
When you give to the needy, don't blow a trumpet as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, so that they may be praised by men. I tell you the truth: they have received their reward.
As for you, when you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
So that your alms may be in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you.» Prayer (Luke 11:2-4)
And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues so that they may be seen by others. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward.
As for you, when you pray, go into your inner room, close the door, and pray to your unseen Father. And your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.
And you pray, but you don't sit and repeat empty words like other peoples who don't realize that God will hear them saying a lot of words.
Don't be like them, because your father knows what you need before you even ask.
Therefore, pray like this: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
Let your kingdom come to us, let your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Every day, give us our daily bread.
Forgive our sins, just as we forgive those who wrong us.
We have not been put to the test, and we have escaped the evil.
And if people are forgiving of each other's mistakes, your father who is in heaven will also forgive your sins.
Here is the English translation: "Or if you don't forgive people their mistakes, even your father who is in heaven will not forgive your sins." Fasting
And as you fast, do not put on a sad face like the hypocrites, who disfigure their faces so that they may appear to people to be fasting. I tell you the truth: they have already received their reward.
As for you, when you fast, comb your hair and wash your face.
So that your fasting may not be obvious to people, but rather to your Father who is unseen by the eye, and your Father who sees what you do in secret, so that He may reward you." (Luke 12:33-34)
Don't hide treasures for yourselves on earth, for rot and pus will spoil them, and thieves will dig them up and steal them.
Wherever you store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break in and steal.
"Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." (Light of the Body, Luke 11:34-36)
The eye is the lighthouse of the body. Therefore, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be filled with light.

No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.
So then I tell you, don't worry about your life, what you will eat or drink, or about your bodies, what you will wear. For isn't life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the sky: how do they not sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns; and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?
And which one of you thinks that he can add an hour to his life?
And why do you think about clothes? Look at the flowers of the brittle grass and how they grow: they neither toil nor spin.
Here's the translation: And I tell you: Even King Solomon in all his glory did not dress like one of them!
If God wore clothes like these, even though marijuana grows today and will be thrown into the oven's fire tomorrow, then how much more deserving are you to be clothed by the one whose faith is weak!
That is why you should not worry and say: What will we eat? Or what will we drink? Or what will we wear?
Here are these things that everyone is looking for, the people who are not believers, and your father who is in heaven knows that you need them.
As for you, seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
That's why you shouldn't worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will worry about itself. Every day has enough trouble of its own.»
Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. Give, and it will be given to you. Good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap. For whatever measure you deal out to others, it will be dealt out to you.
Do not judge others, so that you will not be judged.
Here is the English translation: The judgment you judge people by will be the judgment used against you, and the measure you measure out to others will be the measure used for you.
Why do you look at the splinter in your brother's eye and never notice the log in your own eye?
And how can you say to your brother, 'Let me remove the splinter from your eye,' when you have a board in your own eye?
Hypocrite! Remove the log from your own eye first, and then you will see clearly to remove the splinter from your brother's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs, and do not throw your pearls before the pigs, lest they trample them under their feet and turn and tear you to pieces.' Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.' From Luke 11:9-13.
Seek and you shall find, knock and the door shall be opened to you.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "Anyone who asks receives, anyone who seeks finds, and anyone who knocks will have the door opened for them."
Which one of you who asks for his son in the bread, would give him a stone?
And why would they ask for a fish and be given a snake instead?
If even you bad guys know how to give good things to your children, then how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him?
Therefore, do to others the things that you want them to do to you. This is what the Law and the Prophets have said." The Narrow Door (Luke 13:24)
"Enter through the narrow gate. For the gate leading to destruction is wide and easy, and many enter through it."
"For it is like a man traveling to a far country, who called his own servants and entrusted his property to them. To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, each according to his ability. And he went on his journey. When he returned after a long time, he called his servants to him in order to settle accounts. And he said to the one who had five talents, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, take your inheritance, for I was faithful over a few things, and you will rule over many things. Come, receive your master's approval.' And he said to the one with two talents, 'You are faithful in a few things; take charge of ten cities.' And he said to the one with one talent, 'You ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, so that at my coming I might have received my own with interest.' And he said to him, 'You wicked and lazy servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered? Then you should have invested my money with the bankers, so that at my coming I might have received my own with interest.' And he said to him, 'You wicked and lazy servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered? Then you should have invested my money with the bankers, so that at my coming I might have received my own with interest.' And when the master of the servant came and settled his accounts, he demanded the wicked servant and delivered him to the torturers until he should pay back all that he owed. So the servant fell to the ground and prostrated himself before his master, saying, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you everything.' And the master of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him and forgave him the debt. But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants, who owed him a hundred denarii. And he seized him and began to choke him, saying, 'Pay back what you owe.' And his fellow servant, falling down at his feet, begged him, saying, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you everything.' And he released him and forgave him the debt. But his fellow servants, seeing what had taken place, were deeply grieved and went and reported everything to the master of the servant. And when the master of that servant came, he summoned his servant and said to him, 'You wicked servant! You received your fellow servant's debt, when he begged you for patience, and you refused. And when the master of that servant found out, he summoned you and said to you, "You wicked servant! You received your fellow servant's debt, when he begged you for patience, and you refused. And when the master of that servant found out, he summoned you and said to you, "You wicked servant! What more is there to say? Pay back what you owe immediately." And you should have paid back what you owed immediately. But you did not do that, and now there is one more debt to pay back, and you will pay it back with interest. And he said to him, 'You will pay back your debt with interest. And he said to him, 'You will pay back your debt with interest. And he said to him, 'You will pay back your debt with interest. And he said to him, 'You will pay back your debt with interest. And he said to him, 'You will pay back your debt with interest. And he said to him, 'You will pay back your debt with interest. And he said to him, 'You will pay back your debt with interest. And he said to him, 'You will pay back your debt with interest. And he said to him, 'You will pay back your debt with interest. And he said to him, 'You will pay back your debt with interest. And he said to him, 'You will pay back your debt with interest. And he said to him, 'You will pay back your debt with interest. And he said to him, 'You will pay back your debt with interest. And he said to him, 'You will pay back your debt with interest. And he said to him, 'You will
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
You know their habits well. Does a thorn bush produce grapes, or does a vine produce figs?
Therefore, every good tree produces good fruit, and every bad tree produces bad fruit.
Neither does the splendid tree produce a bad crop, nor does the bad tree produce a splendid crop.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
"Therefore, you will recognize them by their fruits." The Parable of the Tares (Matthew 13:24-30)
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
On the day of reckoning, many people will say to me: "Lord, Lord, did you not prophesy in your name? And did we not cast out demons in your name? And did we not do mighty works in your name?"
And I will tell them, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'" This is like the two houses (Luke 6:47-49).
Here is the English translation of the provided text: "Anyone who listens to this advice of mine and acts upon it will be like a wise man who built his house upon the rock."
The rain poured down and brought floods, and the wind blew strongly against that house, but it did not fall, because its foundation was built on stone.
Whoever listens to my words and does not act upon them will be like an ignorant man who built his house on sand.
And the rain poured down and the floods came, and the wind blew against that house, and it fell down, and nothing remained of it."
And when Jesus finished this discourse, the people were astonished at His teaching.
Because he was teaching them how someone with authority does it, not like their book.
The leper is healed (Mark 1:40-45; Luke 5:12-16).
When Jesus came down from the mountain, great crowds followed him.
And behold, a leper drew near to Him and prostrated Himself before Him, saying, "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean."
And he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him: "I want to, be cured!" And immediately he was cured of leprosy.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "And they said to Jesus, 'What should we say to those who have been saved? Should we tell them to go to the temple and offer sacrifices, as prescribed by our ancestors?' The people who heard this were amazed and asked, 'What kind of wisdom is this that has been given to him? By his words, even the most wicked are given a chance to change their ways.' And Jesus went about among the towns and villages, teaching, and making his way toward Jerusalem."
And Jesus entered Capernaum, and behold, a centurion of the army came, and knelt down before Him, and said:
Here is the translation of the provided Arabic text into English: "Oh my lord, my slave is lying paralyzed at home, suffering greatly and unable to move."
And Jesus said, "I will come and heal him."
But the captain of the hundred answered him, "Sir, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed."
Here I am, a man who has people under his authority, and I have an army that I rule over. I tell one person, "Go!", and they go. And to another, "Come!", and they come. And to my servant, "Do this thing!", and they do it.
When Jesus heard it, he was amazed and said to those who followed him, "I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.
I transport you, many people will come from the East and from the West and will sit at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven,
Here are a few possible translations, with slightly different nuances: **Option 1 (More literal, emphasizes the abandonment):** "But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the darkness, and there will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth for years." **Option 2 (Slightly more idiomatic, emphasizes the suffering):** "Yet the children of the realm shall be cast forth into the darkness, where lamentations and the gnashing of teeth shall endure for years." **Option 3 (More concise and direct):** "Still, the kingdom's sons will be cast out into the darkness, where weeping and gnashing of teeth will last for years." The best option depends on the specific context and the desired emphasis. All of these translations aim to be accurate and convey the original meaning effectively.
And Jesus said to the centurion, "Go, and let it be for you according to your faith." And the servant was healed at that moment. Peter's mother-in-law was healed (Mark 1:29-34; Luke 4:38-41).
And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw that Peter's mother-in-law was lying down, sick with a fever.
He touched her hand, and the fever broke. She got up and started serving him again.
In that evening, as the sun was setting, many people who were possessed by demons were brought to him. He cast out the demons with a single word, and he healed all the sick.
This event happened to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah said: "He took our weaknesses and carried our diseases." Jesus and the World (Luke 9:57-62)
And when Jesus saw that there was a large crowd around him, he told his disciples to go to the other side of the lake.
And one from the book of the Jews came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
And Jesus said, "The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
And another of the disciples said: "Allow me first to go and bury my father."
As for Jesus, He said to them, "Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead!" Jesus Calms the Storm (Mark 4:35-41; Luke 8:22-25)
When Jesus got into the boat, his disciples followed him.
A fierce wind arose on the lake, so much so that the waves were covering the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
And His disciples approached Him and evaluated Him, saying to Him, "Lord, let us go to them, for we are about to perish!"
And Jesus said to them, "Why are you terrified, O ye of little faith?" And straightway he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and a great calm was made.
And the people marveled, saying, "What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him!" The Exorcism of the Demoniacs and the Drowning of the Swine (Mark 5:1-20; Luke 8:26-39)
As Jesus came to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes, two men who were possessed by demons met him. They came from the tombs and were extremely violent, so much so that no one could pass by on that road.
And they cried out, "What have you to do with us, Jesus? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"
And there were many wild boars grazing in a place far from them.
And the devils tempted him and said: "If you make us come out, send us to the pigs!"
He told them, "Go!" So they went out and entered the herd of swine; and the entire herd of swine rushed down the steep slope into the sea and were drowned in the water.
They fled, the captives, and entered the city, and they said everything about me and what happened to the two men who were possessed by demons.
Here is the English translation of the provided text: "My brother, the people of the entire city came out to meet Jesus. Yet they begged him to leave their region."
Jesus heals a paralyzed man (Mark 2:1-12; Luke 5:17-26)
And Jesus entered the boat and sailed and came to His city.
And the people brought to Him a paralytic lying on his bed. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, "Be of good cheer, my son; your sins are forgiven you."
And there was a group of Jewish writers who said in their hearts, "This man has blasphemed!"
Jesus perceived their thoughts, and said, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?
Here is the English translation: Which is easier? It is easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven," than to say, "Stand up and walk?"
Here is the translation of the provided text: "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." And then He said to the paralytic, "Get up! Pick up your mat and go to your house."
My brother, he got up and went to his house.
And when the people saw what had happened, they were afraid and glorified God, who had given such authority to human beings. Jesus Calls Matthew (Mark 2:13-17; Luke 5:27-32)
As Jesus passed by from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And he said to him, "Follow me." And he rose up and followed him.
While Jesus was reclining in Matthew's house, eating, a large crowd of tax collectors and sinners, who had gathered to hear Jesus, also sat with Jesus and his disciples.
And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard that, he said, "It is not those who are well who need a physician, but rather those who are ill."
**Mark 2:18-22 (and Luke 5:33-39)** **The Question About Fasting** 18 Once, John's disciples came to Jesus and asked him, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?" **Jesus' Response About Fasting** 19 Jesus replied, "The wedding guests cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them, can they? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast. No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If you do, the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse. Instead, you must patch an old garment with a piece of cloth cut from a garment that has not been used. Then the patch will not tear, making the tear worse." **The Meaning of the Old and New Covenants** 21 Jesus also said to the crowds, "When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, who try to show everyone how pious they are. I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you fast, wash your face so that it does not look to others like you are fasting. I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you fast, wash your face so that it does not look to others like you are fasting." 33 The Pharisees and the teachers of the law asked Jesus, "Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don't wash their hands before they eat!" 39 Jesus responded, "You are blind! You hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but are full of decaying bones and uncleanness on the inside. In the same way, on the outside you appear righteous to people, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. 43 "Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law! You are like hidden graves, which people walk over without knowing it. You make yourselves look good in front of people, but God knows your hearts. What people think of you is not nearly as important as what God thinks of you." 47 "Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law! You are hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to convert one person to Judaism, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as yourselves. 51 "Do not be surprised that I have come to you as a Jew speaking to Jews. 52 I know that you are bitterly opposed to me and my teachings, because I am not here to please you or to tell you what you want to hear. I am here to tell you the truth, even if it is uncomfortable or challenging for you to hear. 54 "I know that you are in the dark, spiritually blind, and that you are looking for someone to lead you, to tell you what to do, to give you the answers that you are looking for. But I am not here to be your leader, your guide, your teacher, or to give you the answers that you are looking for. I am here to tell you the truth, to show you the way, to give you the answers that you are looking for, and to lead you to the truth, to the light, to the way, to the answers that you are looking for, and to the truth. But it is up to you to choose whether to follow me or not, and whether to accept the truth or not." 55 "You are looking for me, not because you truly understand my teachings, but because you saw me perform miraculous signs. But I tell you, do not believe in me or in those signs, but only in the one who sent me. It is not enough to simply believe that I am the Messiah, but it is also necessary to
And John's disciples came to Jesus and said, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them, "Can those who are invited to the wedding feast mourn, as long as the bridegroom is still among them? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them; then they will fast in those days."
There isn't a single person who patches an old piece of clothing with new fabric, because the fabric will absorb and consume from the old piece of clothing, and the tear becomes even larger.
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, otherwise the wineskins burst, the wine spills out, and the wineskins are ruined. But new wine is put into new wineskins, and thus both are preserved." The little girl is healed, and the woman who touched Jesus' cloak is also healed (Mark 5:21-43; Luke 8:40-56).
While Jesus was speaking to them, one of the rulers of the synagogue came, knelt down before Him, and said, "My daughter has just died; but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live."
And Jesus rose up and followed him, he and his disciples.
There was a woman suffering from blood loss for twelve years. She came from behind and touched the edge of his clothes.
For her sake, she said in her heart: "If I go to him, even if it's just to gloat over his misfortunes, I will be satisfied."
Jesus and her scout told her: "Be confident, my daughter, because your faith has healed you." And immediately, the woman became well.
And when Jesus arrived at the house of the Jewish leader, he saw the crowd that was playing flutes in the street, and the people were in an uproar.
He said, "Step aside! The girl isn't dead, she's only sleeping."
And when the people went out, he entered and pulled the girl by her hand until she stood up.
And the news of this thing was published in that whole region. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus passed by from there, there were two blind men who followed him, crying out: "Have mercy on us, O Son of David!"
When he entered the house, the two blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord!"
And Jesus, touching their eyes, said, "Let it be done to you according to your faith."
And their eyes were opened. And Jesus warned them, saying, "Be careful that no one knows!"
As for them, they went out and spread the news of him throughout that entire region. Jesus heals a mute man.
And when the two blind men went out, a demon-possessed, mute man was brought to them.
Jesus drove out the demons, and the mute man spoke. The people were amazed and said, "We have never seen anything like this in Israel!"
As for the Pharisees, they said, "He casts out demons by the power of the ruler of demons." Jesus is compassionate toward people.
And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God. And He healed all the people of their diseases and afflictions.
When he saw the people, he had compassion on them because they were worried and tired, like sheep without a shepherd.
And he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
So, ask the master of the harvest to send workers for his harvest.»
The Twelve Apostles (Mark 3:13-19; Luke 6:12-16)
And he called the twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal people of all diseases and pains.
And these are the names of the twelve apostles: The first, whose name is Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
And Philip and Bartholomew, and Thomas and Matthew who collected taxes, and James the son of Alphaeus and Judas the Zealot,
And Simon who is zealous for his country, and Judas Iscariot who is going to betray Jesus. Jesus sends the twelve apostles (Mark 6:7-13; Luke 9:1-6)
Jesus sent these twelve out and he instructed them, "Go nowhere in the region of Judea, and do not enter Samaria. Go instead to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. As you go, proclaim this message: 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.' Heal the sick, raise the dead, and cast out demons. You have received without payment; give without payment. Take no gold, silver, or copper to be carried on your persons; do not take a traveling bag for the clothes you wear, or two pairs of sandals, or a staff; for you are not going out to a situation of poverty. You will be given money, resources, and even great lodgings. I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that they may receive you into their eternal homes. Whoever receives you as a traveler receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me. I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep to be attacked and scattered. The hired hand runs away because he is a hired hand and does not care about the sheep. I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me, just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And because of this, my Father loves me; not because I am seeking my own glory, there is one who seeks glory, and that is God. Because of this, the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again. I have the right to lay down my life, and I have the right to take it up again. This command I received from my Father. Because of this, the Jews wanted to kill him, not only because he had said these things, but because he had been teaching these things publicly, and he was winning over many of the Jews, causing them to go over to his side.
Go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
As you go, preach and say, 'The kingdom of heaven is near.'
Heal the sick, raise the dead, heal those with leprosy, cast out demons. You received freely, so give freely.
Do not carry gold, silver, or copper in your belts,
Not a shirt, not two pairs of trousers, not sandals, not a stick, because the servant deserves his food.
And whenever you enter any city or village, look for those who deserve that you enter their house and stay with them until you leave.
And when you enter a house, greet the people who are in it.
And if the people of that house deserve it, let your peace come upon them. But if they do not deserve it, your peace will return to you.
If anyone rejects you or refuses to listen to you, shake the dust off your feet as you leave that house or that town.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "Believe me: the condition of the city of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment will be better than the condition of that city!" The persecution that is going to take place (Mark 13:9-13; Luke 21:12-17)
Here, I will send you like sheep in the midst of wolves, so be alert like snakes, and good like doves.
And beware of people because they will hand you over to the Jewish council, and they will flog you in their synagogues,
And mock the rulers and kings for my sake, so that you may bear witness before them and before the other nations.
When they hand you over, don't worry about how you will speak or what you will say, because at that very moment, you will be given the words that you will speak.
Because of you, it's not you who are speaking, but your father's spirit is speaking on your behalf.
A brother betrays his brother to death, and a father his son, and children turn against their parents and kill them,
And everyone will hate you because of my name. But whoever stands firm to the end will be saved.
And when they persecute you in one city, flee to another; truly I say to you, you will not have completed the circuit of the cities of Israel before I come, the Son of Man.
The student is not greater than his teacher, and the servant is not greater than his master.
Fear of the Lord (Luke 12:2-7)
So don't be afraid of them. For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing secret that will not be made known.
What I tell you in the dark, speak of it in the light. And what is whispered to you in your ear, proclaim it from the rooftops.
And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear the one who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.
My brother, aren't two sparrows sold for a farthing? And yet not one of them falls to the ground apart from the fact that your Father in heaven is aware of them.
Even the hair of your head is all numbered.
Don't be afraid, you are better than many birds!
Therefore, whoever acknowledges me before people, I will acknowledge them before my Father who is in heaven.
As for those who cause me to be publicly discredited, I will also publicly discredit them before my Father in heaven." Jesus and the World (Luke 12:51-53; 14:26-27)
Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I came to separate the son from his father, the daughter from her mother, and the daughter-in-law from her mother-in-law.
And the enemies of man will be his relatives.
Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me does not deserve me. And anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me does not deserve me.
He who does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it." The reward (Mark 9:36-41)
Whoever accepts you accepts me, and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.
He who accepts a profit for himself, a profit that he will take as a reward for a profit. And he who accepts a righteous man for himself, a righteous man that he will take as a reward for a righteous man.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "And whoever gives even a small amount to these children, even a glass of cold water because he is my student, I tell you the truth, his reward will not be lost."
The disciples of John the Baptist (Luke 7:18-35)
And when Jesus finished instructing his twelve disciples, he left that place to teach and preach in the towns of that region.
And John, while he was in prison, heard about the deeds of Christ, so he sent him a message through his disciples.
And they said, "Are you the one who is coming, or should we expect someone else?"
Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you are seeing and hearing: the blind are receiving their sight, the lame are walking, those suffering from skin diseases are being cured, the deaf are hearing, the dead are being raised, and the poor are hearing the good news.
The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, those with skin diseases are healed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news preached to them.
And health, why shouldn't I suspect him!»
When John's disciples left, Jesus began to speak to the people about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
So what exactly did you come out to see? Did you come out to see a man wearing expensive clothes? Those who wear expensive clothes are in the palaces of kings!
So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, and I tell you: More than a prophet.
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: **Mal 3:1; Mark 1:2 This is what is written about him in the Scriptures: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way."**
Here is the translation of the provided text: "Truly I tell you, among those born of women, there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist. Yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the Kingdom of Heaven has been forcefully advancing, and powerful people are seizing it.
The prophets, all of them, spoke of the Law, foretelling until John came.
And if you want to believe, he is Elijah who is coming.
Let him who has ears, let him hear!
What are we to compare this generation to? They are like children sitting in the market place shouting at each other:
We sang to you and you didn't dance, and we wailed to you and you didn't cry.
John came, not eating or drinking, and you said, "He has a demon."
Here I am, the Son of Man, come to eat and drink. You said to yourselves, 'Here is a man who is a glutton and a drunkard, and he is a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' But wisdom is justified by her children.» The cities that did not repent (Luke 10:13-15)
And afterward, Jesus began to rebuke the cities where His mighty miracles were performed, and yet their inhabitants did not repent.
"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty works that were done among you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, then their people would have repented long ago, dressed in sackcloth, and sat in ashes."
Listen, I tell you: the state of the cities of Tyre and Sidon will be better than your state on the Day of Judgment.
And you, Capernaum! You, too, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be cast down into the depths. For if the mighty miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
Here's the English translation: "Listen, I tell you: the condition of the land of Sodom will be better than your condition on the day of judgment." Jesus Rejoices (Luke 10:21-22)
Jesus spoke at that time and said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children."
Yes, father, that was your will.
My father gave me everything. And no one knows that the Son was the Father, and no one knows that the Father was the Son and everyone whom the Son chooses to reveal himself to.
Here's a translation of the provided text: "Behold, you are burdened and carry heavy loads, and I am here to relieve you."
They shook my hand and learned from me. I am good and my heart is humble. And you will find comfort in your souls.
"My side of the scale is not heavy, and my burden is light."
Saturday (Mark 2:23-28; Luke 6:1-5)
At that time, Jesus passed through the wheat fields on the Sabbath, and His disciples were hungry. So they began to pluck the heads of grain and eat them.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "However, when the Pharisees saw that, they said to him, 'Look! Your disciples are doing something that is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day.'"
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what David did, he and those who were with him, when he was hungry?
How could he enter the house of God, and eat the bread of the Eucharist, whose consumption was not permissible for him and those with him, but was only permissible for consumption by the priests alone?
" # Count 28:9-10 O my brother, have you not read in the Law how the priests in the temple break the Sabbath on Saturday, and yet no one finds fault with them? "
I tell you then: There is someone here who is greater than the temple.
Here is the translation of the provided text: # It is 6:6; Mt 9:13 And if you had understood what this verse means: "I desire mercy and not sacrifice." Then you would not have condemned the blameless.
Here am I, the Son of Man, the Lord of the Sabbath.» The man whose hand was withered was healed (Mark 3:1-6; Luke 6:6-11).
Jesus left that area and entered their synagogue.
And there was a man whose hand was withered. The people asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" so that they could find something to accuse him of.
Jesus said to them, "Which one of you, if he has one sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out of the pit?"
Here's the English translation: "And how much more valuable is a human being than a donkey! So that's why it's permissible to do good deeds on the Sabbath."
And Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand!" And the man stretched it out, and it was restored, whole like the other hand.
As for the Pharisees, they went out and conspired against Jesus, discussing how to kill him. Jesus is the servant whom God has chosen.
And Jesus knew about this, and he left that place. Many people followed him, and he healed all of them.
And he ordered them to tell no one about him.
And this thing happened so that what the prophet Isaiah said would be fulfilled:
Here is the English translation: # Isaiah 42:1-4 Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights. I have put my Spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations. He will not cry aloud nor cry out, nor make his voice heard in the streets. A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not extinguish; he will bring forth justice to the nations.
It neither grinds nor shouts, and no one in the streets hears its voice.
A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not quench. Until he makes justice triumph,
And the peoples will have hope in his name. Jesus and Beelzebul (Mark 3:20-30; Luke 11:14-23; 12:10)
And at that time, they brought him a blind and mute man who was possessed by a demon. And Jesus healed him, and he began to speak and to see.
And all the people were amazed and said, "Can this be the Son of David?"
As for the Pharisees, when they heard about this, they said, "He is driving out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of demons."
And Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said to them: "Every kingdom that is divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or house that is divided against itself will not stand."
If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself, so how can his kingdom stand?
And if at that moment we go out into the wastelands with Beelzebul, who will your disciples go out to then? That is why they will be the ones to judge you.
If, however, we are going out into the world in the power of God, then the kingdom of God has taken control of you.
Here's a translation of the provided text: "And how could someone enter the house of a strong man and take his belongings, unless he had the strong man's trust beforehand, and then he could take the things in his room?"
He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.
That's why I tell you, the sins and blasphemies of all people will be forgiven them, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come." The Fig Tree and Its Fruit (Luke 6:43-45)
Either let the tree be good and its produce good. Or let the tree be bad and its produce bad. The tree is known by its produce.
You vipers, how is it possible for you to speak well while you are evil? The tongue speaks what is in the heart.
The good person brings out the good things from the good treasure in his heart, and the bad person brings out the bad things from his bad heart.
Your translation: Every empty word that people utter will be held against them on the Day of Reckoning.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "You with your words appear innocent, and with your words, you are judged guilty." The Pharisees demand a miracle (Mark 8:11-12; Luke 11:29-32)
At that time, some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to Jesus, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
Here is the English translation: As for them, He answered them, "A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
# Jon 1:17 And just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
# Jon 3:5 And should not the people of Nineveh rise up with this generation, and condemn it; because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, there is one greater than Jonah here.
**The Translation** I Sam 10:1-10; II Chron 9:1-12 And the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation; for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here. The Return of the Unclean Spirit (Luke 11:24-26)
"When the unclean spirit goes out of a person, it passes through the places that do not have water, seeking rest, but not finding any place.
At that time, he would say: "I will return to my home from which I went out." And he would return to find it empty, swept, and tidy.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "And so it is that this generation, too, is an evil one.» The mother of Jesus and his brothers (Mark 3:31-35; Luke 8:19-21)"
And when Jesus was still teaching the people, his mother and brothers came and stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone said, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you."
Here is the man who spoke to him replied: "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"
And he stretched out his hand toward the true paths of his disciples and said: "Behold, my mother and my brothers are here."
Here is the translation of the provided text: "RaHo, anyone who wills it, my father in heaven is my brother and my sister and my mother."
Like the farmer (Mark 4:1-9; Luke 8:4-8)
And Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake that very day.
Many people gathered around him until he got into a boat, while all the people stood on the shore.
And he told them many things in parables: "A farmer went out to sow.
And while he was sowing, some seed fell on the path, and the birds came and ate it.
And there's another seed that fell on a land with rocks, not much soil, but it sprouted on time because its soil wasn't much.
But when the sun came out, it scorched and dried up, because it had no veins.
And another seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it.
And there is another seed that fell into fertile soil and spread across the plains. There are those that brought forth bitter waters, as much as what was sown. And there are those that brought sixty, and there are those that brought thirty.
"Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear!" Why did Jesus speak in parables (Mark 4:10-12; Luke 8:9-10)?
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and said, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
And he answered them, "To you the secrets of the kingdom of heaven have been given; but to them they have not been given."
Here is the English translation: He who has, will be given more and will have abundantly. But he who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.
That's why I speak to them in parables, because they look, but do not see; they hear, but do not understand.
Here is the translation of the provided text: **English Translation:** # Isaiah 6:9-10; Mark 8:18; John 12:39-41; Acts 28:26-27 Fulfilled in them was the prophecy of Isaiah which says: "**You will listen, but never understand; you will look, but never see.**" (Isaiah 6:9-10) **Notes:** * The text includes references to biblical passages. * The original text is in Arabic, and the translation provided is in English. * The translation aims to be accurate and faithful to the original meaning.
Here is the English translation of the provided text: "Here is this people, their hearts are hardened, they have closed their ears and shut their eyes, so that they do not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their hearts, and they will return to me, so that I may heal them."
As for you, may your eyes be healthy because they see, and may your ears be healthy because they hear.
Listen carefully: many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see and did not see it, and to hear what you hear and did not hear it." (Explanation of the Parable of the Sower - Mark 4:13-20; Luke 8:11-15)
Therefore, listen to what is meant by the proverb "The farmer":
When anyone hears the word of the kingdom of God and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path.
Here is the translation of the given text: And he who sows in the ground where there is stone, is the one who hears the word and at the right time accepts it with joy.
But if it has no roots within, it will endure for a little while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the Word, immediately it will fall.
The one who plants in the midst of thorns is the one who hears the word, but the worries of the world and the love of wealth strangle the word and he becomes empty of seed.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "And he who sows in the good soil, is he who hears the word and understands it, and brings forth much fruit; but there is he who brings forth a hundredfold, and another sixty, and another thirty." (Like the Tares)
And Jesus said to them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
When everyone was sleeping, the enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.
And when the seed grew and produced wheat, the darnel also grew along with it.
The servants of the landowner came to him and said, "Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where, then, did the weeds come from?"
He told them, "An enemy of mine has done this very thing." The servants said to him, "Do you want us to go and gather the weeds?"
Here's the English translation: He said, "No, so you don't uproot the wheat while you are gathering the tares."
Let both the wheat and the tares grow together until the harvest, and then I will say to the reapers, Gather the tares first and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barns."» Like the mustard seed and the yeast (Mark 4:30-32; Luke 13:18-19)
And he gave them another parable, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like unto a mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his garden.
She was the smallest of all the seeds, but when she grew up, she became bigger than all the vegetables, and she became a tree, to the extent that the birds of the sky come and nest in her.»
Here is the English translation: And he said another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till the whole was leavened."
Jesus spoke to the people in parables. He did not tell them anything without using a parable.
Here is the English translation of the provided Arabic text: **The events described were to fulfill what the prophet had said: "My mouth shall speak of parables, and I shall declare dark sayings from of old." (Interpretation of the Parable of the Tares)**
At that time, Jesus sent the people away and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds."
Answer them, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man."
The sowing is the world, and the good seed is the children of the Kingdom of God, and the tares are the children of the evil one,
And the enemy who planted them is Satan, and the harvest is the end times, and the harvesters are the angels.
And exactly as the tares are gathered and burned with fire, so shall it be at the end of the world.
As for me, I am the Son of Man to send my angels, and they will gather out of my kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity.
And they will throw them in the midst of the fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
"And at that time the righteous will shine like the sun in their father's kingdom. Whoever has ears, let them hear!" Like the treasure, the diamond, and the net.
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and in his joy he went and sold all that he had and bought that field.
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls.
Like finding a valuable piece of gold, he walked and sold everything he had and bought it.
Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and gathered in large numbers of different kinds of fish.
When it was full, the fishermen took it to the shore, sat down, and put the good fish in boxes and the bad ones they threw away.
And so it will happen in the End Times: the angels will come and separate the evil ones from among the righteous.
And they throw them in the midst of the fire, and the future will be weeping and the loss of years." The new and the old.
And Jesus said to his disciples, "Do you understand all of this?" They answered, "Yes."
And He said to them: "This is why every scribe who becomes a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a household who brings out from his treasure what is new and what is old."
And when Jesus finished this parable, he went away from that place.
And as he went throughout his own country, he began to teach them in their synagogues, and they were astonished and said, "Where did this man get all this wisdom and these miraculous powers?
My friend, isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary? And aren't his brothers called James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
"And aren't all his sisters girls, all of whom are with us? So where did this man get all this from?"
And that's why they were suspicious of him. Jesus said to them, "A prophet has no honor in his own country and in his own house."
And He did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith in Him.
The Death of John the Baptist (Mark 6:14-29; Luke 9:7-9)
At that time, King Herod heard reports about Jesus.
And he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist risen from the dead; and that is why he performs miracles."
And Herod arrested John, bound him, and imprisoned him because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
Because John told him, "It is not right for you to take her."
He wanted to kill him, but he was afraid of the people because they considered John a prophet.
When it was Herod's birthday, a daughter of Herodias danced at the feast and pleased Herod,
That's why he promised her and swore to her that he would give her anything she asked for.
And her mother-in-law, when she heard this, came and told Herod, "The woman is dancing for him and her friends; and she will not dance for me until I have given her John the Baptist's head on a platter."
And the king was sad, but he ordered that she be given whatever she desired, because of the oath he had sworn and his guests.
And he sent someone, who cut off John's head in prison.
And they brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, but she took it to her mother.
And John's disciples came and mourned over his body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus. Jesus feeds five thousand men (Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-14)
When Jesus heard about this, he left the area by boat and went to a remote place. But when the people heard about him, they followed him on foot from the towns.
Coming down from the boat, he saw a large crowd of people, and out of compassion for them, he cured their sick.
In the late afternoon, his disciples approached him and said, "The day is ending, and this place is deserted. Send the people away so they can go to the villages and buy something to eat."
Jesus said, "You do not need to go. You give them something to eat."
They said to him, "We have nothing but five loaves and two fish."
Jesus said, "Bring them here to me."
And he ordered the people to sit on the ground amidst the grass. He took the five loaves of bread and the two fish, raised his eyes to heaven, blessed and broke the loaves of bread and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
And they all ate and were satisfied. And they carried twelve full baskets of what remained.
And the people who ate were about five thousand men, not counting the women and children. Jesus Walks on Water (Mark 6:45-52; John 6:15-21)
And then, he precisely ordered his disciples to get into the boat and precede him to the opposite side of the lake until he sends the people to go.
And after he sent the people away, he went up alone to the mountain to pray. And after the sun had set, he was the one going alone.
But at that time the boat was already too far from the shore and was overpowered by the waves, because the wind was against it.
And before dawn, Jesus came walking on the water to them.
The pupils were frightened when they saw him walking on the water, and they said, "This is a phantom!" And they began to cry out in fear.
As for Jesus, he spoke to them at that time and said to them, "Be of good cheer. I am he, do not be afraid!"
And Peter answered him, "Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus.
But the fisherman was afraid, because the wind was strong, so he started to sink, and he cried out: "Oh Lord, save me!"
At that time, Jesus stretched out his hand, touched him, and said to him, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
And as they sailed in the boat, the wind fell.
And when He was entered into a ship, His disciples followed Him. And behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, so that the ship was covered with waves, but Jesus was asleep. And His disciples came to Him and awoke Him, saying, "Save us, we perish." And Jesus arose, and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea, "Peace, be still." And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. And Jesus said unto His disciples, "Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?" And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, "What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?"
And Jesus and his disciples sailed to that place and came to the region of Gennesaret.
And when the people of that country learned about Jesus, they spread the news of His power throughout the entire region, and all the sick people were brought to Him.
And they asked him to let them touch even the edge of his belongings. And everyone who touched him was completely healed.
The Traditions of the Ancestors (Mark 7:1-13)
And the Pharisees and the scribes of the Jews came to Jesus from Jerusalem, and they said:
"Why don't your students respect the customs of the elders? And why don't they wash their hands when they eat?"
Answer them: "Why do you not obey the commandment of God, but hold fast to your traditions?"
Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long and the Lord your God may bless you. For the Lord your God is a compassionate and merciful God. He is patient and full of compassion, and he is willing to forgive. If, with humility, you repent and turn from your unfaithfulness, and if you are willing to listen to the voice of the Lord your God, then the Lord your God, in his compassion, will be gracious to you again. He will gather you from all the nations where the Lord your God has scattered you. Then the Lord your God will bring you into the land that he swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give you a land as large as your heart can imagine.
Here's the English translation of the provided text: "And you say, if someone tells his father or mother: 'What I was helping you with, I have given to God. He doesn't *have* to honor his father.'"
And thus you have made the word of God of none effect through your traditions.
O hypocrites, Isaiah was true when he prophesied and said about you:
This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
"What comes out of a person is what defiles them." (Mark 7:14-23)
Jesus called the people and said to them, "Listen and understand."
It is not what enters into the mouth that defiles the person, but it is what proceeds out of the mouth that defiles the person."
And his disciples came and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard these words?"
Answer them, "Every tree that my Father in heaven did not plant will be uprooted."
"Get away from them! They are blind leading blind. And if a blind man is leading a blind man, they will both fall into a pit."
Peter said to him, "Explain to us this parable."
And Jesus said, "O you of little faith, do you not understand yet?"
Come on, don't you see that anything that enters the mouth goes to the stomach, and then it leaves the body?
What comes out of the mouth comes from the heart, and that is what defiles a person.
For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies,
Here are those who defile a person. But eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person." The faith of the Canaanite woman (Mark 7:24-30)
Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
And as he was going along, a woman from Canaan came out of the fields and cried out, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is tormented by a demon; she is often thrown into a fire or into a well. But Jesus said to her, "Let the children be filled first; for it is not good to take the children's food and throw it to the dogs." But she said to him, "Yes, Lord; for even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' tables." And Jesus answered her, "O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that hour.
As for him, he didn't answer her with a single word. Then his disciples came and scolded him, saying, "Give her what she wants so that she will leave us alone! She keeps following behind us and shouting!"
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Here she is, she came and knelt down on her knees in front of him and said: "My lord, help me!"
And He answered her, "It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
She said, "Yes, sir! Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table."
Jesus answered her, "Woman, your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you wish." And immediately her daughter was healed. Jesus heals many people.
Jesus walked from there, crossed the shore of Lake Galilee, went up the mountain, and sat there.
Many people came to him, bringing with them paralyzed, lame, blind, and many others. They placed them in front of his pool, and he healed them.
And the people were amazed as they saw the lame speaking, the paralyzed walking, the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel. Jesus feeds four thousand men (Mark 8:1-10)
And Jesus called His disciples and said to them, "The people are with Me for three days without food, and I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."
And the disciples said to him, "Where will we get bread in this desolate place to satisfy all these people?"
Jesus said to them, "How much bread do you have?" They said, "Seven loaves and a few small fish."
And Jesus commanded the people to sit on the ground,
And He took the seven loaves and the fish, and He thanked God, and He divided them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
And they all ate until they were full, and they took away the seven large baskets that were filled with what remained.
Here are a few options for translating the provided text, with slight variations in emphasis and nuance: **Option 1 (Focus on directness):** > The ones who ate were four thousand men, not counting the women and children. **Option 2 (Slightly more formal and emphasizing the total):** > The total number of those who consumed the food was four thousand individuals, aside from the women and children. **Option 3 (More concise and slightly less formal):** > Four thousand men ate, excluding women and children. **Explanation of Choices:** * **"The ones who ate" vs. "Those who consumed the food" vs. "Four thousand men ate":** These options represent a spectrum from very literal and slightly awkward ("consumed the food") to more natural and concise ("Four thousand men ate"). The best choice depends on the desired tone and context. * **"not counting the women and children" vs. "aside from the women and children" vs. "excluding women and children":** These options are similar to the previous set, but they focus on the specific phrase used to exclude the women and children. "Not counting" is a very common and natural phrase. "Aside from" and "excluding" are also perfectly acceptable and slightly more formal. In summary, the best translation will depend on the specific context and the desired tone. However, all of the options provided are grammatically correct and convey the essential meaning of the original text.
And after he sent the people away, he went and got in the felucca and went to the area of Majdal.
The signs of the times (Mark 8:11-13; Luke 12:54-56).
And so the Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, and they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
And Jesus answered them: "When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'
In the morning you say, "It's going to rain today, because the sky is deep red." You know how to interpret the condition of the sky, but you do not know how to interpret the signs of the times.
"A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it, except the sign of Jonah.» And he left them and went away. The Leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees (Mark 8:14-21)
When the students reached the opposite shore, they forgot to bring the bread with them.
Jesus said to them, "Watch out and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students discussed among themselves and said: "That's because we don't have bread."
As for Jesus, He knew about this and said, "Why do you who have little faith discuss among yourselves the issue of, 'We have no bread,' " ?
My brother, don't you understand now? Don't you remember the five loaves that were distributed to the five thousand, and how many large baskets you filled with what remained?
And the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many large baskets did you fill?
How is it that you still do not understand that I am not talking about bread? Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!»
At that time, they understood that he was telling them, "Be careful of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees, not the leaven of bread." Peter testifies that Jesus is the Christ (Mark 8:27-30; Luke 9:18-21).
When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "What do people say about the Son of Man?"
They answered him, "Some say you are John the Baptist; others, that you are Elijah; still others, that you are Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus said to him: "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For it is not flesh and blood that has revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
And I say to you: You are Peter, which means a large stone. And on this stone, I will build my church. And the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.
To give you the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
And at that time he instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus speaks for the first time about his death and resurrection (Mark 8:31; 9:1; Luke 9:22-27)
And at that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he had to go to Jerusalem and suffer at the hands of the elders, the chief priests, and the Jewish scribes, and be killed, and on the third day, rise.
And Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "God forbid, Lord! This shall never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are an obstacle to me; for you are not thinking about the things that are of God, but those that are of men."
At that time, Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to follow me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
Here is the English translation of the provided text: "Anyone who wants to waste their life, let them waste it. And whoever loses their life for my sake, they will find it."
What is the benefit of a person if they gain the whole world but lose their life? Or what is the thing that a person would give their life for?
Here am I, the Son of Man, come with my angels in the glory of my Father, and then I will repay every man according to his works.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "I tell you the truth: there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
Jesus reveals his glory to his disciples (Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36).
And after six days, Jesus took with him Peter and Jacob and John, his brother, and He went up with them alone to a high mountain.
And he changed before them, and his face shone like the sun and his clothes became white like light.
And the one going and the one coming, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking about Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will erect three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And while he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to Him!"
When the students heard this, they fell to the ground, face down, and were very, very afraid.
As Jesus came and touched them and said, "Arise, do not be afraid."
And when they looked up, they saw only Jesus.
And when they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell no one the things you have seen, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead."
And the disciples asked him, "Then why do the scribes of the Jews say that Elijah must come first?"
Answer them, "Truly, Elijah is coming, and he will restore all things."
As for me, I am telling you that Elijah has come and they did not recognize him, but they did to him everything they wanted to do. And the Son of Man will also suffer at their hands."
And at that time the disciples understood that he was telling them about John the Baptist. Jesus Heals a Boy Possessed by a Demon (Mark 9:14-29; Luke 9:37-43)
And when Jesus and His disciples came to the people, a man came to Him, knelt down on his knees before Jesus, and said:
Oh Lord, have mercy on my son. Because he is suffering and being tortured a lot, and he always falls into fire and water.
And I brought him to your students, but they were unable to heal him."
And Jesus answered and said, "Oh generation of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? How often would I have gathered you together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not! Go away from me, all of you, for you are a generation of vipers." (Matthew 12:34-37 ESV)
And Jesus cast out the demon, and it came out of him, and the child was healed immediately.
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus aside and said, "Why could we not cast him out?"
He told them, "Because of your weak faith! Truly I tell you, if you had faith even as small as a mustard seed, you would say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there!' and it would move. And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive it."
# ‏17‏:21 There are ancient texts in which this verse is found: However, this kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting. Jesus speaks again about His death and resurrection (Mark 9:30-32; Luke 9:43-45)
When the disciples were gathered together in Galilee, Jesus said to them: "Behold, the Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men."
And he said, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? And about the ninth hour he cried out with a loud voice, 'Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?' And some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, 'This man is calling for Elijah.' And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed and offered him to drink. And the others said, 'Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.' And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, 'Lazarus, come out!' And the man who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with bandages, and his face covered with a cloth. Jesus said to them, 'Unbind him, and let him go.'
As they were going up to Jerusalem, Jesus took his disciples aside and told them, "Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees." Then Jesus told them, "Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees." And he said, "The teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees are not the true teachings of Moses. They have made their teachings into a convenient way of life. They follow the traditions of men, rather than the commandments of God."
He answered, "Yes, it is so." And when he went home, Jesus went ahead of him in conversation and said, "What do you think, Simon? Whose earthly kings charge duties and taxes, that is, tribute? From their own countrymen or from foreigners?"
Peter said, "He is from the region of the Paneas." Jesus said to him, "Then, the people of the land are free."
Here's the English translation: "See, we don't want to cause them any trouble, so go to the lake and cast your fishing line, and catch the first fish you get, and when you open its mouth, you'll find a piece of silver enough for you and me to pay our taxes, so take it and pay my taxes and yours."
