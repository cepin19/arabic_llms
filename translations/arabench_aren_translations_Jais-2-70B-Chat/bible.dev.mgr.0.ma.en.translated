Chapter One: The Ancestors of Jesus Christ
These are the names of the ancestors of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:
Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren.
And Judah begot Perez and Zerah of Tamar; and Perez begot Hezron, and Hezron begot Aram.
And Aram begat Amminadab, and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,
And Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth, and Obed begat Jesse.
And Jesse begat David the king. And David begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Uriah,
Solomon the son of Rehoboam, and Rehoboam the son of Abijah, and Abijah the son of Asa,
And Asa the son of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat the son of Asa, and Asa the son of Abijah,
And Amaziah the father of Joash, Joash the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,
And Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh the father of Amos, and Amos the father of Josiah,
Josiah begat Jehoiakim and his brothers, in the time when the Jews were exiled to Babylon.
And after the Jews returned from Babylon, Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
And Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud, and Abiud was the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim was the father of Azor,
Azur the son of Zadok, and Zadok the son of Ahim, and Ahim the son of Elioud,
And Elmod, the son of Eliezer; and Eliezer the son of Matten, and Matten the son of Jacob,
And Jacob begot Joseph, the husband of Mary, who gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
From Abraham to David there were fourteen generations, and from David to the Babylonian exile there were fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian exile to the birth of Christ there were fourteen generations. The birth of Jesus Christ.
And this is how Jesus Christ was born: When Mary was engaged to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the power of the Holy Spirit. Luke
Youssef, her fiancé, was a pious man who feared God. He didn't want to expose her and decided to break up with her in secret.
And when he was thinking about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said to him, "O Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is by the power of the Holy Spirit."
Behold, you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son, and you shall call him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins." Luke
And all this happened so that the word of the Lord, spoken through the prophet who said:
Here is the translation of the provided text into English: "Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: the young woman will conceive and give birth to a son, and she will name him Immanuel," which means "God is with us."
And when Joseph woke up from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and he married Mary.
But he did not *know* her until she gave birth to a son. And he named him Jesus. Luke 2:21
Chapter Two: The Astrologers Come to See Jesus
And when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the time of King Herod, behold, wise men came from the east to Jerusalem, saying, "Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him."
They asked, "Where is the newborn king of the Jews? For we saw his star rising in the east and have come to worship him."
And when King Herod heard this, he was frightened, and so were all the people of Jerusalem.
And behold, there gathered together all the chief priests of the religious men and the scholars of the Islamic law, and he asked them, "Where is Christ to be born?"
And they answered him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written through the prophet:
And you, Bethlehem, which is in the land of Judah, you are not the least among the cities of Judah, because from you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.
And after that, Herod secretly sent for the leading astrologers and asked them where the Messiah had been born.
And after that, he sent them to Bethlehem and told them: "Go and search diligently for the child. And when you find him, come and tell me, so that I too may go and worship him."
And when they heard the king's words, they departed. And there appeared to them the star which they had seen in the east, and it went before them until it came to the place where the child was and it stood.
And as soon as they saw the star, they were very happy.
And when they entered the house, they saw the child and his mother Mary, and they knelt down and prostrated themselves to him, and they opened their boxes and gave him gold, frankincense, and pure musk.
And when an angel warned them in a dream not to return to Herod, they took another road and returned to their country. The family of Jesus flees to Egypt
And after the scholars departed, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said to him: "Arise and take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you the time to return, because Herod is going to seek the child to kill him."
And Joseph got up and took the boy and his mother by night, and they went to Egypt.
And he remained there until Herod died, in order to fulfill the word of the Lord spoken through the prophet who said: "Out of Egypt I have called my son." Herod was killing the young children.
And when Herod realized that the astrologers had deceived him, he became very angry and ordered that all the young boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity, who were two years old or less, be killed, because that was the length of time that had passed since the time he had learned about it from the astrologers.
And so the word of the Lord was fulfilled, spoken through the prophet Jeremiah, who said:
«From Ramah you can hear the cries, much weeping and wailing. Rachel is weeping for her children and refuses to be comforted, for her children are dead.» The family of Jesus returns from Egypt.
And when Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, while he was in Egypt,
And He said to him, "Rise, take the boy and his mother, and return to the land of Israel, because those who wanted to kill the boy are dead."
And Joseph arose, and took the child and his mother, and returned to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go back there. And because God had warned him in a dream, he went to the region of Galilee.
And he came to a city called Nazareth and lived there, so that what was spoken by God through the prophets who said: "He will be called a Nazarene." Mark 1:24; Luke 2:39; John 1:45
Chapter Three: John the Baptist Prepares the Way for Jesus
In those days, John the Baptist came into the wilderness of the country of Judea, preaching to the people,
And he says to them, "Repent, for the time of the kingdom of heaven is near." Matthew
And this is the man about whom the prophet Isaiah spoke when he said: "A voice cries out in the desert: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.'"
And John's clothing was made of camel hair, and his belt, which he used to gird himself, was made of leather, and he lived on locusts and wild honey.
And people were coming to him from Jerusalem and all the region of Judea, and all the surrounding areas of the Jordan Valley.
And they went to the Jordan River because of him, while they were confessing their sins.
And when John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to be baptized by him, he said to them, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Matthew 3:7-10
Well then, demonstrate your repentance through your good deeds.
And do not start saying to yourselves, "Who is this, this 'Abraham'? I tell you, God is able to make children of Abraham from these stones." John
And now the axe is laid to the root of the tree, and every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. When?
I will baptize you with water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
And in it the rich man, with his studies, will gather the wheat in his granaries, but the straw, he will burn it with the fire that will never be extinguished." John baptizes Jesus.
And afterward, Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to John, to be baptized by him.
But John didn't let him, and said to him: "I am the one who needs you to baptize me, and you are coming to me to be baptized by me?"
And Jesus answered him and said to him: "Allow this to happen now, for it is necessary for us to fulfill the will of God." And John allowed him to be baptized.
And after the baptism of Jesus, he came up out of the water, and just as they were watching, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.
And a voice came from heaven saying: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Matthew 12:18; 17:5; Mark 1:11; Luke 9:35
Chapter Four: Satan Tempts Jesus
And after that, God sent Jesus to the desert to be tempted by Satan. Hebrews
And he fasted for forty days and forty nights, and then hunger came to him.
And Satan came to him, the one who tempts, and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread."
Jesus replied to him, "It is written in God's book: 'Not by bread alone does a person live, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'"
And afterward, the devil took him to the holy city of Jerusalem, and he stood him on a high mountain before the house of God.
And He said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written: 'He will command His angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that your feet will not strike against a stone.'"
And Jesus answered him, "It is written in the book of God again, 'Do not test the Lord your God.' "
And then the Devil took him up to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.
And he said to him, "All of this I will give to you if you fall down and worship me."
Jesus replied to him, "Go away, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.'"
And after that, the Devil left him, and some angels came to wait on him. Jesus Preaches in Galilee
When Jesus heard that John the Baptist had been arrested and imprisoned, he withdrew once more to Galilee. (Matthew)
And leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which is by the Sea of Galilee, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.' John
And so it was that it came to pass what the prophet Isaiah had said:
O land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, which lies along the way to the sea, on the other side of the Jordan River, the land of Galilee of the nations who are not Jews!
The people who sit in darkness saw a great light, and those who live in the land of death and in the midst of it, a light dawned upon them."
From that time on, Jesus began to preach to the people and say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near." Matthew 3:2 Jesus Chooses His First Disciples
And when Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who was called Peter and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
And Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of people."
And then they left their window and followed him.
And after that, he went from there and saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, with their father Zebedee in a boat mending their nets. And immediately he called them,
And they left the boat, their father, and they followed Jesus. Jesus teaches and heals.
And Jesus went throughout all the Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and healing those who were sick with every disease and every weakness. Matthew
His fame spread throughout Syria, and they brought him all the sick people who suffered from various diseases: those possessed, those afflicted with winds, those crawling, and he healed them.
And many groups followed him from Galilee, the Ten Cities, Jerusalem, the region of Judea, and the other side of the Jordan River.
Chapter 5: The Sermon of Jesus on the Mount
And when Jesus saw the crowds of people, he went up the mountain. And when he sat down, his disciples came to him.
And it seemed like he was teaching them, and he said:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who weep, for God will comfort them.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who are hungry and thirsty for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
Blessed are those who help people live in peace, for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who suffer persecution for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 1Peter 3:14
And your happiness, if people insult you, transgress against you, and say all kinds of bad things about you with lies, because of me. 1Peter 4:14
They were filled with joy and were overjoyed, because your great reward is in the heavens; for in this way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. Acts 7:52 The salt of the earth and the light of the world.
You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34,35
You are the light of the world; a city set on a hill cannot be hidden. John
And there is no one who lights a lamp and puts it under a measuring basket, but rather it is placed in its place so that it illuminates everyone in the house. Mark
And so, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven." 1Peter 2:12 The Law
Here is the English translation of the provided text: "Make no mistake, I have not come to abolish the law of Moses or the writings of the Prophets. I have not come to abolish them, but rather to fulfill them."
And I tell you the truth: heaven and earth may pass away, but not one letter, not one stroke of a pen, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Luke
Truly, unless one is born again through water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. Water gives the Holy Spirit to those who believe in Jesus. Truly, unless one is born again through water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.
And I say to you: Unless your obedience exceeds that of the scholars of Islamic law and the Pharisees, you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven.' The anger.
You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'You shall not murder. And if anyone murders, he must be put to death.'
But I tell you: Whoever is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment; whoever calls his brother 'Raca' is answerable to the Sanhedrin. And whoever calls his brother 'Fool' will be in danger of hellfire.
Otherwise, you brought your gift and placed it on the altar, and then you thought that you were right on the side of your brother.
Set your gift down before the altar. Go first and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.
Make peace with the one who is suing you. As long as you are both still on the way to court, before he takes you to the judge, and the judge puts you in the hands of the policeman, and the policeman takes you into prison.
I'll tell you the truth: you're not going to get out of there until you pay the last riyal you owe». Corruption
And have you heard it said, "Don't corrupt"?
But I say to you: Whoever looks at a woman to desire her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to stumble into sin, tear it out and throw it away from you. For it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. Matthew
Otherwise, your right hand would be like causing you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you, because it is better for you to lose a part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell." Matthew 18:8; Mark 9:43 Divorce
«And it was said again: Whoever divorces his wife, it is necessary to give her her freedom. Matthew»
But I say to you: whoever divorces his wife for any reason other than marital unfaithfulness commits adultery against her. And if a man marries a divorced woman, he commits adultery." Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11,12; Luke 16:18; 1 Corinthians 7:10,11 The Swine
And have you not heard that it was also said to your ancestors: If you make a vow, do not delay to fulfill it, for the Lord will not allow the righteous to go unpunished, and he will fulfill his vow to the Lord, and the Lord will not allow the righteous to go unpunished, and he will fulfill his vow to the Lord.
As for me, I tell you: Never swear, not by heaven because it is God's throne, Jacob
Neither by the earth, for it is the place of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king.
And don't swear by your head either, because you can't turn back even one black or white hair from it.
"But if your answer is yes, say: 'Yes.' And if your answer is no, say: 'No.' And anything beyond this is from the devil." Vengeance
And have you not heard that it was said: 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth'?
But I say to you: Do not resist evil with evil, but the one who slapped you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.
And whoever wants to sue you in court to take your djellaba from you, let him even have your shirt.
If someone forces you to walk a thousand steps with them, go two thousand steps with them.
And whoever asks you for something, give it to them. And whoever wants to borrow from you, don't send them away empty-handed. Love your enemies.
And have you heard it said: You love those who are close to you and hate your enemy.
But I tell you: Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.
So that you may be children of your father in heaven. For he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
Because if you only love those who love you back, what reward do you have? For even the tax collectors do the same thing.
Otherwise, you only greet your brothers alone. What makes you better than others? Is it not that even those who worship idols do the same?
Be perfect, then, just as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Chapter 6. Charity
Beware of doing your charitable acts before men, in order to be seen by them; otherwise you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. Matthew
If you want to give charity, don't sound a trumpet before men, like the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may receive glory from men. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward in full.
But if you give charity, your left hand should not know what your right hand is doing.
"To keep your charity secret, and your father who is in heaven, from whom nothing is hidden, is the one who will reward you." Prayer
"When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that they may be seen by others. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. Luke"
When you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your father who is in secret. Your father, from whom nothing is hidden, is the one who will reward you.
And when you pray, do not babble on like the pagans, who imagine that they will be heard because of their many words.
So, don't be like them, because your Father in heaven knows what you need before you ask him.
Here is the translation: "And so pray this prayer: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name."
Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as in heaven.
The bread that is enough for us is our daily sustenance.
And forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us.
And He kept us so that we would not fail in the trial, and we were saved from the devil.
For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you your trespasses.
But if you do not forgive people their offenses, your Father in heaven will not forgive your offenses." Fasting.
"Be silent, and do not be sullen like the hypocrites who frown their faces to show people that they are fasting. I tell you the truth: those have already received their reward from people."
But when you're fasting, oil your hair and wash your face.
Because it is not for the people to whom you must appear to be fasting, but for your father who is in secret, and your father whom nothing can conceal, that He may reward you. Treasures in heaven.
"Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal." - Jacob
But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.
"Wherever your treasure is, there your heart will be." Light of Being
The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eye is good, your whole body will be filled with light.
But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!" God and Money
Here is the translation of the provided text: "Even one cannot be a slave to two masters, because either they will hate one of them and love the other, or they will be loyal to one of them and will fall from the grace of the other. And so also you cannot be slaves of both God and wealth. Do not worry."
Therefore, I tell you: Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the sky; for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?
Which one of you, if he bears the burden, can add even an hour to his life?
And why do you carry the burden of clothing? Look well at the flowers in the field, how they grow. They don't suffer or toil.
But I'll tell you the truth: even Solomon himself, at the height of his glory, never wore anything as splendid as one of those flowers.
Well, you doubters! If the spring in the field, which we see today and which tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, is clothed by God thus, how will He not clothe you, you who are even better?
And because of this, do not worry at all and do not say: What will we eat? Or what will we drink? Or what will we wear?
Even those who don't know God ask for all these things, and your Father in heaven knows that you need all these things.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
And do not carry the worries of today into the coming day, let the worry of tomorrow be for tomorrow. And each day is enough for it to simply carry its own worries."
Chapter 7: Do not judge others.
Do not judge others, so that you will not be judged.
With the measure you measure, it will be measured to you; and with the same judgment you judge, you will be judged; and just as you give, it will be given to you. Mark
Why do you look at the straw in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log in your own eye?
And how are you going to tell your brother, "Let me remove the straw from your eye," when there's a log in your own eye?
Ah, this hypocrite! First, remove the log from your own eye; then you will see clearly to remove the speck of dust from your brother's eye.
Do not give what is sacred to the dogs, lest they turn on you and tear you apart; and do not throw your pearls before the swine, lest they trample them under their feet." Seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Ask, and you will receive. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Here is the English translation of the provided Moroccan Arabic text: **"All that he requests will be given to him, and whoever seeks will find, and whoever knocks on the door will have it opened for him."**
Which one of you, if his child asked him for bread, would give him a stone?
And if he only asks him for a fish, will he give him a snake?
Well, if you who are not good know how to give your children good things, how is it that your father in heaven does not give good things to those who ask him?
As you wish people would do with you, so you must also do with them, because this is the teaching of the Law and the Prophets." Luke 6:31 The Narrow Door
Enter through the narrow gate, for the gate that leads to destruction is wide and its road is easy, and many enter through it.
Here is the English translation: \n \n How narrow the door is and how difficult the road that leads to life is, and few are those who find it. The tree is known by its fruit.
Be careful of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
Here's the English translation: **"Their deeds betray them. Can you pick grapes from thorns, or figs from a sycamore tree?"**
And so, every good tree bears good fruit, and every bad tree bears bad fruit.
And a good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. - Matthew
And so, from their fruit, you will recognize them." Matthew 12:33 We need to do God's will.
Not everyone who calls out to me, 'Lord, Lord!' will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Rather, it is the person who does the will of my Father in heaven who will enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
That day, many who will say to me: "Oh sir, oh sir! Is it not in your name that we prophesied? In your name, we cast out demons? In your name, we did many miracles?"
At that moment, I will tell them: I never knew you! Get away from me, you sinners! The example of two houses.
Everyone who listens to my words and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
And when the rain fell and the rivers overflowed, and a strong wind came and struck that house, it did not collapse, because its foundation was built on the rock.
And all those who hear my words and do not act upon them are like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
And when the rain fell and the rivers overflowed, and a strong wind came and struck that house, it collapsed and its collapse was powerful."
And when Jesus finished this discourse, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, Mark.
Because he was teaching them like someone who had authority, not like the scholars of their religious law.
Chapter Eight: Jesus Heals a Leper
And when Jesus came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
A leper approached him, prostrated himself before him and said, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, and said, "I will, be clean!" And immediately the leprosy left him and he was clean.
And Jesus said to him, "Be careful not to tell this to anyone, but go and show yourself to the religious leader. Offer the gift that Moses commanded, so that this may be a testimony to them." The officer's servant was healed.
And when Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, entreating him,
And he said to him, "Master, my servant at home is lying on a bed, paralyzed, and suffering greatly."
And he said to him Jesus: "Behold I am going to heal him."
And the military commander answered him, "I am not worthy, my lord, to have you enter under the roof of my house. But just say one word, and my servant will be healed."
Because even I have someone who judges me, and I have an army that I rule over. I tell this one: Go! And he goes. And I tell the other: Come here! And he comes. And I tell my servant: Do this! And he does it."
And when Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed him: "I tell you the truth: I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel."
Let me tell you, many people will come from the east and the west, and will sit down to eat with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven." Luke
As for those who should have been in the kingdom, they will be thrown out into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' Mat
And after that, Jesus said to the military commander: "Go! Because of your faith, it will be done for you as you wish." And at that very moment his servant was healed. Jesus heals Peter's mother-in-law and many other people.
And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he found Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed, sick with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and as she walked, the fever left her. She got up and served him.
And when the evening came, they brought to him many possessed by demons; and he cast out the spirits by a word, and he healed all the sick.
And so it was fulfilled that which the prophet Isaiah had said: "He took our pain and carried our diseases." How should those be who follow Jesus?
And when Jesus saw the crowd of people surrounding him, he told his disciples to cross to the other side of the sea.
He brought one of the religious scholars close to him and said to him, "My master, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered and said, "The foxes have their holes, and the birds of the sky have their nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."
And another of his disciples said to him, "Master, allow me to go and bury my father first."
But Jesus answered him, "Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God." Jesus was calming a great commotion.
And when Jesus entered the boat, his disciples followed him.
And a great and strong wind came on the sea, so that the boat was filled with water, and Jesus was sleeping.
And his disciples approached him and woke him up, saying to him, "Master, save us, for we are perishing!"
And he said to them, "Why are you afraid, you of little faith?" And when he rose, he rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.
And the men wondered, saying, "What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?" Jesus drove out demons from two men from the Gerasenes.
And when Jesus arrived on the other side of the sea, near the country of the Gadarenes, two men possessed by demons, coming from the cemetery, met him. And they were so dangerous that no one could pass by on that road.
As soon as they saw him, they began to shout and say, "What do you have to do with us, son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"
There was a large herd of wild boars grazing in a nearby area.
And the madmen wanted Jesus and said to him: "If you drive us out, send us to enter the herd of pigs."
And he said to them: "Go!" And they went in, and the whole piece moved and fell from the edge of the mountain into the sea and sank in the water.
And the possessed men fled and went to the city and reported all that had happened, and what had befallen the men who were possessed by madness.
And all the people of the city went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their country.
Chapter 9: Jesus Heals a Paralytic
Jesus got into the boat and crossed the sea and returned to his city.
And some people brought him a paralyzed man lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man: "Take heart, my son, for your sins are forgiven."
And some of the scholars of Islamic law said to themselves: "This man speaks words of unbelief!".
And Jesus knew their thoughts, and He said, "Why do you think evil things in your hearts?"
As for an easy one, it is said: "Your sins are forgiven," or it is said: "Get up and go?"
But I will show you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. And He said to the paralytic, "Get up, pick up your bed and go to your house."
And the man got up and went to his house.
And when the groups of people saw what had happened, they were afraid and praised God, who had given people such authority. Jesus Chooses Matthew
And when Jesus was going from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting in the tax collector's booth. And he said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and followed him.
And afterward, Jesus sat down to eat at Matthew's house, and many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. Luke
And when the Pharisees saw him, they said to his disciples: "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
And when Jesus heard them, He answered them and said: "It is those who are sick who need a doctor, not those who are healthy."
Here is the English translation of the provided Moroccan Arabic text: "Well then, go and learn the meaning of this statement: I only desired mercy, not sacrifice, because I did not come to call upon those who fear God, but rather upon the sinners." Question about fasting.
And then the disciples of John the Baptist came to Jesus and asked him: "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
And Jesus answered them and said to them: "Can those who are invited to the wedding mourn while the bridegroom is with them? For the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from their midst, and then they will fast."
No one patches an old sock with a piece of new cloth, because the patch would shrink and the hole would get bigger.
Here is the English translation of the provided text: "And no one puts new wine into old leather bags, because if they do, the bags will burst, and the wine will be lost and the bags will be ruined. But new wine is put into new leather bags, so that nothing is lost, neither wine nor bags." The president's daughter and the woman who touched Jesus' clothes.
And when he was telling them this, a chief came to him, prostrated himself before him, and said: "My daughter has just died, but come and put your hand on her and she will live."
And Jesus arose and followed him, He and His disciples.
And there was a woman who had been ill for twelve years, constantly bleeding. She came up behind Jesus and touched the hem of his garment.
Because she thought to herself: "If I just touch his things, I'll feel better."
While Jesus was walking around, he saw her and said, "Don't be afraid, daughter. Your faith has made you well." And at that moment, the woman was healed.
And when Jesus arrived at the chief official's house, he saw the people wailing loudly in mourning, and the crowd of people was making a commotion.
He told them, "Get out of here! The girl is not dead, she is just sleeping!" They laughed at him.
And when Jesus brought them out, he went in and took the girl by her hand, and she got up.
The news spread throughout those areas. Jesus heals two blind men.
And as Jesus was passing by there, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, "Have mercy on us, O Son of David!"
And when he entered the house, the blind men approached him. And Jesus asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to heal you?" And they answered, "Yes, Lord!"
And at that very hour, Jesus touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith, it will be done to you."
And their eyes were opened, and Jesus rebuked them, saying, "Be careful not to tell this to anyone!"
But they went out and started spreading the news in all those areas. Zizoun is recovering.
And they hadn't even finished explaining to the blind man how to get out, when they brought him a completely insane and possessed man.
And when Jesus cast out the demons, the man spoke. And the crowds of people were amazed and said, "We have never seen anything like this in Israel!"
The Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the prince of demons!" Matthew 10:25; 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15 The Temptation of Jesus
And Jesus was going through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom of God. And he was healing every disease and every affliction among the people. Matthew
And when he saw the crowds of people, he had compassion for them because they were distressed and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd. Mark
And he says to his disciples: "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few." Luke
So they asked the owner of the harvest to send the harvesters to harvest his harvest."
Chapter 10: Jesus Sends Out His Twelve Disciples
And afterward, Jesus called his twelve disciples and gave them authority to cast out demons, and to heal people of every disease and every affliction.
And these are the names of the twelve apostles: The first of them is Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother,
And Philip and Bartholomew, and Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus,
Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who would betray Jesus.
And Jesus sent these twelve out and he gave them authority over unclean spirits, and he instructed them to take nothing for the journey, no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, and they were not to carry a second tunic. And he said to them, "Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that city. And as for the towns in which you do not receive you, as you leave them shake the dust off your feet. Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah than for the city that refuses to listen to the words spoken by the messengers from God."
But go to the diseased sheep of the people of Israel.
As you go, tell everyone, 'The Kingdom of Heaven is near.'
They healed the sick, raised the dead, made the lame leap for joy, and cast out demons. They took nothing for themselves, so they should give nothing.
Don't take anything out of your pockets - no gold, no silver, no copper.
No pack, no two suits, no shoes, no crutches, because the worker is worthy of his food. 1 Corinthians 9:14; 1 Timothy 5:18
And the city or the village you enter, ask about someone who deserves to host you, and stay with him until you leave on your own.
Otherwise, if you enter someone's house, greet them.
Here's an English translation of the provided text: "Otherwise, if the people of the house deserve your greetings, then your greetings will reach them. But if they do not deserve it, then your greetings will return to you."
Or else they wouldn't have accepted you, the owners of some house or some city, or they wouldn't have listened to your words. They left from there and shook off the dust that was on their feet. The Businesses
Let me tell you the truth: the condition of the earth of Sodom and Gomorrah on the Day of Judgment will be lighter than the condition of that city. Luke 10:4-12 The coming invasion.
Here is the English translation of the Moroccan Arabic (Darija) text: "Hani, I'm sending you out like sheep among wolves. So be as careful as snakes, and as gentle as doves. Be aware."
Beware of people, because they will take you to court, and in their houses of prayer they will strike you, Mark.
And they will lead you before governors and kings because of me, to give testimony to them. And to the Gentiles.
And when they take you, don't worry about how or what you're going to say, because at that moment, they will give you what to say.
Because it is not you who will speak, but the spirit of your father who is in heaven who will give you the words to say.
A brother will betray his brother to be killed, and a father will betray his son to be killed, and children will rise up against their parents and kill them, Mark.
And they will hate you, all the people because of the name of mine. But that which remains steadfast until the end will be saved. Matta
But when they persecute you in one city, flee to another. I tell you the truth: you will not finish going over all the towns of Israel until the Son of Man comes."
The student is not above his teacher, nor the servant above his master. Luke
Woe to the scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For they build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the tombs of the righteous. And they say, 'If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have participated with them in the shedding of the blood of the prophets.' Thus, you testify against yourselves that you are the sons of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up, then, the measure of your ancestral sins! Therefore, I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town. And so, on you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. I tell you, it will be more tolerable on that day for Sodom than for you. And if Tyre and Sidon should have been enduring such a fate as yours, they would have repented long ago in ashes and sackcloth. But you, you are those who justify yourselves in the eyes of men, but God knows your hearts; for that which is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful but within are full of the bones of the dead and of all kinds of uncleanliness. Even so, on the outside you appear righteous to men, but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the tombs of the righteous. And they say, 'If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have participated with them in the shedding of the blood of the prophets.'

Do not be afraid of them, for everything that is secret will be revealed, and everything that is hidden will be made known. Mark
And because of that, what I told you last night, proclaim it during the day. And all the things you heard in secret, shout them from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who can kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather, fear the one who is able to destroy both the soul and the body in hell.
Here are two birds being sold for one dirham! But none of them will fall to the ground unless your father in heaven wills it.
Even the hair on your head is all numbered.
Well, don't worry, you are better off than many birds.
Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will acknowledge them before my Father who is in heaven.
But the one who denies me before others, I too will deny before my father in the heavens." 2 Timothy 2:12 Not with this one but with the sword.
Beware, do not think that I have come to establish peace on earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I came to separate the son from his father, the daughter from her mother, and the bride from her mother-in-law.
And they will become enemies of humans, those who are in their homes.
Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me does not deserve me. And anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me does not deserve me.
Whoever does not pick up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Matthew

The one who welcomed you welcomed me, and the one who welcomed me welcomed the one who sent me. Luke
And whoever welcomes a prophet, knowing him to be a prophet, will receive a reward similar to that of the prophet. And whoever welcomes a God-fearing person, knowing him to be God-fearing, will receive a reward similar to that of the God-fearing person.
Here is the English translation of the provided text: "Anyone who gives even a glass of cold water to one of these young children, because he is my student, I tell you the truth, he will not lose out on the reward for his good deed."
Chapter 13, John the Baptist sends his disciples to Jesus.
And when Jesus finished the commandments that he had given to his twelve disciples, he left there to teach and preach the gospel in the towns of the Jews.
And when John, who was in prison because of what Christ was doing, heard about it, he sent his disciples to ask him.
And he said to him, "Are you the one who is coming, or should we wait for someone else?"
And Jesus answered them and said to them, "Go and tell John everything you hear and see:
The blind are seeing, the lame are walking, the lepers are being cleansed, the deaf are hearing, the dead are being raised, and the poor are hearing the good news.
And blessed is the one who will not doubt me."
And when John's disciples left to follow their own paths, Jesus began to speak to the crowds of people about John, saying, "What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind?
What then have you gone out to see? A man dressed in fine clothing? For those who wear fine clothing are in palaces of kings!
Tell me, what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, he is more than a prophet.
Here is the translation of the given text: "And behold, this is the one about whom God said in His book: 'Behold, I send My messenger ahead of you, who will prepare the way for you.'"
And I tell you the truth: there does not appear from among those born of women any greater than John the Baptist; but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and violent people are trying to seize it by force. Luke
And all the prophets and Moses' law prophesied until the time when John the Baptist came.
If you believe, John the Baptist is the Elijah who is to come. Matthew
Well then, whoever has ears, let them hear!
But what can I compare this generation to? It's like some kids sitting in the market, shouting at each other and saying:
We blew into your Lira but you didn't dance, and we wailed for you but you didn't cry!
Here comes John, and he doesn't eat or drink, and they say: This one is possessed by a demon.
And the human child came, eating and drinking, and they said: This one is a glutton, a drunkard, and associates only with tax collectors and sinners! But the wisdom of God appears to be good from its fruits. Woe to the blogger who does not repent.
And at that time, Jesus began to rebuke the scribes who had done more miracles among them than the other scribes, because their people had not repented.
"Wo unto thee, Chorazin! wo unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes." Matthew 11:21 "For they that dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled the words of the prophets, which they desired to hear, but would not hear." Acts 13:27-29 "And the Lord said, Because this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precepts of men:" Isaiah 29:13 "But go ye now unto the by-ways, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled." Luke 14:23 "Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven." Mark 10:23 "And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto them, How many are there? And they said unto him, We cannot tell." Luke 14:31-32 "Then said he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few, Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest." Matthew 9:37-38 "And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again." Luke 6:38 "Then said he unto his disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto that man by whom the offence cometh!" Matthew 18:7 "And he said, Because of thy hardness of heart he wrote thee this precept." Mark 10:5 "Then understood they how that he spake unto them of John the Baptist." Matthew 11:10 "And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might become blind." John 9:39 "Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any man desires to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me." Matthew 16:24 "And he said unto them, Take heed and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth." Luke 12:15 "Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life." John 8:12 "And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, excess, slander, pride, foolishness: all these evil things come from within and defile the man." Mark 7:20-23 "Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, And he said, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in the chair of Moses: For all their works they do to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi, And be called masters by the means of an alphabet, and a few other things, And by this means you shall all be called rabbis and teachers by the congregation.'" Luke 11:46-47
But I tell you this: the fate of Tyre and Sidon will be lighter on the day of judgment than your fate.
Here you go: "What a Covenant of Grace! Will you even carry it up to the heavens? You are about to crash down all the way to the abyss. Because if the miracles that were performed for you had been performed in Sodom, then it would not have been utterly destroyed and it would have remained until this very day."
And because of this, I tell you: The end of Sodom will be lighter on the day of judgment than your punishment will be." Matthew 10:15; Luke 10:12 "Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest."
And at that very hour, Jesus spoke and said, "I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent and revealed them to little children, to those who have a humble and contrite heart."
Oh Father, so was your will.
The Father has given me everything, and no one knows who the Son of the Father is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son of the Father and only the one who is born of the Father wants to reveal him to him. John 3:35; John 1:18; 10:15
Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."
Chapter Twelve: Jesus Teaches About the Sabbath.
And on those days, one Saturday, Jesus passed through the fields of grain, and his disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat.
And when the Pharisees saw them, they said to Him, "Behold, Your disciples do what is not lawful to be done on the Sabbath!"
Here is the translation of the provided text: "And He said to them, 'Have you not read what David did when he and those with him were hungry?'"
And how he entered the house of God, and ate the bread that they offer to God, which he was not supposed to eat, neither he nor those who were with him, except the clergy alone.
Have you not read in the Torah that the Pharisees, while serving in the Temple of God on the Sabbath, are guilty of profaning the Sabbath, and yet they are not considered culpable?
But I tell you: There is someone here who is greater than the Temple.
And if you had understood the meaning of the verse that says: "I desired mercy and not sacrifice," you would not have judged those who are without blame.
Because man was made from the Lord of the Sabbath. Jesus heals on the Sabbath day.
And he walked from there and came to their prayer house.
And he found a man whose hand was paralyzed. And they were asking him and saying, "Is it permissible to heal on the Sabbath?" They asked him in order to find a charge against him.
And He answered them, "What man of you, having one sheep, and losing it in the wilderness, would not straightway go out into the mountains, and seek diligently for that which is lost? Luke
Well, a person's value is much greater than a sheep! And that's why doing good deeds is permissible on Saturday.»
And Jesus said to the man who had a withered hand: "Stretch out your hand!" And he stretched it out, and it was restored, becoming like the other hand.
And the Pharisees went out, agreeing together how they might kill him. Jesus is God's chosen one.
And when Jesus heard the news, he left that place, and large crowds of people followed him, and he healed them all.
And he instructed them not to tell anyone about him.
So that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled:
Here is my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will bring the peoples the knowledge of the truth.
He will not argue or shout, and no one will hear his voice in the streets.
A cracked reed will not break, and a wick that gives off smoke will not be extinguished, until justice is restored and it prevails.
And in his name, the nations will place their hope." Jesus and Beelzebul
And some people brought Jesus a man who was blind and mute and possessed by a demon. And Jesus healed him, and he was able to speak and see.
And the crowds of people were amazed and said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
And when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This fellow does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons." Matthew 9:34; 10:25
And Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said to them: "Every kingdom that is divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or family that is divided against itself will not last.
So if the devil casts out the devil, he will be divided against himself, and if he is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand?
Otherwise, I would be with Beelzebul, casting out demons. So who is this, by whom your children are cast out? For this reason, it is your children who will judge you.
But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
And how could someone break into a healthy person's house and steal their things without first tying them up, and then stealing their house?
Here is the English translation of the provided text: "Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters." Mark 9:40
That is why I tell you: Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
He who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but he who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come." Luke 12:10 The Fig Tree and its Fruit
They planted a good tree, and its fruit will be good; or they planted a bad tree, and its fruit will be bad. For from the fruit is the tree known." Matthew
Oh you vipers! How can you say good things when you are not good yourselves? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. Mat 12:34
A good person brings out the good things from the good treasure in their heart, and a bad person brings out the bad things from the bad treasure in their heart.
And I tell you: Every empty word that people speak, they will be held accountable for it on the Day of Reckoning.
Because with your words, you will be judged either innocent or guilty. The religious scholars and Pharisees wanted to see some sign.
And when the hour came, some of the Pharisees and experts in the law who were looking for a sign from heaven came and said to him, "Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you."
And He said to them, "A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah." Matthew
Because just as Jonah remained in the belly of the fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
The people of Nineveh will be sent on the day of judgment together with this generation, to witness against it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, there is now a greater than Jonah here.
And the Queen of the South is going to rise up on the day of judgment with this generation and testify against it, because she came from a distant land to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and now here is one greater than Solomon.
When the jinn leaves a person, it goes around places that don't have water, looking for comfort but not finding it.
And he says: "Let me return to my house from which I left," and he returns to it and finds it empty and furnished and ready.
And as he walks, he takes with him seven other more evil spirits. And when they enter, they dwell there, and the condition of that last man becomes worse than his first condition. This is what will happen to this generation that does evil, even they." The brothers of Jesus and his mother.
And when he was talking to groups of people, his mother and his brothers came and stood outside wanting to talk to him.
And one of those present says to him, "Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to speak with you."] # 12.47 This verse is not found in many of the older manuscripts.
And Jesus answered him, saying, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"
And he gestured with his hand towards his disciples and said: "Behold, they are my mother and my brothers,
Because those who do what Mourad Ba does in the sky, they are my brother, my sister, and my mother."
Chapter thirteen, the parable of the sower.
And that very day, Jesus left the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
And many people gathered around him, and because of the crowd he got into a boat and sat down, while all the people stood on the shore. Luke 5:1-3
And he recounted to them many things with a parable, and said, "A certain man went out to sow,
And when he was sowing, some seeds fell on the road, and the birds came and ate them.
And other seeds fell on rocky ground with little soil, and they sprouted quickly because the soil was not deep,
And when the sun rose, they were scorched, and because they had no roots, they withered.
Some other seeds fell among the thorns, and as they grew up, the thorns choked them.
Other seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop; some yielded a hundredfold, others sixtyfold, and still others thirtyfold.
Here is the translation of the provided text: **Well, whoever has ears, let them hear! The purpose of the proverb...**
And his disciples approached him and said to him, "Why do you speak to the people in parables?"
And he answered them, saying: "Because it was given to you to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but those, it was not given to them to understand them."
For to every one who has, more shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has shall be taken away from him. Matthew
And I'm talking to them in detail because when they see, they don't see; and when they hear, they don't hear and they don't understand.
And thus the prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled in them: Even though you hear what I heard, you understand nothing, And even though you see what I saw, it does not appear to you.
Because the heart of this people has become hardened, their hearing has diminished, and their eyes have closed, so that they do not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their hearts, and they return to me so that I may heal them.
But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust. You yourselves know how to judge rightly. Luke 6:27-37
And I will tell you the truth: Many prophets and righteous people have wished to see what you are seeing now and they did not see it, and to hear what you are hearing now and they did not hear it." The meaning of the parable of the sower
Okay, here's the translation of the provided text: "So listen to the meaning of the proverb of the man who sows:"
Whoever hears the word of the kingdom of God and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what I sow as the seed that falls along the path.
And the one who sows in the rocky soil, this is the one who hears God's word and accepts it immediately with joy.
But the word of God did not take firm root in his heart, and his faith remained only for a short time; and when trouble and persecution came, he quickly departed from the faith.
And the one planted amidst thorns, is the one who listens to the word of God, but the worries of this world and the love of money stifle the word of God within him and do not bear fruit.
Here is the English translation of the provided text: "As for the one who was sown on the good soil, this is the one who hears the word of God and understands it; and this one produces a crop, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty." The Parable of the Tares Among the Wheat.
And Jesus gave them another parable, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
And while the people were sleeping, the enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.
And when the crop grew and the ears ripened, the tares also appeared alongside them.
And here come the servants of the owner of the house and they said to him: O master, is it not that the good seed is what you sowed in your acre? So where did this tare come from?
He replied to them: Some enemy did this. And his servants said to him: Do you want us to go and remove him?
And He answered them, saying: No! lest ye should gather up the tares with the wheat.
Let the wheat grow alongside the weeds until the harvest time comes, and then we will tell the harvesters to gather the weeds first and tie them into bundles to be burned, while the wheat they should gather and take to my granary.'" The parable of the mustard seed and the parable of the yeast.
And he said to them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and planted in his field.
And even though it is the smallest of the seeds, when it grows it becomes a tree larger than all the other plants, so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches."
And he increased their understanding and gave them another parable, saying: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until the whole dough fermented." Jesus speaks in parables.
And all of this, Jesus told the groups of people using parables, and without parables, he wasn't telling them anything.
In order to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet: "I will speak in parables, I will explain what has been hidden since the day the world was created." The meaning of the parable of the tares.
And at that time, Jesus left the crowds of people and went home. Then his disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
And He answered them and said, "The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.
And the world is the field, and the good wheat is the children of the Kingdom of God, and the tares are the children of the devil.
And the enemy who sowed the tares is the devil, and the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels.
And as the tares are gathered and burned with fire, so shall it be in the end of this world:
And the Son of Man will send His angels, and they will gather from His kingdom all things that cause sin and all those who sin,
They throw them into the depths of hell, and that is where the wailing and gnashing of teeth will be.
But those who obey God will shine like the sun in their father's kingdom. So whoever has ears, let them hear! The parable of the treasure, the pearl, and the dragnet.
And the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid again; and from his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
And the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls,
And when he found a very expensive jewel, he went and sold everything he owned and bought it."
And the Kingdom of Heaven is like a net cast into the sea, and gathering fish of every kind.
And when it was full, the fishermen took it to the seashore and sat down and began to sort out the catch; the good ones were put into baskets, while those that were no good for anything were thrown away.
And so it will be at the end of time: the angels will come and separate the sinners from among the righteous, those who fear God.
They will throw the guilty into the fiery abyss, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." The New and Old Treasure
And Jesus called his disciples and said, "Do you understand all these things?" And they answered, "Yes!"
Here is the English translation of the provided text: **"And he said to them: 'Therefore, each one of the scholars of the law recognized the Kingdom of the Heavens, which is like a house owner who brings out of his treasure new and old things.' Nazareth did not accept Jesus."**
And when Jesus had finished this parable, he went away from there.
And he returned to his city of Nazareth, teaching people in the prayer houses until they were amazed and began to ask: "Where did this wisdom and these miracles come from?"
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother the one they call Mary, and his brothers are James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Isn't it true that all of his sisters live in our city? So where did all of this come from?
And they did not like the situation, but Jesus said to them: "A prophet is respected everywhere except in his own country, and among his own family." John 4:44.
And He did not perform many miracles in that place because they had no faith.
Chapter fourteen, the death of John the Baptist.
And when the time had come, word about Jesus reached Herod the ruler,
And he said to his servants: "This is John the Baptist who has been raised from the dead; therefore, powerful miracles are being performed through him."
Because Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison at the instigation of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip. Luke
Because John used to tell him, "It is not lawful for you to marry her."
Bagi wanted to kill him, but he was afraid of the people because they believed that he was a prophet.
And at the feast of the birthday of Herod, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.
That's why he swore to give her what she asked for.
And when her mother told her what to do, she told Herod: "Now bring me the head of John the Baptist on a platter!"
And the king was sad, but before the solution that he swore and the people who were present, he ordered that she be given what she wanted.
And he sent someone to cut off the head of John the Baptist in prison,
And they brought it on a platter and gave it to the girl, and she took it to her mother.
And John's disciples came, and they took his body and buried it, and then they went and told Jesus. Jesus feeds five thousand people.
And when Jesus heard these things, he departed from thence in a boat to a desert place apart: and when the people knew it, they followed him on foot out of the cities.
And when he came down from the boat, he saw a great multitude of people, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
And when evening came, his disciples approached him and said to him, "It is getting late and we are in this desolate place. So tell the crowds of people to go to the villages to buy food for themselves."
But Jesus said to them, "There is no need for them to go away. Give them something to eat yourselves."
And they said to Him, "Behold, here are five loaves and two fish, but what are they among so many?"
And he said to them, "Bring them here to me!"
He was ordering groups of people to sit on the grass. He took those five loaves of bread and the two fish, looked up to the sky, and thanked God. When he broke the loaves, he gave to his disciples, and the disciples gave to the groups of people.
And they ate it all until they were full, and then they gathered ten large baskets full of bread crusts that were left over.
And they were the ones who ate, about five thousand men, not counting the women and children. Jesus is walking on the water.
And Jesus commanded His disciples to immediately get into the boat and precede Him to the other side, so that He could send out groups of people like them.
And when he had sent them away, he went up into a mountain by himself to pray. And he remained there alone until evening came.
The students' boat went very far into the middle of the sea and was overwhelmed by the waves, because the wind was against it.
And at dawn, Jesus came to His disciples, walking on the sea.
When the students saw him walking on the water, they were terrified and said, "This is the illusion of some jinn," and they screamed from the intensity of their fear.
And at that very hour, Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Be of good cheer; I am He, do not be afraid!"
And Peter says to him, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you walking on the water."
And Jesus said to him, "Come!" And Peter, disembarking from the boat, walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when he saw the wind was strong, he got scared and started to sink. He shouted and said, "Help me, sir!"
And immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and grasped him, and said to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.
And those who were in the boat prostrated themselves before him, saying, "Truly, you are the Son of God." Jesus heals many sick people in Genessaret.
And when Jesus and his disciples had crossed to the other side of the sea, they landed in the region of Gennesaret.
And the people of that land knew him, and they spread his news throughout those regions, and they brought to him all their sick people.
And they sought him to touch him, even if only his cloak. And everyone who touched him was seen to be healed.
Chapter fifteen: discussions on the customs of the senators.
And afterward, some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem approached Jesus and asked him,
Why don't your students follow the customs of the elders? Because they don't wash their hands before eating.
But he answered them and said: "Why do you also transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?"
Because God says: Honor your father and your mother, and whoever curses his father or his mother, he must be killed.
But you say: Whoever tells his father or mother, 'What I was going to give you has been given to God as a gift,'
He is no longer obligated to care for his father. And so you have nullified the word of God in order to follow your custom.
O hypocrites! Behold, Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you and said:
These people praise me with their mouths, but their hearts are far from me.
And without benefit, they worship me, because they teach teachings that are nothing but people's commandments." The things that defile a person.
And He called the crowd of people and said to them: "Listen and understand:
It is not what enters the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; that is what defiles."
And afterward, his disciples came to him and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard your words?"
And he answered them, saying: "Every branch that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted."
Let them be! Those are blind leading the blind. If the blind leads the blind, both will fall into a pit. Luke
And Peter said to Him, "Explain the meaning of this parable to us!"
Here's the translation: "And he replies to him: 'So you guys still haven't understood at all?'"
Don't you know that everything that enters a person's mouth goes to their stomach, and from there it comes out?
But that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defileth the man. Matthew 15:11
For out of the heart come evil thoughts: fornication, uncleanness, covetousness, deceit, lasciviousness, idolatry, falsehood, murder, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also said before, that they which do such things shall be called by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
And this is what makes a person impure, but eating with unwashed hands does not make a person impure." The faith of the Canaanite woman
And Jesus went out from there and came by way of the region of Tyre and Sidon.
And a certain woman, a Canaanite of those regions, came and cried out, saying, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, O Son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon."
But he didn't answer her even with a word. And his disciples approached him and requested him and said, "Send her away, because she is following us and shouting!"
And Jesus answered them, saying: "God has not sent me except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
But then that woman came and prostrated herself before him and said, "Help me, sir!"
And He answered and said to her, "It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
And the woman said to him: "Yes, sir! But even the dogs eat from the crumbs that fall from their masters' tables."
And Jesus answered and said to her, "Great is your faith, O woman! Let it be to you as you desire." And immediately her daughter was healed. Many people were healed.
And after that, Jesus walked from there to the side of the Sea of Galilee, and he went up the mountain and sat there.
Many multitudes of people brought to him those who were lame, blind, paralyzed, withered, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
And crowds of people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the lame walking, the paralyzed moving, the blind seeing, and they praised the God of Israel. Jesus feeds four thousand people.
And Jesus called his disciples and said to them, "Stay with these people, because for three days now they have been with me, and they have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the road."
And his disciples said to him, "Where will we get enough bread in this desolate place to satisfy such a large crowd?"
And Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" And they answered Him, "Seven loaves and a few small fish."
And Jesus commanded the crowd of people to sit on the ground,
And taking those seven loaves of bread and the fish, He thanked God, broke them, and gave them to His disciples; and they, in turn, gave them to the multitudes of people.
And they ate it all until they were full, and they took seven handfuls of leftover bread that had gone stale.
And the people who ate were four thousand men, excluding women and children.
And when Jesus sent out the groups of people, he got into the boat and came to the area of Magadan.
Chapter sixteen: Signs of the Times.
And some Pharisees and Sadducees, who came to test Jesus, asked him to show them a sign from heaven. Matthew
But he answered them, saying: "When the evening is come, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'
In the early morning you tell them: "Today it will rain, because the sky is red and cloudy." You know how to interpret the weather, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times!
A wicked and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah». And Jesus left them and went away. Matthew 12:39; Luke 11:29 The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
And when the students reached the other side of the sea, they forgot to take bread with them.
And Jesus said to them, "Be on your guard and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!" Luke
And they're saying to themselves: "He's saying this to us because we didn't take bread with us."
And Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said to them, "Why do you, who have little faith, say to yourselves, 'We have no bread'?"
Here is the English translation of the Moroccan Arabic (Darija) text: **"Don't you still understand? Don't you remember the five loaves of bread that were distributed to five thousand people, and how many baskets you collected from the bread crumbs?"** **"When..."**
And you didn't count the seven loaves of bread that were distributed to four thousand people, and how many baskets did you gather? When
How is it that you still do not understand that I was not speaking to you about bread when I said, 'Be careful of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees'?».
And at that time, his disciples then understood that he had told them to beware of the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees, not of the leaven of bread. Peter testifies that Jesus is the Christ.
And when Jesus came into the regions of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
And they answered him, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets." Matthew
And He asked them, "And who do you think I am in your view?"
And Simon Peter answered and said: "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God!" John
And Jesus said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For it is not some human who has revealed this truth to you, but rather my Father who is in the heavens is the one who has revealed it to you."
And I tell you: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the power of death will not overcome it.
And I will give you the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven." Matthew
And after that, Jesus instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus prophesies about his death and resurrection.
And from that hour, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer greatly at the hands of the elders, the chief priests, the scribes of the law, and especially be killed, and on the third day be raised from the dead.
And Peter pulled him to the side and began to remonstrate with him, saying, "God forbid, Lord, that this should happen to you!"
While he was speaking, he turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are setting your mind not on God's concerns but on man's."
Here is the English translation of the provided text: **"And Jesus said to his disciples: 'If anyone wants to follow me, they must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me,' Matthew"**
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for me will find it. Matthew
What profit is there for a man if he gains the whole world but loses his life? Or what can a man give in exchange for his life?
Here is the English translation of the provided text: "The Son of Man is coming with His angels in the glory of His Father, and He will repay each one according to his works." - Matthew
And I tell you the truth: there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."
Chapter Seventeen: Jesus Appears in His Glory
And after six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and his brother John, and led them up privately to a high mountain.
And his appearance changed before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white, shining like the light.
And it seemed to them that Moses and Elijah were speaking to Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "It is good to be here, Lord. If you wish, I will make three dwellings here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And as he spoke, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice spoke from the cloud, saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to Him!" 2 Peter 1:17,18
And when the students heard this, they fell on their faces and were terribly afraid.
And Jesus approached them, touched them, and said to them, "Arise, do not be afraid!"
And they looked up and saw only Jesus alone.
And while they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus instructed them, saying, "Do not tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead."
And his disciples asked him, "Well, then, why do the scholars of Islamic law say that, in the first place, the prophet Elijah must come?"
And he answered them, saying: "Truly, Elijah will come first and will restore everything."
"But I tell you: Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of Man will suffer at their hands." Matthew
And at that time the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a possessed boy.
And when Jesus and His disciples reached the gathering of people, a man came to Him and prostrated himself before Him,
And he said: "Have mercy on my son, sir, because he suffers greatly from winds and is in great torment, and many times he falls into the fire and into the water.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "**You brought it to your students, and they were not able to cure it.**"
Jesus answered and said, "Ah, this generation that seeks for a sign! Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation."
And Jesus arose in the synagogue, and as He was departing from the child, he was healed immediately.
The disciples approached Jesus and asked him privately, among themselves and him, saying, "Why could we not cast out that demon?"
And He said to them, "Because of your little faith! For truly I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Remove from here to there,' and it will remove. And whatever thing you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. [
And this type of madness only comes out through prayer and fasting."] # 17.21 This verse is not found in many of the older manuscripts. Matthew 21:21; Mark 11:23; 1 Corinthians 13:2 Jesus again prophesies of his death and resurrection.
And the disciples were gathered together in the region of Galilee, and Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men."
And they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised." And the disciples were very sad. Jesus pays the temple tax
And when Jesus and His disciples returned to Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
And he answered them, "Yes, he does pay her." And when he entered the house, Jesus went ahead of him and said to him, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take toll or tax? From their children or from others?"
And Peter answered him, 'From the outside.' And Jesus said to him, 'Because of this, their children are exempt from the tax.'
But so as not to cause them any problem, go to the sea and throw in the fishing rod, and the first fish you catch, open its mouth, and you will find four dirhams in it, take them and go pay for both of us."
