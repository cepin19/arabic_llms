I found a tray in front of you with rice and meat on it.
The Chinese have neither a guardian nor a shepherd, nor do they have a limit.
Say it to yourself
This Chinese food is not placed in front of us again.
Don’t become a fool, Saleh.
And we miss the opportunity
No, no, no, don’t try, it’s impossible, it’s impossible, I’m not the one who does that.
The problem is that he is afraid.
I don't know what to be afraid of.
This is a government project, everyone takes and sucks.
This is a rule.
Now people who have nothing to do with the projects are taking
He is the head of the committee for a large project.
What does it mean? It means he has the thread and the needle.
Global Third Millennium Beaches Project (Infrastructure) Phase I (in brackets)
The bull leaned on him.
This is the one with the vacuum cleaner.
If he took it
What does it have to do with you?
You have the right to take from their project.
Because his car was broken
Who was supposed to send him the project location? Not me.
No, if that’s the case, then you have the right.
Who gives you the right to fill up your car with petrol four or five times?
Kholleh Ali
Don’t be a monkey and be stubborn.
Reach out and touch
The belly of Khamis Rail, your aunt
Now, as they say, they call you a millionaire.
One third of the amount is the project's right.
A third of it is commission.
The one who plays in the folk band
They say they’re having a party for the country.
And we bought a hundred springs.
What are they doing?
We set up the class.
It’s no use, auntie.
May God guide him, God willing.
He eats his family with him
I tried with him all night yesterday
This is an opportunity
For the sake of spreading goodness
And God willing, goodness will prevail.
This is a well-known thing.
I want this matter to be between us.
Look outside
You don't need to tell me twice.
But the guys
A problem that could stop us like a bone in the throat.
Real started with Ellen
I was sitting with him today.
Two hours in the morning
He began to be convinced.
We have a meeting with him after a little while.
We need to work on it properly, you and I.
Whoever cuts off our livelihood
They only started the meeting with him hoping to cut off his head.
My brother Ali, my brother Othman
I don’t know.
Assuming that today is my first day of work.
How dare you
How can that be?
Sure, but are you sure I’ll get it?
Now I’m going to ask you a question.
You're hungry and walking on the road.
Do you eat or don't you eat?
I am a gluttonous type.
You have to
Chinese return
We are still on the first item of the meeting.
If you have something
And if you have any concerns
What I want to know is
You and I are from the project.
May God guide you, Saleh.
It’s probably because it’s your first time to participate as a committee chairman in a government project.
And this is simple, brother.
Our share is placed
Part of the project budget
How come?
So that no one feels the story
We put a clause on its own for the amount.
This amount has been withdrawn
by the project's LLQ administrators
It’s not possible
No, no, no, Saleh.
You know the basics.
But it seems that there is a little fear inside you.
This is his right, of course.
First and last
It means that everything is in our hands.
What did I tell you? It’s attractive.
What’s wrong with you? In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. What’s wrong with you?
My friend’s new car is really cool.
He says
The car is my friend's, it's okay.
In a prime location
Except for one who has money, he is on the right path.
I’m not telling you that someone told me or that I heard it.
The one who bought him the land and registered it in his name.
Please, I beg you
He wants the money in his hand now.
He’s attractive now
We are not the same.
That’s it, then.
I don't know
He takes us out of the eastern gate.
He wants to eat a bite by himself.
Don't shake your head
Or your brother
Come here and sit down, you have nothing but good intentions, come here.
It happened to him all night.
I told him that it’s not okay no matter who they are, they’re his family and they deserve it.
I’ll make him agree if I leave him alone.
And that's what's supposed to happen.
God willing, you will not take it all at once and only once.
This is the Global Beaches Project for the Third Millennium.
Infrastructure (in parentheses)
Then they came back and started the second stage.
And you keep going with him.
May God reward you with goodness, you did not fall short.
I’m glad you just let him agree.
You are just like everyone else.
But there’s nothing wrong with it.
But I hope you convinced him.
We want a percentage.
They all agree on that.
Until he told me after he agreed.
It seems that they want their people to attend the meeting to determine the project budget.
It is their business and you have to follow it.
They put it there and they are sure about it.
Submit it as soon as possible so that it can be approved.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Who is this brother? Do you know him?
This is the wife’s brother who was with me yesterday.
This means
You have doors, windows and everything related to finishes.
Sweet sweet
How much more do you need to be satisfied?
You are beautiful, you have defined yourself.
Let’s take something.
Let’s give ourselves a week to think.
We determine the amount we take.
We have people waiting for us and they want us.
Abdulaziz's words are fair.
He is the one who decides for himself half a million.
This week, he recorded himself.
He decides how much he wants.
They decided, thought and determined.
What do you like?
Do whatever you want
Don’t worry about them, don’t worry about them.
She is Shino’s companion, what is Shino, what is wrong with this?
What does God have to do with this mess he got us into?
What are you doing in Egypt? You are inside this project.
This is a government project
Your brother’s name is Saleh Sultan.
This is our neighbor's driver.
Sometimes we would arrive and the car would break down.
Write it down for yourself
Sond Abdullah
Lala has three others besides him.
What should I do with it? I’m tired of it.
I’m telling you, come on, let’s just release our budget and be done with it.
No, no, this is a lump sum.
I was very upset with him.
So this poor guy has children.
Whoever has Zaidiya, let him have twenty-five quarters of Umayya.
And a quarter of illiteracy
They are all stuck together
How many people are you going to distribute this to?
Wade is back
The good mother when he is mentioned
Yes, Mom.
No, no, no, but this is the last one, dad.
No, dad, you want to go to Thailand for treatment.
Wait a minute, what’s wrong with you?
What’s wrong with you? Why are you making it so heavy?
Just keep the first stage between brackets, which is the infrastructure.
Used fan
Add three thousand to them
Buy me watches from Thailand, the ones with the rubber that all sparkle like this.
I recorded it.
My Imamate
It’s not recorded, I just wanted to confirm the name with you.
My love, I’m telling you, mom.
Chinese inkstone
But the budget needs to be determined, it can’t remain open like this.
Tomorrow is the final meeting and everyone will say the amount they have in mind.
May God protect you
A million is enough
I love you so much, my darling.
Hey guys, hey guys, wait a minute, what’s all the noise? Give us a chance.
The committee is meeting now to approve the project budget. Now that the money issue is closed, it’s over.
I keep more
We told you to shut up about the scandal, we are sitting in the ministry's courtyard.
Oh Ansar, don’t disgrace us.
Oh, what’s up now? Why are you all gathered here?
Tell him we’ve arrived, the electricity is down and there’s a power surge.
You are creating chaos for us in the ministry square.
Come on, come on, come on.
Have you heard?
Dude, you were there, how much did the budget reach?
It’s not my brother
With the project, we all mean all of us, fifty million.
This is just the first stage, only fifty million.
What was the amount?
Hey Saleh
Oh, Real, the guardian of Al-Naseefah, is Salim.
Anyway, enjoy it.
Come on, calm down and let’s get to work. All the beneficiaries are waiting for us.
It’s not a problem, but the most important thing is that we don’t want discussions, they should just approve the budget and that’s it.
And we will start implementing the project tomorrow.
It serves a very large segment of society.
May God protect you, this is the project of the world beaches for the third millennium.
This, God willing, is the first stage.
Infrastructure (in parentheses)
This project is for future generations.
Of course, on behalf of the program's team, I would like to congratulate you and also extend our congratulations on the launch of the project, which I believe will take place tomorrow, God willing.
which took a million and a half years to work on
A year and a half
Once again, of course, on behalf of the Future Tenders Program.
This project
And for future generations
May God continue to bless us with the gift of oil.
Second, third and tenth stages
In the presence of a representative
Welcome
Why are we melting here? When will the cars come to take us?
Where will they take us?
Thank God, the Lord of the Worlds, you grew up and became senile.
We all sat in the sun, we died from the heat.
A daughter of the people
But I don’t see anything.
I have nothing in front of me but the sea.
Why did they remove you?
Iman told me that your sister Munira is here.
About my father's land that is in Al-Barr.
I said, “Be fair, look who fooled her and told her false news.”
What is this land?
But when one sees a farm in the desert, he says, “This is my father’s.”
Then what do I have to do with this stuff?
Do you have brothers?
They work hard, thank God, and invest in land, real estate and companies.
Headache
Oh Ava, Iman!
And then my sister
What do you mean you don’t know?
They have to give it to me whether they like it or not.
These two are my brothers
And there is nothing better than honesty.
Because of the money
We are now going to take her to the hospital.
How many years has she been in court with her brothers now?
Nineteen years, if not more.
Never again
The Salmeen brothers are thieves
He came back and yesterday you told me.
Dad, just build me a mosque before I die.
You don't know
I’m not saying that your brothers are like that, God forbid.
Now, my father has been dead for a few years.
Why are you asking now?
And she saw the estate.
What else do you want?
He goes to check on her every three months.
Falcon, calm down, let us know what’s going on.
Not on Kiva
We are not sisters who can't see Rial, God willing.
I have the solution.
Where from?
It’s as if it’s my money.
Munira Shaguf
May God bless you and your heart.
It became fifty thousand
Because I dared to ask about my father’s land that is in the desert.
I am sure that my right is more than that.
Each one lives in that villa.
And their children are in the best schools.
Swing it, Munira!
I will not be silent about my rights.
I’ll just take my share.
We’ll invest your money in the company, it’s better for you. No, I don’t want to.
Everyone is in each other's head
Mercy has died in people's hearts.
Don’t say that, the Ikhwan will turn out to be better than my brothers.
Join me
Twelve years
And I'm going to sue you in court.
And finally
I neither took what was right nor what was wrong.
Okay, why do they do that?
That’s why I’m telling you, Mom, to be patient with them.
Take them gently
And Bilthung Taltha
Okay, but why does it take the courts all these years?
We are all four hundred thousand.
If we reach millions like other countries,
I swear, Mom, I don’t think a verdict will even be issued.
Jovi, you are my brothers.
I swear to God, mom, I don’t want anything.
Oh, Mom, what should I say?
I don’t say anything other than: We belong to Allah and to Him we shall return, and may Allah curse the oppressor.
Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs.
You had a court appointment a week ago.
Oh, my mother, do you still insist?
The judge said, "Write a memo."
And here we are, mom, from one note to another.
They are investing millions, and you are watching, mom.
And I’m telling you, just like I told you, I’ll be there in March and April.
No offense
That's why I say, if I were you
Shut up about what they give me.
Because the time
What is your father’s is ours.
Men ask you
That's what she has, you know.
Some questions about her share and that.
You just want to get to know me and then leave.
If there is evidence
Open it and give it to him.
Ibidhlaf Abrouh
Do you expect us to give you a waiver?
Two hundred and fifty is too much for her, her husband works.
Show it or bang your head against the wall.
What made her speak now?
But greed
And paradise is not my destiny.
My father inherited it and it’s up to me to show it or not, it’s your choice.
Neither I nor he will decide.
This is God's will.
Why are they torturing my father in his grave?
I expected my brothers to turn out like this.
This is what money does.
She has been working for thirty or forty years.
I don’t know how to act, Nasser.
It is easy to know about lands, buildings and real estate.
How much do the Ashdranis earn?
Even the company
You have the right to go and find out everything.
And I'm not giving them
How do you go back to them?
Not as you please
And it’s not up to you either, I have the right to know everything.
An agency without a doorman
Your sister has issued an official power of attorney to your husband.
This official power of attorney allows him to access everything we have in the company.
Saqr Saad
Oh, how long is his tongue!
Saqr Khalas
Hey Nasser
Excuse me, I’ll take it.
At your service, sir.
And come on, you are in front of me.
Excuse me, let’s go.
Don’t let him find anything on us.
I’m sure I’ll complain now.
He said that you guys hit him.
Let him do whatever he wants.
He has an official paper in his hand.
It’s official, we can’t stop it.
He has the right to know everything, every single thing.
If the budget and accounts are dry
We give her forty thousand every three months.
If he audits the budget and checks it properly
Multiply twelve by eight
She divided her section into three.
thirty-two
Do you know how much it costs?
This is what we are demanding.
Except if he knows about the lands and projects.
And we enjoyed it.
We don’t fear anything, we are not afraid
If he wants it, he is welcome. If he doesn’t, this is what is available.
He will go and deal with her.
They give their sisters small amounts of money to live on.
married once
Her husband provides for her
What do you want with the money?
Yes, that’s right, that’s the right thing to say.
At your service
Leave him alone
Even my office
My brother Rashid, this should have been done from the beginning.
At your service

When she knew her true heritage
Apart from the villas and the lands that you don’t know about.
They turned out to be seven
Check out the sixteen countries
Blindly following her blindly
The poor girl was shocked.
It’s a sin, by God.
Stay behind them
And for God’s sake, dad, don’t bring up the subject of the court to me.
The hottest thing a human being has
The coolest thing the enemy has
Precise text
And then he says his usual words.
Seven four thousand and I don’t know how many
You see, they have a holiday, dad.
You’re not supposed to leave the room at all, Mom.
May God heal you, God willing.
Lala, the house is yours, what’s the matter?
Nasour and my sister Manour
After we slammed the door and kicked him out of the company.
One of my classmates sent me a round one.
One of them is called Abdullah.
Okay, then.
Ikhsi Aad
That means he can influence them.
God willing, he will be able to
I I I
Do not resort to the courts.
The courts have nothing behind them but warrants.
And delays and the slaughter of lawyers for no reason.
The years passed
And life goes on
And you won’t take a single riyal from them.
May God have mercy on Umm Salmeen.
She gave me advice one day before she died.
She told me to endure going to court.
Tell me about our courts
She died without taking a penny from her inheritance.
She died and the case is still with the judge.
What if we were like other countries?
Hello Abdullah
Brother Abdullah
Years have passed
This is my brother Saad
God bless you all
The most important thing
Family and brotherhood
Brother Rashid
You are like my brother.
Don’t let problems and money
Do you have another topic to talk about other than my sister?
You, please.
And why should I silence him?
He is right.
You begrudge me my father’s lawful property.
Yesterday my mother told me that your brother Saad’s wife came.
Her father is a correspondent in the ministry.
It’s all thanks to my father.
We have been patient all this time
Let’s see this last attempt.
I sent your friend Abdullah to them.
They respected him, but then they insulted him and kicked him out.
Let’s see what the preacher Abdulrahman will do with them.
Okay, good.
He told me, God willing, Nasser.
Ayn Khair
Threaten them with court.
You forgot the late Umm Salmeen and her pilgrimage to the courts.
Maybe the Salmeen brothers are used to the court.
But my brothers
They might be a little afraid of what people say.
They might say it’s shameful to go to court. What will people say about us?
Let’s see what the soul of the Mutaawa Abdulrahman is doing.
May God welcome you and honor you.
Friday sermon
If you don’t have anything, grab the door.
What are you saying, my son?
He is telling the truth.
Get out, come on, get up.
I’m going to court tomorrow morning.
And why postpone it until the day after tomorrow?
Then I will decide, not you.
What does Ashbeesar mean from now until after tomorrow?
Hello brother Rashid
Take my word for it
I told you before
Threaten them with a lawsuit.
He is now begging me to postpone my departure.
Because they have abandoned the truth, my love.
We must go to your sister Manour.
What is this?
What is this you told me? May God protect you.
The people present agree.
A very small model of a courthouse
May God bless you
The people present agree.
Kiss your nose.
But you just said
Don’t go today, I told you
Leave it for the day after tomorrow.
Because God bless you, I will prepare this letter for you for the courthouse.
We’re ready, we’ve worked hard for this, and we’ll be at the end of the road.
Two men came in through this door.
The first thing you see when you enter the door
You put all your stuff
The phone is made of metal so it doesn’t make a beep beep beep beep beep sound.
You register the case, they tell you to go to the eighth floor: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, you take the elevator.
Destroy the offices
Jovi Al-Qadi, if you need a specific judge, for example.
And this too
You want to complain about us
Let’s show them the way
And we’ll see when you get your rights.
You take the six hundred thousand.
As he said
Goodbye
We had dinner at my sister's house again today.
Oh, the ministry approved his project, Abu Walid.
My sister, you’re telling me that I’m flying with joy and can’t believe it.
He told me that if my project was approved, dinner was on him.
Oh God, thank God, after the share that he has, he has it, only once.
Oh God, how happy you must be now, Abu Walid.
Who can do that?
My sister told me yesterday that she couldn’t sleep because she was so happy.
Subhan Allah, Manal, you’re back.
He is not a man who is involved in such things, but God has sent him good people.
God willing, tell your father.
Forgive us for our shortcomings.
We have shortcomings, Abu Walid.
May God bless you, Abu Walid. You did your best.
May God enrich you and increase your blessings, God willing.
You are a good cook, God bless you, Umm Walid.
Now you should hire a good accountant and a secretary to organize your work.
They told me just to rent the office and leave the rest to them.
Welcome, uncle.
Oh my darling, the apple of my eye
I want a Blackberry.
We want to build a big house.
Look at his face
Dad, didn’t we agree that you’ll give a speech after the meal?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, we have a speech from the project owner, Abu Walid. Please welcome him.
Forgive us, please.
Congratulations, congratulations, Abu Walid.
You deserve it, you deserve it, may God bless you, you deserve it.
But honestly, you have nothing to do with business and trade.
Oh, Real, this project has a story, guys.
How is that?
See how, thank God.
That year
The day the Japanese team plays with us.
I am in Souq Waqif.
I don’t know about him.
This is a catalog of a factory that makes multi-purpose halls. We have applicants who have submitted it to them.
Any Maghawal will build for you
What is understood
Any contractor
These two Japanese are not a joke.
He just stopped when he told you the computer said "al al al".
I want cinema
I want a kitchen, click on kitchen.
I’m telling you, the day I submitted the catalog to the ministry’s committee
How is your agreement with the factory going?
I paid them an amount
Means مقدم
The most important thing is to agree with the factory.
Signed by Al-Hamadallah
And they gave me another period of time until I placed my first order.
I’ve been waiting for you for a long time.
Adopt it correctly
We just need Abu Fahd to sign it.
Here is your secretary.
Bofahd told me he didn’t go to work.
Get yourself some tea.
Hey Abu Walid, did you do good?
The problem is that I don’t know Bu Fahd, he might come and he might not come.
A day exists
He doesn't have time
Okay, come now then.
You are the manager here.
You want Abu Fahd to kill me.
It is necessary that he is the one who signs.
All these files are piled up in my office and need Abu Fahd's signature.
The solution is
May God help you.
It’s a quarter to two, Abu Walid.
The working hours are over.
I don’t think Bu Fahd will come.
May God help you, come tomorrow.
You say that you have known the manager for a long time and that he is your friend.
What’s wrong with you?
The manager is sitting at his desk, looking at a picture.
I blame time, they are sitting at their desks.
But it’s only the starch in their ghutra that’s a loss.
I swear I left the office saying, “I’m going to work, I’m going to work.”
It means they don’t do anything at all.
They don’t move a chair without the order of Abu Fahd.
Yesterday, the manager asked about you.
And the interests of God's creation are paralyzed.
It looks like you’re still going to see them today.
A real mess, I swear.
I face a problem every day.
Because the factory gave me a deadline.
No, God forbid, may God not say it.
Okay, what if he asks about you?
Not only you are waiting for Abu Fahad.
Check out these files
They are all waiting for Abu Fahd's signature.
I expect to come today.
Take a rest, you guys.
Or go for a walk.
Then I will call you.
I’ll call you if something happens, but don’t call me and scare the poor guys.
Okay, goodbye.
You were invented by forgiveness, madam.
Hey, it’s been a month since they agreed to appoint me.
But when the man falls, brother, what kind of talk is this?
Dad, my daughter will miss the registration date at university. The scholarship papers are not ready yet, dad.
My problem with the factory is the deadline, the deadline.
Just be patient for a little while.
All your transactions are signed
Real drinks his coffee, but when he finishes, they will attack him.
He already told you to be quiet, that’s it.
Hello, may you live long
Goodbye
Wait a minute, guys.
Wait a minute, where are you going? Wait a little.
Understand what happened.
What happened after that?
He was assigned an important trip.
He has a special door
That’s just how it is.
Brother, our interests have stopped, brother.
Every day I do Enter Enter Movehed
What can we do? Let’s wait for Abu Fahd.
Your courier, sir
May God blame whoever blames him.
Where should he get it from, his father or his mother?
The factory in Japan
They told him that the deadline was over.
And your aunt from another side.
She is poor, she has no money.
Where should he go to find it?
Mom, I’m really worried about my dad.
Don’t leave him alone
Who's talking?
Hello from
Abu Walid
So that you can tell me about the factory and your sister-in-law's money.
Wait, Abu Fahd
What do you mean, dad? How long should I wait?
I can't find anything on their tongues except
Here we are waiting for Bu Fahd.
Dad, you’re not being unfair to me.
But all my friends will be attending university next week.
Shadur Yaba
The phone, dad.
I hope you will be fine, my patience is only for you.
Okay, who’s talking?
Wait, Bou Fahd
I don’t know what to say to you, sister.
You were very patient with us
I love God
His condition is not good, Abu Walid.
I caught him, my boat was hot, he was shaking and trembling.
Because the deadline is about to expire.
There are five days left
He will lose all his money.
God is sufficient for me against him.
Which is better? Eterna, Eterna, Eterna.
Inshallah, I hope for the best.
This is a strange box.
The text above is upside down.
The second text is under the mall and does not move.
You have left me with fifty percent of my health.
I made a discount for you
Don't worry
I hope everything will be fine for you.
And my sister did not fall short.
She said she was waiting for her money a little bit.
May God reward her.
I got rid of your sister, though.
Our manager appeared to me. May God help us with our manager.
It seems our manager heard.
God knows what this manager is planning to do.
I don’t know whether to expect it from him or from Bu Fahd.
May God help me, God is a problem.
And tomorrow is the last day.
I will lose my property
Do not anger God.
Aim for the head Aim for the head
Where can you find the strength to speak?
Come here, let me see who is calling.
Brother Abu Walid
I’m calling you because I feel sorry for you.
But just stay on standby on the phone.
Goodbye
You have always been a committed person.
We used to give you as an example.
Don’t think I don’t notice you leaving work every day.
I can deduct from you.
What’s up with this mobile?
I’ll deduct it from you instead.
I put you on the inventory committee.
Go with them to the farm today.
I don’t want you to go out during work hours.
And when it rises
Don't blame me after that.
Poor guy, today is his last deadline.
He’s sitting there with his phone waiting for someone to call him.
I’m afraid he’ll get fired from his job.
Hey Abu Walid, it was my phone that rang.
It breaks the heart
Let the poor guy go.
Oh Abu Walid
Hello human
What’s wrong with you, Abu Walid? It’s me calling you, not the phone.
Get your transaction done quickly
Don’t worry
You are not short of anything, I swear.
It seems that Bou Fahd continued.
Let me do it for you.
This is a senior official.
Where does it go?
Yalla Ouz Pakistan
My brother, which side is Uzbekistan, Pakistan?
Pakistan's third largest office is on the right.
Don't cough
Wait, Abu Fahd
Don't sit down
Don't notify me
Or do you want
House by house
Forward
Guys, the Rial is down.
Do you know how long it has been for me now?
And all these years, that was you.
Bring papers, take papers
Get on, it fell.
Roll and walk between these ministries.
But we were young
This is what I see in front of you. I put the sack of rice on my shoulder like this, as if I were carrying children's plaster.
And then God bless you, God willing, I learned to ride a bike.
Especially after the cycle I learned on and bought.
Really dangerous oil
They flirt with me when I ride my bike, oh my God!
Making a living and raising children
The manager has arrived.
When I get rid of it, God willing, we will have the sweetness.
Thank God, thank God.
I’m done, I’m going to quit my job.
I testify that you, Abu Said, have not been negligent.
Now that the Prophet of peace has returned, my brother, alas, goodbye.
We are ready for you.
What else do you want? Should I extend it for another year for you?
Buss buss
May God reward you with goodness.
You extended it for me for four years.
Otherwise, I should have been retired a long time ago.
All the kids got jobs.
The last one came yesterday
Now you’re back, Abu Abdulaziz.
I'm looking for peace.
No, and you work as a reporter.
Khanfroosh is delicious.
Do you believe it?
I haven’t eaten khonfaroosh in four years, maybe five.
It’s so sweet
Smell it in my nose.
Whatever you order will happen, God willing.
Ask the Human Resources department for me.
You finished the papers.
I’m from yesterday.
Your transaction will be delayed like this.
Brother, I am bored.
That’s it.
Don’t cut us off again
Hello, father Khalid.
From this moment on, that’s it.
God willing, we will rest, father, we will rest, alas, oh
Sweet sweet
I’m at work and I can’t leave.
The General Administration of Human Resources can do it.
I have a transaction there.
I want you to take it and deliver it to the Civil Service.
Thank you, thank you, dad, you didn’t fall short.
Where are you going?
I have to go to the bank, my yacht is raining.
And we are all determined
Now
The bank is waiting for me.
Share it with someone
I can’t leave work, dad.
Okay, okay, let’s go, goodbye.
He probably didn’t agree.
He says he can't come out.
What are you doing now?
I’ll go to the bank tomorrow morning on my way here.
I have been a student all these years
He must be feeling the heat.
This is better for him.
You’re letting him rest now.
Poor Farhan is happy to be going home.
He called me and told me that it was Khaled.
He sent him there to get his paperwork done.
Fear God
Everyone depends on themselves.
My mother regrets the Khonfroush.
It’s going to break from this side, Mom.
I’m not sorry about the khonfaroosh, mom.
But I say, whoever left work and did this
Khaled will go and work.
Lying in his room
Those who got lost in their sea
Good morning, dad.
Hello, my daughter.
Dad, please, for God’s sake
They just called me and said that the manager is very angry.
And here is your treatment
Hello, Umm Saeed
I told you to let the kids be independent. What’s wrong with you? Can’t you hear what I’m saying?
I don't know what you mean.
Therefore, Ali
Here I am waiting for you and the Khanafroosh is in front of me.
We’ll eat it today.
Okay, goodbye.
I forgot to tell you, dad.
My love, my darling, my father
May God help you.
Yes, the one near the market.
Get out of here quickly.
I have risen, my daughter, I have risen.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
God bless you
I just deleted the house.
Elles elles is
I told you to stay at home.
Teach your children how to manage themselves.
What are you doing, Said?
Their situation is difficult, I have to help them.
Okay, okay, rest.
I’ll get you a glass of water.
I’ll bring you Khanafroosh to eat.
The poor man is dizzy.
And taxis
And so it is on his face
The branch in the market is gone.
They want the ID card
After you get in your car
Bring him the papers.
Thank God, it’s a good thing your father did.
Everyone is self-reliant.
I told you
I want you to rest.
Hello, I am Elsa Yana.
Don't miss out on a delicious meal.
I went from ministry to ministry following up on government transactions.
Adabj from the Ministry to the Ministry
Children's transactions history
You take care of them when they are big and you take care of them when they are small, you really spoil them.
The kids have good, important jobs.
They are busy, what should we do?
Every day, except for meetings with the director, or with the senior official, or with the minister.
It means they have good jobs, but they also need time to work. Oh dear!
And I'm wandering around trying to get rid of my transactions, and I'm running around and doing another job that will make you a mercenary sitting there, how else?
Come now, may God reward you.
Okay, bye, take care.
Oh God, forgive us, oh Abu Shaheen.
They finally called me and told me it was done.
If you send your father tomorrow, he will finish the transaction for you.
That’s why I’m very late.
Fear God
Tomorrow is impossible, especially tomorrow, I can't.
Out of his love for you
He is upset and tired of you and your behavior towards him.
You don’t even respect the grey hair on his head.
He has been lying on the floor in the room for two days.
I’m tired of walking in the streets and tired of the sun.
Let him give you the treatment.
And the spirit ran to save him.
A committee that comes from morning until the end of the day
My reputation, Mom
It means that the construction will be delayed.
Since tomorrow is your last day and you have a committee.
Your transaction will be processed tomorrow.
Otherwise, come at night and complain to me about them.
He has a committee meeting tomorrow and he has to meet them.
What’s up, dad?
He had tears in his eyes.
I didn’t even lie to my dad.
It was the committee that changed their minds.
They said that it was the weekend.
Okay, tell your father.
Oh dad, don’t go.
I’m going to heaven and I didn’t come.
I'm not going to sit here in this cafeteria with these disgusting people.
She laughs at him.
Okay, that's it.
I’m going to apologize to him.
I’m going to him.
Thank you, dad.
Khulood, oh dad
You are wrong
And it turned out he was selfish.
And you won't be tired the day the committee doesn't come.
You are the goodness and the blessing.
From now on
We complete our transactions ourselves.
Stay at home
I’ll kiss your head.
Hello hello hello ya bok
May God bless your morning.
Oh, my dearest father
in the whole world
I don’t want you to be upset.
I don't get annoyed.
And you, as I told you before
I want to get rid of this transaction.
I would like to finish it myself.
They told me to come quickly.
You have a meeting.
With His Excellency the Minister
The happiest moment, father
I have a grudge against these adults.
Oh, my joy, they said your son is with Al-Wa Wilayh, this is him.
Trust in God, go to work, and make your life a success.
Where is Boussaid?
May God protect you, dad.
Here is the envelope in front of me, dad.
Just come by and I’ll send you the envelope with the porter.
My darling dad
That is what happened.
He seems to have forgotten.
Because the committee will meet after an hour.
No, God bless you.
My son has a meeting with the minister today, oh dear.
Just give me the transaction.
This is my situation, from work to home and from home to work.
I don’t see anyone anywhere.
Peace be upon you
And you too. Come in, dad. Come in.
No, I didn’t tell him anything, I didn’t tell him anything at all.
Which week is the camping week?
He told you that he is there in the farm.
He will go in the morning.
He is comfortable there, of course.
And I’ll add another verse to the poem.
They say that a cook doesn’t need it.
And his spirit
With peace
I hope nothing bad happened.
I hope nothing bad happened, uncle.
May God guide you.
No, dad, I’m fine, I’m fine.
Your papers are scattered.
He’s at the farm.
And this is from the excess
Deal with your friend
I’m thirsty, dad, I want water.
Yip Lee May May
My dear children
No, no, just delete it, delete it, I don’t want it.
Don’t write like that
I’ll make them confused.
Vej, my sister
You are right.
La la la I told him
Yes, by God, my sister.
Let me, my sister
What they call the league and the cup
And then he spoke about the verdict
I don’t know what this boy is saying, he’s old and crazy, where did he come from?
And hold him accountable. Enough nonsense, enough nonsense.
Then the people used to call him
They brought him a sheikh and told him to speak on the radio and television.
And more than that
Take him, catch him, my brothers, and throw him in jail.
Be honest, my sister.
These days, no one can help anyone, you good woman.
Full of problems
And God, if he dies now
I won’t let him talk, and as he said, we’ve had enough of nonsense.
Thank God for his safety.
The blessing visited us.
Goodbye
I’m going to be late for work like this, mom.
Listen, dad
I was up all night yesterday
And I'm warning you
I just wanted to remind you now, dad.
That’s it, mom.
It’s impossible to call after that.
No radio, no TV, even Qtel is not connected.
Your sister Aisha has been homeless for two days.
And your fiancée Mounira, her tears are flowing down her cheeks four by four.
It’s a sin, dad. Have mercy on us, for God’s sake, have mercy on your parents.
Just like you said.
Enough nonsense
I don’t want to be annoyed by you anymore.
Your uncle Abu Munira
Yana after they put you in prison
And he said, "Khlass."
Break off the engagement
After he forced him or his father to give him a gift, he made a deal with him to take time to seek refuge in God from Satan, and God willing, only good will happen.
The second time he grabs you by the hand and takes you to court, he divorces his daughter.
That’s it, mom.
Repentance after saying
If you call the radio or TV, you have no one to blame but yourself.
I want to repent.
Let me go now.
This is just between you and me.
The manager told me.
We want him with us
Tomorrow he will go and talk nonsense about the administration.
And just make us our drink, no more nonsense.
Okay, what will the manager say now?
Oh, he has a million excuses to say.
Where should I go?
Okay, that’s it, I’m done.
I miss you
Hello, yes.
Goodbye
I told you
You know, Saleh, that’s why I told you.
The public interest has forced us to reduce the number of correspondents in the ministry.
You are right, but
And if you give it to me, just one, we’ll stop this nonsense.
That was nice of you.
Enough nonsense
Yes, indeed.
You are here for me
We have work to do, please.
What a disaster, dad!
Let's discuss the matter.
I miss you so much, my sister, I’m talking about Salah.
What did you say to him?
Munira was standing there listening when I told you.
Yes, dad, I said.
I just heard them talking about me when I came out of the majlis.
Come on, you’re inside now.
Let me talk to your father.
The prison shower, we said it was a mistake and kept quiet.
We will be quiet now, after they have finished it.
Just because we are family
You know how
Seek refuge from Satan.
God willing, only good will happen.
Remember Allah, may Allah guide you.
I don’t want to drink coffee, keep your coffee for yourself.
I know you
Bored
Your uncle gave you a two-week grace period.
God won’t take you by the hand and take you to court so that I can divorce you.
Mom, even if I leave
What do you have to do with disasters?
Just be patient with yourself.
Even if someone told you
Ask yourself what you hear.
Isn’t that enough nonsense?
Yeah, man, it is.
But don’t punish me these days.
Come on, enough nonsense, we want to hear it from you just once, just once.
But that’s it.
You must be the police.
No, mom, you’ve got it wrong.
My cousin has a problem, so we asked him to speak on the radio tomorrow.
He was a little hesitant.
We felt that we had talked to him in a public place, so he hesitated.
So I said it’s my cousin’s right, I’ll bring him home and talk to him alone, it’s better.
So you thought he was going to say something?
It means he is hesitant, he wants to and he doesn’t want to.
They came from somewhere, let them come.
Puss puss puss puss puss puss puss
I am not your mother, I don’t know you, and I disown you until the Day of Judgment. Did you hear me or not?
Saleh Saad
No, God bless you, this is it, thank God, we got rid of it, phew.
You have a sense of responsibility.
An example of a successful employee
But unfortunately
Although I tried
Peace be upon you
Why did you bother yourself and come?
I’m Tony, I was just talking to the secretary to tell her not to let you come.
What's wrong with you, Shaheen?
You didn't know about this.
Avaa, is there anyone in Qatar who doesn’t know Saleh? Enough nonsense.
You are good, enough nonsense.
Enough nonsense
What is the job?
But there are no jobs, you know the situation.
You hired Zain, you real [person].
I'm Menon, I work for us.
I didn’t leave any place, Manira, I swear I didn’t go
Even one person told me that there was a job five minutes before I came, but they took it, so it’s gone.
My sister Aisha was divorced by her husband yesterday.
It means that my responsibility has become this big.
After one, his responsibility became this big.
I swear to God I don’t know what to do.
He is usually close to the minister.
But I honestly think it’s not fair.
He thinks I'm afraid he'll take my place.
Okay, that’s enough, you’re killing me.
Who told you I’ll be quiet?
I just want this method to be far away from me.
I'm thinking of a way to slaughter him.
Finish it all at once.
But what is it?
I know him.
This is the one who talks on the radio.
I’ll bring you the food.
And you are just a morsel of information.
You, Saleh, are a citizen full of patriotism.
You are a patriotic citizen.
Received
I left, and I swear I’m done.
I consider your voice to be the voice of truth.
I also talked to him a little, Abu Fahd.
Come back, Saleh, I'm telling the truth.
He says that we haven’t heard this for a long time, this is the one who says “enough of this nonsense”
I would like to get to know him.
This is normal, Saleh.
I am a fighter in the tent.
Forward, forward, forward
There are few people like you
Your words are very sweet.
And your words on the radio are much nicer.
We only heard him, but enough of his nonsense.
Come on, just one more for Bu Fahd. Now he’s going to say it, he’s going to say it. Listen, listen, listen, listen.
We’ve had enough of your nonsense.
This is the original, long live you. This is it.
I asked you to continue, don’t stop.
It’s a bit difficult.
Then he stopped, that’s it.
I mean, I want it to continue for the sake of people's problems and issues.
Listen, Saleh.
I’ll give you just one problem.
You, Saleh, are the voice of truth.
I want you to get up a little, get up.
A senior official
Come on, brother, say yes, say yes, I swear.
Yes, by God.
This is your chance
Opportunity doesn’t come twice.
No, no, I mean
What’s wrong with you? Don’t you understand?
Please be patient, brother.
Problems, calamities and highs
Mr. Minister
In its latest project, the ministry requested eight thousand pipes.
Compressed bearing with a capacity of 120 cm cm
But this employee
Approved capacity of pipelines
so that he can benefit from the price difference
Enough nonsense
You did your best, you did your best, brother Saleh. We’ve had enough of this nonsense.
May God protect you
This call is a special order.
God willing, you will call it yes.
That’s enough, stop the nonsense, stop the nonsense.
Do you know?
What life does to you
But this is the last one, that’s it.
Sultan flew with his friends.
The minister lifted it at that speed.
He told you the truth.
Now the field is empty, so Bu Fahd can play by himself.
I do all the tasks.
Yes, long live you.
The minister is currently absent.
Goodbye
Enough nonsense
Okay, this is the last one, that’s it, after that.
Ooh, and these are my job papers, Your Highness. Apologies, I was just kidding.
That means they got what they wanted me to deliver.
Listen to me
Because he is afraid
Talk about him and expose his scandals and misdeeds.
You point out flaws and criticize.
They are afraid of you
They deceived me, my sister Aisha.
You are the kind one.
Tomorrow your uncle Abu Amneera will come
Terms of employment
Those who criticize and point out flaws are just talking nonsense.
Why do they hate our country?
Do we have any defects?
We don’t have any connections
This is the first time I hear the word "wasta".
In our government offices, you go in turns.
We don’t have bribes.
We do not know it either.
Look at the employee
Does the foreigner get more than the son of the country? No, no, no, never.
We do everything with our own hands.
You are a boy, your mother is a ..., your father is a ..., we have never had a master.
An official gets angry with you while you are on the job.
We are the best people.
The best country
Flawless
And thank you.
He was talking nonsense on the radio yesterday.
Mom, I want candy.
I told you there is no candy until after dinner.
That’s it, there’s no more candy.
Who tore the shirt?
Mom, I and Adoul were playing.
I know you're playing
But what tore the shirt?
May God have mercy on you, O Adil.
Come and see what your brother’s naughty son has done.
I told you there was no need to buy it expensive, you told me no, it’s fine, it’s for a child, it will look good.
See what he did
It’s no use canceling this, it’s already canceled. This shirt is canceled, it’s no use, I don’t want it.
I said I’ll do whatever I want to him, of course no one will stop me.
Mom, where is the candy?
Look at the deliberate split in the workforce, then at the end
He came back and Walid was with him.
He is happy wearing it for the first time.
I think about it
Where is the waiver?
In the garden
Why is this happening?
There is a topic between us that I want to talk to you about.
I don't know.
Be ashamed of yourself
Put your back and the back of your family into it.
And the children do whatever they want.
Wreaks havoc
No, come and teach me manners.
Come teach me
We will teach them a lesson, I swear.
About the extra mistake and respect yourself
Let him come to you.
You are fighting like children.
A distant bay, mother
Mom, don’t you ever interfere.
Tell him to raise his children right. Listen, you and him, listen.
Is this it?
May God curse you, you are not able to distinguish between a child and an old man.
But I just found out.
The blame is on me, not on you.
Let’s go up.
These people don’t deserve one.
Even if they respond to them
It is preferable that one
The time of quiet hearts
Okay, okay, okay, here I come, here I come, here I come. Goodbye, goodbye.
But sir, the minister asked for the papers and I expect them to be necessary.
Okay, okay, I’ll talk to the minister later. It’s none of your business, I’ll talk to him.
A pair of disasters, a pair of calamities, a pair of catastrophes.
His new dress, no, Aisha.
This is not a child's action.
And the Saj
Lalala Joe Boh Bohdal clothes got messed up
Jovi Jovi
So there’s no hope that you’ll wear it?
Jovi Sarwal Adul means he wears one rail and leaves.
No, no, no, this is not something that is cut by hand, I will show you.
I tell you, it’s like a paradise with an electric saw.
But I can only say that I leave it to God to deal with the one who did it.
I’ll tell you
Who among you wants candy? Come on.
I still know
If you still don’t know, then go take a tour around the villa.
I don’t just love you because you know how to ride a bike.
I love you because there is something else in you.
You are telling the truth, right?
Okay, you want candy.
I want two of them
I’ll give you four units.
Who cut our clothes in the closet?
Hey, your father, how did he cut them?
He has a big pair of scissors to cut the car with.
Under the bed is all the candy.
How did he get to this level?
No one else has caused this mess.
Why should we keep quiet about it?
The most important thing
We insist on what we said.
The clothes are torn, Walid is a child.
Which computer
He’s still talking about this.
The destruction I saw with my own eyes is impossible for a child to do.
Why don’t you want to believe me?
Go back to your neighborhood, go back.
Wait, just give me a moment.
This is your condition
They fight every day, mom.
Where are you, the old days?
Oh God, grant us forgiveness and well-being.
May God guide you
Axe estimates a scissors of this size.
You are the one who is looking for your friends.
Look at the crack, mom.
Going to get a big pair of scissors
Respect yourself, Sultano, and respect yourself, Awoosh.
Oh dad, come here, for God’s sake, find a solution for them. Come here, dad.
How do I start?
Each and every one of you
You are fathers
And the child is born
A child is born
You are my brothers
Listen to me and reconcile, extend your hands.
Okay, tell me what you're doing now.
What’s up, bird? I tore their clothes.
They washed their clothes after this disaster he did to me, he lost my files, my information, my documents, he lost the whole world.
I swear I won’t let him go.
Bring us a story about museums of the Arabic language, I swear I won’t leave him alone.
Don’t worry about him.
He hits, he hits, he hits, he hits until he gets tired and leaves.
My brother is not in his right mind, and I know him.
And everyone greeted the other.
He is not my father from his heart, he is not from his heart. His heart is full of hatred and malice.
He’s mad at me because I broke the computer.
Wai Fahd
Sultan, give him, give him, give him.
But, mother, fear God.
Give him Give him Watch out Watch out
Take your cousins, dad, and go play outside.
Come on, come on, may God fix you.
May God bless you.
Men, each one taller and more handsome than the other.
You have ruined it for the children, you have ruined it for the kids.
God willing, mother.
Their brother, Abdulrahman
It’s possible, mom, for the first time.
Do you know, mom, that’s the oud.
Does he know how to talk to people?
and understands them
Don’t be mad at me either.
You are supposed to
Each one has a role
May God fix you, just may God fix you.
Even you, dad, have become like them.
Oh, mom, mom, they hit my son. Whatever God commands us to do, may He guide you. And you keep saying, "Move away, move away, move away."
I don’t know
This is my son's blood, my son's last blood.
You have failed us, you kids.
The ones who were deleting were the children, the children.
I don’t want to believe it.
I saw them with my own two eyes.
Tell the kids that they won’t believe this
He says from above
He’s a dry coffee boy from above Al-Futton, but he thinks he’s big just because he’s from above.
I’m not drunk, I’m awake.
Please, you can go.
You must be a little tired or your head is spinning.
Do you know who these people are?
You say they're coming to throw stones at you.
All
My love
I’m telling you, go and rest now. They’ve signed a pledge, that’s it. What else do you want?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
What is this? Come on, come on.
May God be sufficient for me against the enemy.
Mom, mom
It’s all your fault.
It’s your fault.
I respect you, but I pity you and your minds.
Take me to the hospital, I’m fainting, I’m dying.
I’ve never seen this couple before
And I also noticed that he doesn’t take his eyes off you, ya Hazzy.
That’s who was registered in the business with us.
But now he has been attending the course with us for a week.
It is obvious that he is dying to get to know you.
Don’t be too heavy if he doesn’t like you that much.
No, my sister
He can’t say that I threw myself at him.
A noble boy hugged me and took a breath on me.
Let things become normal, it’s better.
He is the one who follows you and he is the one who throws himself at you.
It means that I actually feel the same admiration for him.
But I don’t know, I still feel that the right opportunity hasn’t come yet.
An eye for an eye
I look at you and I see my brother and my sister.
Or are you waiting for her to come and say to you, "Excuse me, I'd like to get to know you"?
Be the one who takes the initiative, brother.
You are right.
But I’m waiting for the right opportunity.
The right opportunity
You are more than just enrolled in the same course with her.
Teacher Ashkal
Say it, so-and-so.
Hey, so-and-so, come here, what’s her name again?
We have been looking at each other for three months.
And no one knows the other.
You are not the same as you used to be, my brother.
You have to go and tell her, please.
I would like to get to know you.
It’s not that strong anymore.
I have to wait for the right opportunity to come to me.
Calm and polite
I swear I don’t know exactly what you want.
We finished filming the series yesterday.
Yes, by God
You never forgot us and you never let us down.
I’m free now.
We should buy the villa behind us for Waleed.
God willing, if he gets married tomorrow, he will stay with us and won’t go far away.
What’s the use now?
You are very late.
And you are a bearer of good news.
I saw her door open a few days ago, my uncle is free of her evil.
They bought the land through the Development Bank.
May God bless them in it, God willing.
Hello, hello, dad, good morning.
Hey, uncle, start the engine.
Thank you, my father, thank you. May God reward you. May God reward you with goodness.
Hello, hello, Noura, welcome, welcome, come out, the car is working, I’ll let you know, come, I’ll take you, come, come, dad.
Peace be upon you too.
What’s up?
They are neighbours and are talking to each other. What do you have to do with them?
I say get out of it, it’s better for you.
They are neighbours and are sitting together, what business is it of yours to be among them?
I have a nice brother who locked my car and I can’t get it out.
Excuse me, excuse me, can you give me your car key?
After turning on the car
I’ll leave you in the Titanic atmosphere you’re living in.
See you later
Goodbye
Now you know a lot about me.
I only knew Walid.
Walid Rashid Abdullah
Many people will definitely think you are the son of the actor if you tell them your father's name.
Mashallah, the same name.
My father is Rashid Abdullah, the actor.
Rashed Abdullah, the famous actor Abuok
Why didn’t you have dinner with them? One of these psychos had dinner.
Come on, tell me
How did you know the famous actor Rashid Abdullah Yarna?
Yeah, that's right.
That’s my friend from university, they know them and she’s the one who told me.
He is the one who loves him and loves his acting, and he is the only one who follows him.
He told me that we no longer live next to someone famous who has value in society.
Oh my heart, my joy
Shahlila, Shahlila, he has a light blood, yes indeed.
His son turned out to be an Audi like him, and he also helped me, may God reward him.
The saying is true
You just found out.
I have to take a picture with this actor I love, you know why.
Mom, Haj, talk to Aboud, my aunt's son.
I just read an interview with him in the newspaper.
He says they are filming a series about the days of diving.
I said I was going to bring you a sheep for the occasion of the new villa.
He proved to be a good neighbor.
Hello Saleh, is there anything new?
We have a lot of names
They told me, may God protect you, oh Abu Sa’ad, my name is there.
It is determined according to the need and experience of the employee.
We don’t know.
We may transfer you
Wait, let me. I can’t do anything for you.
In the name of God, your enemy.
We said we would move and settle before that, and then God would provide us with furniture later.
Edit your work
Yabu Ali is back.
Please don’t consider me a stranger.
Anything you need
I am at your service.
A neighbor is for a neighbor, and I am your brother.
But now I’ve heard and seen
Mashallah, you know a lot about furniture.
I’ll go with you.
It’s not your fault, sister.
Whenever you want to choose furniture, let me know.
My love, my father applied for a loan, and if they approve it, we will change all the furniture.
And here I am repeating it again.
And nothing will bring you back but the Sanje.
We are family today.
And she doesn’t even know how to study by herself.
I just want her to be self-reliant.
I definitely spoke it.
You mean I should cut you off and tell you to talk to my friend?
Oh, mother, oh, Ali
I’m not doing it for any reason.
She still loves me and I love her. I get along with her.
You are dreaming
Let me propose your cousin to you.
Leave the subject alone
As you like it
The man will kill you.
We'll see.
Good night
And you are one of them.
Buali Khair
Brother, this car is broken.
Every other day you make a story out of me.
The structure is back, God bless you, she has a university.
And this is always a suicide.
Your daughter is our daughter.
You have to
You don’t have to go out of your way for me, brother Rashid.
No, God bless you.
The car is parked in the yard and the driver is sitting without work.
The Development Bank did not fail you, it bought you a house and a car.
This is not our car.
The car of the neighbor Rashid Abdullah's house
Hollow relations have developed
We discuss topics of common interest that are beneficial to both parties.
Oh, that’s a terrible development, Hazzy.
Let’s go, come on.
Come on, mom, it’s embarrassing.
I did not accept
Noura said, "I thought she was my daughter, and the driver takes her to university every day."
You must have told her that my dad’s car will take a week to repair.
No, God forbid.
She said that the driver should take her every morning, no exceptions.
I bear witness to God, O Ali.
Good people
No, no, no, dad.
There is no power and no strength except with Allah.
Oh, what a disaster! Oh, what a disaster! What am I going to do now?
I have responsibilities to fulfill.
Who will take my daughter to university?
Yabo Ali, since your mediator is Mr. Rashid Abdullah
We can’t say anything, that’s it.
Bousaad Bousaad
Bo Saad, I'm sorry.
Bouali knows his value to us.
Thank you, may God reward you, you did not fall short, Abu Saad.
Everyone loves you, Mashallah.
God, this is beautiful. This is beautiful.
Guys, he’s back. Mr. Rashed is busy, let him go.
Sorry, sorry, Professor Rashid, did we disturb you or something?
At your service, we are present, we are present.
You are so lucky, you have a powerful connection.
We are your friends and brothers, if we need anything, please help us, don’t forget us.
Just tell me where you want it and I’ll bring it to you.
Why are you doing this to me? What’s wrong with you?
You are proposing Manal to me.
They agreed, Mom, they agreed.
Manal spoke to her mother about me.
I can’t believe it
Umm Walid
And dresses, do you have a party?
I didn't understand.
The wish is Walid’s right, God willing, the apple of my eye.
She called me back, poor thing.
Accessories are taken
Oh my God, jewelry accessories
This is my mother.
Now you will also ride a fancy car.
Mashallah Mashallah
Mashallah, I can’t believe it.
Um Walid, I am no longer with you.
Everything he gave you, he also gave you the car.
And with her the driver
If I go with you like this, they won’t believe that this bald and salty man is the husband of the queen.
Ambe Wai
God willing, you will go in these clothes of yours.
Hala, la, la, la, la, la, afa alaych.
I’ll change my clothes so that you won’t recognize me.
They say, who is this sheikh who is coming to us?
Coffee for the long-lived
I didn’t recognize you, Bouali. I said this must be one of the cabaret guys coming to us, not Bouali. You’re not Bouali.
What do you think?
And the walk is different too.
May God protect you, we are going to ask for Ali’s hand in marriage from these two.
Big people
I managed to get myself from the agal to the car.
I said I’m sure I’ll find it with you.
The last series I acted in
In a scene that was a wedding, I remember which wedding
I was wearing that shiny black cloak.
And after Abi, teach me how to wear a bisht.
Because your brother, may God protect you, has never worn a bisht.
Mashallah, you are shining, you are shining.
That's how it is when you enter the majlis with the group.
This is not fair.
My brother Rashid told you
You don't have any buttons left.
Goodness
The one I always see with me and Khulood.
That’s how the story goes.
You are my love.
We are now family.
We don’t want our daughter Nora to go far away.
Noura's right to Waleed
He tells me, “Mom, I see her at university and I can’t find anyone better than her.”
This is the blessed hour.
God willing, I will tell her father, and may God do what is best.
Why did you reject it? What is the reason?
Because his father is an actor.
Go and call your father's soul.
Tell him quickly, Rashid wants you.
Where are you?
Scream out of frustration
Do you say that because his father is an actor?
Don’t you feel ashamed of your faces?
I am an actor.
But I represent Asharaf.
I perform on stage for two hours and my role ends.
My representation ends.
You play roles
I represent
I offer them a message that benefits them.
But you guys
I wear acting clothes.
On stage
But you
You acted in it in the majlis.
The rich sheikha
Who is the actor among us?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be sad, Walid
Raise your head
We are not honored
But you missed the sight of me coming just now.
And I hear her screaming at him, don’t look back, don’t look back, poor thing, it breaks my heart.
And he walks his way
It’s like a horse, she says.
It’s Thursday, Real.
It's Thursday.
I can't wake her up.
She is jealous of him
That's why he walks like that.
So that he doesn’t see the women and the women don’t see him.
See how his wife is faithful to him.
Seda don't look back
But tomorrow they won't be in the office.
Khamis, please, please show them how to wear the city.
Show me your city outfit, Khamis.
It’s not your wife, right? You call her “the lady” when you talk about her.
Come on, it’s Thursday.
I’ll go and see Salim Ashibi.
Poor guy, brother.
How long are you going to stay like this?
If you could hear what people say behind your back
No, Mashallah, they even say it in front of me, maybe even more.
Why am I doing this?
Ali's challenge
What is it a challenge for?
I sometimes sit in front of the TV.
This is it.
Yes, I swear to God.
It’s okay, no problem.
Hello, peace be upon you, my sister.
Now, come on.
I’m now in front of her talking to her and I heard a man’s voice.
Sometimes I tear my clothes on the way, God damn it.
Respect yourself and divorce her.
It’s hard for me to let her go.
There is nothing, there is nothing, there is nothing, there is nothing, there is nothing.
Don’t come near me, don’t come near, stay away
Oh, I recognized you.
My intentions are good.
You need
The only thing that’s ruining you is these kinds of people you hang out with.
Especially this one, I don’t like him at all out of all your friends, may God bless this fat and chubby guy.
The guy with the moustache that looks like it just grew
The shameful person who has no shame
Do you want to torture me in my grave?
Let me talk to her.
After that, tell me.
You understand each other
I don’t see anyone here.
Hello, what’s wrong? What happened?
Khamis, our friend, is coming.
He was staring at the wall and talking to himself.
No, I’m saying that the limp in his head is jumping up and up.
This is a normal Thursday, poor thing.
He was sitting with his mother in front of him and talking to her.
May God take revenge on his wife.
They say it's Thursday with you.
He is busy now, he has an international call that is very far away, even the line is cutting off.
What’s wrong with this message?
I say may God help you, Khamis.
What’s wrong with you? You’re not sleeping.
I don’t have any Noda, I swear I don’t know, I’m not coming.
Regarding tomorrow's meeting
With the women's delegation at the ministry
I mean, is it possible?
May God guide you, Khamis.
These names came from the office of His Excellency the Minister.
And then come back.
Why are you afraid of her?
If I were arguing with Salim, I wouldn’t have hidden.
Tell the truth
Why do we hide and fit behind the water tank?
But just like that
Kk, as you saw, read, read, read, the last number in the l l l you have.
The latest numbers
The last number you called after you deleted the number of the woman you were talking to.
Tell me her name, oh father of women.
I don't see any text to translate. Please provide the text you would like me to translate.
I told her Salim's riddles.
Slum Refugi FFF Fall at work
You didn’t believe me, brother.
And what are you wearing?
I'm going to go diving
I swear to God, brother, she didn’t let me wear it. She told me to go out like this.
Call me
My wife’s father called.
Hajj, my wife
Say, brother, give me the pen and I’ll give you the number.
Be kind to one another
This is your nature, you men.
You are a thug just like him, but I will show you.
If you intervene again, nothing will stop me but the minister's office.
This is a horse.
And you threatened me, saying that you would complain about me to the minister's office.
This is really bold
She’s planning to cut off my livelihood, you know.
But I am the one who made a mistake by obeying you and calling her.
Thursday, Jouf is back
If she complains about me, then it’s to the minister’s office.
Come with me there and tell them the whole story. Take me out of the story. Yes.
It has nothing to do with me.
You are a coward.
My brothers and sisters
Good morning to you all.
I am honored by your presence at the meeting.
But where are the rest then?
Hit and run
It’s Thursday and where is he?
Oh, long live you
Hang up the phone
That’s it, don’t close it, leave it in the office.
The whole meeting is one hour.
This is my phone.
She stood up and got ready.
I was at your place that day and I didn’t go home.
Where does he go?
He can't go
That’s Zach today, he’s still in the same condition.
Jealous, jealous, she is jealous of him.
My love, this is not jealousy.
He sits here in the hall alone at night.
Tell me to talk to my mother.
Mother, mother is dead.
That’s why I brought you here so you can find me a solution.
Madame A asked you to move to the section where women are admitted.
It is a military rule, damn it.
I’m so sorry, I can’t sign it, read below
Brother, excuse me, I was transferred to the social care department.
Are you sure you’ve been transferred to the care department?
Why is it strange?
Thank you, may God protect you.
You are the sister, sorry, brother Khamis.
They called us from the minister’s office and informed us.
Here you have reached your new department.
And who are your friends in the office?
Issa, Saleh, Jassim and
O Khamis, yesterday the minister decided to transfer you.
Today you are in your new department.
And I explained to you, I told you about my problem with my family.
You are a transformer, a minister's decision.
It means I should go to the minister.
He took his annual leave today.
And Mehb will not return until after a month and a half.
What a mess
And I also want to know your opinion.
The minister said the same thing to you and to me.
I will keep looking for a place for you because this time I will transfer you because many people told him about your problem with your wife.
I’ll tell you the truth.
The solution
They say that if a woman calls me, don’t talk to her.
And what do you think? They will comply with your request.
I made them put your clothes in the car, I put them in a box for you.
Jem alone
I gave you ten, assuming that there are five of you in the office, so each one gets two.
And he’s also going to die because of his wife, he’s afraid of her.
Imagine if we all had men's names.
My name is Abdul Qadir.
And that’s what it’s called
He is handsome and sweet, that’s why you are so worried about him.
In the name of God, what’s wrong with her?
When you said call me
It’s Abdul Qader, the one sitting next to Hassan, and the one over there is sitting behind Khalil.
Each of these cloaks is chosen by the one who wants it.
This is Jupiter
A dumb joy
What’s wrong with you? What’s happening?
Please
Where is the welfare office?
There should be five female employees.
What is your name?
I am sweet.
I am Minoun, my wife drove me crazy.
I am Minon
You just blew up the project in front of us.
We listened to them
Okay, what did they tell you?
They said
Come here, Noor, next to me, you have this.
I can't
I went to the kitchen and got into a mess.
Come on, come on, come on, go make us some tea, come on.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, what nonsense!
Come on, come on, listen to what the men are saying, listen to them.
Come on, or have you forgotten that we are the sons of Aqrab?
Come on, come on, I’m coming without thanks. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
All the bank officials said that there was no disagreement about the project.
He called him, but his phone was always busy.
They’ve been waiting for you for a long time, poor things.
What trouble do I have other than this uncle and these brothers?
The maid traveled on a one-month basis, and now it has been three months.
God Rim, God, goodbye.
All the changes are in our favor.
Pour the boy
But just remember, if you make the garden
At least he will go to a place, at least two or three villas.
They say that the garden is a place for people who live in this complex to relax. This is the bank.
Men are discussing, they don’t need women’s opinions.
Go your way
You brought the tea, we saw your face, now get lost.
No garden
Just a minute.
My sister, you know that I love football.
Your uncle and your brothers don’t know that you play football at school. If they knew, they would kill you.
Tell me about yourself.
She told you.
I say forget about it, it’s better for you.
Don't hurt yourself
No, no, no, I’m upset with you.
I tell you, it’s the business, the business of this world.
You have the right to be our blessing.
Oh, Uncle Shaheen is here.
Mashallah
It’s Thursday.
Length and width
Fear of the Dishdasha
I have been looking for a wife for him for a long time and I couldn’t find one.
origin and lineage
I’ll tell you something
I have a Thursday wedding
This is from the Resources Department.
Yes, may you live long.
Leave it aside
She has some comments on the proposal.
May you live long
Do you have anything else?
No, may you live long
Take care of them, and if I have time, God willing, I will meet them.
What did you do to the employees I sent you?
The best that happens
I’m leaving now, I’ll call you later, okay?
What happened?
Who are you?
We are your sisters and we are older than you.
We have been suffering a lot for a long time.
You know, they asked me, Fatoum, what sport do you play at school?
I told them table tennis
They just killed her, that’s all.
This strike is just an appetizer.
You don’t know who we are.
What is our origin?
Do you know what scorpions mean?
This time we messed up your face.
The Chief of Scorpions
Scorpion
Uncle, let’s slap her in the face.
Enough of what she wants
You will be a reserve for later.
You didn’t say you were going to study architecture like me, you jealous.
Yinithi Anti
Scorpions don’t have daughters who work in the streets among men.
Structure, architecture and power
Where shall we go with our faces among the scorpions? Where?
Let me break it right away.
No, no, Sultan, no.
Stay away from the big scorpion
Your mother is broken, Fatoum
Let your brother Saqr have his chance.
What they are doing is a sin, by God.
My dear, it’s okay, at least you’re enough.
I am Jovi and this is me
Okay, why do they want you tomorrow morning?
Ashibon baad
Shadour, O Falcon, come down
Come on, in front of me, in front of me.
Where do I go?
Not a word.
Where are you going, Zain?
We told you, LG, not a word.
And write “education” instead of it.
And even if it turns out to be a nurse, we have no objection.
What else?
You have two options
So that you know that we are democrats.
Bear it, don’t say we pressured you.
Oh, health care, oh, education
Come on, get out of here.
Bring us a copy of the request.
Come on, get out, get out.
The biggest scorpion, oh dad
The scorpion, the oud, and the eyebrow alone proposed to you.
I’m not late, uncle, but when is the engagement, God willing?
Professor Amneera
What you are asking for seems very difficult to me.
I can’t travel, Abu Khalid.
I have special circumstances.
The minister stressed this
It’s very difficult.
Think carefully, Omneira.
Don’t make a decision now, think about it tomorrow.
How did they let you work?
That’s why they are silent.
I have a suggestion.
Let one of them travel with you.
We don’t have girls who travel.
I don’t understand this nonsense.
No shame, no modesty
It’s only because of us that you’re still working.
You will go tomorrow and apologize.
When you don't reply
Listen to me and shut up.
Thursday, one of the sons of the scorpions
One of us
He’s stupid and doesn’t have a degree.
But a scorpion
What are you doing now, my sister?
What should I do, Fatima?
I am broken and weak.
What can I do?
There is nothing we can do about it.
What are you doing?
Next Thursday, God willing, is the engagement.
We will call you and tell you what time to come to us, depending on the time of the sheikh who will perform the marriage contract.
What a beautiful laugh
The spirit of the season dresses you.
The spirit of the season, make me some clothes, dad.
This laugh is killing me.
Brother, I beg you
I don’t want to hear a single word.
Make us tea, coffee and cake.
Who is like you now, Aisha? Who is like you, a friend of the minister?
I’m afraid it’s just a rumour, Abu Khalid.
Amneera is a candidate to hold a ministry in the new cabinet formation.
Amneera deserves it.
I hope it’s not a rumor.
You’re working tomorrow
We all work together to serve the nation.
By each of us contributing in our own way, thank you.
I wish us all success.
Thank you, Minister's assistant.
Thank you for the heat of the barley, the minister's messenger.
Thank you.
How old is she? Come on, come on.
Peace be upon you
I’ll wash it with soap, just like you told me.
This is the general supervisor of the women's national football team.
Ask him how your sister Fatima played.
In the name of God, what God wills, God is great.
Captain Fatima broke the rules like the grown-ups.
Captain Fatima is talented, my friends. Goodbye, my son.
Captain, what do you think about my sister's game? What is her position?
Just a spearhead, that's all.
You are traveling to China.
Captain Jannah is a little far away from China.
May God help you.
Your sister is playing an important game.
She was studying education, but I went today and transferred her papers.
Khalia studies at school with her architect.
Any captain, because there is no difference between a man and a woman.
By God, just pour the coffee, just pour it.
Come on, where are you going?
I’m tired of waiting.
You are an ass, you are an ass.
Come on, go and greet your mother and tell her that I was fired.
Come on, come on, neither your father nor your mother's father.
What a situation!
The coffee pot you have is cold.
They don’t know about you all year long, but as soon as they hear you have a job,
Hello, how are you? How are the kids?
I missed her.
I told her that, God willing, this time you will be with us in the series.
Of course, and you play the lead role.
Jov, Ali, no one can play Nof's role except Shaoula.
My love, there is something called makeup that makes her look younger.
Maryam, twenty-six or twenty-seven episodes, I don't know.
Let Shula benefit, my father.
He keeps giving us endless lectures.
I’m afraid that a bone will get stuck in our throats.
The most important thing is that he doesn’t know that the company that produced the series is your company and Hamed’s.
I hope I’m not late, brothers.
And Kahou Rashid and Rai too
The director is ready with his technicians
Okay, guys, let’s start the meeting just to save time.
Whoever wants to speak and give his opinion, please go ahead.
Jenk Hamed wants to say something.
To be honest, I don’t think there is anything better than this series.
Come on, it’s been a day since this maid committed suicide.
And you know which scene affected me the most?
The day the maid commits suicide
The day her soul is hanged on the fan, the fan spins, spins, spins, spins, and the blood drips, drips, drips, drips down her neck.
She found him and started shouting at her son. It was a real action scene.
He keeps shooting and shooting and shooting until he reaches his house.
Action Summit
The police came to search and arrest the mother.
Frankly, the series is absolutely wonderful.
All you have to do is act out the series, then get up on the table and act it out.
This is a rape of artistic conscience.
and a rape of the values of society.
A series based on bizarre events
Unbelievable
A series of seventy-two murder cases
What’s up with all this crying?
You are actually known for not wanting anyone to leave.
Come on, come on, brother Hamed, let’s be democratic.
We resolve the issue by majority vote.
Brother Nasser, don’t hide behind the majority and democracy when it comes to critical evaluation of any artistic work. There is no democracy and majority here.
You got involved because of your government job in this matter.
Goodbye
I tell you, I heard the sound of the bell.
And when I came out, there was an Indian with a bag in his hand.
He asked me, “Are you Mama Hessa?” I said, “Yes.”
I opened the gas.
I think there was a ring in it, so I think it’s worth about seventy or eighty thousand.
I’m afraid that this Indian guy brought us these things by mistake.
No, dad, it’s not a mistake.
This is Samira.
Hamed’s wife is the manager we have at the company.
And this is a gift from God to you.
What’s wrong with you?
The ring is very luxurious.
I never dreamed of having a ring like that.
The occasion is that God blesses you, Hessa, my love.
This is my father. I call this series the good series.
Ali and Hamed are the employers, but since they are our employees, they cannot present the series under their name, so they presented it under my name.
And what else is there other than this ring?
I’ll tell you, but the talk should be between you and me only.
What the hell, is she crazy? I’m talking to someone.
Your cunning husband
What they call the wizard
Five percent is too little, come on!
No, my love, it’s good if they approve four million for them.
Your husband earns two hundred thousand good riyals.
I say the role of the college girl is to give Nada.
It’s so nice to love someone and go for a ride with him on a bike.
The name of the series we are working on next is "Rape of Conscience".
They just talked to me again about a role in a series.
I just want to know one thing, Zain.
Our Gulf series are always like this, I mean, like we say, rape is the fashion this year.
The important thing is, tell me, my love, what will my role be?
And you too, my love, your role is 100% guaranteed.
Zain came back from embarrassment.
Kani yay yay now
My love has just come back, I made you all this delicious breakfast, and you’re going to leave me and go.
This is the manager's secretary's age.
May God protect us.
He has never asked me at this time.
He said that the series they are going to make is weak and trivial.
It’s a shame to waste money on him.
And then, what happened? I mean, what’s next?
God help me, what should I tell them? I’m afraid that crazy Rashid has told them something bad about the series.
Don’t be afraid
Leave this matter to me.
A sick person
A social series
I just saw this a few days ago on TV.
No, long live you.
The series that is currently airing is called "The Rape of a Rose That Has Not Yet Been Picked".
But it seems that the budget they are asking for is too big.
It needs a big budget.
Then don’t forget, God bless you, that the company that produces the work is a local company.
May God bless you, I asked her.
Don’t worry, long live you.
I read the technical page.
We hear these days about the start of filming the series "Rape of Conscience".
And a huge budget has been allocated for it.
while it is said that the series is not up to the required standard
Another said that the series is a school that teaches deviance.
There is a high probability that they will stop filming.
Hello
Peace be upon you. Hello, hello Abdulhamid.
Hello, hello, welcome, welcome, take a rest.
Good morning
Good morning, hello.
I am journalist Elie Mounir and I have an appointment with Professor Hamed, if you please.
Okay, but take a little rest because he has a meeting.
Mercury makes us exploit design and create a universe.
By the way, we will contact all the correspondents in the world so that they can contact us.
That’s your job now, that’s it.
Mercury Company for Artistic Production
and discuss its issues in a way that makes the series one of the best works in world history.
Do you believe that this is the person who wrote this?
If you have no shame, do whatever you want.
The eye is shy
Is it possible that we have journalists like this?
A journalist is supposed to have principles.
We're coming to you here.
What are they coming to record? Positions.
Yesterday I met the minister’s assistant, Sha’oula. Do you know what I did?
I’m telling you, our series is amazing, amazing, and its events are strange.
Tomorrow is the first episode and I will watch it with the people.
Hey mom, what do you think?
Oh, come on, mom, this is just the first episode, I have no more patience.
I’ve never seen anyone talking to himself except in Gulf series.
Then I heard my mother say, “I’ll kill my children if they stay with you.”
My son, art is a matter of taste, not abnormal cases that you bring and generalize to society and people.
Mom, this might be in fine art, but in drama it’s completely different.
Oh, don’t give me a headache.
It seems that the Turks will become eagles.
No, dad, don’t judge it now, at least watch the first five episodes.
The series is a failure.
It is a sin to let our children see these things.
Come on, brother, it’s not that bad.
There are many worse series that are shown.
This work is not right, brother Salem.
It’s your fault, by God.
And every house supported it
Go and find people who understand the dimensions and intricacies of the lines.
And show it to them
It’s not for us
I'm sorry, I cannot translate this text as it appears to be gibberish or written in an unknown language.
The minister passed by with his guests.
I got up to greet him.
We were the ones who approved the series.
Only His Excellency the Minister will like it.
Let’s hear what Nasser thinks.
It was my colleague who posted the insults.
I will only post messages that praise the series.
No, no, don’t you ever worry.
Tomorrow I will see the article and I will post my own messages thanking and praising the series and I will say that these readers sent them.
Inshallah
You can only be happy
for this year
We agree with that.
The best series in the history of Gulf drama
They all agree with them, and the minister is trying to help them.
I'm walking with you, we're in agreement with the journalists.
Addresses Addresses only
I wish to rape the conscience again.
Thanks to the Minister of Information for this series.
I wish they would do it again.
I was the first person the minister’s office called.
We have already paid you the remaining amount of money for your series.
They are not to blame for calling you a magician.
You haven’t seen anything yet.
To be honest, we have now invested our money and made a profit, and the profit was excellent.
And then, the series is a failure, by the way.
I’ll talk to the author himself, he’ll tell me he regrets it.
I’m here now to suggest a second part of the series to you.
The Minister Tra is between me and you
He was fed up with the story of journalism and the fake success we created.
He told me that he was not comfortable inside because of the series.
It means it’s impossible for him to agree to a second part for us.
If the minister himself asks for a second part
I cannot
I cannot but reiterate my thanks.
For all employees
In this series
And I congratulate them on their victory.
what they deserve
The truth is that the work won these awards at these prestigious festivals.
It is the biggest proof
You are the one who said that.
I turned out to be someone who is not easy.
The Golden Prize is guaranteed to be 100% illiterate.
Ashkan tells you
Readers tell us lies, and the press tells us lies.
He tells them there is a second part, why doesn’t he say?
As long as you have these Arab and Gulf TV festivals, you do art washing.
Art washing
I hear about money laundering.
I'm sorry, I cannot translate this text as it appears to be incomplete or contain non-translatable characters.
Illicit funds
The same thing goes for TV series.
What are we going to do with one and two?
How are we going to do it?
We signed a contract with them, they have to comply.
Write to them
Our products are exported abroad, including various types of roti, small, large, triangular, and shaped bread.
We are the ones who signed the contract with them.
Two million dollars
What did you do with the Australian baker?
This is the inventor of roti.
They told you what product he was going to make.
And God told me about the roti, but I don’t know what’s in the roti or how it’s made.
Bisway Allah islimak roti abjrar
You call it a zipper.
It means instead of taking this roti that you call samoon.
This is the inventor's idea, to make it easier.
Roti Jeans
This secret
You eat roti with sosta.
Damn, they do some really weird things.
The dough of this pizza is processed in such a way that as soon as you put the pizza in your mouth, it melts.
Different flavors of Sesta strawberry, Sesta strawberry ketchup, Sesta coffee are all equal.
Do you know how much I have invested in this project?
Three million dollars with patent rights
Come on, Sameh.
Yes, Abu Nasser.
At your service, sir.
We took it today, ya Tawil al-Umr.
What you're saying, Sameh.
Your son Nasser took them yesterday to play a football match with the team he formed.
I agree with him.
This team is the one that caused us trouble with its money, but only with the security guards and drivers.
And then we are considered incomplete because we only have one guard, if he gets hurt we will be in trouble.
I should have a fan club by now.
And when you took the employees, who, according to your mother, were seventeen
I told you something.
About the important people in the company
those who form the heart of the company
The baker took the dough money from the hospitals.
It all made the boy miserable.
I told him it’s a shame, it’s not right, you’re a son of a well-known family, it’s not right to go running after a ball and make the world laugh at us.
Whoever wants to play with them can do whatever they want.
But it only takes important people who form the heart of the company.
What should I do, mom? My team has a match and I’m missing four players.
We don’t want excuses.
What happened has happened now.
Hamdi didn’t come to work today, professor.
I rode I rode with him
Put it on me
And Gabon stopped me at the goal
The match seemed
Then I didn’t feel any need.
They told me that a ball came towards me, but I don’t remember.
So you used to play as a goalkeeper before?
Just for Nasser's sake
There is no power and no strength except with Allah.
May God curse this ball and this nonsense.
From today, Nasser.
There is no such thing as a ball.
Cancel the team you just created.
All the bakers returned to the bakeries.
What do you think?
Dad, the topic
I want to hear something from you.
I asked you, Abu Nasser.
Let’s hear what the boy has to say, please, I’m begging you.
Just for you, Abu Ahmed.
I see, what do you have to say?
Tomorrow we have our last match in the tournament we are playing.
Don’t break his heart, Abu Nasser, please, I’m begging you, please.
Okay, guys.
Congratulations, congratulations.
Good good good, congratulations
Mr. Nasser, I want you now.
May God bless you, my team was on time today.
Master Nasser is needed
You promised us you would throw us a party.
I want to call and book a hall for you at the hotel.
And I will let the journalists and newspapers come there once and for all.
No, Rashid, I’ll do it at our place in the majlis.
Because when my father sees the joy, the players, and the victory, he might let the team continue.
They brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup.
May God hear you, but
Lala, I saw pictures of him with the players and he did an interview with them just now.
Wako Janna Sami is the sports page editor and he will do an interview with him.
What is the picture?
Don't go far away from me
Oh God, I hope the icon image turns out well.
You tell me I’m not happy.
What is your comment on your sons, the bakers, I mean the players, winning this great achievement?
With a fighting spirit
and effort
Loyalty to bakeries
Bo Nasser, excuse me, we have seen the bakery team playing 4-4-2 throughout the tournament.
Loyalty to the bakery and the coach's plan
Thank you, Uncle Abu Nasser.
May God protect you.
Here is the guard
The league and cup are his property. They will come and do an interview with you.
This tail does not belong to the council.
They are sending you their representative to have a meeting with you.
Bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup.
You know we encourage young people.
God willing, I hope you will see it in the future.
Yes, goodbye.
Mashallah, your phone doesn’t stop ringing, and your pictures are in the newspapers. Congratulations on this ball.
You know what he was talking to me about.
He came back and gave us a discount on the price of the machines. He said, “What do you want, Abu Nasser? The ball is yours.”
Now you’ve become famous and newspapers don’t publish your pictures without writing “the first sports sponsor in International Bakeries” underneath.
I am far away from the ball.
What is this talk?
I’ve been like this since I was in middle school.
The one next to me was playing football.
You say stay away from the ball
As long as the one next to me is playing football, I am close to the ball.
It means I’m close to sports, I’m an athlete.
So we are no longer the international bakeries, we have become the international stadiums.
Yesterday I heard him say that he wants to open a sports club.
Of course, today we meet with the sports coach at the International Bakery, Uncle Bou Nasser.
Football development
Of course, we spoke before the match. We want to know your expectations before you get to the stage.
The game is tough today.
The team that controls the text line will have a high heel today.
God willing, we are currently contacting professional player agents to develop the International Bakeries team.
His name is Saud. Listen to me. God bless the hard work, and God bless the hard worker.
Listen to me, dad, the deal that went away was for the players, the shipment that came to us.
We didn’t benefit from anything.
When I gave you the prices
I gave you the prices at which we sell to the world.
What do you mean? The Gulf is not like the rest of the world.
Of course not.
This is not your business.
All you have to do is let me know when the Gulf buyer arrives.
Keep your pussy open
Two of them are defenders, one is a midfielder and one is a pivot.
Look, my love, I’m telling you about these four players.
Three of them are the head
Metin Alf
He took all the dollars at once, the bastard.
How much do you get, six hundred thousand? I’ll give you that in Jamaican, five hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
It’s nice, now this is for the empty ones, now we’ve come to the Brazilian.
This is the player of the season. This one alone is worth a million and two hundred thousand dollars.
We have set this price, but after that I will send you a fax to show you where it is. Here it is, above. Wait a moment, look at it. Look, I’ll send you a fax. May God protect you. From which club in the UAE?
You are the owner of the decision, and the decision is your decision.
Received
Oh, Mashallah, check it out, check it out, the duck man.
How?
Knee Knee
The knee is fine, the knee.
Don’t be fooled, it might be a cruciate ligament or something.
Oh, Abu Nasser
What is this adductor muscle?
Slaughterhouse, so they have a whole roasted lamb. Thank you, you did well.
No, frankly, Abu Nasser, you succeeded. You have good players, the Brazilian and the Uruguayan. Congratulations, congratulations.
May God bless you.
I say, take the boxes to the store, come on, to the store.
Mashallah, you have another business.
No, no, no, just players, just
They are dropping boxes
Buds, yes, buds. Where do I get them from? From the jungles of Africa.
Yes, why?
Karm is a hero who has only one cartoon.
He is a human being like us.
A bud tells you what you heard.
They say these are sprouts.
Now that we are here
Why don’t you give us this bud as an advertisement with them?
I’ll tell my father, Abu Nasser, that if you take care of him and raise him, he will be useful to you.
Then the team will go, then he will go and do this in the stadium.
How much How much How much How much
Slowly, slowly, be gentle with him, slowly, slowly, be gentle with him, you know, he’s very tender, very tender.
Put it in the annex, they will air it. Goodbye.
Anything you need, I have all the players.
If this coach’s owner understands
We won 2-0 yesterday and we dominated the game.
Dad, this is a coach in Spain.
I don't like it at all.
The successful coach
Who controls the traffic during the match?
For example, the north, this line is the opposite of the Al-Wakrah line.
To be honest, we won’t let your coach do whatever he wants.
Dad, dad, the coach has only been with the team for two months.
We need to find a solution for him.
If Kurah Jan understands the action of the sides, he won't be sitting there for the whole match attacking from the depth.
And he’s sitting on an offside trap.
Oh, Mom, for God’s sake, don’t give me a headache.
He should withdraw, Kakonomalalawi, his father.
I am sorry, but I cannot translate this text as it appears to be written in an unknown or unsupported language.
No, no, no, no, no, he doesn’t even want to play.
Shololo Habobo Taba Lawa Khaleh Ayoli
any line
As planned
And Khal Hololo
It doesn’t have to be, it doesn’t have to be between the manager and the team coach.
The star of today's match and the team's star scored a super hat-trick. God bless you, Jakolamanando.
What do you mean we don’t understand football?
Listen, Sultan
Let him go home.
Lala, don’t pick him up in the bakery car, let him take a taxi.
It’s none of your business anymore.
Come on, stay on the line with me.
So, what my father did was right.
Is the coach going to make us sit like this?
What else does he do?
Idmar team
Say goodbye to our team
Oh mom, oh mom
He wasn’t sane, he told you to come and said you are divorced. Tell the truth, what happened between you?
From the first day I saw him, I told your mother that I didn’t like this man.
I feel like he’s not responsible enough.
Let’s stop talking too much and talking about the past.
Go and ask your father the truth and find out why your daughter got divorced.
I swear I’ll tell you, brother Rashid.
But what was the reason he divorced her?
No, it’s not okay, Abu Abdullah. We need to know why the girl got divorced. We have the right to know.
Please, you don’t interfere, it’s none of your business.
How can I not interfere when the man is sitting in the majlis and wants to know why his daughter got divorced?
Whoever doesn’t know how to appreciate her husband doesn’t respect his feelings.
And who is this Barcelona?
You can’t be blamed, you don’t know much Spanish.
This is not just one Barcelona.
This is Guardiola's team
So, I should now go to the man who is waiting for me in the majlis?
If you don’t go, I will go. Okay, stay here. Get out of it. You. Some people don’t know how to raise their daughters.
Don't slam the door, don't shake your head like that.
She didn’t stop there, she also left the Barcelona team.
Messi is a football magician who never plays a match without scoring a hat-trick.
Maradona, who is Maradona, said that Messi is better than me.
And your shameless daughter is insulting me. Just look.
Your daughter is neither a Barcelonian nor one of our kind.
What do you mean by that?
Listen to me, may God guide you.
You must have intended to say "oldie".
He should go and apologize to her and make her happy.
Lose weight
And then, thank God, we have a lot of good things.
We will destroy our money if we are not happy with what we have earned.
Oh, come on!
The condition is that I will find you a fiancée who is a Barcelona fan.
Mom, I’m not upset.
You understand, mom, forget it, it’s gone to hell.
Hack Jay Hack ya Yma
Do you know, Mom, that they are the ones who are losing?
You are the only one I wish for
Hack, mom
It’s a sin, you broke my heart.
Poor thing, it’s been two days since she’s been painted.
After a marriage that lasted only one month, poor thing.
What’s wrong with you? Do you want to get me in trouble with him?
Mom, I don’t want to get into trouble with him.
Who told you this nonsense that doesn’t make sense?
You don’t have to worry about it.
You don’t know if this is a boy that comes out.
What is this?
Her sustenance is
You told me about the building I wanted to buy and turn into a furnished apartment hotel.
The one in Mansoura
It’s his father’s right, tomorrow when his son takes our daughter and I ask him for the building.
And if I can
Talk to her brother
Listen to me carefully
There is a guy whose father is a millionaire.
Do you know what it means to be a millionaire?
Opportunity doesn’t come twice.
You know that they are so rich that they have a palace in Spain just to spend their summer there every year.
Okay, what about this Barcelona story? What does it mean?
The girl’s family might have started this rumour about him to prove that their daughter is innocent.
And if we assume that the story is true and the guy loves Barcelona and is loyal to Catalonia
His wife is supposed to respect that.
And don’t blame the team.
That is, assuming the story is true.
May God protect you, his father is called Abu Burjain because he has two towers on the corniche.
He made them in a strange way, like a rope wrapped around each other.
People who see them from afar think they are one tower.
I hope you get what you deserve, I hope you get it.
Hello, welcome to those who come to us.
May God protect you. Alright, extend your hand and eat something, may God protect you.
Thank you darling
But please give me good news, my dear Abdullah, the light of my eyes, is waiting for your reply.
No, Umm Abdullah, don’t worry, my love.
If I were to search the entire Gulf Cooperation Council for a better person than you, I wouldn’t find one.
Come on, tell them to give us their estimates for building the building.
I’m done now, sir. Is there anything you’d like me to do, sir?
Your family will call you
See their wedding requests, prepare the cheque and I will sign it.
In the name of God, what God wills, in the name of God, what God wills. With your permission, sir, with your permission.
After Abdullah’s divorce was answered
I hope for children, and I hope for money.
May God bless you, auntie.
You wear it to protect yourself from the cold.
But I don’t know where my mom booked for us.
Mom, I’m asking you, where did you book for us?
My mom says she booked us a trip to Malaysia.
What’s wrong with Malaysia? Come on!
Goodbye
How come someone comes back from their honeymoon crying?
What’s wrong with you, mom? Tell me.
Tell me what happened, mom.
She gives herself too much to him.
Why does she think she’s so great?
Arrogant, leave her alone.
Good job, mom, you sent her back to her parents' house.
You broke my heart.
Hi, but
Okay, what’s wrong with it like this?
What happened to her?
May God bless you, don’t forget to bring us olive oil from Spain with you.
Where are we going, Spain?
Okay then
My mom said she booked us a trip to the Maldives.
It’s okay, mom, the Maldives are beautiful too.
And I’ll come and visit you soon, God willing, God willing.
I just said that you came back happy from the trip.
What annoys me, mom, is why he takes the kids.
Come on, Chile, bring the bag.
What happened between them?
What’s wrong with you, my love, are you upset?
Shut up, for God’s sake. Are you going to teach me about my son’s face?
What’s wrong with you, mom? What’s bothering you?
I get depressed when I see the scales.
May the one who upsets you never live, oh mother.
Leave her alone, just divorce her, divorce her, don’t worry about her, your father has a lot of money and there are a lot of girls.
Shut up, for God’s sake, my son. I know him well. He doesn’t need anything. Why should he live in distress?
Go on, mom, call her and divorce her.
May God help her.
Weh weh, say it three times.
You are divorced. Wait a moment, don’t hit me, there are still two more times left.
Divorced, divorced.
I swear, Masha is nervous.
But mom, go, my dear, go and rest and get rid of your worries. There are plenty of girls, as they say. Go, mom.
Oh, there's a problem.
Just because he saw you at the club.
Call him, call him, let me talk to him.
He agreed, Mom, and finally divorced me. He said, "You are divorced, divorced."
Why would he divorce you? He has no shame, he’s really rude.
Now, if she goes to the club alone, what will happen?
And if necessary, I shake it, there’s nothing wrong with that.
It’s not a big deal, what does it mean? Is the world going to end?
I swear that if I go to his house now and wash his sails, he will not know who you are.
I am I, O Abu Abdullah, my daughter is divorced.
My daughter got divorced.
She thinks she is better than others
Do you buy and sell them from Toys R Us stores?
Just as I burned for my son, I now burn for my daughter and my anger.
And they didn’t do anything, poor things.
Mom brought you a peeled apple, throw it away.
It’s normal for you to shoot at them however you like.
And she is under the responsibility of Real.
This is normal for you, fuck it, let it go.
And drink from the cup from which you made God’s creation drink.
And what you don’t accept for yourself
You do not wish it for people.
Do you know that this land belonged to the compound?
and in a strategic location
Oh, brother, leave it to God.
No, it’s a ridiculous price.
I am stuck
You need to get Abu Saqr's approval.
Yes, dad, I went to his office and didn’t find him.
I went to him the week before, and they told me he was traveling.
But I will smell it tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow. My situation is stuck. The problem is that I need Abu Saqr's approval.
Soul of the Majlis
No, no, no, no, this is official business.
May God bless you, it’s the office, not the house.
After eating
Abu Saqr returned, this is his Ashbisha.
Listen, everyone has a key.
But tell me, Abu Fahd
You are what you know.
What do I know about him? I only see him on TV, and you didn’t tell me that you were with him on the pilgrimage.
But we don’t really know each other that well.
May God cut off your conversations.
May God guide you, you didn’t even believe it when you turned on the engine and came here. At least ask why this invitation.
There is an occasion for this, may God guide you.
The month has thirty days and he makes dinner fifty times.
I suggest, long live you, that they put you in the Guinness Book of World Records.
The one who makes the most dinner in the world
I’m not going to say who this brother is who is with you.
Hello, what a blessed hour, by God.
We are honored, may you live long.
Oh, Abu Falah, you poor thing!
You say that Abu Saqr makes dinner every day.
That’s what we see.
But, Abu Falah, dinner today is a special occasion.
Today, God bless you and your son Saqr.
Mashallah, you deserve it, long live you, congratulations
Here you go, good man. Since you mentioned him, hello dad.
Peace be upon you
What happened again?
By the way, tomorrow my son Saqr will go to the agency and choose the car he wants.
I’ve been waiting for approval for a year and a half.
Current status
But when I got to him
And Bakhita
May God guide you, Abu Sa’ad.
This is not how things are done.
I told him that’s it.
He goes to the exhibition and chooses the car he likes.
We buy three for him
I’ll take him to him.
I'm going to him by myself
You didn’t tell me that you met him last year during the Umrah.
His son, the young Shahin, today
Here is his evening game
This is your chance
Pass by him and congratulate him.
May you live long and be safe.
O Shahin, or Falcon Father
May God bless you, thank you all.
Thank God for the safety of our son Shaheen, may he live long.
May God protect you and
But from the brother
May you live long
You didn't recognize me.
I swear to God that I would sacrifice my life for you.
I was with you on the Umrah, may God prolong your life, last year.
I even remember buying a red rosary.
May God protect you.
I was in the hospital.
I’ll visit one of our children.
I am honored to meet you.
He is still a hawk, is he still hesitant to enter the business world or has he decided?
I couldn’t handle him, brother.
Why, dad, Saqr? Trade is good.
You should never set up an office and see.
Abu Saqr
Long live, don’t turn me down and say yes.
What happened again?
I have a falcon as a gift.
Full role
And if the trade is good for you and you come to me, you will tell her that you don’t want it.
You have everything available to you today, just like anyone else. Ever since you got your license, thank God, the world has opened up to you. You have a free car and the best office on the corniche.
Yesterday, Abu Abdulaziz told your father that if Saqr wants to enter the business, he will bring him in as a partner with a fifty percent share.
Mom, how can I balance business and university?
Mom, don’t force me to do something I don’t like.
And you, God bless you, you get agencies, offices and cars for free.
An opportunity, my son, for someone who starts his business at this time without capital.
Your capital is people's love for your father.
Be smart and invest it.
Believe me, my son, this is the opportunity of a lifetime.
Come on, get lunch ready quickly.
Mashallah, he even got to the rent and the pepper.
He didn’t leave anything, he didn’t leave anything, tomorrow I’m afraid he’ll take the samosa agency too.
Ajwaf Waladij opened his mind to business.
This is the one you were begging for. Do you know what he told me today?
My mother told me that I want to expand more in investment.
He wants to go to the Caribbean Sea and invest in the islands there.
Keep the envious eyes away from him.
Yesterday, Abu Sultan told me that your son has just entered business.
He has twenty agencies, six restaurants, and is a shareholder in two banks.
I gave him a painful elbow that no certificate or name could bring him back from.
It seems that they haven’t opened it yet, God knows.
Oh, what’s wrong with the one in the northern area of our office?
I just want it
May God bless you. Congratulations, Abbas.
In the name of God
May God bless you.
It’s no use crying over spilt milk.
What, dad? What? A whole year of hard work and effort to prepare the supermarket.
What’s the story? It seems that he comes to the office every day.
This secretary is so sour, his name is Samir.
He told me that this is Saqar, the son of Abu Saqar, who wants to partner with you instead of taking the shop from you.
After I’ll come with you, partner.
There is no might nor power except with Allah.
But then I saw you start talking to him.
He asked me who the brother was.
I told him with my boobs.
Why did you tell him you have an Iranian baker?
When we were walking past this shop, wasn’t there a small sign that said something? What was the name written on it?
Fereej Bakery
No, I want a different name.
Peace be upon you too.
How is work going with you?
Okay, God bless you. God willing, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow we will finish the workers' housing plan for Al Mustaqbal Company.
Lala, Monsieur, she has become my wife, Elissa. I know you, Monsieur, you are the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?
Let her take one of the company cars.
Thank you very much, you are very kind.
Even cooking is based on science and study.
Today someone will come to you and say that he works in business, has a few riyals and wants to invest them.
But the one between us has no knowledge, no education, no study of economics, or even of trade.
One like this
I think it will succeed. I don’t think it will, he’s wasting his time and will lose.
I heard you, Abu Nasser.
I heard what these two birds were saying.
I don't understand this language.
This is yours, and I have a falcon, Mashallah.
Look at him, may God protect him.
See it today
Long live, we are not talking about your son Saqr.
We are talking about Al-Qaeda.
Your son Saqr, God bless him, is an exception and I have no envy towards him.
He will tell you to talk about Al-Qaeda.
We were terrified by a falcon. My son built it himself.
Kaho gave him a car as a gift once.
He sold it, invested the money, and took his own advice.
And Mashallah, as you have seen, Ka Ka.
Hey, man, we're talking about ordinary people now.
One of them did exactly that, and Abu Nasser took him and put his hand on the road.
Mashallah, Saqr has business talents.
And mighty economic tendencies
We need to ask who his father is.
It’s a sin, I’m really surprised, I swear.
Mashallah
Al-Amwal Al-Khaleej magazine in the economic referendum
Please come in.
Peace be upon you. Hello, hello, Salem.
I hope nothing bad happened.
I don’t know what to tell you, Salem, I swear.
Yes, I told you.
I heard the story, it’s true.
The company sent a fax to your father, they say.
And they said to him, "That's it."
My home is unbearable
As you can see
He says that as soon as he heard the news
He fell in the office and the fax is broken.
And He has a favor over him.
He who taught him archery was shot by him when he grew strong, as the saying goes.
What did the doctor say now?
Pray for him, Salem.
I am shocked. I am shocked.
A responsible person in this world
A man gives to the poor with his right hand without his left hand knowing.
This is the association that delivers its donations to all Muslims throughout Asia and Africa.
But of course I also want you to explain to us, O long-lived one, your goals and future steps, God willing.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Our goal at Saqr Charity Association is to achieve solidarity in this nation.
In addition to sixty cloaks for our brothers who were affected by the earthquake in Pakistan.
And this also means, last but not least, that we are now supporting seven poor families.
With a monthly salary of only ninety-two and thirty-two riyals, no more and no less.
No, we are not late for you.
Then I will come to you immediately after that.
Who is my life?
This is Khalid and his wife, they invited us to the hotel tonight.
Yes, by God, any place, any place where you and I are together, I am happy there.
My life, may God keep you for me, oh Lord.
You are the love of my life.
This is my livelihood, it’s haram.
This bakery
Take the money and it will be useful for you.
Five riyals for beans, three riyals for bread.
Two chickpeas
Five beans, five beans, very good, very good.
Soy six six baghla
Come on, you divers
The captain arrived and brought breakfast.
He wants men.
Please, you who have a long life.
What happened again?
No, the request I’m asking you to do, I need to hear you say “done” so I can hear it ringing in my ear.
Hello Nora
Al Anoud is upset with you.
Why am I so quick to upset you?
God willing, it will be good.
Why are you upset?
Nora Amnaya Fasatan Ambast wa Simbel
Don’t say that again, Anoud will get upset.
Why do Lebanese people have a sweet tongue?
Don’t overdo it and don’t talk to him too much.
I am also jealous of Aliya.
The most beautiful dress for the most beautiful flower.
They call her “Idla’onha” and then they call her “Nawara”.
He’s still got a free Gem left.
My Alef is twenty thousand and my Baa is twenty thousand riyals.
Congratulations, God willing, you will be compensated.
May God be with you.
Hello, may you live long, Umm Saleh.
Hi Fadi, you look busy, I don’t want to hold you up.
Of course, my eyes.
Hello, hello
Did you receive the message yesterday?
You boring person
And you liked the joke.
Okay, did you bring the design with you?
I didn’t have time to make them. Show me your designs and I’ll choose from them.
Frankly, your taste is the best.
They started making us work again out of envy.
I found out that my project went well and it will bring in money.
He told you that he is going to do a project like mine.
Design and tailoring shop
Women's clothing
This is Bu Nasser who has nothing to do with business.
Your bank is available
His cousin's son
This is how it is these days.
Okay, okay, my cousin.
Do you believe it? I was asleep, they woke me up and said your cousin wants you.
God willing, it's okay. Your wish is my command.
God willing, it will be good. God willing, it will be good.
I wish
What do you intend to do? For example, do you want to start a project?
I just want to know if you need a partner or something.
I heard, that is, they say that you are planning to come. I said I would come to you, maybe.
Hello and welcome
If you want more stock
Thank God, the job is excellent.
What should I do, Abu Saleh?
But we were late, they rented it last week.
Yes, by God.
Okay, God willing, everything will be fine. Goodbye.
He remains
Are you sure?
And it has details, and you don’t know the biggest disaster.
What else?
It’s a store next to your store that he rents.
Oh, you envious, you hater.
Before I knew that the market was open to everyone
You need to know
Your heart must be open to your cousin.
Mom, I want to ask you something.
You deny, attract, laugh at me and what do you do to me?
I wanted to do my work quietly.
You took a sticky place in my place and it got ruined for me.
I swear, but they didn’t say, “Come here and sit in my mouth, next to my wisdom tooth. It’s killing me.”
This is envy, this is hatred, by God, by God, I swear this is hatred, I’m done with him.
You are family, guys.
You disappoint me, Abu Saleh.
He made me do it, and God will punish you with a slap, you Abu Zanita.
I reached out my hand just as you reached out yours, and I was left with my bite, my morsel.
Oh, come on, guys!
Oh people, pray for the Prophet.
I didn’t do anything, I swear to God, I swear to God.
He advised me to bring a designer from the Philippines.
Don’t let anyone fool you
Why? Why? Why is it specifically a Lebanese?
Chat with him, joke around, laugh, and be completely comfortable.
I see that Bu Saleh has brought a Lebanese.
He kept talking to me and trying to convince me.
He enchanted me, he enchanted me with his words.
He convinced me and made me pay twelve thousand riyals.
After two days, I swear to God, I went to the auction market and found the same cabinet there, its twin brother, for 900 riyals.
Aflos was informed
Get a Lebanese designer
I could meet the professor yesterday. You told me it was difficult yesterday, and it’s still difficult today.
Yes, today is also very difficult.
I feel that Abu Saleh has changed in the last couple of days.
What's up?
I don’t know what’s wrong with him.
Abu Saleh is very psychologically exhausted after his cousin opened a shop and brought a Lebanese designer like him.
I’ve been working at the store for two weeks now and I’m still not used to the sales.
What is this defect here in Qatar? There is no Qatari who opens a shop without another Qatari coming to copy the same project and open the same shop next to him. Why is that?
No, no, no, he’s with the designer Fadi, hello, and they’re thinking of a solution.
How is that possible now?
We were sitting there eating Sam.
If we continue like this, I think we won’t even be able to pay the rent of the shop.
A place far away from them, that is.
This means that you should clear the area for them.
Okay, thank you. And what is the discount?
What the hell? I hope you don’t give away evening dresses for free with every wedding dress.
Come on, man!
What’s up? What happened? I’ll go to the store near you today. They’ve posted an ad that says with every wedding dress you get two evening dresses for free, and there’s also a 25% discount.
Come on, let’s go, let’s go.
No, wait two weeks and they will bring back the same dress. Make one wedding dress and get two dresses for free with a 25% discount.
They are fighting us
I think so too, because if we leave them alone tomorrow, they will destroy our house.
Don’t worry about it.
afterglow
This is a challenge, and I thank him for it.
It's a family challenge
Good for you, you did well to him. The stingy one doesn’t want anyone else to make a living except him.
Oh, you will get the news in two or three days if I don’t close his shop once and for all.
Good for you
Stay, stay, sugar, sugar, I’m coming to you now, I’m coming, okay, bye.
What happened?
Saad says that the shop is unbearable and you can't sit in it because it smells bad. He says he doesn't know where it comes from.
The smell has nothing to do with the air conditioner, no.
She didn’t leave the place at least six days ago, she stinks.
One hundred percent
Yay for the night
Cut off the electricity supply to the shop.
That’s fair.
Now you will sign an undertaking, or we will file a case and open a file.
Do something for him.
He will put an end to its existence.
Uncle Bou Nasser, something strange is happening, no one is coming into the shop.
Uncle Bou Nasser, sugar, sugar, I have a customer coming to me, I'll talk to you later, it's strange.
Aku saw Ali lying on his bed.
I’m talking about his psychological state. I was afraid to tell him that the bank called and wanted the installments, brother.
He was burdened with debts because of his cousin, that bastard.
What happened this time?
So, if they accidentally enter the store and see the designer Saad, they scream at him and run away.
Where is he? He is lying down, his eyes are wide open and he is staring at the ceiling.
I don’t know what he did to me.
I am happy in the store.
I don’t know what he did to him, he bewitched him.
When women see him, they invent fear.
I don’t know what he did.
He lost me, he lost me.
Give me more, brother.
I’m afraid they’ll put me in prison.
I don’t have any evidence against him to go and file a complaint against him.
I don’t know what he did, I don’t know what he did.
Let him deserve it.
And please tell me, what kind of magic did you do to him? You made the designer turn into a monster, and women were scared when they saw him.
A rumor was spread about him.
Guys, this can’t be happening. Tell the photography team that they need you urgently.
Guys, may God bless you, tell him they need him urgently, urgently.
They really raise my blood pressure, they will kill me, they will make me sick. It shouldn’t be like this, Mr. Abdullah.
My dear Ahmed, my love, don’t get so angry. You have a heart, this is not good for you, dad.
I swear I called him so many times, my ears hurt, but it was useless. These extras are going to drive me crazy, they’re going to drive me crazy.
You don’t do anything, everything is on my mind.
Jauf Aad Baba Bahat Al-Harrah Feek
It took him twenty-five scenes, sixteen, come on, Hamed, we need to finish.
And then, does that mean I have to stop filming because of the extras?
This production
But what have I done, Professor Abdullah? Why is he bothering me like this?
My love, do you want no one to disturb you?
What happened, Abdullah?
A late and confused extra
Ahmed, I don’t want anyone to be my lover.
Joff Lee has a certain aura that convinces people that he could actually be a millionaire or a billionaire, not just anyone.
Sir, you just enter the photo power and your request will be available within half an hour.
Not anyone, Alaa, not anyone. I’m still trying to explain it to him.
I’ll figure it out myself, I’ll do two scenes, not just one.
You take responsibility, and you, as the production manager, take responsibility.
And what will they do?
They will do everything. Look, the director is angry, but God help him, they will act.
This requires someone with special qualifications to find him, a security officer from Al-Wat.
Are you serious?
I didn’t hear what the director said.
I have one. May God help you with him. I hope he will be useful.
SS Saud Akhnar
Saud Qawati, I am the one who knows him, Saud Akhnar.
This is when he was little, they used to call him Asoud Aknaar, and when he grew up, they called him Qawati.
Why cans?
I’ll tell you why he’s poor. He wanders the streets collecting cans and sells them by the kilo.
My brother, sing, it’s a matter of pride, not shame.
It has to look like this. Look at this, this is what I know. It’s round and fat, it doesn’t have length or width.
So it definitely works.
God willing, when I tell you that you have done the makeup perfectly, it will work. He is also funny.
What are you waiting for? Speak the whole truth.
I don’t have the number.
I’ll just take Amir with me and go to him.
Where is Saud's house, the can?
What does this say?
Shut up, shut up, you.
Saud Qawwaty
In our neighborhood, we have someone named Saud Qawati.
Yes, I’m sure he’s in the neighborhood, but I forgot which house.
This is a house of a man named Saud who lives there with his mother only.
Yeah, right.
But that’s not Saud Qawati.
This is a Saudi laptop.
Sure, it just evolved over time, the laptop is like a can.
He is tall, strong and a little tanned.
He canceled the order and started collecting old laptops. Oh God, oh God, oh God, uncle.
He’s going to the vegetable market to buy it for me, where’s the other one?
I swear, dad, I don’t know.
This is the one she always wears.
I have another one. Mom, where is the other ghutra?
The right to
This is what I’m looking for, where is it?
Fax and Bufas
Dad, iron it a little before it comes out broken.
But these days it’s getting too much for me.
Oh God, I’ve been worried about you since yesterday, I’ll take you to the emergency room, I’ll take you to the emergency room, you tell me no.
Oh, Mom, they told me they would give me
Thank God, this is it, dad. You got a job instead of sitting around unemployed.
Come on, mom, goodbye.
She went to argue with him, you get stupidly upset, you go upstairs.
Sit down, move slowly, move with the camera, move next to you.
Yes, Jaafar, yes.
Whose laptop is this?
Ay Obeid Al-Riyyal is a great actor, Abdullah Al-Lama'a.
This is with you, I am the son of Fat Aboud, how are you?
How are you, slave?
But stop it, calm down, show some respect for yourself in front of people.
The boy from our neighborhood
Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, oh yeah, oh yeah.
I love acting, God willing they will give me a role as a slap.
I swear to God, brother, it’s not your news.
I’m tired, I swear to God. You won’t believe it, I didn’t sleep yesterday, man.
Asthma, may God heal it.
May God heal her.
Fallen in love
Hey teacher, hey teacher
He has asthma medication, brother, for my mother.
He is a director, not a doctor.
You are cursed. Listen to what he says. You really have no idea.
What is his mother's name?
Spit on you, what do you think?
I heard what you said about you.
She told you it’s light, make it a bit heavier, heavier.
Give me a cough, cough, cough, cough, half a million to fix my car's flat tire.
And give him three million to bring me dinner.
Tony, I’m just asking you why you’re talking like that.
Because I’m heavy, according to some people’s requests.
Jov, Mr. Ghafel, our neighborhood's production has actors of a high standard.
Currently, it’s excellent, meaning it’s suitable for the role.
It’s sweet, and I’ll help you too. I’m a viewer, I don’t have anything, I don’t have anything, right?
This is your house, Sharine.
Oh my God, he is in love.
Take the teacher, bring him to the makeup room, do his makeup, and God willing, Salman will get you the clothes and bring them to you.
Walk, walk, walk, it’s very nice.
ee ee
Listen, brother, leave the car with us. When we finish filming, I’ll call you to come and pick it up.
Don’t worry, someone will take me there.
He will take you. I will let our driver take you. Thank you, brother. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Wait a moment.
Come on, call your friend, this extra, call him, come on.
Hey guys, call Saud, his laptop is in the makeup room.
Let him clean my teeth, brother.
What is written in front of me
Let’s say, God willing.
I’m done, that’s it.
I didn’t expect that from you.
We are not silent about what
We are not going to remain silent about our rights.
Be patient
I know who I need to talk to, Abu Abdulaziz.
Why did he divorce her, man?
Just divorce her and that’s it.
We don’t take the daughter of a thief.
No, there is no need. What do you think?
He’ll clean it up later. The important thing is that you get ready because you’ll go to the dressing room to change your clothes and we’ll be ready to shoot.
Expensive toothpaste for teeth
Oh, come on, this scene was shot so many times.
Why then?
We don’t want tea, man. I’m bored. My stomach is bloated from the tea. What is this? We’ve been waiting for an hour. How long are we going to wait?
Dad, dad, dad, you haven’t seen anything yet, this is normal.
May God give you health.
Fast, Mashallah
May God protect you, may you live long, may God protect you.
Say hello to the group.
They say that Bouabdellaziz sends you his greetings.
God willing, may you live long, God willing.
They are beautiful.
May God bless you, they love your nose too.
The first time someone loved me for my nose.
How do they love them on their nose?
Problems
He got a nose like an ice cream cone, your lips are sweet, sweet.
By God, you haven’t laughed yet.
How dare you
It means he is a good actor.
I hope nothing is wrong, what’s wrong with your voice?
Dad, dad, I’m tired, I’m waiting for you.
Come quickly
Welcome, Sheikh, welcome.
Uncle, look here or there, look for yourself.
Listen to me
Yes, come on!
I have a lot of hollow respect.
What’s happening, dad?
Peace be upon you, what’s up, may God prolong your life?
Kheli Kheli Kheli Kheli
Don’t worry, God willing, it will be fine. Dr. Hassan, come, come.
Yes, Dr. Hani, what’s up?
Let him rest in the office, long may he live.
I don't care.
I hope everyone will be okay.
Please, please, your excellency, please.
Shut up or I’ll punch you in the face.
My name is Bu Abdul Aziz.
Call me, call me uncle
How are you, uncle?
I swear to God, on Halaweh.
Yes, long live you.
Please, sir, have a seat.
May God bless you.
With this chef
Go with him, Mr. Rasheed.
By God, if he did anything to you, let me know and I’ll show you what I’ll do to him.
Hey, mate, can I get a doctor quickly?
Doctor, my mother is sick.
Wait your turn It’s your turn It’s your turn
Listen to me
You can, my friend.
Dad, come quickly, I’m tired.
No matter how many times you go to the hospital and take your mother there every week, you haven’t seen any of them, and they are good, they accept the least thing.
Not like the girls of the country
Don’t take the local girls, leave them alone.
Okay, that’s it, go find someone from the hospital.
I'm in a good mood.
But, brother, you don’t give me any attention.
Come on, go near her, laugh at her, look at her, give her your number, and your intentions are good.
There is nothing, there is nothing.
Just respect yourself.
Walla roh roh wada maroh broh kalam siorty asan atakalam mak.
No, I don’t want anything, I don’t want anything.
It is not necessary for the circuit to leak.
I am Asan Khatiri.
No, thank you.
You can take it and go.
The one who talks to you is Faleh Al-Marzouq.
You marry him, that means you marry him.
Lala, I want the cloak, I want the clothes, and I want the car too, I’ll rent it from you.
Because of that, your salary will be paid to you.
No, no, no, wait a minute.
Oh God
What is this? This is Faleh Al-Marzouq's pistol.
Hello and welcome, may God bless those who come to us, hello
I saw it with my own eyes yesterday.
But I wish you were here.
I tell you, they were impressed by what I did for them. It was a very classy and special party.
One regular, the other diet.
Now you have no excuse.
What is this?
Mom, I have an appointment with my friends tomorrow at work.
God willing, you will deliver this to them.
What’s wrong with him?
Come here, Noura.
What is this?
He will tell his friends about this to make a scandal.
Etudeh can handle it, it makes everyone talk about us.
Give me the money and tomorrow I will go and buy you something nice.
But I just promised them now.
I have to take him tomorrow.
Now that they’re open, let’s go change my people so we can get something that will make our faces look white in front of people.
What’s wrong with you, God?
It is affordable and the quality is very good.
Above average means it’s not the finest type.
Even if it’s chocolate for visual doctors, but sorry, I thought maybe you wanted the right price.
Why is this soul still so dear? Why do you still take us to the most expensive?
You have to check out this artistic touch, it’s impossible.
Heidi is the name of the royal chocolate.
The same chocolate that the Spanish royal court always orders.
Give me this.
Congratulations, and by the way, it also comes with a warranty certificate.
Welcome, welcome, rejoice.
Come on, brother, give us some of that chocolate, brother.
I say, what’s the occasion, you wolf?
It’s not Saleh Abdul Qader who is in the accounts.
Congratulations, he deserves it. Come here, give me one, come on.
Bring us coffee quickly.
My aunt went to their wedding.
I went to their wedding, my love, it was a failure, it was so annoying, you won’t believe it, my sister.
I heard what your aunt said.
That’s why I want to throw you a wedding that has never happened before.
There’s nothing left, we only have a month and a half.
I’m arranging everything.
But he just left me.
You don’t live in society, you don’t see people who spend all their money on their weddings.
You saw it yourself
When I bought you something nice, you saw how they praised you and your taste.
They told you it was amazing and beautiful.
Okay, but how much did we pay?
The money we paid for the coffee could buy four sheep for the wedding.
And may God protect you, don’t interfere. Your mother knows how to do everything. You just have to give her the money and that’s it.
This means that they agree with whatever we choose.
You really have no taste.
What do you think about the Halcush?
But discrimination costs more money.
Why is it that the one who left is beautiful?
What do you think about this?
For the first time in Qatar's history, someone is thinking of making a wedding stage in the shape of a computer mouse.
Excuse me for a moment.
Look, you can talk about anything except the wedding venue and the preparations. This is the place where women who have nothing else to do but talk sit. Just shut up.
Real is waiting for us
We want this to be a luxurious wedding stage.
A strange alley
Guess model 2011
We’ve already taken the mouse.
Relax, all of this is for your own good.
The important thing is to decide whether Noah's Ark will cost you an additional twenty thousand, or whether the car will cost one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Come on, we are ready.
You’re not the first one to get married.
Do you think you’re getting married in Comoros? This is how this country works.
No, we’re just at the beginning.
If you don’t want a stage, then where will the bride sit? In a box?
Iron, paint, and wood burning
And people are happy
They are exploiting us and lying to us. These people are basically scammers.
And what does that mean now?
I'm upset and angry.
I don’t want to get married anymore.
I will talk to the bride's mother and tell her that Saleh is going through difficult circumstances.
He doesn’t want to get married because he can’t afford the wedding expenses. It’s normal. Do you want me to talk to her? I’m serious, I’ll talk to her.
We received a variety of flowers from the Netherlands today.
In my opinion, if you put them on the tables at the wedding
Sure, for the first time in Doha.
and the Middle East after
Put it on the bill.
What does it mean to increase?
Umayyad seventy-two, that is, salvation
But Samir, I don’t want to see this group at any wedding.
Do you know what people say after the pilgrimage?
Consider them booked already.
You earn more than me.
A door opens for you that you don’t know how to close.
May God help you, Saleh.
But you should have tried to fix things a little, may God guide you.
But I, thank God, have decided to go and see a good woman from any Arab country.
They tell you that a wedding party will only cost you a thousand or two thousand dollars, so go ahead.
May God bless you, my love.
God willing, his wedding will be next month.
You just specify how many cards and tell me.
As long as the cards served their purpose, the important thing is that people know where and when they are invited, and that's it.
This is all that matters to you, you don’t care about what people say.
People can tell the level of the wedding from the invitations.
Tomorrow, when people see these cards, they will know what people are saying.
She leaned towards their wedding, since these are their cards, they haven’t seen the cards of so-and-so and so-and-so.
We didn’t say that, we order it from the internet.
Its cover is made of panda bear fabric and has two silver buttons.
You can’t be blamed, but I don’t care about you.
I won’t become a piece of gum in the mouths of women. We will ask for the cards, that is, we will ask for them.
I really feel sorry for you, brother.
He’s poor, they must be putting pressure on him now.
Oh, Real, there is no one he hasn't borrowed from.
What are you saying? He even sold his car.
His face looked twenty years older. I saw him walking and talking to himself in the morning.
Don’t blame him, brother, he’s poor. God, I don’t know when we’re going to develop.
Close the door, please.
Forgive me, brother.
So you didn’t try to convince them that you’re having a wedding that’s within your means?
What do you mean, I'm just a regular guy.
Why am I living alone?
The problem is that our society is sick with appearances, boasting and arrogance.
You must be sick at the same time.
If you want to live in it
I once glanced at the bride’s mother.
I only want my clothes.
Leave it to God.
But tell me
How did you get married?
I don’t want to get married, and I don’t want to be crazy either.
And then, brother, even if I decided to get married
I’m thinking of taking a foreigner or even an Arab.
Yes, your country is saying that.
We were actually planning to bring a DJ for the music.
But Mrs. Om Nasser brought that singer for her son’s wedding.
This singer is famous, but I forgot his name.
What's wrong with you, you crazy woman?
You don’t like what I’m doing.
Akfayeh sold his car and every day one of his friends would pick him up.
I just went into his room and found him talking to himself.
I see that your words have changed now.
Because my brother Saleh is tired, Mom, that’s it.
I don’t care about you or him.
I am no less than other people.
Don’t leave us as a laughing stock.
May God protect you, mother, but my brother spent all he had and didn’t leave anyone without borrowing from them.
And what makes you shut up is that you surrender.
My mother has new requests for the wedding, and my brother told her that he would cancel the wedding and that he no longer wants to get married.
Where is she now?
They are giving her first aid inside.
He says it’s better now, but they will arrange a room for her in the hospital.
My scandalous couple
You should rest, sister.
The doctor told you not to talk and gave you an injection so you wouldn’t sleep.
Where can I rest when he makes us a laughing stock for everyone, good or bad?
I told him to bring us Abdullah Ruwaished, and he said I don’t have money.
And therefore, your mother
He was afraid for her.
She has a soul, she has a soul, kiss her on the head.
Tell her I’ll do what you want.
Beep by Abdullah Al Rowaished
Abu Yusuf is a good man, I don’t think he will let me down.
It’s a sin against you, I couldn’t find anyone else but Abu Youssef.
What’s wrong with her?
Yanet, you, Saleh
But the minister left him alone because he is an old man, and on top of that he is disciplined and honest.
In my opinion, dad, if you went and told him what you told me, there is a high probability that his heart would stop.
I understand.
Because of the shitty crisis you are going through, you want to ask Abu Youssef for money, of course from the ministry's money.
Only God knows when you will return them to him.
Hi, if the auditors come to him and ask him about the money
He could go to hell, of course.
No one knows, but he knows how to handle it.
And God, how are you? The man is in his office and you are responsible if something happens.
I’m stealing at the end of my life.
This is what they call embezzlement, uncle.
On the first floor
It’s in a white can with a blue stripe and a circle that has something like a picture of a dove in it. Bring it, bring it.
God willing, Uncle Abu Youssef, if it wasn’t for my difficult circumstances, I would have…
I’ll bring it all back.
They call me Abu Youssef
You are the last thing in my life
You ruined me, Khamis.
Salih Salih
Listen to me, Hassan. By God, if it were someone else, he would have been beaten up or something would have happened to him. Oh, oh, oh, Khalid.
Salih Salih
All the methods I tried were useless, Uncle Abu Youssef, I’m drowning now.
I can’t back out of the wedding now.
And I know all of these guys, they are all bald.
What’s wrong with you? What’s wrong with you?
Lala, the second horror tilted, the second horror tilted.
On the stairs On the stairs
My uncle, Abu Youssef, the stairs are full of grains, which one of them?
The Gothic one with the picture of a real person on it is scary.
We booked two rooms for us, just for makeup and hair.
And tomorrow morning we will be there.
Yabana Abdullah Ruwaished and his band
You see, my love
I’m not going to tell you.
The bomb of the season
We are the first people in the world to use it.
Oh mom, oh mom
Okay, goodbye.
There is no god but Allah.
Mom, don’t forget tomorrow when you enter the hall, read the Muawwidhat.
The women here have an evil eye.
I told you that it was amazing.
The most beautiful groom. Mashallah, you are blessed, my eyes are cold upon you.
Mom, mom, the police are knocking on the door.
I was wrong to obey you, oh God.
It’s a sin, today is my wedding day.
Oh, the audit money, yoowa.
Come on, I’m going to blow up, I’m going to go to jail.
Bouyoussef Bouyoussef Bouyoussef
Now you're talking
But it’s a shame if this happens, brother.
The company provided a contract for three million, two million of which was just the value of the materials.
He wrote a memo to the minister.
We talked about corruption, but corruption has not reached that level yet.
You're like you don't live in this world.
The minister said what he had to say to Othman.
And why didn’t our manager protest? They say he had
I don’t know about him, I swear I don’t know.
Where are the morals?
What was right has become wrong, and what was wrong has become right.
Oh Saad, are you sure that the minister fired him? What is happening in the world, people?
It's over and done with.
What else?
The King's Minister's Sister
This girl has a relationship with the minister.
Oh my God, what a world!
What’s wrong with you? Don’t you know who this is?
This is the new employee appointed by the minister to replace Othman Miskeen.
Walk, walk, walk
What do you want me to do, Saleh? Oppose the minister?
Who are you?
Listen to me, dad
We have children and we want to live.
We want to live
What happened?
There is a poor man standing by the elevator.
Finally, loyalty and honesty, my brother Saleh.
Nothing we can do for you, brother.
Praise be to God, praise be to God in all circumstances.
What’s wrong with you, Saleh?
It is one of the strange things we see in this world of ours.
I see things that are beyond belief.
I'm sorry, I cannot translate this text as it appears to be incomplete or missing context. Please provide the full text you would like me to translate.
Please stop by the supermarket on your way back from work and get us some salad.
I’ll try. Goodbye.
Who took my sister home?
And then he sat down, laughing and talking. Who is this?
This is my colleague at university. What’s wrong if he sends me something? It’s normal.
Wow, wow, wow, I can’t believe it, what’s wrong with you, you’re like the old you.
What do you say?
You don’t hear what we’re saying.
Your thinking is outdated.
There is still right and wrong, new and old.
Right is right and wrong is wrong.
The world has evolved, we are living in the age of technology.
The era of global changes that are shaping the world and that no one can keep up with.
We have lived and seen it all.
Don’t blame me, Omneira. It’s not up to a person when he gets angry and upset.
What he sees in his day
Tell her I'm sorry.
The world is no longer going right.
Zain, don’t bother yourself and come have lunch.
Let me go to sleep and rest.
Dad is not angry at you.
Papa, there is no salt.
No, I’m not angry. Get up, wash your face and eat lunch.
Come on, my love.
Of course, I am very keen to meet you on my first day of work.
We are honored, may you live long.
Sure, sure.
Of course, I know that you don’t need anyone to remind you of the basics of the job.
But at the same time, it is very important.
We are restoring some of the values and principles that we have poured into.
For the public good
It is supposed to be, may you live long
We all need to
The loot is a must, long live you
You are thieves
Thank you, thank you all.
And what I also want to say is
I warn you from my first day of work.
There is only one employee among you.
Loyal, honest, dedicated and all that other useless stuff.
Just a doubt
He is a loyal employee.
so that we can take the necessary legal action against him in our ministry.
No, good news, long live you.
Thank God, we are all thieves.
Good news, long live you, my colleagues are in front of them and behind them, I say.
Where is Khaled?
Yes, long live you.
Khaled, they praised you a lot to me. Mashallah on you.
God willing, may you live long.
By God, you have made a good choice, O long-lived one.
May God guide you.
Why do you let the devil fool you?
Say Alhamdulillah that he came with integrity.
Mom, why is my dad in prison?
Shut up, mom.
Lala Toba
Mom, why is my dad in prison?
You’ve broken our heads.
It means he became a secretary.
It’s a shame that you say that about your father, Amin.
This is a misunderstanding.
Your whole body is covered.
They will see the world
God willing, you will look for a job for me, who will employ you like this?
A respectable woman covers her body and her charms.
And wrap it around my chest too, because what I’m wearing here is suffocating her.
I want to be with you
And she also brought a top and pants that reveal half of her belly from above the bed.
But there’s no use, you don’t listen, you don’t want to walk the right path.
Here I am telling you
Don’t blame anyone but yourself.
We would like to ask for your daughter Sarah’s hand in marriage for our son Rashid.
These days, one of us will only give his daughter to a straight man.
And Rashid is my firstborn, I’m happy to tell you.
I love you, darling.
The hero fell from his throne.
Drunk for twenty-four hours
Drunk, high, and sniffing all day long.
And don't ask about the rampage
What a good upbringing, Abu Rashid!
And I have good news for you, hypocrite.
What about the trumpet?
You are original, my son, but how about drugs?
The written one is finished. I’ll give you five riyals if you find the blackness of his eye. Make a competition about it.
But Abu Sarah, we didn’t come to ask for her hand in marriage.
You know his ranting and his nonsense.
A girl of noble origin
Congratulations, my son, congratulations. This is the way of life. Congratulations.
I'm drunk.
I can’t walk.
Oh God, oh dad
Okay, bye bye.
Come on, call your dad so he can come and pick you up.
Call him why
This is why I want you
Where is he?
Is there a hollow where the guy wearing the ghutra is sitting with a beautiful blonde girl?
Do you believe that your father is going to give it to her directly?
Hello my daughter, my love Mona.
Majed's name was not Abdulaziz.
What justice?
My daughter, you are torturing me.
And you know that since the establishment of the State of Palestine, with its capital in Jenin, in 2090, after the signing of a comprehensive peace with the State of Israel,
Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure and siege against it.
The latest of these are the allegations made by the Israelis and their Arab friends against the Palestinians.
They are smuggling plastic knives through the tunnels.
In particular, Article II, paragraph A, which stipulates that the Palestinian people must trim their nails every day.
We now take you to the decisive meeting.
My cheap sir
When Israel agreed to the establishment of the Israeli state
What are you saying, man? You’re ruining our reputation, man. Keep working and leave the other one alone.
Please
Sorry, Mr. Tiger. Sorry, Mr. President.
Let me speak.
I am fully committed to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
What is this Israeli delegate talking about?
We have nothing solid here, whether it is stone or plastic, out of our commitment.
Even our homes, man!
What do you Gulf people call it?
In all of Palestine it is made of wood.
According to the agreement, American companies will manufacture wooden cars for us.
All the doors of our houses are made of thermally treated wood, man.
We don’t want speeches.
Don't change the subject.
Mr. President
This point is important. Please vote on this matter because growing nails is a violation of the agreement.
Whoever agrees, raise your hand.
I just had a strange dream.
To control the students
I got tired of telling him.
This is the fourth school I will be attending tomorrow.
Because I wanted to establish my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The boys are chasing him and tearing his clothes, and he is silent.
How many times will you come without a ghutra?
Their manager told me
Rashed is a good guy, we don’t want to fire him.
The children drew on him with chalk.
He lost his gutra in Fusha in front of the whole world.
They said that this teacher has a weak personality and will ruin us all.
I tell them the story of ketchup.
Maryam returned.
And what’s this new story about ketchup? No one told me about it.
They wrote him a full letter of Katjib Katagb and put it on the chair.
He sat down.
He didn’t know anything about the story.
But it was a dry day and the kids laughed at him in the school yard.
Enough already
Your manager, who I’ll be working with tomorrow, called me.
But it’s okay, we’ll still give him a chance.
Because I want to wait, I want to tell you.
The time of kindness and weakness is over.
Oh, your cousin, Abdullah
You will see a different Rashid.
And I don’t need to remind you of that important educational saying.
You are a graduate of education, and I am a graduate of education.
We all know the saying
The teacher is the son of the first class.
You will see the strong teacher Rashid.
And whoever makes a mistake
Woe unto him
When I first went on pilgrimage, they told me to shut up, what do you have to say?
I can't translate this text as it appears to be a non-standard or incomplete phrase in an unknown language. Please provide more context or a complete sentence for an accurate translation.
Which one of you made fun of me and said, "Shut up, you're fine"?
You told me to shut up.
I am not
The one next to you
Be the spirit of the right manager
And he said that Professor Rashed expelled me.
I don’t want to see your face here, do you hear me?
What do you think about my nervousness?
It’s supposed to be like this not only on the first day, but all year long.
Woe unto him
The one who hears his voice
I explain or I speak.
Do you know what that means?
Nervous, do you know what nervous means?
It means nervous.
Did you hear me when I said that or not?
I heard it after that.
Get out of the classroom
The spirit of the right of the director
Come on, take your stuff and get out.
Take your stuff.
Oh, how beautiful!
Sure, they are still looking for him.
No, we didn’t see the teacher.
Try this ice cream, it has milk, if there is strawberry inside, it is very sweet.
My love, Abdulrahman
Every human being is prone to error, and so is the son of Adam.
Joking, dad.
It means that the most important thing is that the topic doesn’t reach the father.
I want the cocoa that’s in my bag.
Present and ugly, your country is ugly, and your country, and where is your bag?
f page
Of course, my eyes.
You say that he is happy with you.
You don’t know how to tell the difference between a rich kid and a normal one.
What does a tick look like? The tick is red and green.
Come on, where are you going?
In the bathroom
And you are mine in the bathroom.
Knock on his door quickly and tell him that the first class started half an hour ago. Come on, quickly.
I’ll have one juice and one chips before all of them.
I took their hearts because they needed my friend Abdulrahman. This is really good for your health.
Okay, now go to Saud and get the PlayStation tape from him.
So what do we learn from this story?
the human being
He must have good morals.
This is the PlayStation money, and he also told me to return the PlayStation to you all at once.
God willing, my friend, is there anything else you want, my friend Abdul Rahman?
Now no.
We learn from the story
Of course you know that I am leaving this week because I have been accepted into graduate studies.
So I said I had to submit the party file before I left.
How can I take you in the afternoon? Abdulrahman told me he doesn’t know where he wants to go, but he didn’t tell me what time.
His father came back from the trip and didn’t say anything, thank God, I’m relieved.
Let’s say I took him there this afternoon and he got upset and didn’t tell his father. No, no, no, it’s a disaster. No, no.
Hello my friend Abdulrahman
May God help you.
What should we do?
Sweet, sweet, like this
And guys, today we’re taking a new science lesson.
Peace be upon you.
Thank you, thank you.
Abi May
I didn’t ask, I asked you with my eyes.
Teacher, teacher, how do you ask the teacher for water?
A teacher goes to get water for a student whose janitor he is. No, no, this matter will not go well. I will write it in the report.
You are still making fun of me.
Don’t raise your voice or shout at me, or else.
How much is this? How much does it cost?
That’s all, how many cars is this?
Four cars five
Excellent, this is excellent, sweet, excellent.
What is this?
As you can see, he is going to build a parking lot in front of our houses and at our expense.
Don’t say the days of Bu Nasser
Okay, Abu Nasser, that's enough.
He studies
Zain broke the table.
About nervousness, brother
What makes it special?
Do you think you have a feather on your head?
Change your style with me.
Me or you
We didn’t say anything, dad.
What is this?
Listen, it’s better for you to let things go on as they are.
We are threatened, dad.
There is no need and I want to make you feel comfortable.
What are you saying?
Instead of what I mean
You probably want to
You want this? It’s up to you, that’s it.
Hurry up hurry up
Ha ha, that’s good.
It’s not up to him, it’s not possible.
Frij Abuh
We came to Uncle Bonaif to think, not to shout.
Who is Rashid who behaves in the neighborhood as he pleases?
You made me talk.
Okay, guys, be quiet and let’s hear what Uncle Bonaif has to say.
Now this worthless piece of trash is playing with your nerves.
Leave him alone
If you slap him, he will stick to the umbrella he made.
The game is played by its people.
That’s good.
See you later
You haven't seen anything yet.
You know he has a jewelry store.
Ajwa wearing these rings and chains
May God have mercy on us.
Just walk a little more and you’ll stay in the heat.
Rashid couldn’t believe that an innocent man who had done nothing wrong could end up like this.
He was appointed Deputy Director General of the World Educational Center.
He will tell you, he will teach you. You are a teacher and he is a teacher, but look where he has become and where you have become.
How dare you
Come on, Abdullah.
I’ll teach you what the secret is.
The teacher has arrived, the teacher has arrived.
Professor, I didn’t do anything.
Professor, do you know who this boy is?
My love, I know this is a boy.
I’m telling you, we’re not going to get a good opportunity like this again.
I’m looking for a job. You made me laugh, you really made me laugh.
No, it’s okay, the job is in the pocket.
Thank you, you did your best, thank you, thank you.
Say hello to him
May God protect you, and may your mother protect you after God. May God protect you and may he greet you, God willing.
Okay, goodbye my love, may God protect you.
After your brother fights, he will become a minister, but believe me, dad.
Okay, Mom, we’re working, we’re working on something big.
But dad, if it’s your job, they won’t say anything.
That’s how he gave it to you.
It’s just normal, that’s all.
Normal automatic, this doesn’t need to be said.
My love, please, make my dream come true.
My dream came before yours.
List a tower for me among the Corniche towers
Come on, what are you waiting for?
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You can do it, Abu Saleh.
I say your friend looks upset.
He doesn’t look like it, man.
You are up to it, Abu Saleh.
He got up, took the phone and gave it to Abu Saleh.
Look, these are his moves, and for sure, Bossultan is a hundred million percent against him.
He didn’t have a good relationship with Abu Saleh at all.
No, Abu Sultan wouldn’t do that unless he was up to something.
Is it possible that it has come to this?
He went back to open the car door for him.
Finally, he will work to disable the doors of the minister's car.
Oh dad, don’t hurt my heart, don’t hurt my heart.
You know, the talk we hear in cafes is what's happening in the country.
But I can’t believe what I’m hearing.
My heart has stopped, my heart has stopped.
I’m afraid that the story will spread among women, and Latouf, the one with the plates, will embarrass me in front of the women, oh mother.
Say something, Abu Sultan, speak up. I’m shocked by what happened during the day.
Please, I know what I’m doing.
No one has anything to do with it.
Amneera, I'm working on a low flame.
The fact that I opened the door for him is the beginning of the plan I have in mind.
I am the one who should be the minister, not him.
Let me work, I have a plan.
Let them carry it.
Any plan
But he has to trust me first.
They told me that he was appointed as a minister because he was appointed two months before you.
Because I guarantee his burden and his expenses.
Magic can be nullified
What is this?
What’s next?
Any activity that is prohibited by photographers is to take pictures until the picture is burnt in the newspaper.
It smells until it floats to the surface.
Sure, again.
Wait, let me work on it and I’ll show you.
On the contrary, Your Highness.
Of course, Mr. Minister.
Then come and tell me.
She thanked him for the sheep, it has really good meat.
The real is at the door, get up for him.
Don’t be a loser, people want to marry you and you want to belittle yourself.
The minister: Please, come in, come in.
No, no, I don’t imagine myself as a minister’s assistant, just a picture, a picture of a minister’s assistant.
Hit him with the second one, give it to him.
I swear, brother, I really liked your plan.
I want you to take him there.
Image Image Image
Which minister?
Okay, let me tell you something for a moment.
Go to the second last page
I took a picture of him and enlarged it with the groom.
Say there is no God but Allah.
Every day has one or two pictures
As you said, a social activist, okay, okay, goodbye.
They all love you, but I don’t know what’s wrong with you.
Melas in every wall
These two are hateful and jealous of you. Only a fruitful tree is stoned.
Take me to the market.
What I prepared until then
Peace be upon you
Hello, peace be upon you, hello.
You are very famous
I'm sorry, I cannot translate this text as it appears to be gibberish or a non-standard script.
This is my husband.
I love my mom's words.
Three hundred and fifty three
I hope this person is known.
But today at home, I hope nothing bad happened.
Oh God, today I have a headache, my head is pounding, my body is broken, and my colon is acting up.
I’m tired, I’ve been tired for a month and I’m still looking.
Let me rest today.
Hello, hello, Umm Sultan.
I say
Come on, just take me there.
I see you’ve solved it.
You saw what fame does to violet.
I’m glad you’re convinced, thank God.
The truth is clear
This minister of yours seems to be a fatalist, he apparently liked the story.
I’ll send it to you, my brother Saad.
No, I didn’t follow any activity today, nor did I read the newspapers. I don’t know.
Okay, God willing, goodbye.
If God wanted to destroy the ant, he would have given it wings.
Hello brother, is there a conference at the hotel tonight?
Wedding
Ava means everything, there is no activity like this, a birthday party, a wedding.
I don’t know, but you can see the hotel behind us.
Oh, you're at a hotel behind you.
I’ll leave you in the car and go into the hotel to ask.
Soul, soul, soul, take your time, soul, ask, soul.
May everyone succeed, God willing.
Let this minister let us sleep and rest.
It means he couldn’t find a party, a wedding or any other reason to wake him up.
Sixteen thousand hotels and he couldn’t find one. He’s unlucky, just like his face.
Shut up, just leave me alone.
I couldn't find him a birthday
You can catch the second half.
Every number has a thousand images.
He doesn’t sleep, he doesn’t show up, brother.
Uncle, the guy who tears up the newspaper says that the first thing to do is to prepare his picture and then make the newspaper.
My children say they made a competition out of a picture of your husband.
One person asks another: "How many pictures of the minister did they put in the newspaper today?"
And the winner gets a prize.
It’s not like that. Come to the coffee shop and listen to the comments every day about the picture in the newspaper. They say that the old man never stops talking.
God is near to His end
As they say, when God wants to end a butterfly's life, it gets close to the light.
People are greeting you and saying hello to him.
He became one of the country's most famous celebrities.
What a shame on you, and who is this?
I ruined my reputation
May God protect you and her.
She said that all of us got married except for poor Amal, who is the only one among us who didn’t get married.
This share
I am not destined to get married
And I have already forgotten the story of marriage.
May God punish whoever was the cause.
Look at those two sissies sitting over there.
Heal them.
The one who plays with his hair is hollow.
Is this a boy or a girl?
After my father died, I mean, after I killed him.
Which pair is bigger?
It’s a sin to make us attached to the maid.
Come on, go make some tea.
I was tired of talking to my mother, but she didn’t just hire one maid for him, she hired two.
We told you a thousand times that it’s none of your business, Khulood is my son, not yours.
You don’t have any other topic except Khulood and the maids, except the maids and Khulood.
Mom, it’s not good like this. Khaloud spends 24 hours with the maid and doesn’t want anyone else.
Come on, get out and let me rest. I want to sleep. How am I?
My father, Saud, your brother has become a girl.
Wait a little bit, I’ll tell my dad about you.
I’m just telling you, Khulood, what’s wrong with Khulood?
Saud says that Khulood puts on makeup and acts like a girl. What’s the story? What’s the story?
Oh, Saud, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până până
He put makeup on his face, Khulood, but it was just kids' makeup. He saw the makeup box and played with it.
I saw that big Antifa, and I couldn’t even tell.
Okay, sweet and tender.
I am Bahaa Shah Saud
I haven’t seen you in a long time.
Hey, Saad, I asked you last time what you would become when you grew up, but you didn’t answer me. Now answer me, what will you become when you grow up?
And you, my beloved Khuludi, Saad will become an officer. What will you become?
This year we're going to London the same year.
Any word that is trembling in Bahrain
He said, let him bring Susan, Fahooda, and Kholoud.
Say hello to Samora.
I seek forgiveness from the Almighty God.
Today my dad told me to choose.
Do you want me to build you land on the sea or the land next to us?
I told him I don’t want to choose.
I, my love, will live with you anywhere.
You’re welcome, my love.
Teach me how to fish
Oh God, Amal, I wish I could close my eyes and open them and they would tell me that Amal has finished university.
If Jannah is a perfume, it is not a men's perfume.
I don’t know, but it smells very strange.
This is my doctor.
Your way of speaking has become feminine.
You forgot that you are a Real.
And God willing, after that I will be able to talk to people outside.
I can’t believe it, Khalid.
Please get out of my room.
What a pity, Khulood!
You fell from my eyes.
Come on, don’t hurt my feelings, I swear I’ll tell my mom.
This is my son and I know him well.
So, Khaloud, my dear, I wish all the children had your intelligence and feelings.
And if you see someone who is gentle and quiet, you say he is my son.
It’s a shame that you’re saying such things about your brother.
But come on, you made a big deal out of something that was small.
It’s worth it, so put a little perfume on it. It smells good now. What’s the difference between men’s and women’s perfumes?
Don’t you dare tell this story in front of your father.
I have
I’ll tell you, but quietly so that Mohammed doesn’t notice anything.
Oh, where do these girls listen to this?
It’s a sin to do this, she’s a beautiful girl.
You don't read it, you don't read it.
I’m afraid that he will feel that this has something to do with him.
Give yourself a rest.
I know you're looking at the Bluetooth that's been spreading these days.
I’m waiting for Saad, just let him come.
How are you Saad?
May God bless you
I’m telling you, we’re waiting for you, we haven’t played cards yet.
Why?
Would you like to drink something?
He’s been lying hollow here in your apartment for two days.
About Bluetooth
Which of the older brothers is he talking about?
I'm afraid of him
Don’t try to kill me anymore, don’t try anymore.
Seek refuge from the devil, mom, for my sake.
I have already booked.
I’m done, I’m leaving. Where will I hide my face from my people? I have no face.
What are you going to tell your father?
Tell him anything.
Oh, these kids, oh, these kids, oh
This is the end, mom.
Say why Khulood was young
This is definitely the result.
It’s a sin, come on, just get out.
The truth always hurts
The jar broke.
I can't live in Doha.
My face
I’ve had my phone turned off for a while.
And tell me, oh hope
And you, my son, stay awake all day at home.
I am a real plumb bob who spends all day meeting people outside.
It’s difficult, Amal.
I can't live my whole day and my whole life with my head bowed to the ground.
My father has been feeling for a while that something is happening in the house and that there is a change.
But when will my father be absent from the events that happen in the house?
Sometimes I blame my father and sometimes I don’t blame him.
Malouma, O Amal, when I remember his suffering and his dedication to his work so that we can live with dignity among people.
And I blame him
Why did he leave the responsibility of the house and children to the mother?
We don’t want to dig into the past now.
Do you know your parents or not?
But I intend to
Transfer it via Bluetooth
But I’m not going to give it to him.
I want to see my father's shock with my own eyes.
You are hurting a lot.
Whatever it is, Amal.
Know us
Better than what is known through others.
Our house has reached this level of loss.
Because a dirty bomb called immortality exploded in it.
Customs and traditions
They taught them with all insolence.
They will block their ears against it.
And they do not hear it
Only one voice
It is the voice of filth and perversion.
May God grant you all the goodness.
What came to your mind?
Suddenly, I decided to travel to study.
We can only say that God will help you, my son.
May God help you
The gift is to be returned by those who are coming back from a trip, not by those who are traveling.
You are right.
This is the rule
But there is an exception to every rule.
Come on, my hope, come with me quickly.
Hey mom, it’s dry.
I didn't hear anything.
Busaad
Busaad
What's wrong with you, Abu Sa'ad?
Dad, what’s wrong with you, dad?
Dad
Don’t be upset
You are a great person.
And any young man wishes to have a wife.
I didn’t divorce you because there was anything wrong with you.
I divorced you.
Because it’s impossible
Accept that he will be the uncle of my children.
A freak like your brother
Hey, Salah
I come here every day
You don’t show up at all first
Buried underground
That first one is under the earth.
This is powerful talk. Are you up to it?
You are in one thousand and two hundred, oh my God, that’s a lot of money.
Say Mashallah
Come on, let's go, come on.
It’s only been seven months for you, stop whining, you’re making me sick. Come on, take me home.
A failure and a scandal
I’ll tell you about this driver.
It’s been seven months since it happened to him.
My ears hurt, my ears hurt.
Deport him and get rid of him.
Deport him and bring another one.
Fahmi’s son doesn’t know what Ashura is, he doesn’t know the loss of money and time.
Train him to drive and get rid of him.
You are the first person to come to my house since I came here six months ago.
Then I will say something new, what do you think?
This is oil in Ahin, one hundred and thirty-four riyals per kilo, half a riyal. It is five riyals, very expensive, Baba.
Okay, you’re a genius now. Listen to what he’s saying.
You are the first to come, how much does he give you, what is your money?
Seven hundred gives
You are still very new, you are only six months old, that’s a lot, this is eight hundred.
I want money.
This is a driver, you are saying old words, you are new.
This is seven hundred, eight hundred.
Roh
This is what he says, he just comes and takes one hundred riyals.
Three hundred, no use.
I like what you say very much.
Lala Shashi, there is a problem with the padin, I have a lot of time to waste.
No fear Shashi
Who is the sponsor of the money?
Why are you a cove?
This man is working for his first sponsor.
I don’t know how much six hundred soldiers are, I don’t know how much you’ve done.
How much is it?
Wool is not you, Kov.
Mafi Cove
God is sufficient for me against him.
I sat down to take a picture, then I went inside him.
There is no one
Even the phone I bought him a package for.
I did it
I did it again
They didn’t fail, they took his passport and kept it with them.
I’ll talk to you later, goodbye.
Tomatoes are everywhere
The problem is here, the problem is here.
After all, what do they flee?
They will deceive us and humiliate us.
I told you to deport him.
But you think I’ll let him go?
I will find him wherever he is.
Yatsfar means yatsfar
I would rather pay for his ticket and send him away than have him stay in the country and collect money.
My liver hurts, I wish I could just catch it.
A shower buddy, no one buys it now
At the beginning of the game, you looked like you were very scared, I noticed that about you.
But what are we afraid of? We are afraid that our team will not score goals.
We want more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were terrified and afraid of the opposing team.
I’m not afraid of the opposing team, I’m afraid of our team. I’m afraid that they won’t score more than three goals, I’m telling you.
This is our team's level, I know it, I'm talking about our team's level.
I have great confidence in you.
The opposing team has nothing.
Foxes are cute. Come on, say it now. You scored the first goal.
Wherever you go
Roh Beit
In a car
Come, I’ll take you with me, I’ll deliver you with me.
Oh, thank you, my friend, Shakkariah.
Why are you trying? You won’t be able to defeat our team.
Long live you, the matches have just started, the league has just started.
You didn’t hear what he said.
He told you there are a lot of problems.
Come on, Mahmoud, bring it here.
Al-Hain Rafiq Aiji Roh Malab Ya Allah
Come on, uncle, you're drunk.
Here you go, boss.
What has he done to himself?
Oh, the Indian boy.
Yes, sir, this is a football rule.
There is no saying that this is the talk of my team, the foxes.
Sui labo ku labo ku
Come on Sajid, come on Sajid, hurry up, hurry up, the match is about to start, hurry up, bring a bottle of water, the foxes are playing today, hurry up.
Dear viewers, we have with us one of the most famous fans of the Foxes Club team, nicknamed Thaaloub.
But they say that you won against them because they were incomplete.
This is talk, this is talk, there is nothing good.
What’s wrong? What’s missing? This is a team, a very good team, it has a dozen people in it.
And one minus two minus no use, same same.
This is a devil fox.
This is our best fan.
Okay, on the occasion of this victory, Thuloub, I have a final word to say to the foxes.
Stop talking altogether.
Why do we hate this in the saying of foxes?
This is Sama inside Ali.
This is the right fan.
Look, brother
He received it with such enthusiasm.
Here you go, cutie.
Where is the Indian boy who kicks the ball?
I haven’t seen him for a long time.
Uncle, this is a great curse, if it continues, he won't stay here.
I saw him a few days ago, I didn’t recognize him. He was sitting in a café in Villagio called Starbucks or something like that.
I remember that guy used to sit with us in the café, he didn’t even have a cup of tea.
The man gave the boy a tip of twenty riyals in front of my eyes.
Why did he do that?
Uncle, he is counting with the club's senior officials, they are fixing him, they are not messing with him.
I say Thulub.
My name is
My mother says, do it in your own way, do it in your own style.
You are talking nonsense, you are supporting a bad and tired club like this one.
This is the team of the foxes’ money, my financial heart.
When my heart stops beating
There is a very negative mood inside.
You, long may you live, have never heard the poem he wrote about the ruling.
The day we had a match with them
Please, please, Thulub, say it, say it, this is a poem, say it, say it.
My mother, oh God, in a world of secrets, I am
This is my money, I have a lot of it.
I don’t sleep at all at night.
Do you know that we are a fan club of the Foxes?
What I mean is that you can’t tell me the name of the winner so that I can have a journalistic scoop.
We have a press conference and God willing we will announce the name of the winner.
Say what is beautiful
This fan, known as Thuloub, was honoured today by the Foxes Club administration in a generous gesture and a very beautiful initiative.
By God
Thuloub, congratulations on this beautiful tribute. It is certainly a wonderful gift.
Snow will say you are either in a pen or in a watch.
It’s God, it’s my father.
This is in Lifa
I tell you it is
We need to inform the police.
Stay in your place and shut up.
All this fan fan fan is in money fan
No, no, no, this is not your father, it’s someone who looks like him.
I tell you it is
You are late.
I don’t know when the matches are, brother.
Okay, how are we going to catch him now?
We have no choice but to wait for the Foxes team to play their next match.
Aku aku jifte
Let’s go and catch him.
Dude, you're late.
Aku aku aku aku
Hit him, hit him, hit him, hit him from behind.
The thing is that we are not sure if this is him or not.
I’ll tell you, dad, it’s him.
I say that the opinion and wisdom is that we should go to those two and ask them: where did this driver come from, how did he come to you, and when did he come to you?
Dad, you have to make two trips out of one trip.
Let’s go and report it. I’m sure it’s him.
And the earth, may God protect you, may God bless you, my name is Malti.
Registered in the name of Mali Nam In my name Nam
Blow this in the second land next to his.
Say to your father that he should hand over to you the son of Abdurrahman al-Subaji. Peace, peace, peace.
No, God bless you. It seems we made a mistake, dad. We came here for a friend of a friend and we mistook you for him.
God creates one person and makes forty people who look like him.
Thank you, thank you, long live you, thank you.
Lala, may God bless you. Apologies, apologies. Thank you, thank you.
Come on, forgive us, give us your permission, I don’t have your license, forgive us, may God grant you peace, come on, may God grant you peace.
And then you tell me you’re still sure?
What will your father do to us now? God help us.
What did you do, Walido?
And I, while I was walking, the bag strap got torn.
Come on, let’s blow this place up now.
Get up, soul, get up and leave your room.
May God protect us
May God protect us.
Come on, explain this to your father now.
Before my dad knows
Break into a million pieces
Okay, mom, let’s go buy one like it quickly.
Before my father came
May God protect you, Mom.
You know your dad, when he gets angry he becomes like a crazy person.
Go to your room and don't come out of it.
We didn’t do anything.
He accidentally hit the vase, it fell from his bag and broke.
Mom, I'm worried about him.
I don’t know where he went.
No, no, no, his father is not sane.
It’s a sin what you’re doing to the boy, oh mother.
The Amazighs are angry, they want to kill these children.
I say, Mom
You think he’s dead, where did the boy go?
Okay, I’ll call you then.
May God protect us.
Auntie, I know where Waleed went.
Come on, I’ll change you, where are you going?
Come on, come on
I'm here
And I don’t want to go home, may God protect you, my grandmother.
Stay with me
I didn’t see the vase.
I swear I don’t know.
May God guide your father, he has scared you.
Come here, mom.
Don’t be afraid, you’re safe as long as I’m at home. That’s it, dad.
I have the solution.
We didn’t say anything, Abu Walid.
Your student is his student, Abu Walid.
I’ll forgive him this time, just for you.
I see him at home.
Where is he, where did he go?
Where is he? Where?
Okay, my son, Waleed, don’t be afraid, your father is not going to do anything to you.
Sure, dad.
Oh, yes, dad, yes.
I’ll leave it here, I’m afraid one of the kids will touch it and break it.
He recommended me and told me that he wanted one like the one you brought me, which Walid broke.
Exactly, he wanted it, so I went and found only this last one in the store. He’s very lucky. Oh, my God! Where are the kids?
They study in the room.
Come on, take care of it.
But these values and I will get up.
Oh, wow!
Okay, come on, let’s study.
Dad, just this game and we’ll get up.
Dad, for God’s sake, don’t tell my uncle.
Dad, don’t tell your brother, dad, this is the last time, I swear, dad.
I call him
And you especially made a mistake with your friend at the coffee shop, me.
If you tell my brother about me, I will kill you.
This phone is no longer connected, it’s in my pocket while we’re studying, that’s it.
Mom, why don’t you take him to a doctor?
May God guide you, mother.
The Amazigh's heart is afraid because of how much it beats.
Poor boy
Be you
Mom, where is Amoolah? I don’t see her with you today.
I want to be with her.
My sister never gets enough of playing.
Oh, mom, I didn’t tell you the story of Munira and her son Nayef.
Her son is the same age as Walid, may God protect him.
The same length
Yesterday you told me you didn’t know what to do with your son.
She wanted to take him to the hospital, but her husband, Youssef, wouldn’t let her.
I heard about the story yesterday.
And Hausha was shouted at.
He said, "How come you didn't tell me?"
This is a psychological case.
The boy will pee whether he likes it or not.
He takes his son and ties him up in the middle of the yard.
Then he tells him to do it again and pee in his bed.
You are praying in a ruin.
What happened, O Umniyyah?
I tell her, eat, eat.
Enjoy your meal.
Oh, my luck
Mom, mom
Your father didn’t feel sorry for you.
Or I would have slaughtered you from the start.
Come on, go take a shower before your father wakes up and causes you trouble.
What do I have to do?
Poor people, it’s a sin.
They are sitting there shouting and arguing.
I’m afraid something will happen to my children.
I have to take them to their uncle to discipline them.
I am nervous.
They all passed successfully.
Why would you take them to their uncle?
We got 48 out of 50 right.
Why don’t they get 50 out of 50?
Their uncle warned them.
And I honestly support his point of view.
Keep your emotions to yourself
I have to teach my brothers a lesson.
Okay, bye bye
Last time, last time.
Fifty out of fifty
Let him waste our time, I have to confirm to them that this is our son.
Why don’t you get fifty out of fifty?
Jab jab jab I warned you but you don’t listen
What you hear is the word.
Jalil Al-Haya
Give him one, let me, let me teach him a lesson. Yes.
Okay, that’s it, uncle.
So that you revise it properly for the second time, okay, you will revise it.
Come on, man.
Do you know what I should do?
I will bring you one by one and make you falafel.
Be careful not to go to public places with your family.
Tell him the ambiguities
Professor Walid is shouting
What’s wrong with you, why are you crying?
This is an excellent grade.
It’s strange that you’re shouting.
You are supposed to be happy.
You, my son, all the people took the buses and went home, I was waiting for anyone to come and take you.
At the school gate, it means he’s waiting for the bus. The bus arrived and the kids got off, but he wasn’t with them.
Have you heard about the boy who committed suicide today?
Hi, God bless you, they gave us the certificate.
His father threatened him if he didn't get a perfect score.
Walid, Walid, come back, Walid, come back.
I greet you live and welcome you to a new episode of the program Without Borders.
Oil accounts for more than thirty-five percent of total energy sources.
The rest goes to natural gas, coal and hydropower.
Oil is therefore the world's primary source of energy.
The Gulf States and Iran alone have 668 billion barrels.
followed by Iran at twelve percent, then Iraq at ten percent, Kuwait and the UAE at nine percent.
Each of them, and then comes Venezuela with a percentage of seven percent.
Then Russia with five percent
The Gulf states and Iran account for two-thirds of the world's reserves.
to unprecedented prices, exceeding one hundred and nine dollars for the first time in history.
In this episode, we try to understand many of the complexities of oil.
and the problems faced by the exporting countries
Despite the huge rise in its prices
as well as the problems experienced by citizens and residents of these countries
due to inflation and unprecedented increases
which will appear successively on the screen, or write to us on our website at www.aljazeera.net.
Because today the market is the main factor.
and not the producing countries
The factor that determines the price is market power.
Not OPEC
Of course, supply and demand play a part in this.
But other factors
Other factors are political tensions.
in the world
Real estate markets
And the markets of the LLL Bourse and others
And they turned to the prices of Al-F speculation.
In the Kamatejis, including oil, for example
Tomorrow it will reach a thousand dollars, God knows.
Oil jumped to $44 in 2004.
And today we see that even oil prices
It fluctuates from one day to another.
Oil prices fell below ninety dollars.
And it rose in the second quarter
Especially with the arrival of spring, most refineries around the world enter a maintenance period.
which always refers to the second quarter
Seasonal demand for oil is declining.
In winter it drops below ninety.
And all this indicates that speculations have power and control over the market now.
I thought a lot, meaning that when we go back to the traditional market in the past
The market was affected by supply and demand.
L L L Seasonal supply and demand
Today we see that there is economic growth.
General Fallon, commander of the Central Region in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned today or yesterday.
His resignation has caused a huge reaction because of its connection to the so-called impending American war.
Political or geopolitical effects
It affects the oil market in a way that is either negative or positive, i.e. very quickly.
The impact will definitely come and it will definitely have its effects.
Even the speculators themselves are also involved in political speculation.
Some people who might confirm what you say might also tell you that an American war on Iran is coming.
Here is what the market will be. The market is optimistic in its own way.
A question in the shadow of His Excellency's efforts, now that the deputy is in the White House.
This brought the region back to a tense atmosphere.
This is a beaver.
But perhaps Fallon saw this scenario.
A very rapid rebound in the oil market
Today we prove with numbers that there is no shortage.
Let me give you an example from the past seven weeks.
The United States' oil inventory has increased to more than the average of the past five years.
It means that today I am not, I mean, I say.
Not even for the next war, because today I tell you that even the world has a bitter reserve.
Even today's global consumption, show me any country in the world where there is a long line or queue in front of petrol stations.
This is something else.
What danger does this pose?
What number do you think it could be? I don’t know, it could be anything.
Miten could be three hundred dollars, it could be less.
If these tensions escalate into riots, they could turn into real tensions.
Because, as you said, the Gulf constitutes sixty percent.
In a country that is even far away from the oil-producing countries.
See the impact is coming in reverse on the oil market.
It can reach up to $300.
And they set up and moved from stocks and other things to the oil market today. Look above, it's over two trillion or trillions of dollars.
Today we will see the print.
He speculates on it, over a hundred barrels a day, that's what it means.
These existing tensions in the region and the anticipation
April was said before to be the month in which this war would be launched.
And God knows, I mean, my generation doesn’t
In the area because of the the the
This is an election year.
The current US administration has only a few months left.
George Bush Sr. declared war on Somalia and sent 30,000 troops in his last days in the White House.
We see, but we do not anticipate events.
But I don’t expect this scenario to happen.
Because this scenario is very expensive.
It will cost you nothing. You, the Iranians and the consumer countries will pay.
USA Today
It now depends on African oil and has many alternatives.
Look, let’s just be clear.
You said in your introduction that sixty percent
oil reserves
But now they import twenty-two.
Their oil is from the West, from West Africa.
I am from West Africa, and no matter what they import from any region in the world.
Oil production
Because this is a difficult number, proven reserves, and reserves.
on what is called deep water, or the act, or production from the sea at great depths
The navy and therefore the Gulf will continue to be a difficult number.
and Caspian oil
I consider them dreams because they are not real and true.
They are destroying it and ruining it.
The important thing is that there is
Today, Qatar is the world's largest energy exporter.
This is why these countries are a difficult case.
in it and the energy needs of countries
This means that there is definitely something called security and safe supply.
Despite the fact that there was internal opposition in the United States, even at the level of General Fallon
But there are still concerns.
that President Bush would
He, you noticed that the political risks did not come from the Gulf countries.
It means no, no, no, it’s not a matter of generosity, because we don’t have anyone who deals with generosity.
There is no dealing with a lot of generosity.
But not in an article right now.
We are not part of the charity work.
Could he please
But Karam is only with Westerners, not with anyone else.
Specifically with America
Where is the market?
Where is our economic return? We will go for it.
We will not
such as oil and gas
You put it there out of generosity and
I have the proof.
I have the proof.
No more than sixty to seventy dollars
Not a price increase
But it is the decline of the dollar that you insist on.
You are primarily Gulf Arabs and OPEC.
The export should be in dollars, but you refuse.
Change the currency even though the currency has collapsed
Although the return is not in your favor
No, I didn’t say seventy.
But this is what the experts say, not me.
Okay, the dollar fell by thirty-five percent and oil rose higher than this decline.
That is, if we take 2004 as the base year.
We saw that oil prices were, that is, ranged between thirty-five and thirty-six dollars.
I mean, of course, I mean.
The price of oil has increased.
But the increase is slight, the deputy said.
That means if we took them
So we consider it to be now.
even these prices
That means if we compare it to 2004
It has even exceeded the rate of the dollar's decline.
The exciting LL
Reacts to the decline of the dollar
The lower the dollar, the higher the oil prices.
And this is also something that the market has started to give its opinion on.
The interests of the two are now preserved.
No, the situation has changed. Perhaps this was said two years ago when the decline began, but the situation has changed now and there is
The dollar appeared to be losing value against major currencies such as the euro, the yen and the pound.
The question here is why do you insist on linking your currency to the dollar?
Its currency is weakening and has no cover.
This is it, this is it, this is a historic era.
Petroleum and its derivatives in dollars, even European production in the North Sea, Russia and Norway.
It states that America was in the mid-seventies.
It abolished the gold cover that the American currency had.
This is not correct.
What is the correct primary medicine?
The OPEC organization includes
Four Gulf countries
Qatar, Kuwait, the UAE and Saudi Arabia
Today OPEC's share of the global market
Forty percent

Today's market share does not exceed forty percent.

And this one can't be the owner of the 40 percent.
You cannot do it yourself
In countries that have tried but
An attempt that is not my real, real right.
You are refusing because of your ties with America.
From Aldora to other work
All oil-exporting countries
How many barrels of oil are imported per day?
They are the loss of what is not yet issued.
His currency has risen very high.
He sells his oil in dollars.
So the importer either receives it at the port, takes his money in dollars, and then converts it to his local currency.
His currency is not tied to the dollar.
It’s true, but he is
But your problem is also that you sell in dollars and your currency is not linked to the dollar, you have no problem.
This is my important question now
What is the concern and the impact caused by the fact that your currency is linked to the dollar in light of the dollar's decline?
has been associated for many years
Especially in the 1970s, when the dollar was a very strong currency and a currency meant a great deal of power.
This separation is not that easy.
The paint is easy
No, no, not here.
Divorce has costs
It serves the interests of these countries and is not against them.
Profit and loss
Dugens announced in yesterday's publication that there are four countries, one of which is Qatar.
But there is also a report by the Gulf Finance House that says there are four Gulf countries because, of course, Oman has withdrawn from the unified Gulf currency.
I read the statement in the dungeons and I don’t think it’s a real statement.
The director of the Qatari Central Bank has issued a denial.
He said yes and said that he would do a study, but all Gulf countries must also do so.
You need to study profit and loss in a way, as I said, in a careful way without emotions.
Let’s leave it to the study and wait until they come.
I will bring you economists later who will tell you that there is another study.
This study reflects
Lobal House is very simple and very neat, and they issued a report on March 8th.
Apple only four days
Global House Al: The solution is simple and requires a political decision.
The political decision is summed up in two facts.
There is no third option, the first need is
Kuwait and the other five countries announced their intention in 2010 to issue or study the issuance of a unified Gulf currency.
The second point is to issue a decision to disengage from the dollar.
First, with regard to the unified currency
In my personal opinion
To see the unified Gulf currency
Currency The currency when this currency will be strong
You will be You will be
It is probably one of the strongest currencies in the world, as they say.
and the reserves behind it, and the huge revenues behind it.
This is what His Excellency the Prime Minister focused on when he said
That is why the Gulf states cannot act alone.
But with a stronger economic content
And today's economic bloc, even the euro, we see it today.
But you must not forget that the central bank has a very important role to play.
Evaluation
And and and profit and loss calculation
Out of all this news
Tense situation
Global House observers say that inflation will continue in 2008.
For a long time in the Gulf countries, but the solution is in the hands of the governments.
Some countries have raised salaries by up to seventy percent, such as the UAE.
In order to stop the inflation process
And this is my question now: when will you increase the salaries of the poor people in Qatar?
And I will hear your answer after a short break.
The topic of today's episode is oil reserves and daily production in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
It has a reserve of two hundred and sixty-four billion.
Two out of ten barrels
It broadcasts nine and two tenths hours daily.
Kuwait's population is one and a half million, and it has a deficit of two billion and seven tenths of a million.
Qatar: fifteen trillion and two hundred and ten billion, two hundred and eighty-nine thousand and fifty. Oman: five trillion and six hundred billion, seven hundred and seven thousand.
Bahrain has a population of 25 million and 35 thousand people.
The total revenue for the year was thirty-eight billion.
From 2003 to 2007
One hundred billion in Europe
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion
in Asia and other countries
But the GDP of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries was seven hundred and seventeen billion in 2006.
The total output in 2007 was seven hundred ninety-nine and seven tenths billion, which is expected.
In 2008, 9.912 billion
But inflation is eating away at the salaries of employees and workers who live in this area.
It will increase in 2008 to 38.3 percent.
Kuwait's forecast for 2008 is fourteen point nine percent, and for the UAE it is nine point eight percent.
It will become ten, but Saudi Arabia was six and a half and will reach six.
Eight out of ten
Salaries are being devoured
So what are the amounts and percentages by which you will increase the salaries of the poor employees here?
If we want to address the problem
B Real treatment
Salaries are always Salary increases are always
It is not the solution
I am not against increasing salaries.
That’s right, this is not right.
We are always
Of course there is faith.
The issue of increased inflation and the inability to control it will cause inflation to consume all these increases.
A weak high committee that includes all experts and specialists was established to address inflation.
And now this committee is putting
Because salaries are increasing in the world.
And the golden rule of economics says of course.
It will have no end.
And whatever
Salaries have increased, and no matter how much they increase
Inflation will increase
It must be treated and it must be
A scientific study conducted by Bayt.com, a recruitment specialist, in collaboration with the British YouGov Siraj Institute, means that
They surveyed 15,000 employees working in the Gulf countries in twenty important sectors.
especially experts and those who have jobs, there is no job satisfaction.
Inflation has become devouring
especially those with experience
They are thinking of moving away from these countries where inflation is eating them up.
You are going to lose now.
This is a simple idea, and you put forward a simple idea and try to implement it.
The inflation rate is an increase in wages.
There is parallelism in the subject.
Available and
We are keen, and the state and the government are very keen.
This problem should be addressed with a real solution.
Temporary solutions do not always solve the problem, but rather increase it.
It means you increase it.
We hope that there will be more time for this committee to do so.
All its applications
Here is a dog and you are looking for the deputy.
Boredom will always be
He will, but the state also tried and raised the increases by forty percent.
Here is a very important point about the increases.
You are only increasing the salaries of Qataris when it comes to salary increases, as if non-Qataris are working for Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
You care about Qataris, but you don’t care about expatriates.
which is a high percentage in it
Hey Ahmed, you live in Qatar, not in Germany.
You talk about this topic and suffer.
Salaries are much higher than in the public sector.
And vice versa, we saw
the public sector
On the contrary, the government sector has become
Keep the best elements and competencies.
I also read a report and we know that the oil sector is in Q.
For employment
We are like experts when we succeed.
Engineers and workers who come from outside Qatar
And because we also interact with the global market.
All of these things have a percentage increase in salaries.
And hope is with God Almighty, but we say
The government has a plan there.
I say that controlling inflation is more important.
Temporary treatment
We will see, and I am sure.
There will be
Positive results
It will be around fifteen percent.
Al-Helou says that he told you that there are 5.22 billion barrels of oil and 5.43 billion barrels of gas.
No comment. We are the client, not his client.
It’s a process, and of course we are
The discussion about economic growth also means that it must have an impact on people.
And any economic growth today is reflected, of course. Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world.
And vice versa
The huge belts in the country are also part of it.
If it weren't for these huge belts and huge projects
The country also had a part in the inflation.
He also played a part in the inflation.
This also led to an increase in liquidity in the market.
First, regarding the link between the dollar and oil
Oil mortgaged in exchange for protection from
in the United States of America, and therefore this stability in governance is something that means
Thank you
Saad Al-Ghamdi from Saudi Arabia, Saad, your question is
Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God and His blessings.
The truth is that the episode was successful and the title was good.
What I want to say is that the region is now under the current American policy.
America's current war policy, in addition to its cultural war against Islam, is a global economic war.
In today's China
The US deficit with Japan also reached sixty-one billion dollars.
And Japan also invested in the year 2000.
With America, that is equivalent to nine.
a billion dollars, while now it is investing more than twenty-seven billion dollars with the European Union.
in keeping up with American politics and in making the dollar a currency that is inevitable for the whole world
My brother, I say that you should buy now.
The Gulf region will become
I mean, like, like, like, everywhere.
Thank you, brother Saad.
Mohamed Al-Waseef from Egypt
Hello, I am the deputy's assistant.
The deputy’s attempt reminds me of the Arab rulers in the Middle East.
When there is
When there are bottlenecks or demands for price adjustments
Salary adjustment Adjusting salaries in relation to prices, as you have mentioned.
In Qatar, we consider you to be a model, so you should take that into account.
And I am determined not to preach about this increase. This is an Arabic style.
We want this Qatar, which we consider to be Abu Adrika.
He has the right to say what he wants. Do you have a question? Do you have a question? He has the right, of course, he is responsible for this policy.
Question 1
The deputy of Siah must take this into consideration.
One, two, he should interact with public opinion.
With the poor, as you said, because they are the people who deserve to be taken care of.
Arab rulers who don't care about the poor
Hello, peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you.
I would like to greet you two and greet Al-Uqayl.
I also want a salary increase.
The salaries are excellent, good, okay, fine.
May God bless you. As for the topic, we need to work on its meaning in relation to us.
With the poor people, and God willing, there will always be no poor people in Qatar, and we are sure of that.
The ruling makes Qatar, as he said, look like a place where money goes to the ruling family and the ruler.
That is the important question now.
Let’s respond to the brothers.
He cannot rule
What happens to that wealth?
Now there are whole new cities, almost like the Pearl, Lusail and other places. That means even Qatar has started to expand.
It’s not the issue, it’s the issue.
A harmonious urban plan
In short, because there are two minutes left, we said what Qatar will be entitled to.
Qatar is now there, Qatar after oil and gas.
There is, of course, a clear state policy.
Because it is not
Depleting asset
Because it is a renewable wealth.
So today the trend is in the State of Qatar.
The capital of the Middle East in education
Today we will see the cultural city, the educational city.
Today, this educational city includes the best universities in the world.
Establish medical cities, media cities and financial cities
Because today it is oil and gas.
No, of course not, we don’t imitate anyone.
Other satellite channels and
It’s not just the island, you’re going to make a hundred islands and you can’t stand the island.
Because, brother, these are our countries in the Gulf now.
The boom in the 70s, now everyone remembers the boom of the 70s.
Today, when we look at the growth we see in Qatar today
And this also calls for a special episode about Qatar after oil.
Our vision of oil, its future and its wealth in the region, especially in Qatar. In conclusion, I convey to you the greetings of the program team.
This is Ahmed Mansour greeting you in 'Without Borders'. Peace, God’s mercy and blessings be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God and His blessings.
I greet you live this week from the Qatari capital, Doha.
Welcome to a new episode of the program Without Borders.
At a time when Qatar hosts the largest American military base outside the United States, namely Al-Udeid Air Base.
With the enemies of the United States in the region
like Iran and Syria
Its doors are open to leaders
Indeed, Hamas leaders have excellent relations with the Qatari leadership.
He was also the only Arab leader, the Emir of Qatar.
Who visited the southern suburb of Beirut, which was destroyed by Israel during its war on Lebanon in the summer of 2006.
It remains an unlimited supporter of the reconstruction of what Israel has destroyed in Lebanon.
At the time when Qatar reconciled, at the time when Qatar reconciled
With its big sister, Saudi Arabia, about two years ago
At the same time, skirmishes with the regime in Egypt
Like the case of Lebanon, where I succeeded where others failed.
He brought together Lebanese leaders in Doha, where they signed an agreement that led them safely.
to the last election
It also has files that are difficult to access.
who wanted to be the driving force behind these files, not Qatar.
The smallest Arab countries
And in today's episode
We are trying to understand the principles and rules that govern Qatar's foreign policy.
And for whose benefit?
The geographically and demographically small Qatar plays these major roles.
What qualifications does she have that enable her
in a live interview with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of Qatar.
For viewers who wish to participate, they can call the program's phone numbers that will appear on the screen one after another.
The visit made by the Emir of Qatar
Al Jazeera's artillery roars in a bid to improve relations with Saudi Arabia
A Saudi coup attempt against the Emir of Qatar in cooperation with members of the Al Murrah tribe in the past.
In its issue published on June 20th
What is the nature of the secret deal?
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Many of the things that
I don't think it's accurate.
The truth is that in more than one interview here on this program, I always said
We consider it to be the backbone.
the Gulf Cooperation Council
There was a misunderstanding.
Then
And a difference of opinion
I settled the border issue correctly, and that was a big obstacle.
The historical Saudi-Qatari relations are unique relations.
If we look at these relationships
Between the two families and the two countries
There were some misunderstandings among them.
Neither by us nor by them
Because there are no conditions between brothers.
And now the relations are in a situation that I can describe as very excellent.
In the interest of the Cooperation Council
But how was Al Jazeera's situation resolved with Saudi Arabia? It was the obstacle or the reason that led to it in the year 2002.
At an important point
And I repeat to you, if you go back to all the programs, I always said
Not only the big sister, but I would say that we rely on each other in the Cooperation Council.
He said that Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
And we give importance to our relations with it.
There was a media exchange, and this was clear to both parties.
These countries found themselves
It was a failure when the brothers agreed.
The Qatari-Saudi private house
Rather, they found that most of them got into a dispute.
They have neither a she-camel nor a camel in it.
And I don’t think it was a strategy by anyone who got involved in this dispute.
But Sheikh, allow me, allow me here in this context, so that things are clear and the dots are on the letters.
Many observers believe that Al Jazeera has been doing so for the past two years.
At a time when the conditions that were criticized on Al Jazeera still exist
due to the situation inside Saudi Arabia
Whether it is detainees, opponents or others, the list is still there.
Al Jazeera has stopped covering these issues.
until Al Jazeera's coverage of the Hajj changed
into praise for the system and what the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is doing at a time when it is contrary
First, I think you should ask Al Jazeera management about this topic, not me.
The two countries are united
Regional stability
This strategy has continued and strengthened, first of all, the stability of the region.
The region means the Gulf region.
Gulf region
There are many issues surrounding the Gulf region.
Also, the call of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Kuwait
It had an impact on all the listeners and on the entire Arab world.
He spoke from the heart about settling, overcoming and burying Arab differences.
It is not only a matter of opinion
No, it’s politics, and politics is a matter of opinion.
The Arab world believes that this is
A type of war
while in the developed world
You're talking about the same interest.
You have been there for several years now.
The current situation The current situation
Look first
In a complete difference between this topic and that topic
The idea that a small country is hitting the big ones and making them feel weak in front of it.
Any dispute or misunderstanding
He had his reasons.
And its reasons ended.
It ended with the judgment of the two leaders.
Are there guarantees for the future relationship?
There are guarantees between the two parties.
Based on the love, brotherhood and interests that unite the two countries
And the words of the leaders are considered more than a document.
A relationship between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
We hope that this Qatari-Saudi relationship will develop a lot.
for the better and there will be large areas
This relationship is similar to the model we have with other Arab countries, other Gulf countries.
As for Qatar, it is an important country.
Okay, Saudi Arabia is an important country.
What is Egypt to Qatar? Even now, it has been noticed that you reconciled with Saudi Arabia at the same time.
and three organizations, Hezbollah
It is Al Jazeera channel.
or the system in Egypt, the largest Arab country.
First, let me start with the following beginning.
the Egyptian people
We respect the Egyptian nation.
and her interest
Many Arab issues and the sacrifices of the Egyptian people
And this is the case
Some people think that this is an issue that we want to use as a way to reach an understanding or a lack of understanding with the brothers in Egypt.
And in this context, when you say that we respect Egypt and the Egyptian people,
We believe that he is a good person.
Our disagreement with Egypt is on two points.
He point
We were accused of having prepared the coup in Gaza, which I don’t believe.
We don’t go in.
in cases concerning other States
It does not believe in interfering in the affairs of any country unless there is room for reform.
So did you have any involvement in the coup that Hamas carried out against the authority in Gaza?
Of course not, we didn’t know about it until we heard about it in the media, just like everyone else.
Yes, we have relations with Hamas and we have relations with all parties.
What made Egypt different or what was the point of disagreement between you and them?
I’m coming to him.
Hezbollah conspiracy
Hezbollah conspiracy and also
But I'm talking about my country.
We were very surprised by this topic.
If it shakes in favor of Qatar
Al-Ahram Al-A
Ahram said it delivered
to undermine Egypt and its position
I can answer.
Let’s go back to the conspiracy they talked about.
The days will reveal this issue.
It didn’t start with the Gaza conference
And I justify it by absolving the Egyptian people of it. I absolve President Hosni Mubarak of it.
If we go back a long way to the MENA conference
After the Madrid conference, Al-Mina remembers the one held in Doha.
This was the agreement when the conference was held by us.
They said that we don’t want to hold the conference anymore.
Hey guys, we know you have coordination with Israel.
I’m from Qatar and this is it.
What we want to understand is what
We sat down and started talking, and the conversation was always good.
It has two parts
What are they
In a dispute
Political orientation
If we came to the Gaza conference that happened
His Highness the Prince spoke with all the presidents, including his brother, His Excellency President Hosni Mubarak.
We received this from a foreign country.
The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has a point of view on this issue, which is that what complicates it
They kill people and we just watch.
If you do not want to meet in Doha, we can hold it anywhere in the Arab League.
It is shameful that I have to discuss this issue on the sidelines of the Kuwait conference.
It is being done by Israel, and the Western world is standing by and watching.
When we came, we said, "Okay, this is going on now, and there is nothing we can do. We Arabs cannot stop it. No major country has stopped this fighting."
Egypt's announcement of a request to stop the fighting in Gaza was followed an hour later by a ceasefire.
So we too
We should not take the Arab street for granted. Our disagreement with the Muslim Brotherhood is on one point only.
And this is in international customs.
My hospitals are not enough, doctors are standing at the borders.
You stopped at the border.
There, and no one was allowed to enter.
The Muslim Brotherhood was very sensitive about this issue.
The reason for the sensitivity is that Gaza is adjacent to Egypt and is considered part of national property.
When we talk about any humanitarian issue anywhere in the world, we are talking about a humanitarian issue.
And we respect Egypt's sovereignty.
We know the position, but this does not affect the Egyptian position.
We have high hopes for Egypt.
It is the largest Arab country.
And we believe that it can deliver our voice and the voices of others in the Arab world.
all other parties
So even the rescue operation after the jump was fake.
which the Europeans tried to save
What happened in Gaza at the conference
Whether it is a donor conference or not, I consider it a rescue for the government.
We were not invited to a conference, we were invited to coordinate between the GCC countries.
We met at the Cooperation Council.
These amounts will not be paid to any party.
But it will spend
For those affected in Gaza
directly and that was
Because entry is prohibited from all sides.
I am happy for Egypt, and all the people of Qatar are happy for Egypt because of Egypt.
Egypt’s victory in political matters is important to us.
But you are anticipating.
Just give me, just give me two minutes.
One minister boasted of what had been saved, saying:
Whoever tries to outbid Egypt here, we will break his neck and break his arm.
I think this official has done a disservice to his country.
No, they didn’t fail, and if we’re being honest, they could only talk about themselves.
What helped them in this, and I said this to our Saudi brothers, is that the Saudis intervened because the king has wisdom in this matter.
If things go wrong in the Arab world
We agree.
The king decides that this is in the best interest.
We accept King Abdullah's decision because we respect him and trust him.
But if someone says we stopped them, it would be an insult to those who stopped them.
As if they were students in a school.
I mean, I think so.
The intensity has arrived.
It is believed that Ahwa should impose his power.
We are sorry, we are sorry about this issue.
If they think that a small country has no right, then that right is taken away from it.
You came in and stuck your nose in Darfur.
An Arab decision at the Arab League
An African and a UN resolution
I think the main problem is
The Hezbollah conspiracy also involves Qatar.
A conspiracy, I don't know what about Qatar.
I mean, if it happens, even if swine flu starts somewhere, it could be caused by Qatar, which could be spreading the epidemic.
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and its capabilities.
But Qatar has a point of view.
Qatar has a separate policy.
If Qatar can resolve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor for us.
Because there is no Arab dispute
We believe that any Arab conflict weakens our position in relation to our main issues, which are Palestine and the other issues we face.
The Arab world has become a mere recipient.
Even our analyses have become the same as yours.
Western analysis
While we are here, we know what happened in Pakistan.
But I swear I want someone to receive me and roll out the red carpet for me in Washington.
Does anyone blame Qatar?
Has Qatar done anything to harm any Arab country?
I tried to contribute money.
These contributions are provocative.
What if I say hello to you and you say that I'm saying hello to you just to annoy you?
This is a second case, which means you have a problem or you have a deficiency.
This is your issue, not mine.
But if you have an internal problem
We always tell him
especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah
I am in Kuwait and I know this man, he is honest.
A man who says what he thinks is what he is.
In his heart, la la la la, this is la la, I always say this.
I always say this.
I always say that even at the height of our dispute with Saudi Arabia, I used to say this.
Go back and check all the documents you have on the island.
The case is different.
Unilaterally, we said that we have had enough and that we will take this position.
We tried as much as possible
I don't want to get into this topic.
They will see their affairs, they will see their mistakes, where they are.
Let’s look at our mistakes, it doesn’t mean that everything we have is right.
His Excellency the Sheikh
to the existence of internal problems in Egypt
They want to get out of it.
Deny any connection between Qatar and any form of external conspiracy against Egypt, and sever its relations with Turkey or other countries.
We really have a superpower, by God.
And, God willing, there are seventy million of us. If we are able, we can reach eighty.
They also have a problem that they need to address.
You played a role in the Qandil Shalit case despite knowing that this file is an important file for the Egyptian government.
I worked with the French.
We received a call from a friendly country.
In the case of Beneshova, we said, "Brothers, this is with the Egyptians," and they said
We want to see this issue in a request.
It was done by Israel and another country. We need to see what a second party thinks about this issue.
When we saw this issue, we told them, "Brother, if it's the same conditions that you're talking about with the brothers in Egypt..."
And this is what we announced, meaning that one official said that we, in a sense, made fun of the entire Arab League.
Oh God, this means that he is a poor man.
How did he get away with it?
President Mahmoud Abbas remains
And we supported this.
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is on your side.
I think I think this is a healthy phenomenon.
I am not the owner of the island, as I was accused.
And Al Jazeera must enter the media competition, just like in the West where there are many media outlets.
There are many media outlets where, during adolescence, everyone curses at each other.
But after a while, they reach a stage of maturity.
It is possible, it is possible, and it is not possible.
First of all, we are with Saudi Arabia, and our situation is different.
And even if we give in to Saudi Arabia, we accept this in Qatar.
Important relationships
And Egypt is an important country, but there is a special nature to Saudi-Egyptian relations.
And also, Egypt has a special relationship with any Arab country. Egypt is the largest and greatest country.
This is true. This is true, but with Saudi Arabia there is a history and a different relationship.
It is a personal conflict between officials here and there.
We respect the Egyptian President.
I hope it is limited to a difference in policies and points of view.
I told you it was a problem when Gaza was attacked.
The second problem is that they are allergic to anything Qatar does or anything like that, and we haven’t yet discovered the reason for this allergy.
Why don’t you try to arrange a meeting now between the prince and the Egyptian president?
Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has intervened in this matter.
As it was leaked to the newspapers, they said it was a secret meeting first, then we found out about it the next day.
I had a meeting with Omar Suleiman.
in Saudi Arabia
Irreversible separation
I can’t tell you that we agreed on everything.
Let’s say that so that no one interprets it as you comparing yourselves.
But dignity is dignity for both young and old.
The minister said that if Egypt received the appropriate compensation,
Reconciliation between children
I don’t think this is Egypt. Egypt is bigger than this. I think he misspoke.
Do you have a vision for solving problems with Egypt, or are you like the Egyptian people, waiting for divine intervention?
This is it. Please, I don’t want to talk about divine intervention or anything else, because God knows who lives and who dies.
And here I am calling
He made them believe that there would be a way.
And we are proud of Egypt
There must be a certain way in Ban.
Either you stop with me or you stop against me.
Why would any Arab citizen feel pain?
We are suffering for the Arab world, and this is His Highness the Prince's policy.
States derive their power from sources of power.
The United States has sources of power, China has sources of power, France has sources of power, and a small country like Qatar has sources of power.
I believe in God.
which is clearly not the case
All of this is nonsense, you keep doing it.
But we are a small country, and I respect that.
And I repeat it a hundred times.
So that no one says we are sensitive.
No one among us will confiscate it.
You are now tickling Israel.
Eat before I go to Israel.
What is your vision for solving the problem with Egypt?
The problem is that they weren’t the first either.
And every day they file a complaint against America. If I tell you about the great countries you are talking about.
They deal with us out of interest, and we deal with them out of interest.
All complaints and all
In order to sabotage the relationship
I think it diminishes any great nation that does that.
It also diminishes our Arab pride when we go running to complain about each other.
Everything comes and everything we know
Our vision is to be based on the Arab interest.
And we are with them in anything.
Are there any next steps to repair relations?
But I know that there are close relations between the president and His Highness the Prince.
If one of them moved anything
Anyone who opposes rapprochement between the two countries and their leaders will find themselves at a loss, because in the end...
No, maybe tomorrow, maybe after ten years. I don’t know, really. From our side, we always attend any conference we are invited to.
Anyone who invites us to a conference, we will attend, and if we have an opinion, we will express it at the conference.
What we can do is
Because Egypt is our big sister in any matter, but we have a point of view and we discuss it.
That’s all that’s required. When the time comes, we will of course be happy about this matter.
It was canceled due to this policy.
And, as I said, we respect the Egyptian people.
Of course, canceling a contract and adding a contract, you are asking how many cancellations there were. Ask how many Egyptians came to Qatar at the same time.
But it is a state policy. As I told you, the Egyptian people are very close to us in Qatar and to our hearts.
On June 4th, you stirred the emotions of the Arab people by closing the Israeli office. On June 4th, Arutz Sheva published it.
Why do you say we tickled them? If we wanted to tickle them, we would have closed it twelve years ago.
When Shannen was there, when everyone was Shannen, it was a campaign before they made peace with Israel and before secret meetings took place between some Arab countries and Israel.
And after, and after, and after, and after most Arabs reconciled.
Whether under the table or above the table, with Israel or talking to her in any capacity
If we wanted to play on emotions, we would have done so at the previous Islamic conference.
At the United Nations, Nasser's supporter held a banquet at the residence of the Israeli ambassador, Bilakji.
Yes, he was one of many guests who attended a banquet, but I don’t know what occasion the ambassador held it for.
Because we sit next to Israel at the United Nations, so no one can deny this.
Or we have found a glimmer of hope in alleviating the suffering of our brothers in Palestine.
The administration has changed now. The thing is that Egypt was a small issue for me, but unfortunately...
I didn’t raise him, you raised him.
My question is about the United States and the new administration and how this will affect your relationship as Qataris with the United States, given that the largest military base is in Qatar.
In a disagreement of views
A road to solving many issues in the region
And if they are all serious, we will help them to the fullest extent.
You expect a special relationship or a solution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these issues have been resolved.
Yesterday, the Emir of Qatar spoke in Paris about what is happening in Iran.
And Iran has a special relationship with you, despite its bad relations with the United States.
First, we must put it in the context of internal affairs, because we must respect every country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said in this program that the Doha agreement would end with the elections taking place.
Is this your vision too, or do you think the agreement is in place or will you have to make a new one?
The Doha agreement was intended to lead them to peaceful elections.
A year and a half has passed since the last year, and a little more than a year has passed since the Doha elections.
We were following them day by day and moment by moment until they reached the elections according to the Doha agreement.
We have recently intervened in one of the electoral districts to correct some misunderstandings that occurred.
But you still have a role to play in sorting things out in Lebanon.
We are always close to Lebanon. You know that the Qataris love Lebanon and go to Lebanon.
I mean, the first country I visited after a Western country was Lebanon.
A quick question about what is happening in Yemen.
You have interfered in the Houthi issue and there are accusations that you have supported the Houthis.
Or at least your intervention made them equal to the state. Now there is a greater danger, and that is the danger from the south.
And we suffered what we suffered. This is the same question: why did you stop here and why did you stop here in Qatar?
We were indeed under a lot of pressure on this issue, but this was our vision and this was His Highness the Prince’s position on this issue.
The Houthi issue
Its stability has a positive impact on us, and its instability has a negative impact on us.
Our intervention was a neutral one between the two parties, by Bo Bo.
We have signed an agreement.
But I understand that if this is to be exploited for other reasons
And I would be with them there, and we always stood with them on every issue.
It is baseless and has no basis in truth.
I think we don't need to.
We sell it.
And I say this without regret. I know that many Arab audiences will be against me.
I also thank you, dear viewers, and hope that you have followed us well and that we have explained to you some of Qatar's foreign policy.
In conclusion, I convey to you the greetings of the programme team and this is Ahmed Mansour greeting you without borders.
Peace be upon you and God’s mercy and blessings.
Dear viewers, peace be upon you. Welcome to this special interview.
Bin Jassim bin Jabor Al Thani, Prime Minister, Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar
Of course, why do I say it is a special and exceptional interview?
Qatar and this man in particular were the main sponsors.
Sir, a simple and direct question.
I think it happened because there was an Arab consensus at the beginning.
And we tried that when we went to the United Nations.
The Arab consensus was important, and the Lebanese terrorism from both sides was important.
on achieving results
It is very important that there is no external interference.
Many opinions or many suggestions from outside
Lebanese Arab International If you want to say
But it meant going through stages.
There is nothing that doesn’t have something that doesn’t mean that these stages existed.
Does this mean that there are complications in Lebanon?
A while ago, actually.
I mean, now that you have listened and have directly entered the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file
Have you discovered that the Lebanese knot is a major knot?
Lebanese, Arabic, regional, and international issues require significant decoding.
Or is it a very small, simple contract, but it was exaggerated by external intervention?
Because we know that Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, a beacon for many things.
The Lebanese must not allow
It affects peace and security in Lebanon.
Problem number one
External repercussions on Lebanon
You suddenly decided, after 24 hours, to take everyone on one plane.
Directly from the plane to meet the Emir of Qatar
They didn’t even expect it, meaning they couldn’t rest for a single minute except for what you are doing for them.
The secret is that we don’t let them rest and think too much.
They make a lot of calls, that was the secret.
We are proposing the idea of moving them to Doha because we need a climate.
She will bring them together in many different difficulties.
In many cases
So we brought them out under these conditions, because you came to solve the problem.
If we want to succeed, we must get them out of this environment.
And quickly
Oh God, God, help us with the statement, the Phoenician statement or the Beirut statement.
Then we agreed that the most important thing was that they all agreed to go to Doha.
Both parties decided to go to Doha.
Some people think that Qatar, for example, is biased towards one side against another.
But from Beirut
His Highness’s policy means that we are mediators.
in this operation
Speak very frankly, the state of the sheikh.
Did you consult seriously?
With the two main parties involved in what is happening here in Lebanon, namely Saudi Arabia and Syria.
Especially the brothers in Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
He expressed his support for the idea.
That means we benefited from Prince Saud, that we
Everyone wanted a solution.
His justifications are weak.
If you go, if I go to the mind
His arguments are weak.
It had to be removed because there is tension between me and Palestine.
There is the issue of the Iranian nuclear program.
This means that the Arab League must have a mechanism to resolve issues.
This means that the African Union is better than us at solving problems.
He is trying to bring the parties together.
He organizes conferences to solve the problems of the Arabs, who have been united for years but are unable to do so.
to gather the Arabs or to gather the parties if there are any, or to intervene to help the oppressed.
must be studied
If we want to have an awakening of the Arab League, not the Arab world, the university
The Arabic language is an instrument of implementation with him.
One of the officials here was President Nabih Berri.
It requires Sin Sin
So it turns out that the Lebanese have agreed.
And God, you see, we
First of all, Qatar
It has never led to any result.
For the Arab interest
It is a power for the Arabs.
We tried it in several ways
At the United Nations, when we went to the Doha Agreement.
The agenda is to solve the problem, not another agenda.
There is no doubt that
And the most important role they play in the Arab world as a whole, in particular
in a situation
Let’s stop it by agreement.
Others, come and help us.
Because this is a serious matter, and this is a serious matter.
Why have we reached a point where everyone is playing in our field?
In our yard
It is very important that we overcome the interests of our people and the people.
Now we need an Arab summit after this agreement to see what we will do among the Palestinian brothers.
What are we going to do in Somalia?
What are we going to do in Somalia, which is not a member of the Arab League?
Why is it that when we try to... Sudan is not a member of the Arab League, Iraq is not a member of the Arab League.
We are part of the Arab world and a small part of the Arab world.
We hope that this is not a suggestion, but an idea.
Can Qatar have good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia?
I think that first of all, if we are asked to do something, we do what we can.
But I am sure that His Majesty King Abdullah
King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
and his brother, President Bashar
Because historically, Saudi Arabia and Syria had an agreement.
It can be a transitional stage
We will find her later, God willing.
However, I insist on asking, if you don’t mind, whether you can play a role in this regard.
Even if it’s not publicly, you now have some kind of confidence.
We strive for any rapprochement between Arab countries.
This is His Highness’s policy from the beginning, but this is what this issue means.
Can what happened in Lebanon indicate that the region is heading towards serious settlements?
But what happened in Lebanon was a local Lebanese affair. The region’s issues still remain.
I'm not very attached to this situation.
I hope the opposite. I hope that this
A new situation in the Arab world, this is a wish, a bad start.
We can create
It will happen somewhere else.
In other words, Sheikh, do you fear that the escalation that existed some time ago will continue?
at least from now until the end of President George Bush's term
There is no doubt that I still have concerns, whether it is about Palestine, or Gaza now.
I mean, I just want to ask.
We don’t want anything else.
He orders me to pay attention to this humanitarian aspect in Palestine.
We can deliver medicine to them.
and food
Electricity for the patient in the hospital
If the electricity is cut off, he will die.
I mean, I wish
As the League of Arab States, we agree on an amount for this issue, which we call medicine and food.
We don’t want the Red Crescent to reach him, brother.
Let the Red Cross reach him.
But sorry, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli blockade.
I don’t want to go into the details of this issue. I’m just saying that as Arabs we must deliver medicine and food even if we disagree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made an effort and pledged to protect the Holy Kaaba.
Because this is a conflict that will only benefit the other party.
Do not deal with this party because we will solve this for you. This is not true.
And I
So far, I don't see any signs of a solution in front of me.
Do you fear a US-Iranian confrontation in the coming period, or do you welcome it?
This is possible, of course we are.
At least talk about the State of Qatar.
Iran is an important neighbor to us.
We may not agree on all their policies, or they may not agree on all of Qatar’s policies.
That means, for example, they tell us that they do not want us to have relations with Israel or to contact them.
Perhaps some people consider you to be necessarily a party to this because of the American bases there.
We know how to deal with this issue.
Some said that after the Emir of Qatar's visit to Saudi Arabia
as if he had met, consulted or spoken with the Saudi family
Negotiations between Syria and Israel in Istanbul
And I can say that it was purely by chance.
The second topic is that the Kingdom was keen to find a solution, and I was in contact with Prince Saud.
What happened in the last few hours
Change the tactic Change the negotiation tactic
Is it from you or from the parties?
We are responsible for this as officials.
And I took you from all sides and locked us in the room.
And finally we found ourselves, and then His Highness the Emir intervened, which was important.
And from there the invention proceeded.
Without mentioning it now, it’s over.
It was a clear message when he said, "We know our size, our location, our role, etc." as if
He wanted to play the role of Menon without provoking any other party.
Whether it is Arab, regional or international
But still
became responsible
Whether you like it or not
Some jealousy is good. We want to avoid jealousy because we are a nation.
These countries
You can work or
I think this is going to be the most comfortable combination.
Perhaps a last or penultimate question: What is your relationship with Washington now? Is it a distant, extended, or special relationship?
So our relationship with Washington is a good one, let me say.
It is not without its different perspectives on issues.
But this is our right, and if they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How good is it, I mean, how do you translate it on the ground as a good relationship with you?
This means that if you talk about the economy, it is excellent, and if you talk about education, it is excellent.
If you are talking about health, if you are talking about politics, I can tell you that it is fine.
In your opinion, clearly, in the next stage
In my opinion, we should leave the issue of confronting Israel alone.
And if we want to stop the field, we play in the Arab field.
We are mending relations between the Palestinians.
We agree on an opinion so that we can be a respected force.
I don’t think we have it here.
That we become something effective
Thank you, dear viewers, for your good follow-up, and we will meet again, God willing, with my appreciation for you.
Welcome viewers to this interview with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.
In this conversation
We are trying to anticipate the Arab political reality and Arab efforts.
Welcome, dear Sheikh Saada.
To discuss what is happening in Gaza
I hope that through this dialogue we will be able
Shedding light on some of your questions
The entry of Israelis into Gaza in the manner that they did, by land.
Our goal was to have an Arab position.
Her dealings with friendly countries
and brotherly States
And how to try to find a clear and strong Arab position that the Arab countries
And then we find areas for reconciliation.
We know that more than one Arab country has been violated by us.
in an arbitrary manner
And no one has been held accountable.
We find that we are held accountable for everything, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
We are the specialists
We are the only people in the world who are always targeted.
We always discipline with style.
I think
To the extent that we will not be able
We must come together at the leadership level.
Stop the disciplinary attack, we are the people
We did not want to create a rift in the Arab world.
There were five other verbal approvals.
By a two-thirds majority
But the purpose of the meeting is not
We hope that it is correct and that our view is wrong, because the goal is
Solving the problem now is not the goal of holding a summit.
But is it going to be resolved at the expense of Palestinian blood?
What we have now requested at the ministerial level does not cancel Qatar's request.
This was also confirmed by His Highness.
In his speech, he said that we are not insisting that the summit be held in Qatar if it is embarrassing to do so. We are not insisting that it be held in Qatar; the summit can be held wherever it is.
An Arab position that earns us the respect of others
Yes, but what about the ministerial?
So we want to tell them that the Security Council resolution has been issued.
and Israel
She was not concerned about the decision and continued and still continues to kill and bomb Gaza.
And we need to ask the Arabs what we are going to do.
What are we going to do?
What happens after Israel ends?
Does the remainder of the Security Council resolution apply?
or was there a position since Israel did not stop
Shooting is not to force our brothers
A decision that considers that it is
A few days ago
We will talk about the ministerial meeting.
You ultimately support this argument.
We support an Arab summit, of course, and this is our idea and the idea of several other Arab countries that have also called for a summit, Syria and Yemen.
There is already a crack in the Arab world.
He moved Afrouzna from the camp to Etedal.
And the camp of extremism
What do they mean by "immoderation"?
The West has chosen us
The Arabs who are called moderates and the Arabs who are not moderates
We find that there is a moderate nation and a non-moderate nation.
And then we want to know what moderation and extremism are. Is moderation walking according to Israel's plans?
And end the case in a humiliating way.
Or maybe we just need to keep the issue alive.
This is an important question.
The topic is whether countries exist.
You follow Israel's plans and want to solve problems in certain ways.
I am not saying that it is following Israel's plans, and I do not want to accuse anyone.
But I say
If we call it a moderate camp
What is moderation in the eyes of the West?
Do we agree to the slaughter of a certain group of Palestinians?
Of course, there were elections.
I am neither a supporter nor an opponent of Hamas, but I am talking about reality.
The reality is that there is
The idea
Some of those who are called the radical movement
But we have to ask ourselves what this radical movement is demanding.
Is she asking for something that is not her right, or is she asking for her right?
Or should we sort them out?
And we also create other blocks.
Because we are against it.
Internal Arab intellectual
And this has started to happen.
Therefore, we do not want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, Your Excellency Sheikh, in brief.
Who prevented the Arab summit from being held?
I can’t say it’s forbidden, there are different opinions and everyone knows the topic.
Subject of the ban
But, as I said, we could have
We will take a vote and get two-thirds.
But that was the goal, because it's not a question of challenge, it's a question of urgent need, and we believe that.
Others thought it was not urgent.
Okay, we went to the Security Council.
or in a Security Council resolution
But the decision is up to the Security Council. Israel said it would continue and then look into the matter.
All I want to focus on again is
We are probably too keen to apply the decision to the weaker party.
How will it differ from the first meeting?
The subject of quarrels usually means that there are differences of opinion.
As important as it is
Are we ready to have a clear Arab position?
humanitarian aid
We clearly support our brothers.
And also address the Israeli Palestinian side and tell them
This is something we should discuss, but I don’t think everyone is ready.
Why don’t we freeze the Arab initiative?
We are committed to the 1948 truce, but the Israelis are not.
It is natural that there are disputes in meetings, but in reality these disputes
It expresses positions that reflect the feelings of certain people, that is to say
One of the quarrels I know about is
Some have described Hamas as a gang.
And not even a minority
This is a situation that happened and we responded to it, I am a brother of one of the ministers.
And I think that means what the West says.
But these are a radical movement and these are a gang, and one says that these are so and so.
We don’t want to be other men’s men.
So it always means that, and I don’t mean anyone in particular.
any foreigner they find
It is a Western country or Western countries that find
Among Arabs
Yes, okay, Your Excellency the Sheikh now.
Call for a second ministerial meeting
And God, his agenda should be one thing.
Where are you, Arabs, from what is happening and what is the position of the three hundred and something nation?
Million Israel Soft
pursuant to which resolution 1860 was issued
The decision that was issued
Israel has not implemented it yet. Israel will implement it after the mission is completed.
There is no doubt that the Arab delegation has made an effort.
commendable in this decision
We are asking for Chapter VII because Israel is above the law, i.e. Israel.
And if they are asked again, they will say to them, "We understand."
It’s not the Arabs’ fault if they are
If that is the case, then Israel is not accountable.
It is above international law.
This is a fact.
Why did you go to the Security Council and why did you link the convening of an Arab summit to what the Security Council would issue?
At the summit, the Security Council will seek us out.
requires a difficult decision
to a decision
An official may lose his position.
We are the West, we are afraid.
And we are among those who strive after they have decided, for example.
I don’t want to get out of the topic.
Those who carried out this attack will have to pay for the entire reconstruction of Iraq, because they destroyed it.
Let’s not ask the Iraqi government or the people who died.
No compensation
Exactly the same thing happened in Sudan when they first started talking about trying al-Bashir.
His Eminence Sheikh
His Eminence Sheikh
A major Arab diplomatic victory at the Security Council
He said that they had difficulties in the Security Council because the first talk was about a presidential statement.
the consequences
Israel has not complied with it.
You will commit in two days, in a week, after you finish the task.
Because they did not comply with the decision.
Sorry, people are supposed to comply.
Because Israel accepts it only after the mission is over.
You have an alternative to this decision now.
All that we have done
Unfortunately, some of the brothers have carried out this with their own efforts.
Gaza blockade, participate in it
I am a friend of the West and I don’t mind if we have a relationship with the West and I’m not
Anti-Western and anti-American
But these people know the language of interests.
Your friends if you are strong
Or if you have a point of view
In the end, our opinion is taken into account by one percent, and we say that we have won.
What is victory?
What does it guarantee?
I cannot say anything about any reservations now because the decision has not been made.
The Council is master of its own procedure.
You participated in the formulations
We participated in the formulations to some extent, yes we participated.
But you did not call for a meeting of Arab ministers with the US Secretary of State.
But I’m sure that the brothers who went there will be enough for us.
I pointed to certain Arab parties for a specific interest.
In this regard, His Excellency the Sheikh
Two years ago until now
Look, I don’t want to talk about accusations.
I can claim that we have seen everything that we can see.
Are they people?
The Israeli rejection turned into an international rejection, and we also contributed to this rejection.
And that is where the conflict began and the siege started.
Last month, Israel killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the truce.
And they will stay hungry until we exhaust them, because we don’t want them to be in power.
Those are those parties, His Excellency Sheikh.
It clearly states that there is a Palestinian-Palestinian dispute.
That is, if there was
Who created the Palestinian conflict? Maybe there was a Palestinian-Palestinian conflict.
To tell someone, "No, you are absolutely right."
I'm not saying that Hamas is 100% right.
I don't claim that, and I don't say that.
But May the mediator is usually a mediator who is at the same distance from everyone.
And I don't just mean the mediator, I mean us as Arabs, to be at the same distance from everyone.
We don’t want it to exist, so we have to end it by any means.
Once, train the forces on the right and left.
and besiege them and do not give them money or salaries.
And we are also creating a positive model in the West Bank.
CNN, let the people in Gaza see how people live.
A comfortable life. F F F
In contrast to that, in Gaza
You called for a second ministerial meeting, a second Arab ministerial meeting, but at this time.
Talks between Hamas and Turkey are still ongoing.
This meeting that you called seems to be an attempt to circumvent.
Circumventing it if we take another initiative
We don’t have any initiatives.
On this subject
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
It is required to play a role, and we support any Egyptian effort that leads to an understanding.
But it is important
We do not come
Tomorrow, one party will have defeated the other.
Nor is the path to harmony.
A balanced Egyptian initiative
Between international requirements, Arab requirements and humanitarian requirements
And the requirements of Egypt’s role, which is an important role
It is a leading Arab country that we respect and appreciate.
This is what is required in your opinion with regard to Egypt.
The current proposals and the current initiative do not meet those requirements, Mr. President.
I have an idea about the initiative.
We hear about what has been announced here and there, and we get information about it.
I can’t comment on something I don’t know.
With all due respect to the government or the Palestinian presidency, it must exist and we all recognize the Palestinian presidency.
But there are also people
The injured party must have their point of view taken into account.
So that we can make this mediation successful.
By the way, take a look at this point of view.
Hamas’ position was clear that we were not consulted on this decision, so how could it be issued?
A resolution in which Arabs participate in its drafting without contacting or taking the opinion of the main party concerned with the matter.
We only want to say that we are of course dealing with the Palestinian state as a state.
And we deal with the authority, let's say, let's say, one party, one side.
But now there is a rift between one party that is in one place and another party that is in another.
This does not mean that if we deal with the people in Gaza, we should stop dealing with the people in the West Bank or the Palestinian presidency.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
If they ask someone from Gaza to be with them
And now we started to coordinate together.
What was announced was announced.
First, the decision did not say that to him. He welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiatives.
Some considered it a mechanism.
This is an explanation, but what I understood from reading the decision is that he welcomed the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative will succeed in its mission.
The fighting is stopped by them.
I don’t doubt them, I don’t doubt our brothers in Egypt.
because Israel did not accept the Security Council resolution.
And you consider this resolution to be as if it did not exist, since Israel did not accept it.
Even if you accept it later, things will have changed on the ground.
Yes, Your Excellency, Sheikh, I am talking about the Egyptian efforts, the Egyptian efforts.
Turkey is also sharing efforts with it at the same time.
On Arab helplessness
As for the Arab disputes that cannot be resolved, it came to occupy a place as a result.
That is, it was supposed to be occupied by Arab parties.
I welcome Turkey's position.
A position that must be appreciated by Arabs and Muslims.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
And that is this natural role.
And people need to follow me.
There is no Arab consensus to address the situation.
One says let them finish the mission.
There must be a clear Arab position that strongly condemns this aggression, its continuation, and the procrastination.
to be in an Arab position opposite
This means that Israel is able to spy on the villages. I am not talking about an Arab-Israeli war, and we are among the people who always call for peace.
No, we are a country, so you should love to live in peace.
But I am not asking for an Arab war, I am asking for a position.
Clear Arabic
When talking about initiatives and proposals, of course you follow what is happening.
proposals and conditions put forward by the Hamas movement
Do you think
As an observer, I now see that the reality on the ground is
The politician who emerged from the military operation now allows Hamas to impose its conditions.
What is needed is for it to be right.
We agree on this point, but we don’t agree with you on this point.
The second thing
They are not here now, they are negotiating. I don’t know about this negotiation, as I told you.
The second thing
Okay, so what is required of Arabs in such situations?
This Arab reality
what we have seen since the start of these operations
There is no doubt that the position of the Arab street is much, much more advanced.
About us as governments
Of course, I am sorry that some people describe this popular gift as such.
They once told me this topic.
We represent the views of our peoples.
The presidents now
That is, if they want it.
At least let them see what
Of course, there is a high ceiling and there is a modest ceiling, and this is what is required.
Stop normalization, stop diplomatic relations with Israel.
Qatar Pan
The Israeli representative office in Doha is closed.
Qatar, which is taking this position
She believes that the Arab side should be radical and take radical positions.
Anything that Arabs agree on, we agree on collectively.
We will never start if there is an Arab agreement.
The treaty is one thing, and relations are another.
We are ready.
We are in line with our Arab brothers
But there must be a decision and clear Arab credibility.
They also deal with others, not just countries that have relations.
Even countries that do not have relations
Very important
We are not agents of others.
He asks why Qatar cannot be a model in this field.
If this is the only model, we are ready to be part of it.
But we also want
A model for the Arab world, Qatar is committed to part of its Arab obligations.
e.g.
And no one should sell anyone to anyone.
The problem is that trust between Arab countries is lost.
And I don’t want to say our secret, unfortunately I don’t want to say brokers.
And that is why it is very important
A formal invitation anywhere, because we must rise above this.
Some summoned the ambassador, some lodged protests, some expelled the ambassador, like Switzerland, for example.
And this is part of the disagreement.
But some of them summoned the ambassador, and some summoned five ambassadors from permanent member states. All of this is just a show for our people.
That is, we spoke about the modest ceiling of popular demand.
At the top, there are those who demand the opening of fronts. There are those who demand that Syria open its front with Israel.
Look, I told you that we call for peace and not for fighting with Israel.
We do not seek a fight with Israel.
To start a fight with Israel
And how will we agree?
This is also a problem.
which made us talk to each other and overcome our differences
I missed what you said, Your Excellency the Sheikh.
provided that countries do not sell each other
What do you mean?
means now
The street will not forgive us.
His Eminence Sheikh
Is what is happening today a continuation of a project that began in 2006 with the Lebanon war?
She believes that there is a difference.
No, I don’t think there is any difference between the goals.
This means that Lebanon had land that was liberated.
The remaining parts are, of course, supposed to be a deposit with the United Nations.
or something like that
Lebanon means that we have dealt with the Lebanese issue to a large extent.
Israel, of course, needs weak countries around it.
So that you can dominate and have the upper hand.
And of course, there are countries that are supported by foreign powers.
And that’s why she wants to remain the only power in the region.
And now they want
They are changing this example in Gaza.
In Lebanon, how many sects do you speak with?
How many parties?
While Lebanon is in Palestine, it talks about one side only.
But I want to reiterate that the problem of the Palestinians is that they listened too much to the Arabs and to foreigners.
Two parties, and that's how the gap formed, with each side believing they control the other.
In your opinion, as an observer and a follower
As planned, it ends up breaking bones.
As Arabs, do we accept this, because this example may be repeated for those who resist?
He gives his opinion
whether for Israelis or others in the future
And we gave an example
The highest in obedience and in helping to break bones.
We have a saying that goes: "Me and my cousin against the stranger, and me and my brother against my cousin."
We now assume that there is a conflict with Hamas, and I am not saying that Hamas or anyone else is immune from error or authority.
They all have mistakes.
Now we must pass this issue.
On bringing a party to its knees
Because here, failure will not be the failure of a group.
His Excellency the Sheikh of Qatar has been making proposals for some time now.
And the solution to that came in Lebanon through initiatives.
This happened in Darfur. We will talk about this topic, albeit briefly, in a moment.
that we
We don’t want to burden our brothers because sometimes there is sensitivity.
We have no problem with a country that takes all these initiatives, as long as the issue is resolved.
We are not aiming now to put Qatar on the top headline.
What that means is that it was not one of His Highness the Emir’s goals.
These were his goals. How do we stop this bleeding?
And we stop this tyranny.
What happened is beyond imagination.
And we are in Qatar
Do we know something they don’t know? I don’t think so.
But the most important thing is that we have the intention.
Sincere efforts to reach an honourable solution
Talking about initiatives means it is useful to know where the initiative has reached with regard to Darfur and the resolution of the Justice and Equality Movement.
The Sudanese government in Khartoum
It is specifically intended to solve the Darfur problem, because the Darfur problem is the beginning.
Arabs helped
But I am facing a case that we have brought to the international level.
We wanted to take revenge on the regime, and now we want to solve the problem but we don’t know how to solve it.
And, as I said at the beginning, we always strive to implement decisions. We are the best people to implement decisions.
Remove the case from competition. Is there also competition in the Darfur issue?
I don’t want to get involved in this topic.
Before we end this conversation, Your Excellency, there is an economic summit.
Will this summit take place? Will you attend this summit?
No, we will boycott the summit.
We hope that the meeting will be held, but in a different atmosphere than the Arab atmosphere, although it is scheduled.
It would be a shame
Okay, if the Arab leaders attended this summit.
When the blood of Palestinians was being shed in Gaza, they were listening for financial and economic reasons.
We help to ignite
But it seems that no one is afraid of this street.
What you know about the circumstances means that, of course, I don’t wish anything but safety for all of us.
And we will be safe
But that means no one can take anyone in their small pocket.
Qatar’s Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, thank you very much.
Dear viewers, wherever you are, peace be upon you.
What is the point of this celebration and how truthful are the statements made by the High Commissioner for Human Rights?
People with disabilities are the most neglected group in the world.
And what about our Arab region and how much it cares about this issue?
These and other questions we will ask our guest in today's episode.
Former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Disability
She holds a Bachelor of Arts in Social Work and Sociology from Qatar University.
He also holds a master's degree in social planning and social policy from Helwan University in Egypt.
I have held many positions in the field of disability.
including a founding member and the general coordinator of the National Committee for Persons with Disabilities
The year two thousand and ninety-eight
and Vice-President of the National Committee for Persons with Disabilities since 1999
Until 2003
I also contributed to the establishment of Shafallah Center for Persons with Disabilities.
People with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest has overseen the launch of many programs, projects and media campaigns.
Activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world
I also contributed to giving lectures and participating in meetings, conferences and forums.
Welcome, Ms. Hessa, to this episode with us.
The approved term is people with disabilities.
At the beginning, we used to call them disabled, maybe in the eighties and before that.
more educational when
is among those to whom that education is provided
In 1993, an important document appeared at the United Nations.
Speaking of this term, before we go into the details
than the rest of the regions, although there are regions that are not or are classified as developing and are classified as poor.
And Latin America, especially, actually, this trend may be stronger in Latin America than anywhere else.
But statistics have proven otherwise.
The trend towards a rights-based approach exists in the Arab world; you can find it in many countries.
Resources may be available and political will may exist.
Okay, let me give you some statistics here that you may already be aware of.
Eighty percent of them are from poor countries.
UNESCO says that about 90% of disabled children in poor countries do not go to school.
Ms. Hessa, how do you comment on these statistics?
It is largely true.
I saw it first in Darfur, in Gaza, and in areas that are exposed to such events, which are wars and conflicts.
There, don’t differentiate between a disabled person and a non-disabled person, because the numbers are large.
Separating children, the illiteracy rate among females is, for example, approximately fifty-three or fifty-two.
And in other countries
There are many obstacles that prevent these children from attending school, even if they do not have a disability.
The city originally has no infrastructure, so even if this child found that school, it wouldn't exist.
He can access it.
for children and for other inhabitants that
This means that such projects and agendas are great, but we don’t actually hear much about them.
Except when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated a few days ago. What is the point of this celebration?
The situation in the world
I am in a better position than people who have no disability at all.
There are organizations that have arrived and established many projects.
implements a very important strategy for health
Through this strategy
There is an overlap between humanitarian work and work with specific marginalized groups, such as people with disabilities.
There is now a greater degree of awareness in the Arab world.
At the point of awareness, we stop to receive communications and continue our dialogue.
Thank you
I have two questions that I would like to ask, given that I was previously a delegate at the United Nations.
The second point is what?
United Nations laws that call for, for example, combating systems that cause harm to children in society. For example, my son, the Syrian intelligence system.
Is there a law that allows me to file a lawsuit against the regime? There are many people in Syria who do so.
Yes, Suleiman, your idea is clear. Suleiman Crow is talking to us from Syria. Thank you very much. With us is Nayef Al-Sa’eed from Kuwait. Go ahead, Nayef.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God and His blessings.
Peace be upon you too.
Good evening
Good evening, please go ahead.
I, if you allow me, I am a person with intellectual disability.
It means, listen, Arabs say that a free man understands by sign.
And in the Quran it says: "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Glory be to the One who gave us speech and gave speech to everything."
It means that I have spent more than thirty years maybe speaking only one or two words a day.
So glory be to God, God made me speak.
So he was talking about the gran, so I found out what he meant.
It means an attack on me, accusing me of exploiting the Quran and being a hypocrite who targets people and so on.
They slander me and target me, while they are in the lowest depths of Hell.
I only got defamation
They do not distort the truth.
People who live in glass houses should not throw stones at others.
And of course, psychological disabilities
It falls within this definition. Brother Suleiman's question is:
UN programs or their reactions to the causes of disability, such as political goals or others.
Approach different organizations and agencies
To discuss it with her, convince her, and find out... sorry, to what extent.
Issues and topics related to disability are on their work agendas, so to speak.
UNESCO, ILO, UNICEF. The reality is that these organizations originally address disability.
It is one of the programs that tries not to overlook children with disabilities.
Appropriate opportunities and schools
B Environmental aspects and different aspects
UNICEF also
But there are shortcomings. We must admit that there are shortcomings in the situation at the United Nations as well.
What are the main weaknesses and shortcomings you mentioned?
Regarding the United Nations
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
I was directly present in my country, the State of Qatar.
But it was routine and bureaucratic, which hindered it.
I have seen it in particular in my work, sometimes also in the constraints or limitations.
People with disabilities struggle, try and fight for recognition.
until it reached a somewhat satisfactory level, and did not place it in a separate article as the global disability movement wanted.
But it occupied a fairly decent part.
Unfortunately, there is no coordination between them.
This is one of its most important shortcomings.
The survey conducted by the Special Rapporteur was applied to States
either within the staff or among the people working on those programs
Unfortunately, we have only received three responses from forty-eight organizations and agencies, and only three responses have reached us.
Don't put it
The issue of disability has been a permanent, stable and continuous issue for many years, despite the fact that this issue is primarily a human rights issue.
In the last period, yes, thank God, two or three years ago.
The issue of disability has at least begun to be raised through events such as seminars and others.
Hello, peace be upon you.
Madam, why are there no binding laws and decisions for Arab countries, and who is responsible for enforcing these international laws?
As for Arab countries, for example, allocating salaries for people with disabilities
Is there money allocated by the United Nations?
Does this money go to governments or to UN offices? Do these aids really reach the disabled?
And finally, note that if there are no binding decisions for the Arab countries
Thank you very much, Ahmed Al-Halabi, who spoke to us from Greece.
We have Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia. Go ahead, Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
adopt this proposal
It is to write directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
Switch to this fund
He is a manufacturing plant.
by allocating just one percent of the annual net profit
I return to our guest to answer the callers' questions.
He says that doctors advised him to undergo surgery, but
It costs a lot and he can't afford this operation, so where should he go?
He is from Algeria.
I think it is important to meet the needs of brother Naji.
Like any other rights, i.e. the rights of disabled people.
All of these are rights that this citizen must have and must obtain.
To join the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this is a binding and legal convention.
and to fulfil the rights and needs of people within its national scope.
or even at the level of non-governmental organizations
It is binding on all countries and there must be oversight to ensure that these laws are implemented.
At least at the level of officials, first and foremost, there must be awareness.
At least, if we work on these agreements in this way, we must
Even if there is no major commitment
There was a response to the reports of the monitoring you were doing, and was there interest?
But don’t forget that standard rules are a document that is morally, not legally, binding and is actually a fact.
to be committed to it and to ratify it
And we understand that these issues will be resolved, discussed or raised within the context of a society that suffers from many problems and complications.
Naji Zakarneh, Director of the Qatari Center for the Deaf, is a sign language expert at Al Jazeera.
First of all, Mr. Ali would like to extend his sincere thanks to Al Jazeera.
who kindly broadcast this special episode now
Now Ali is speaking and says, "I am very proud."
She was a servant to all people with special needs in the place where she was and still is.
We support it and stand by it always and forever.
I also say that there are many people with special needs.
Some of them don’t know about this agreement because there were no training courses.
especially if it is in schools, hospitals, or public and private institutions.
It is necessary to publish this agreement.
It is like a law that deals with people with special needs in all countries of the world.
And I emphasize and insist that States should
By adopting and signing this Convention
Like the State of Qatar and other countries, it has also signed this document with the aim of serving people with special needs and serving us.
Thank you very much, colleague Naji Zakarna. I spoke on behalf of Ali.
Thank you very much.
Your opinion can make a decision.
The former UN Special Rapporteur on Disability. We might start with a suggestion made by one of the callers, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
About creating a support fund
It is a voluntary fund and accepts any contributions from countries.
This fund is intended to be used to finance the activities that the Special Rapporteur would undertake.
Even the Arab countries did not make donations, except for one country, Syria.
Therefore, fulfilling those obligations is a problem that exists in the United Nations.
The Fund
Unfortunately, this is due to a lack of commitment and interest on the part of member states.
Unfortunately, many people say it with great courage that we don’t care about the situation now.
It is a matter of fact that it is a commitment.
Human Rights
Humanity in its broadest general form
especially the marginalized
But that is why these covenants exist.
If these countries fulfill their obligations, this is a good idea that the brother has launched.
It should also be added that it is necessary that there is not only an independent fund in its independent form, but also the organizations that already exist in the region.
from its own budgets
Apply for projects for people with disabilities in Gaza
Assistance for people with disabilities
The issue is always intertwined, meaning that political factors intervene in it.
His country or government has undertaken to support him significantly.
Unfortunately, the number has decreased.

Of course, his citizenship was withdrawn.
The girl withdrew. She has a daughter.

Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God and His blessings.
Peace be upon you too.
And we can
Rebuilding themselves with knowledge
I hope that Arab countries will allocate a portion of their budget.
Thank you very much, Bahjat. Bahjat Karawan Bahjat from Kuwait.
Aisha Mohammed from Qatar, please go ahead.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
Good evening to you and good evening to Sheikha Bint Khalifa.
I just want to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In the past years
With our best wishes, we are the people with special needs.
In support of Sheikha Hessa’s continued support for them
A noble flag bearer from Tunisia, welcome.
There is another level, which is the genetic level.
I think that care at the genetic level reduces the percentage of disabled people.
In our Arab customs, a man always takes his cousin’s daughter, his uncle’s daughter, his aunt’s daughter, and so on, as his wife.
This is what it means at this level, which is the level of disability. Thank you.
Commentary and response to what was said in the viewers' communications
The truth is that, as you said, this is the case at the national level.
I know that there are guidance and support programs.
It falls within the health services.
which is also under the umbrella of Hamad Medical
Within the psychological clinic, I also believe that there are educational programs at the Supreme Council for Education.
The special education department, I honestly don't know if it still exists.
But it is definitely part of health services. Yes, there is support and there are medical services.
And Tahilia offers these cases
Prevention is better than cure, and he pointed to the genetic factor of marriage between relatives. Are there any campaigns?
For example, for awareness
In this field
This is definitely a very important and dangerous point.
One of the things that I and others have talked about in many words and many posts
Yes, there are awareness campaigns that are not only targeted.
implemented by the World Health Organization
Also for UNICEF
Now in many Arab countries, including Qatar
Tunisia, confirmed
There are now mandatory decisions for early examination.
which has been applied in many countries
All this is on the preventive side.
And do such campaigns get a response?
positivity, especially since it conflicts with customs and traditions
Of course, this is the difficulty of it, it clashes with societal culture.
It is a matter of decision, of strategy, of will to confront this and to commit to it.
The issue of early examination, for example, is a very important issue before marriage.
I ask you if there are any statistics that talk about the disabled.
especially for the disabled in the Arab region
Apply it to the Arab region, meaning that
especially
With the recent events in the region
In areas and in conflict hotspots, in wars, with regard to wars, conflicts and other issues
For every person killed, three people are disabled.
Events in Lebanon, in Darfur, in many areas.
No, never, it’s not enough, first of all, it’s a matter of me.
with the principles of human rights
There must be a place for people with disabilities, their programs and their plans.
Integrate the agendas that already exist in ministries, institutions, and governmental and non-governmental organizations.
and in times of war or unrest, such as
Only for your words, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay.
In the world, and even stranger is what the International Monitoring Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said about population statistics.
Does this mean that people with disabilities are not included in the general population statistics to this extent?
It is not always announced
For example, in the State of Qatar, when the census was conducted, I think it was more than five years ago.
But frankly
in cooperation with the Planning Council and with the
It was prepared by the Council and we, as the Office of the Special Rapporteur, contributed to it.
Put more Put disability classifications
The needs that are assumed to be present in me
The quality of those observations is all these important details that must lead you to a result.
Is there a disabled person or not?
Quite, but at least
Statistics are somewhat improving in this regard.
Hello
Madam, I thank you for this program and I thank Sheikha Hessa.
But I thank God that I am Qatari and I receive this attention from my country, I mean.
My daughter is now a student in an independent school and receives a good education, thanks to God.
And I would like to thank Mrs. Hessa.
Her motivating role and her role that makes us not fear or worry about our children.
Thanks and praise be to God, and many thanks to her and to those who support this group.
Thank you, thank you very much. Fatima Al-Dosari spoke to us from Qatar. We remain in Qatar with Latifa.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
My esteemed sister, the reality and the hoped-for outcome that we await is the resolution of the problem of our stateless children.
What is the role of the sheikha in relation to our Qatari children?
I hope she answers it, answers this question.
Hello, peace be upon you.
I can testify to the services that the State of Qatar has provided, especially for hearing disabilities.
We had an early hearing impairment detection program.
There is a Higher Council for Persons with Disabilities.
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability
Even the civil society organization MG Oz or other communities
Because the reality and the hoped-for is that if I compare it over five years
What was offered to the disabled five years ago and now
Thank you very much, Karim Naseem, who spoke to us from Jordan. I return to our guest.
Of course, of course.
The community as a whole, its individuals, and especially families with
Children with disabilities have great ambitions and expectations from anyone.
whether at the planning level or at the executive level
But with regard to one of the points you mentioned, which is a very important point:
Children who do not have documents or anything else, whether in Qatar or elsewhere
The international agreement, like many international documents
and a commitment to translate them into plans and strategies
that these services are provided automatically
Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, sex or nationality.
Okay, Sheikha Hessa, as a former Special Rapporteur, worked at the United Nations on disability issues after six years of work.
So you were hoping
Maybe you didn’t have enough time, maybe the financial aid wasn’t enough.
This means that many achievements have been made and I am proud of them.
Through my participation, or through existing organisations, and through government institutions in many countries.
I focus specifically on the Arab region.
There should be more research and larger studies
We started with a global survey that resulted in more than one report.
Raising awareness is an ongoing process that must be worked on continuously and extensively.
Coordination between Arab countries
And among the same people, people with disabilities and their organizations, because they are

to fight for it
Many thanks
Thank you
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode, I thank everyone who participated with us by giving their opinion and comments.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will meet a new guest.
So stay with us with your calls and messages in a new episode of Mubasher Ma’a. Goodbye.
Good morning, rose.
I am very happy to have you with us.
At the beginning, before we start asking different questions and chatting this morning
Thank you, Shaimaa. Maybe I congratulated you.
The entire Middle East deserves this global achievement.
Qatar has already put us on the world football map.
Thank you, Qatar
I also have to go, Ali.
First of all, I would like to greet the viewers.
I say congratulations on hosting it and to the entire Qatari people.
And, God willing, as Sheikh Mohammed said
It was a dream before, and now, God willing, it will become a reality and work will begin today or from the time of the announcement.
You expected that Qatar would host the 2022 World Cup.
Despite the existence of strong files, such as those of America, Japan, and Australia, I was not worried in this area, specifically in this matter.
No, look, I’ll be honest with you, seventy percent of me is Qatari, I’m not chosen.
Our file is very large
Vio charts are really global and competitive.
We were up to the competition, that’s what we were.
Why are we afraid?
But thank God, Qatar’s file was really strong and deserved it.
It is true that the 2022 file and the World Cup and its hosting in Qatar
So what does it mean to me, the athletes themselves?
It means a lot to them in this field, so the joy will definitely be great, very great, God willing.
I mean, I like it this way. We used to talk before the air, but I liked to hear it on the air like this.
At the moment of announcement
Where were you? How did you receive the joy? How was the shock? I don’t know. Tell us, tell us. Tell the viewers.
Radio
The whole world is following us.
I know this is an ad and it's high.
How did you see the global media?
Look at the level of sports channels as a whole, no one insisted, especially the Arab countries, so thank God everyone gave their support.
Just announcing that Qatar has won is enough to prove that it has the right to host.
All Arab countries are not unfamiliar with this noble gesture, and it is not surprising that they have announced that they are ready to provide Qatar with whatever it needs.
Media, human resources, and volunteers are possible in the future.
Even at the level of foreign media, Shaimaa.
That means I went and celebrated my bad luck at that time.
Among those who included them was the French news agency, which also took pictures.
We also have meetings
It means that no one insisted at all. Qatar has become that now. Let me tell you, they talk about it every day.
Hundreds of times a day, from the smallest spot on earth to the largest spot on earth.
I expect that everyone will know Qatar. Whoever didn’t know Qatar on the globe, now knows it on the internet.
The owner of the 2022 World Cup
This means that any football player who dreams of serving his country wants to be part of the national team.
Of course, any player in the Qatari league would wish to represent the national team.
So it’s a good thing that one should kill himself even in the games.
Support the team even if it wins and enters the national team, it will give everything it has.
This means that whether it is in training or in matches, he has the team logo on his chest, so he has to give it his all.
God, the officials did not fail, whether in taking care of the players, especially the young ones. This means that they teach them professionalism from a young age.
eat sleep
Tell me about your experience. You have played in more than one different age stage. How was your experience and what is the most important thing for you?
Of course, by God.
I went through the stages in the national team, from the youth team to the first team.
You know the camps with the clubs, with the club, with the national team.
Every stage has its own character.
Yes, Lana, Mashallah, so you were moving around like that
We are now used to you, Lana Al Riyadiya.
Every time we see you, you are always athletic. We wanted to get some information from you and learn about sports news through Lana, so what’s the latest in sports with you?
I mean, to be honest, I don’t watch it much. It’s a variety show, and in variety shows we used to host stars, but in their fields. And in sports, we also host stars.
Like Ali and others in their sports field
On the contrary, sports activity
What’s wrong with us? We used to be the capital of sports.
Qatar, now we have become the capital of global sports and football.
Instead of presenting social, economic and cultural programs when you are in the entertainment section
You have different fields, you have volleyball, basketball, different championships.
But it’s still a sport.
Excellent sweet
I really wished
I wish I wasn’t twenty-five years old now, I wish I was ten years old.
I think the young players have been given a chance, a great chance.
They hold it, like they say, in their hands.
What’s up? God willing, the message I would like to send to the players is
God willing, the young players who will have a bright future in the coming days, God willing, will leave.
Of course, I told you this is an opportunity and they should take advantage of it.
This means it’s a golden opportunity, as they say.
So they need to make the most of it.
What’s new with you? How are you? What’s new now? What programs are you going to present? I know we brought you back from vacation a little bit.
Tell us about your new stuff, God willing.
Stay in touch with the event, I hope we will be ready to attend the Asian Cup, which will start in one month.
We finished two days ago, by the way, in the Gulf Cup. Congratulations to the Kuwaiti team.
The news bulletin is also available, so we are keeping up with the intuition.
I am definitely a founding member of Qatar TV, by the way. My first appearance for viewers was on the Qatari screen.
He did not even try to deny this favor to them.
And Mashallah, they convey the media message across various channels.
Whether they are private channels, sports channels or other channels
Thank you very much, Qatar TV.
We definitely wish you all the best, God willing, always, and we are still on this topic.
First of all, I would like to thank the management of Al-Wakrah Club.
And the fans of Al-Wakrah Club are from
My childhood in Al Wakra
The sheikh was with us yesterday. Sheikh Nasser was with us.
Which club?
I am Liheen, son of Al Wakra and born in Al Wakra.
But, as I told you before the program, this is professionalism.
Belongs to every person on the land of Qatar
Young people, we already know that young people love sports and addiction, just like you said.
How do we make a sportsperson enter the field of social work?
Media awareness is primarily about the media, which plays a very important role in spreading sports in various magazines. Let's say, in life.
You have the young people who are addicted, but now sports have started to enter schools, and sports awareness has become present in schools.
You have occasions where they celebrate. Any sporting event, they make no celebrations.
You have the Qatari street, which means we see signs on the streets, and this is also considered sports awareness.
The female element is not specialized for anything, for example, it has no place in the stands or anywhere else.
This is also a women's awareness or, let's say, a sports campaign for women's participation in sports.
Then we now have a women’s team in Qatar.
I think that sports, thank God, have started to expand.
I also expect that the time period for Lana
To work on many projects and raise awareness about sports on a large scale. I think this is a sufficient period.
If you study properly and work properly
That’s enough, and at the same time, we need to make good use of it, just like the current.
Then there was a point I wanted to make about how younger generations can take advantage of the team.
It means capabilities, expertise, equipment, everything is available.
Also, there is an important thing, which is that, thank God, in Qatar this thing is well known among the Gulf and Arab communities, who love sports very much.
How can I attract this audience to follow sports news and matches that take place in Qatar on a regular basis?
and at the same time be present
But most of the people in Qatar love sports and love football, but the problem is attendance.
If you enter forums, you will find that there is a lot of interest, especially in the forums of some clubs, or most clubs.
Great interest in football in the league
As a player, as a Qatari citizen, what solution do you think could attract you to attend, considering that you are an athlete and a player?
How can your friends who want to watch the games attend?
It depends on the person himself, not on a general idea or something like that.
Some people like to watch it on TV or in gatherings where they come together.
For example, Japan has made a big plan to attract a large audience to attend.
When you attend the matches, I collect points, I don’t know what it means, they are doing it now, they are looking for solutions, God willing.
And Arabic
The most important thing is that every player will be present, God willing, in Qatar, especially in the twenty-two file. What do you think we need?
Apart from financial support, what is the thing that you feel we really need?
And provide the means that can be made available to the generation so that it truly deserves to be called the Qatari national team and participate in the great World Cup.
When he told me that the time was almost over, I thought to myself, "When?" Mashallah, time passed quickly with the beautiful people.
I made the impossible possible and achieved the dream that we thought was impossible, but thank God we are now living in reality.
As Sheikh Mohammed said, these are moments of celebration, but the work has begun.
God willing, 2022 will be an event worthy of Qatar's name.
I congratulate everyone on the land of Qatar and I say frankly that Qatar has now become a landmark of the world.

And thanks to the elegant media personality Lana Al-Aadi. We wish you all the best, God willing, and we will always follow you to benefit from sports.
Thank you very much, the joy is definitely in the eyes of the Emir.
Young Qatari talents
And they are singing a new kind of songs that have appeared during this period.
But in the form of a song, on a music site with a fast rhythm.
He is also a fan of rap, God willing.
Stay with us, viewers, and our journey begins from this moment. Good morning.
We are trying to take a look at it.
In short, rap can be defined as fast vocal music.
It is performed by a singer who hesitates and does not sing the lyrics in a fast rhythmic manner.
consisting of a large number of rhymes that address a number of different topics and issues
which can sometimes be personal
A political and emotional meeting
It is often controversial.
And it is very liberal
And our rapper doesn't sing the lyrics of the song.
He repeats it.
And the tone of his voice is a secondary factor.
In rap songs, the voice is generally not important.
That is why he is not called a singer but a rapper or a rapa.
He is interested in the following racism in the songs.
For example, the flow is a flow of sounds, synchronization, for example, or the delivery.
They have their own followers, their own audience, and their own fans.
They have a style that is specific to rap.
I think they will give you a better and more comprehensive idea than I can personally.
Good morning, hello.
And God, first of all, it was a period when we wanted to do something new.
We are distinguished by something
So why don’t we sing rap?
Then rap is an art that exists in all countries of the world.
Why is it not available in Tripoli?
So we said, let’s invent something new.
It means we give him an idea of it, a message.
Here we talk about the pros and cons that happen in our society.
It means that we deliver a message, first, and second, it means that it is an art.
This is one of the different arts, and by the way, this information may have solved many social and psychological problems among young people to a great extent.
I expect every era to change, and this changes with time, I expect.
I swear that the coverage was a little weak.
We have been singing since 2005, the beginning was a bit weak.
We can say about ourselves that this is our new beginning in 2010.
More popular and widespread
She likes it, for example, she tries to sing and perform in the same rap style. I noticed this during this period.
Sure, a large percentage of people still do.
We also need to talk about his work, he founded several bands.
A beautiful band, you have had several concerts, can we talk about this band?
How was it founded and how did the idea come about that one can actually form a band and how many of you are there in this band?
And God, at the beginning, we were there before the band was even formed.
Rap arrived in Doha, which means it started in 2005.
It means that everyone who loves the idea of rap and wants to sing rap, sings and posts it on the website.
I go down, Salman goes down, so-and-so goes down, so there is competition.
And we got to know people.
So we became competitors to each other.
Then, after a while, after all these years, we reached 2010.
But in 2010, there was a group system, meaning that this was a separate group, i.e. every three or four people were together.
So, we said, “Why not? Why don’t we unite and become one group called Rappers Tar?”
U.B.L.A.K.I. Que Rappers
So we agreed on this, that’s it. We said that we are all one, we are all united together.
And we came out, meaning we started to act out this thing and say that this idea is the same.
About twenty-five people
Twenty-five Waws! Mashallah, a large group.
Okay, is there anyone who plays or performs? Everyone performs rap songs.
He is the one who coordinates and he is the one who composes.
So you can say something personal.
How are these numbers arranged in the band? Excellent, how are the twenty-five arranged?
Everyone is concerned with themselves and has their own capabilities.
This means that every member of the band can make a complete song.
Without it, he does not seek help from anyone else.
But there, the skills may differ, for example, if Salman is better than me.
He hears him say no, correct the words here, it’s something else.
Everyone can edit for the other.
Help me a little
So that there is actually an official body that adopts these works, or even a company that adopts them, for example.
And there will be distributors there
This means that the work will look like this, in a sophisticated style, and it will actually be something official for you.
And God, we really wish for honesty, we wish for support, for someone to come and say, "We are a company that supports you, let's go, we will produce an album for you."
We don’t have any problem, I mean.
Some things are a bit difficult.
So why don’t you think about making the first initiative come from you?
Even when one gets to know the first CD.
This is how you can attract partners later. What do you think?
I made a CD in 2007, approximately.
I distributed it to the young men, by God.
How was the turnout?
By God
Text Text 2007, maybe rap art is not that popular yet in the Gulf.
But not that much now.
We were supposed to talk, but we didn’t go on air. For example, you hear a large group of young people between Valencia and Kiasto.
Let’s talk about it.
They told us that they were organizing a party for us.
It means that they covered all the costs and all the procedures, and the coordination and work were, to be honest, beyond our expectations.
It was a real surprise, to be honest, and the work was amazing.
And there was a bit of pressure, there were no ads, there was nothing, just the party.
There was nothing in the ads, there was nothing two days before the party.
So we said, no one is going to have a party two days before announcing that no one is going to be there.
And we were inside, I mean, before the concert started.
So this is a point in our favor.
So that means that our voice reaches families, not young people.
Our view is that we expected that this idea is only a right for young people.
So at this stage, we discovered that there was more than one category of people who were listening to us.
In a certain song, there was a lot of interaction with the audience and the band.
Otherwise, most of the songs had interaction.
I know almost all the songs, but there were a lot of songs and we were a large group.
The group means almost the entire group.
What are the words and how do you solve different problems?
We are talking about the situation we are in, but the situation we are in is like this so quickly.
Grill at least a little, even if it’s a lot.
Even if they spoke before, I wouldn’t be there.
You have to go out, out, out, out. The sentences are random.
That means that the rhyme comes out.
It means that if we think about it, we should write "haai" instead of "haa". This word is better.
Okay, now we have a song, let’s check it out.
One of the songs you made.
We will follow up on it and see what the public thinks about this issue.
And I hope they also enjoy such words.
Thank you, I liked the introduction because it has the name of my program in it.
With you are KD and DJ Mr. Bobo on the Doha Morning Show.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Mr. Bobo with his KT-1 and he wants to pray.
And don’t forget that the program is broadcast at 9:30 in the morning, so everyone is sitting in front of the TV.
We have Hassan Naama with us in the preparation and Shima Al Hammadi in the presentation.
The director is Nasser Al-Maliki. The guests of the episode are Rappers Qatar, of course.
Because it actually contains the name of Al Al. Thank you guys, may God give you strength. I
I have to applaud you, the young people are above in the control room.
It was recorded last night.
And who among you wrote the lyrics or who?
Everyone writes their own words.
Because if I come, I will write lyrics for Youssef.
He doesn't just write these words, he writes about love, about singing, about passion.
I think you should write about the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup. I think you can enter them, right or wrong?
We are definitely ourselves, so we will definitely release a song about this topic.
But it has to be formal, or at least a little bit formal.
So I think there should be Qatari songs, songs about the homeland and love of the homeland.
Through art, which is rap, that's right.
Yes, I expect that everyone is waiting for us today.
We are watching it live now.
And of course this cup arrived and decorated the streets of Doha.
As our viewers can see, Doha is preparing to host the Asian Cup.
The concerned authorities have completed all arrangements to be at the reception.
The glass and munt are expected to definitely have a larger crowd than what we saw.
I thought the length of the corniche was from the beginning to the end just a while ago.
They are definitely looking forward to this important sporting event.
In the upcoming concerts, God willing, we will follow them in the coming days, God willing.
It means that someone came to us and said that they would arrange a party for us.
But so far, things are a bit complicated, you know.
These are the procedures, but they are not certain.
So, for example, when I say I saw Yusuf and I saw so-and-so, what do I mean?
I saw a few people I wanted, I have a song topic, and I saw the three of them.
The rights to the song belong to the rightful owners.
And the potential we have to enrich it
I’m sitting at home
Then send it to Youssef by email on the net.
This part of the song is for you, Youssef.
He also has a job that requires him to travel abroad.
They entered this field and gained millions of followers.
We’re not trying to copy, but one hears what’s best.
But it has to be a strong competitor in its style.
What’s wrong with me taking ideas from them and imitating them in some things?
But I mean, I reverse it, I take the idea, change it and apply it to my song in a different way.
They made a special band for them and now they have more than one CD with people.
Death of a person named Abdullah Al-Dail
He has experience and is able to discover groundwater.
It is their ability to detect groundwater sources.
A resident of the city of Marat
There are many experienced people.
To locate water before drilling wells
He may need it, or he may dig many wells and find no water.
using copper rods or pomegranate branches
or the figs through which one can find the location of water sources
What tools does he use?
Al-Mak Al-Mak, the discoverer of groundwater
This is the old one.
But now they have been replaced by copper rods.
Now we put the two rods parallel to each other.
And now we walk at a slow pace, a light walk.
We watch when we pass by a stream
The bars will open.
Now, now, we are now passing through this shape, we are now passing over a watercourse.
It is now open in this form.
When we exceed, it begins.
This is in the middle of the water flow.
And and and and therefore it will be the middle
This way we can now determine the width of the watercourse or the watercourse that is under the surface of the earth.
And of course, the process is repeated more than once in more than one location until we find the strongest location.
Abu Ibrahim confirms
reaching an advanced stage in this profession
His discoveries became very accurate.
In the area of Mirat and outside Mirat in Shaqra, in Ahremlah and in Ethiopia.
More than one hundred and fifty wells were discovered.
The error rate was five percent, not exceeding five percent.
You need training, experience, and a gift from God Almighty.
Outperforming modern equipment and laboratories
In a remarkably short time
Abdulrahman Al-Murshed
Doha Morning Show
The city of Marat is located northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
We followed up on this report and promise you, God willing, more reports from Arab and international countries.
And Gulf, God willing
We have now reached different headlines and titles with you, our viewers, but they have meaning.
The Great and the First Title and
So I expect that there is a large group of young Gulf people in the Gulf itself.
There are certain people you should follow.
But I mean, for example, you don’t imitate them, but you feel that it is necessary to follow their work first hand.
And God, they are the rappers of the Gulf in general, there is a connection between them.
So it’s not a competition, it’s not like I’m competing, I just released a song.
And I talk about the subject
I mean, it would be a meaningful competition, as you say.
So there is a connection between us, but it’s only with one specific person.
In Saudi Arabia, Qusai is doing this, Mashallah, he’s creating a vibe.
He became very famous, he had a CD and he had his own audience.
He now has more than one company that could adopt him.
You wish you could reach this stage, but rather, you might surpass this stage even more and more, God willing.
God willing, we wish you all the best, with God’s permission, through this band.
It exists, of course, and let’s see the footage of the reception of this important sports cup, the Asian Cup, which is on the Corniche.
and a group of young Qataris
The one that is transferred is from the West, but in a Gulf style.
And also emotional songs, rap songs, and a distinguished band of twenty-five people.
It is essential to follow your news first hand.
So I assume you need to have an email, a specific website or a forum.
How can one reach you?
God, we had our own website a while ago.
But there were some problems with the hosting company.
He would sometimes get drunk, sometimes I don’t know what.
So we faced problems with it and in the end we just closed it.
So, in the end, the site is definitely going to be closed, it’s going to be closed.
Okay, what is the alternative now until they solve this problem, because as a team?
In the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, or even in Morocco or Egypt.
One has to stay in touch with you, know your news and listen to the songs you produce from time to time.
What is the alternative now?
The alternative currently relies on user pages, for example.
In whose name exactly?
This is Joey from Atsween Serge, but on Google.
In the name of Rab Qatar or Rappers Qatar
Do you make music videos even for yourself?
The program you worked on yesterday
We have uploaded more than one video on YouTube.
Song and pictures
A song and the same thing in the form of a video, but I take pictures one after the other.
I think that we should see you develop more like this.
You need a place other than your home, but everyone should have their own device at home.
the grinder, the computer, the piano, and the guitar
To be honest, I really hope that we will get support.
I mean, for example, a company means
We produce CDs for you
We will make a special place for you.
From ourselves
But in the end, we remain in, like, a personal job situation.
We don’t want it to be a personal job.
My words are no different from those of Joseph, by God.
We need a music video, we need a music video.
The album's wall
The power of spreading BB videos is great, I think it's very important.
Because it conveys the information more effectively.
If there is support, everything will be there with it.
Your sweet voices reach everywhere.
It is considered one of the different arts that deal with problems and deal with issues.
Thank you to Youssef Al-Naemi and Salman Al-Abdullah for being with us.
We see them and wish them all the best on behalf of our Good Luck Youth Program.
These projects were a blessing.
There is also another project that is almost ready, but it needs some technical development.
Expiry date Price
You reach the cashier, you have the total, you have all the details and you are ready.
Identify the goods instead of holding each part and checking the ingredients and their harms.
He was walking on the trolley.
He can assemble it himself so that he can choose the material he wants with more precision.
Of course, most of the projects were a reflection of the child's feeling of a problem.
He also has different activities and goals.
The center now means that the programs it designs and the events it organizes are based on a main idea.
We have ten goals that Her Highness Sheikha Moza set when she established the center.
It is possible that I can also
He goes straight down to it, moves underground, goes down to the underground train from his house.
But the main idea is that it is clothes.
Show me all the stores in Qatar that have black t-shirts.
There is also a house key and a car key. I have a button that I press.
Show me if I lost it, I lost it, take me to the key
Yes, let’s go back again to the projects that you will hopefully carry out through the cultural center.
Early childhood education is weak.
Develop his skills and adopt the talented
So we move between a set of children's skills, whether they are media-related or research-related.
If the personal skills of speaking to the public are in persuading the audience
With the diversity of all these skills, we create a special program for them that serves them.
We started with the media of the future and achieved great success in it. Now we have reached the graduation projects and their end.
We also reached a large number of young child preachers.
and their creativity
Do you also have such young broadcasters?
He returned to television, which means it is necessary for them to present children's programs.
We are sitting here, we are counting them for television.
On their TV channel, Qatar TV
Count them now, that means we end up with them for eighteen years.
Welcome to them wherever they are, yes.
This also means national television.
We need to attract, acquire, discover and develop these talents.
From declarative to interrogative
to to issues related to V thinking
to read about many different areas
In such a collaboration between you, you take ideas from each other.
In every field, for example, the promising preacher program with the Ministry of Endowments.
Our exhibition is also an exhibition for future generations.
The Scientific Club played a major role in developing projects and also in providing technical support for these projects.
The Supreme Council for Education also plays a major role, as well as their support for schools and their partnership.
Professor Abdullah, your move to the great monument of Katara
It also brings together a large collection of great events and activities.
Is this considered a step forward for the head of the center himself?
But you take a building like this, which is separate.
Far from this great monument
And it gave us a platform to deal with the public more easily, I mean.
And also pioneering and good projects
In many cases, it involves receiving guests and introducing them to the nature of the cultural programs offered to children.
Because our main project has been going on for the past three years.
It is a national project to develop reading among children.
Under the patronage of Sheikha Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
She adopted this project and provided it with a lot of support.
This is a major project, which is to develop children's reading and writing skills and their ability to write stories.
different cultures that are specifically related to reading
Of course, there are many programs.
So we moved recently.
And now it means rearranging some of the activities, so to speak.
It is designed and developed in a way that suits the nature of Katara's visitors.
We definitely wish you all the best, God willing, through this center.
which contains very important ideas
Of course, first of all, we thank you for this generous hospitality.
The most important thing is that, honestly, the more we deal with children, the more we discover that our children...
Today’s children are not like yesterday’s children, their childhood is not like ours.
They need us to give them more attention, focus and time.
Give him enough listening to his interest and his imagination.
And I communicate with him intellectually.
They work, so their way of dealing with their children is like a hotel that provides them with accommodation.
He is a bank that provides him with money.
He is a child who lacks someone to listen to these thoughts, to listen to this imagination.
We actually lived through it. They moved us to the exhibition over the past few days, they moved us to twenty or thirty.
through this exhibition
We wish all the best to the projects that won awards, God willing.
Thank you for being with us, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jameeli, Director of the Cultural Center for Childhood. We wish you all the best, God willing.
So that these projects actually come true, exist in reality, and don’t remain a dream forever.
Welcome, viewers. The Children's Cultural Center concluded its activities on Monday evening at the Diplomatic Club.
Activities of the National Exhibition of the Dreams of Generations under the slogan "The Dreams of Generations are the Realities of Tomorrow's Homeland"
which he organized on the occasion of the country's national day with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar
The exhibition featured a variety of events and competitions for our viewers.
Innovative projects for children
In general, we are pleased to host on your behalf, our viewers, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jamili, Director of the Cultural Center for Childhood. Welcome and good morning.
Good morning, welcome, my dear sister.
First, I would like to thank you for giving the center time.
To talk about this special exhibition is really
We are also happy to have you on the program so that we can cover as many events as possible that took place during this exhibition.
This national exhibition of the dreams of generations
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Of course, this is the exhibition.
Contribution of the Cultural Centre for Childhood
National Day celebrations
And of course he had a very natural stance. He had a very important touch with every child.
with a view to empowering children
He lives with a dream
And with a project
This project or dream
Children's dreams are vast.
Its scope is wide, we defined it within a framework, which is a radius of twenty to thirty.
and other key areas of Qatar Vision 2030
We started training the children in four stages.
And how do brainstorming mechanisms and a set of tools expand a child's scope of thinking?
What exactly do you mean by this sentence?
Facts about the country of tomorrow
In other words, what our children dream of today
This project is growing and growing with this project.
This was actually an explanation of this vision that children start living from that day.
With a big dream
Whether it is an environmental field or, for example, a field in health and human development or other fields
serving the homeland
I expect that when we know there are children in a certain place
or in a particular exhibition
Was all of this present?
The exhibition had honorary guests at the exhibition.
The guests of honor are the ones from whom children learn as role models.
Yesterday, the Arab fall happened two or three weeks ago.
He was also a winner of various awards in the Arab world.
There was a schedule to display their projects.
Yes, and the pictures are definitely proof of what you said, Mr. Abdullah.
This is a collection of photos that were present at the exhibition and various events, of course.
This is also the owner of the last project, the owner of the forest.
innovative or creative
This is one of the children's inventions, Mashallah. It is a very beautiful idea that we can simplify for the viewer.
Let’s talk about it a little bit. What exactly is this topic about? The colored ball.
Then there were about four or five projects that talked about this topic, one of which was the colored ball.
It is also called the smart stadium.
This ball, if it goes outside the field
Its color varies and changes.
I think we will see a lot more of this in the games in the future, God willing.
Okay, what comes after these dreams, I mean?
It also relates to the need, which means it concerns his interests.
And I expect that especially when there are officials who take these small projects from small minds into consideration.
But we don’t know if these projects might actually serve us. Well, the president of the football association is here in Qatar.
What do you think of the idea of a colored ball?
Do you love the idea?
He appreciated the visit very much and its value, of course, and he saw the projects that were dedicated to football.
A road stop and these projects are adopted at that moment.
a major exhibitor at the time and adopted these projects
The public also voted for a large number of projects submitted by our children.
And our loved ones, well, what are the projects that we can say have received a lot of attention and have been voted on?
Of course, we have an evaluation method, and there is an evaluation committee that has a main evaluation method.
These are the projects that won the awards. The first, second, and third projects.
She was from the forest and won the first prize.
He had very precise details about the project and the project was ready to start.
It means that, in addition to management, you will of course need many other administrative aspects.
She went into a lot of very precise details and also distributed a visitor brochure, as if she was ready for her project.
These are definitely the pictures we are seeing.
This is a group, yes, this is a group, and I have also participated in many projects.
Maybe they feel that way because they don’t watch movies or cartoons.
It is not a fact that it has actually been linked, but some of the commitments it has made may be realized and adopted by institutions.
For example, we give names to projects. What are these projects?
How can this appendix be used at home? How is it spent, collected and returned?
Forty-seven students died.
Qatar University yesterday celebrated the graduation of two hundred and forty-seven students from the thirty-third batch.
His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al-Attiyah, Minister of State for International Cooperation
A large number of parents and faculty members
The university is celebrating the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen students today.
Of course, we thank our colleague Salman Al-Mujaddid, and we will remain in the same artistic atmosphere. We will have a dear guest with us today.
I am a fan of the series Tasaneef, starring the artist Abdelhamid Al-Sharshani.
, whose presence was confirmed by many works, including the series Qoloub for Rent.
They worked hard to prove themselves on the art scene.
especially since the art world does not know flattery
which means
Welcome to you and good morning, and I would like to greet the viewers.
On the contrary, the program is lit with the cast, to be honest.
We will see something very simple from one of your works and then start a conversation with you.
You laugh at me.
Take the fake cloak and bring the original.
Come and get it.
The cloak is present.
What did you bring the cloak back? How do I return it?
Fuck her, she crushed it in her stomach, fuck her father.
I am a member of a committee consisting of five members.
The Supreme Committee of the Conference
I don't agree with you.
I don’t mind.
So this is a short clip, a simple scene from the series Tasaneef, of which we will see the second part.
We ask you about your participation this year in the second part
Tell us a little about your roles, like the series Tasaneef, where each episode has a different theme.
Tell us about your participation.
Of course, after that
It has been a long time since that era
Merat is also famous for its mountain.
Ikmit, which poets have sung about throughout the ages
When history is a witness and remains in the memory of cities
and refers to the antiquity of its past
which is 170 kilometers north of the capital Riyadh
It is said that he is attributed to Imru' al-Qays al-Tamimi.
It is distinguished by its monuments, the sweetness of its water and the pleasantness of its air.
Poets sang about it and were fascinated by it, and its fame is associated with its famous mountain, Kumayt.
It is said that Ghadeer is like Kumayt.
Of course, the city of Merat is an ancient city.
It predated the advent of Islam.
There were old things whose history was unknown, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
the situation we are in now
The great companion Khalid ibn al-Walid, may God be pleased with him, ordered this well to be dug when he passed by during the apostasy war.
and it has remained so to this day.
The proverb says: guarantee me a quantity and I will guarantee you a wife.
If you see a quantity, you see multiplicities.
Of course, other monuments include the Ghadeer of Kumayt.
who has been a source of sweet water over the years
which was enough for the city for a whole year
From the beginning of the rains until the next rainy season
This effect is also ongoing and its creation date is unknown.
There is also the bride and there is
Mount Kumayt is one of the landmarks of the city of Marat.
Many proverbs, poems and verses have been said about this mountain.
where it comes to him from all parts of the kingdom
Among its most prominent landmarks is the Al-Walidi well.
This is because it was revealed during the days of the Ridda Wars, when he was heading to Yamama.
He camped there and ordered men to dig this well.
whose water is still used for drinking and ablution until now.
Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned in Mu'jam al-Buldan that Khalid passed through Marrat.
It is an old mud house that has been restored to its original state.
It contains several sections that highlight the architectural character of the region and its famous heritage and antiquities.
The poet said about it: "When we reached the water of Majnah"
Ghadir of Kamit, not Ghadir of Anajil
Professor Ayman, there is also, Mashallah, cooperation between the family and the guardian, and between the guardian and this center, as well as with the child.
And I think there are different ways that he could be with you all the time.
To manage the training process in general
It means that from the moment the trainee, student or child comes to us and to Ivar.
This file contains all his personal information.
Even his grades, every month he has a monthly fog, I mean, for example, we
It means, for example, a housing program for the mentally disabled.
Every four lectures, there will be deception.
A parent can do this using a username and password.
We give it to him so that he can access it.
Yes, he sees how much progress he has made since he first joined this center until today.
Yes, we have several different models that we will follow up on.
We have a little girl.
With Professor Ibrahim, he will definitely honor us in a little while.
We will see several different models. I wish we had more space.
But we brought a model of a child.
You will have more than one test in front of you, live on air.
We ask her math questions and different questions.
We will take a short break and continue with you, and then we will see this smart girl. Stay with us.
The artist’s management: The audience has become smart now.
It means that any work done in the first two episodes, three people saw the work, but they just threw the remote.
He won’t bother himself, he has 20,000 other series.
That's right, twenty thousand series. That's correct.
The Sunnah is a chain, and some people focus on one thing, while others do not.
He can see the other works that he has done.
I don’t know what it is.
He told you that I only watch TV during Ramadan.
Of course, we welcome you as a dear and precious guest, Abdulaziz Al-Sharshani.
Would you like to say anything to your viewers, your fans who love you? I am definitely one of your fans.
A word to us
I wish you a happy new year
Yes, we don’t go out a lot, we don’t go out much, we don’t represent much, of course, I mentioned the reasons.
The best is yet to come.
Inshallah, we wish you success in your work this year.
God willing, we will have another meeting to talk about these plays.
It’s all connected
Because fashion shows have become popular with many people and are eagerly awaited by fans of new models.
We welcome you, our beloved viewers, to Doha Morning, and we are with you live.
Today we are definitely talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of students, both male and female, and our children who have joined this center.
This center offers a wide range of different sciences.
They are definitely focused on developing different skills.
And also to operate their minds at 100%, God willing.
Of course, the teacher is Nasma, and the teacher Ayman Khujal, who is the executive director of the Skills Development Center.
Hello and good morning.
May God bless you
And with us is the beautiful Amniya. Good morning, Amniya.
Good morning.
How old are you, my love?
Seven Karad Seven
Mashallah, we wish you all the best.
What services do you offer to our sons and daughters?
It was explained to Professor Ayman and Professor Nesma, and it was specifically a program that benefits our children.
It is a program of Aqoul for mental mathematics.
Through the Fanguez and through the Abacs
To achieve some specific goals, we tried to explain some of the simple parts.
I felt it, Professor. I felt it, Professor Ibrahim. There is actually a difference in the student's behavior during the first two days after they enter.
And after he spends a few months with you, maybe three or four months
If he was studying in a public, private or even independent school
In principle, the program is scientifically based on certain methods.
After completing the first level of the program
This explains where the child has lost abilities or needs to develop them and how to achieve them.
He has reached a certain point, or what developments have occurred with the child?
So we are proceeding in a scientific manner, a scientific program.
It’s not just some methods or mechanisms that are applied normally.
No, in a scientific and organized manner.
Before the start of the program and after taking this course or the levels he went through
Professor Ibrahim is now with us, as you can see, our viewers. Amniya is one of the students who joined this center.
We wanted this to happen today on air so that we could show you, our viewers, how important this is.
Bring back the cloak, I have no objection.
So this is a quick clip, a simple paragraph from the series Tasaneef, of which we will see the second part.
But since we saw this clip from the first part of the series Tasaneef
Tell us a little about your roles, like the series Tasaneef, where each episode has a different theme.
This year, he focused on the fact that he was the one who would
Ghafel Fazel
The one who urged and is still giving chances.
Sixteen episodes in two categories
Of course, there is a ring manager, there is an old man in the ring, there is a baker in the ring.
means various languages
Ghanem Al Sulaiti, a professor from Qatar
We have artists from Qatar.
Many artists don’t block me now. Of course, we have female artists from Bahrain, such as Zahra Arafat and Ebtisam Abdullah.
We have
Faisal Rashid and Mohammed Adel
Of course Tara
If it wasn't for Tara, the young people wouldn't have acted.
There are very few jobs in Qatar, we only had two jobs last year.
Qatar TV also produces dramatic works, we can also say that.
Ghat TV is an executive producer.
Of course, Qatar TV did not fail, but it only produced one work a year, and all Qatari actors want to work.
And that was the reason
I saw you in one series and all the artists in Qatar want to work in it.
Even if something happens to someone, they should say Alhamdulillah.
Praise be to God in all circumstances.
Okay, let’s go back to your beginnings then.
I would like to thank him very much, of course.
I consult him on a few things.
Of course, the artist Abdulaziz Jassim is from Hukm Al-Bashar to Another Day to After the Diaspora to Yes and No.
In his plays, we started working with him in the theater on the day Abdulaziz Jassim produced his first executive product. We worked with him both in the theater and on television.
He is the one who adopted us, he is the one who taught us, and he is the one who made us.
Of course, after that, Professor Ghanim did not fail us in the stories of Dunya in Fayez Al-Tosh 2000.
Because honesty gave us opportunities as young people.
They have thirty to thirty-two jobs a year.
So we have two works a year, so thank you, thank you Tara.
Ghatl's feeling is of course the same, produced by Tara for Artistic Production.
The series' director, Professor Mounir Al-Z.
We are back with you, viewers, and today we are talking about reflexology.
Palm massage palm of the hand
This treatment has actually been practiced since ancient times.
And we brought a guest with us
The method of examination is as follows:
A cycle of pain and swelling
You feel it inside your hand, sometimes it feels like sand, like fragmented veins inside your hand.
Let go of my hand
Of course, our brother Sahbi is a bit nervous.
You feel pressure, you are stressed, you have a little stress.
the left side
Of course, dear viewers, I am now examining the left side of his body.
So that they are in the picture
Any health problem that appears now, we know it. We know the headache, we know the dizziness that comes to him.
Ouch, it hurts here.
Doesn't it mean a problem?
What is this problem? What exactly is the problem here?
The pockets here are the ears.
You have a sinus operation or a problem with the oil.
He had an operation a long time ago.
What is a polyp or something?
His weight increases without eating.
Okay, your left shoulder.
This is due to nerves, when you are under stress, it causes tension.
Ten years ago I walked barefoot on the sea.
Okay, we know that when someone walks by the sea, they are expected to empty out like that.
Any uneven surface is not just the sea.
Negative energies that can be boards
He might also be surprised that you discovered these things through massage.
Sure, the most important people are children.
Children, glory be to God, to the mother, focus with me.
He is tired of the milk and the food he uses.
Her son met her and put her in a car, the child automatically got drunk.
Wash your hands
A simple click, Subhan Allah.
After a few seconds, you will notice that the child is happy. At first, he will be in pain and will cry a little because of the pain here.
Then, suddenly, praise be to God, you see the gases coming out.
What discoveries have you made, Professor Abdulaziz?
But less than the other problems now, joints, bones, headaches, thyroid and obesity.
Secondly, as for menstrual pain, or period pain, or period pain in general
Focus on a rock or a stone, or just press here and you will give orders, Subhan Allah, to the lower back and menstrual problems if you have pain.
In a few seconds, God willing, it will disappear.
Pregnant woman
Make it easier for her to give birth.
But here or here, of course, or God knows.
If they tell her that, God willing, she can give birth in the seventh or ninth month
Except on sand
It means walking on sand is fine, but not on rocks.
Break your fast with seven dates, the best being fresh dates.
And if the dates are ripe, it will be enough, God willing.
He also said, "I seek refuge in Allah from Satan, the accursed," and this discovery of mine is, of course, from the Quran.
It means that God was unable to make this fresh date come to her, but he was not unable.
Praise be to God, and I seek refuge in God from the word "I".
Sakhr answers, you answer a small ball.
The bed is a right of childbirth, and it is weak, for example, she came to the delivery bed and held on to the iron.
And you will notice that even in private hospitals, an East Asian woman comes.
Now, God willing, this is actually a tradition in East Asia.
My phone is with you, no need.
Mobile only
Cooperating with each other means that everyone is me. This is my advice to every creature who is listening to me now.
Be sure to give charity and take care of others. You were created to worship God.
Serving people is the first thing. Second, I am not a religious man or a sheikh, I am an ordinary person.
Professor Abdulaziz, I thank you for this good meeting. Of course, thanks to our guest who is with us.
May God give you a thousand blessings. God willing, and good luck.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of Public Health at the Supreme Council of Health, will tell us more about this in detail.
Good morning, Sheikh.
Let’s start by taking a direct look at these events.
The Truth: Healthy Steps Towards Qatar Program
It is a program that is part of the national strategy to address and combat obesity.
This means that four of the world's ten most obese countries are Gulf countries.
So we started a strategy in the Supreme Council of Health, of course in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and other parties, to combat obesity.
Out of fear that it will spread more and more, Fal Fal will be here soon.
One of the programs to protect against obesity is Healthy Steps Towards Qatar.
They are doing this competition together, so it will be an international competition.
Of course, the program is six weeks long.
Every week is different from the next.
To educate seventh and eighth grade students about the importance of health at this age.
Because at first they seem to be worried, meaning they are aware of themselves.
As you remember, the first week was about what your favorite fruit is.
Week 2 Walking
You have to walk, of course. Every time you walk, you get points.
It is a map of Qatar, and every time someone collects points, they apply, their school takes steps forward, and the word "steps" means to move forward.
So there will be a nice competition between the students.
He drinks water in the third week, we don’t want him to drink carbonated water.
So we say that he gets used to drinking water. There is no need for a lot of soda. Every time you get thirsty, you take a soda. No, drink water.
Then we have the fourth week, your favorite sport.
Some people have games at school that they like.
So we are looking for a sport that he likes to play.
So that we can force him to exercise, you know.
The boy is eating a healthy meal.
His family knows that they have to pay attention to their son and make sure he eats a healthy meal.
And Al Jazeera Academy is a boys and girls academy so that we can take
Of course, this is a sample of its success, God willing, we will increase the experience in the coming years.
Of course, the students are happy. I don’t know what their feelings are, but they say we are more active.
We found more games and had more fun with our colleagues.
Girls say that their skin has improved and acne has decreased.
True, true, exactly, he becomes aware.
Parents know about their children.
And their colleagues in the second rows say hello and learn from them, their colleagues and brothers.
And, thank God, it has started to spread that many schools are eager to participate in the next year, starting now, of course.
Inshallah
Of course, the official sponsor was Qtel, who supported this.
We had Aspire Zone, which organized sports competitions for students and raised awareness.
Ala Ala Ala on the dining table means
So, praise be to God, there are several parties, I mean, I mentioned some of them, and maybe I missed some of them.
But thank God, everyone contributed something of their own.
Some of the brothers used to hold competitions on Saturdays.
It was diverse.
We tried to make several types and involve as many people as possible.
It is the generation of the future, you know.
so that this experience can be generalized or spread to the greatest extent possible, for example in Qatar.
So, this is your first time, and there are a few things that need to be adjusted.
It has now spread, thank God, and the results are satisfactory.
God willing, we will publish it, because there are people now who are asking why you didn’t let us in.
If you eat healthy food, you will reach this goal, you will have no problem.
So, at this age, if he starts from a young age, he will achieve what he wants when he is twenty or twenty-five years old.
You mentioned a list of topics, and there was a topic every week.
If we go back, we will try to make our segment today about the conclusion of the events.
And if we go back to remind people, we had more than one guest on our show.
We repeat it again and again every week: what was the information that we wanted to convey to the students?
God willing, my sister, the first thing, of course, is, for example, the favorite fruit in the first week.
Of course, fruits in general, what is a portion of fruit and what are its benefits?
What are the benefits of fruits that contain vitamin C?
So he himself starts to know what he likes in fruit, not all fruit is his enemy.
This means that he may be allergic to one or two types, but why doesn’t he eat the rest?
Week 2: Walking People think that walking is only for the elderly. Why do young people walk?
That means that when I grow up, I will walk.
On the contrary, you walk because it calms the mind and the brain.
It relaxes the human psyche, meaning that walking improves mental clarity.
You used to make them go to the students.
None of them are required to walk, whether at school or at home.
They score their points through class schools.
Because they are not many, I mean, not every day.
There was an event where people organized a march, and the girls' school also organized a march.
We want them to be creative like this, to have innovative ideas.
The spirit of competition and teachers come up with new ideas, we don't want to give them ideas that they can't deviate from.
Everyone had their skills at this point.
Of course, in the third week, I drink water. Of course, we try to make them drink water all the time so that they don’t get thirsty and crave sodaostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostostost rail railCACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACA
Of course, your favorite sport is in the fourth week.
So if we can find out what his favorite sport is and support him in it
He is passionate about sports.
They love sports, he is playing sports without even realizing it.
Since we said before that we will talk about the Qatari Association for Patients with Sclerosis
Let me welcome today’s guest who has enlightened our studio.
Welcome
Welcome to this program with us
This is one of those diseases that many of us have probably never heard of.
As the Egyptians say, we will get straight to the point.
Is it a chronic disease?
affects the nervous system in the human body
The interval affects people between the ages of twenty and forty.
This disease also has no cure so far, and there is no known cause for this disease and its infection.
It affects the active segment of society, which is usually the youth.
Treatments used for cancer patients, may evil and other diseases stay away from you
This disease is an inflammation of the brain nerves and the spinal cord nerves.
It is the central nervous system of the human body.
The body prefers that there is a nearby body, dash body.
A neuron is
The one that covers this electrical wire
White blood cells are the first white blood cells to kill or dissolve this insulating layer.
This leads to the absence, weakness or disruption of the nerve signal.
It leads to paralysis, God forbid.
So far, despite the development of medicine and medical progress, Professor Abdulaziz, we have not yet found a solution to this disease.
Okay, apart from the solution, we want to know how it comes to us.
One must also be cautious about this issue.
The direct cause is the nature of life, the nature of food, the circulations of life.
And what exactly is the direct reason that makes a person susceptible to this disease?
Everything that exists now is just theories.
even by virtue of marriage
They are trying to solve the health problems faced by humans.
Yes, yes.
All these topics may be somewhat controversial in society.
We still don't know the reasons for it.
Okay, the age group that can be affected by this disease, of course, is sclerosis of the nerves.
of both sexes
Of course, after the age of forty, the disease begins to calm down with the person.
But so far we haven’t found a solution to this disease.
Does this mean that there is evidence that there are actually many people, whether in the Gulf, the Arab world, or even let's say in Qatar?
In Saudi Arabia, statistics say that they have twenty-five thousand infected people.
And Qatar too, I mean.
I personally know of three to four very specific cases that were diagnosed just last week.
We currently have one hundred and twenty-five injured people, this is what is recorded in the files.
And there are many people who, when diagnosed with this disease, go for treatments from other countries, for example.
Okay, Professor Abdulaziz, so are there some effects that, for example, a person who has this disease might experience?
Are there any signs that tell the family of the victim or the person himself that I have sclerosis?
And this virus seemed, for example, to kill
Let’s be honest, it’s not a virus.
Because it is a disease of the nerves, the nerves control the entire body.
Let’s go in a certain direction and give a certain reason for a certain place, like the nature of the food and the nature of the place.
I'm sorry, but I need the text to translate it. Please provide the text you would like me to translate into English.
