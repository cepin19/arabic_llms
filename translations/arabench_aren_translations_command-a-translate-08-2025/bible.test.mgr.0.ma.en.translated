At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked him, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” Luke 22:24
He called a little child to him, whom he placed among them.
Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Mark
And whoever humbles humbles humbles humbles humes humes humbles humbles humbles humes humes humbles humbles hmes humes humes humes humes humes humes humbles humbles humbles humbles humes humes humes humes humes humbles humbles humes humes humes humbles humes humes hume hume hume hume hume hume hume hume hume hوم humes humes humes hререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререререре
Whoever welcomes a child like this in my name welcomes me.
And whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone hung around his neck and to be thrown into the sea.
Woe to the people of the world because of the things that cause sin! For these things must happen, but woe to the one who causes them!
Otherwise, if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter eternal life with one hand or one foot than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. When?
Otherwise, your eye will lead you into sin. Gouge it out and throw it away, because it is better for you to enter eternal life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. Matthew 5:29 The purple lamb
Don’t hurt any of these children, because I tell you: their angels in heaven are always with my Father in heaven. [
For the Son of Man came to save those who are lost. # 18.11 This verse is not found in many ancient manuscripts.
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them gets lost, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and look for the lost sheep?
I’ll tell you the truth: if he finds it, he’ll be happier than he was with the 99 that didn’t hurt him.
And so your Father in heaven does not want any of these little ones to perish.” The brother who sinned.
But if your brother sins against you, go and rebuke him in private. If he listens to you, you have won your brother. Luke
But if he refuses to listen, take one or two others along with you, so that every word may be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
But if he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
I tell you the truth: Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. Matthew 16:19; John 20:23
Again I say to you, if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
"For wherever two or three gather in my name, there am I among them." The example of a slave who does not forgive.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?” Luke
Jesus said to him, “I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.”
Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
And when he began to reckon with them, they brought to him a man who owed him millions of dirhams of silver.
And if he had nothing to repay it with, then his master would order him to be sold, along with his wife, his children, and everything he owned, in order to repay the debt.
The slave bowed down to him and said: "Be patient with me, my master, and I will pay you back everything I owe you."
His master had compassion on him, released him, and forgave him the debt.
When that slave left, he met one of his slave friends who owed him a hundred silver dirhams. He grabbed him and hanged him, saying: "Give me back what you owe me!"
And his friend fell at his feet, begging him and saying: Be patient with me and I will give you back what I owe you.
But he didn’t want to, so he took him and threw him in prison until he paid his debt.
When the slaves saw what had happened to their master, they were very sad and went to tell their master everything that had happened.
His master shouted at him and said: "Oh, you bad slave! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me to.
Why didn’t you have mercy on your friend, the slave, just as I had mercy on you?
His master was worried, so he sent him to prison to be tortured until he paid his debt.
This is how your Father in heaven will treat you, unless you forgive each other from the heart.
Chapter 19 Jesus teaches about divorce
And when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judaea beyond Jordan.
Many groups of people followed him and he healed them.
Then the Pharisees came to him, to test him, and said, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?”
He answered them and said: “Haven’t you read in God’s book that God created man from the desert, male and female?”
And he said: This is why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and they will become one being.
And so they will no longer be two, but will become one. What God has joined together, man cannot separate.
The Pharisees also asked him, “Why did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?” Matthew
Jesus answered them: “Because of your hardness of heart, Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but it was not so from the beginning when God created Adam and Eve.”
I’m telling you that anyone who divorces his wife for any reason other than immorality and marries another woman is committing adultery.” Matthew 5:32; 1 Corinthians 7:10, 11
The students said to him: "If this is the situation between a man and a woman, it is better for him not to get married at all."
Jesus answered them, “Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it is given.
For there are eunuchs who have been born that way from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who have been made that way by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves that way for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.” Jesus blesses the little children.
People brought him some small children so that he could lay his hands on them and pray with them, and the students scolded them for bringing them.
But Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”
He put his hands on them and walked away from there. The young man who was well dressed.
And a young man came to him and said, “O teacher, what good deed can I do to have eternal life?”
Jesus answered him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? Only God is good. If you want to enter eternal life, obey the commandments.”
He asked him, “What commandments?” Jesus replied, “Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony,
“Love your father and your mother, and love your neighbour as you love yourself.”
The young man said to him: “I have followed all these commandments, so what else do I need?”
Jesus answered, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”
But when the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.
Jesus said to his disciples: “Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.
And I will tell you more: It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God!
The disciples were amazed when they heard these words and said, “Who then can be saved?”
Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”
Peter answered him, “We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?”
Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. Matthew
Whoever gives up his house, his brothers, his sisters, his father, his mother, his children, or his land for my name’s sake will receive a hundred times more and will inherit eternal life from God.
Many of those who are first will become last, and many of those who are last will become first.”—Matthew 20:16; Luke 13:30.
Chapter Twenty An example of work in a vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who owned a vineyard and went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He gave them a dinar a day and sent them to his garden.
He left at nine in the morning and found other servants standing in the market without work.
He said to them: Go until you reach my garden, and I will pay you what you deserve.
And they went. And he went out again at noon, and went out again at three o'clock, and hired other workers.
He went out again about five o’clock in the evening and found other workers standing there, and he said to them, ‘Why have you been standing here all day with nothing to do?’
They answered him: “Because no one has ever employed us.” He said to them: “Well, go and work in my garden.”
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.’
And those who were hired at the fifth hour came, and they each received a denarius.
When the first ones came, they thought they would be paid extra, but they too were only paid one dinar each.
And when they got paid, they started complaining about the owner of the place.
And they say: those others only worked one hour and you paid them the same as us, even though we worked all day in the sun.
He answered the king's servant, one of them, and said to him: I didn't wrong you, my friend, didn't we agree on a dinar?
Take your right and go away! And that's what came last, I wanted to give it to him like you.
“Don’t I have the right to do whatever I want with my money? Or are you jealous because I’m generous?”
Jesus added: “So the last will be first, and the first will be last.” Matthew 19:30; Mark 10:31; Luke 13:30 Jesus predicts his death and resurrection for the third time.
Now when Jesus was on his way up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside by themselves, and said to them along the way:
“Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death.”
And they will hand him over to men who do not know God, who will mock him, beat him, and crucify him, and on the third day he will rise from the dead.” The mother of James and John asks Jesus for her sons.
The mother of Zebedee’s sons came to Jesus with her sons and knelt down to ask him for a favor.
And he said to her, "What do you want?" And she said to him, "Order that my two sons sit, one on your right and the other on your left, in your kingdom."
Jesus answered them, “You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am to drink?” They said to him, “We are able!”
And he said to them: “Yes, you will drink the cup, but the seats on my right and on my left are not mine to give; they belong to those for whom my Father has prepared them.”
When the ten disciples heard this, they became very angry with James and John.
Jesus called them together and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. Luke
And this should not be so among you. But whoever wants to be great among you must become your servant. Matthew
Whoever among you wants to be first must be your slave.
And so man was born not to be served by people, but to serve and to give his life for many people.” Jesus heals two blind men.
As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Jesus.
And there were two blind men sitting by the roadside. And when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!”
And although the people tried to silence them, they cried out even more loudly, saying, “Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!”
Jesus stood up and called out to them, “What do you want me to do for you?”
They answered him: "We want our eyes to be opened, sir!"
And Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their sight returned, and they followed him.
Chapter Twenty-One Jesus Enters Jerusalem
And when they drew near unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two of his disciples,
He said to them: "Go to the village in front of you, you will find a donkey tied up with a colt, untie them and bring them to me."
And if someone says something to you, tell him: "The Lord needs them, and He will return them quickly."
All this happened so that the words of the prophet who said this would come true:
“Tell the daughter of Zion, ‘Look, your king is coming to you, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’”
The disciples went and did what Jesus had commanded them.
They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their clothes on them, and Jesus sat on them.
A large group of people spread their clothes on the road, while others cut tree branches and spread them on the road.
The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted: “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!” (Matthew 21:9)
And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and said, “Who is this?”
The crowd answered them, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.” Jesus drove the merchants and traders out of God’s house.
Jesus entered the temple and drove out all those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of the dove sellers.
He said to them: "It is written in the Book of God that my house will be called the House of Prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves!"
Blind and lame people came to him in the house of God, and he healed them.
But the chief priests and the teachers of the law were worried when they saw the miracles Jesus did and heard the children shouting in the temple area, “Hail to the Son of David!”
And he said to him, “Do you hear what these people are saying?” And Jesus answered them, saying, “Yes. Have you never read in the Scriptures: ‘Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise for yourself?’”
And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there. Jesus curses the fig tree
And in the morning, when he was returning to the city, he became hungry.
As he saw a fig tree by the road, he went to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then Jesus said to it, “May you never bear fruit again!” And the fig tree withered at that moment.
When the students saw what had happened, they were amazed and said: "How did the vine dry up so quickly?"
Jesus answered them, “Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done. Matthew
“And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.” Who gave Jesus this authority?
And when Jesus came to the temple and taught, the leaders of the priests and the elders of the people came to him and said, “By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave it to you?”
Jesus answered and said to them, “I also will ask you one question; then if you tell Me the answer, I will tell you by what authority I do these things:
Where did John’s baptism come from? Was it from God or from people?” They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From God,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’”
Otherwise, we would have said that it came from the people, and we would have been afraid of the people, because they consider John a prophet.”
And they answered Jesus and said to him, "We do not know." He said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." The parable of the two sons
What do you think about a man who had two sons, and he went to the first one and said to him: Go, my son, and work today in my vineyard.
His son answered him and said: I don’t want to. But he regretted it in the end and went.
The father went to the second boy and said the same thing to him, and he answered him and said: Okay, sir! But he didn’t go.
“So which of these two did the will of his father?” They said to him, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you.”
Why? Because John # 21.32 refers to John the Baptist. He came to you to show you the way of truth, but you did not believe him. However, tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. Even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.” Luke 3:12; 7:29,30 The example of the vineyard and the gardeners
Listen to another example: There was a man who had a piece of land, planted a vineyard, built a wall around it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, rented it to some farmers, and went on a journey.
And when the time came to harvest the grapes, he sent his slaves to the gardeners to collect his harvest.
The gardeners rose up, captured the slaves, beat one, killed another, and stoned another to death.
And he sent out more servants than the first, and they did to them as they had done to the others.
Finally, he sent his son to them and said: They will respect my son.
But when the gardeners saw the son of the garden owner, they said to each other: "This is the one who will inherit! Let's kill him and take his inheritance!"
They grabbed him, took him outside the vineyard and killed him.
Ewa, if the owner of the vineyard comes, what should he do to those gardeners?
They answered him: “These wicked people will have a bad end, and he will give the vineyard to other gardeners who will give the fruit in its time.”
Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures: ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?”
That is why I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.
And whoever falls on this rock will be broken to pieces, and whoever the rock falls on will be crushed.
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they knew he was talking about them.
Then they began to look for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because they regarded him as a prophet.
Chapter Twenty-Two: The Wedding Reception Example
And Jesus spoke to the crowd again, saying:
“The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
He sent his slaves to call the guests, but they did not want to come.
And he sent other slaves again and told them: "Tell those who were invited: I have prepared the wedding and slaughtered the sheep and the fat calves, everything is ready, so come to the wedding!"
But they didn’t treat him there. Some went to their farms, and some went to buy and sell.
Two other men on display seized their slaves, insulted them and killed them.
The king was worried, so he sent his army, killed those murderers and burned their city.
He tells his slaves: the wedding is there, but those we invited don’t deserve it.
Ewa sirou daba lfin kaytlaqaw tri9an o3ardou 3la kol wahd li9itouh l3ars.
The slaves went out into the streets and gathered everyone they could find, both good and bad people, until the wedding house was full of guests.
When the king came to see the guests, he saw a man who was not wearing wedding clothes.
He said to him: How did you get in here, my friend, when you're not wearing wedding clothes? The man fell silent because he had nothing to say.
And the king said to the servants, ‘Tie him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.’ When?
Many have been exposed, but few have been chosen." Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot how they might trap him in his words.
And they sent to him some of their disciples, together with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone’s opinion, for you do not show partiality to people.”
Come on, tell us what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”
Jesus knew their wickedness and said to them, “Why do you test me, you hypocrites?”
“Give me the money you pay taxes with!” They gave him a dinar.
Ask them: “Whose picture and writing is this on the money?”
He said to them, "Whose is it?" They said, "Caesar's." He said to them, "Then give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
And when they heard him, they were amazed, and they left him and went away. The question is about the mission of the dead.
Then some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him a question,
"Sir, Moses said that if a man dies and leaves no children, his brother must marry his wife to have children in his brother’s name."
We were seven siblings. The eldest got married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother so that he could marry her.
And so it happened to the second, the third, and even the seventh.
And finally, after they all died, the woman died too.
So who among these seven will be this woman’s husband on the Day of Resurrection? Because they were all her husbands.
Jesus answered and said to them, “You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.
On the Day of Resurrection, people will neither marry nor be married, but will be like angels in heaven.
As for the mission of the dead, have you not read God's words to you when He said:
I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”
When the crowds heard this, they were amazed at his teaching. The Greatest Commandment
When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
And one of them, a lawyer, asked Jesus a question to test him, saying,
"Sir, what is the greatest commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.”
This is the great and first testament.
The second commandment is the same: Love your neighbor as yourself.
And on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.” Luke 10:25–28 Jesus and the Prophet David
And when the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
“What do you say about the Messiah? Whose son is he?” They said, “He is the son of David.”
He asks them: “So how did David receive the revelation of the Spirit of God when God called him, saying:
The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.
“Ewa, if David calls Christ his Lord, how can Christ be his son?”
And not one of them was able to answer him with a word, nor from that day on did anyone dare to ask him any more questions.
Chapter Twenty-Three: Jesus warns his disciples to beware of the scribes and Pharisees.
And Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples,
He said: “The scholars of the law and the Pharisees are the ones who have the right to interpret the law of Moses.”
Do everything they tell you to do and follow it, but don’t do what they do, because they don’t do what they say.
They pack heavy and difficult loads to carry and put them on people's shoulders, but they don't move a finger to help carry them.
Otherwise, they do something only to be seen by people, they widen the bands on their arms and foreheads, and they lengthen their robes.
And they like to be in the best places at parties, and in the first places in houses of worship,
And people like to greet them in the markets and call them: Sir.
But don’t let anyone call you that, sir, because you are all brothers and you have one master.
And don’t call anyone on earth your father, because you have only one father, and he is in heaven.
And don’t let anyone call you ‘teacher’, for you have only one teacher, the Messiah.
The greatest among you shall be your servant. Matthew
For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted. Luke 14:11; 18:14
But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither enter in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. [
But woe unto you, ye lawyers and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: therefore ye shall receive the greater condemnation.] # 23.14 This verse is not found in many ancient manuscripts.
Woe unto you, ye doctors of the law and Pharisees, ye hypocrites! For ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more a son of hell than yourselves.
Woe unto you, blind officials! You say that whoever swears by the House of God, his oath is not accepted, but whoever swears by the gold of the House of God must fulfill his oath.
Oh, these are fools and blind people! But Hassan, is gold or the house of God that returns gold sacred?
And I say again: the one who swears by the altar, his oath is not accepted, but the one who swears by the gift that is above it, he must fulfill his oath.
Oh, you blind people! Why is it not good? Is it the sacrifice, or the altar that makes the sacrifice sacred?
Because when someone swears by the slaughterhouse, they swear by it and everything that’s above it.
And whoever swears by the House of God, swears by it and by God who dwells within it.
But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne: Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. Matthew 5:34
Woe unto you, O scholars of the law and hypocritical Pharisees! You tithe mint, dill, and cumin, but you neglect the more important aspects of the law, which are justice, mercy, and faith. You ought to have done these things without neglecting the others.
Oh, you blind officials! You are filtering water from mosquitoes, but you are swallowing a camel.
Woe unto you, ye doctors of the law and Pharisees, ye hypocrites! You clean the cup and the platter on the outside, but within they are full of that which comes from theft and greed.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside may become clean as well.
Woe unto you, ye lawyers and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness. The works
And so you are finished, you appear to people from the outside as God-fearing, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and sins.
Woe unto you, O scholars of the law and hypocritical Pharisees! You build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the gardens of the righteous,
And we say: If we had lived in the time of our ancestors, we would not have participated in the killing of the prophets at all.
And thus you bear witness against yourselves that you are the sons of those who killed the prophets.
Go on and finish what your ancestors started.
Oh, you sons of snakes, the Hanash tribe! How will you escape the torment of Hell? When?
That is why I will send you prophets, sages and scholars of the law, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some of whom you will beat in your places of worship and chase from town to town.
May the punishment for all the innocent blood that has been shed on the earth come down upon you, from the blood of Abel, who was a worshipper of God, to the blood of Zechariah, son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.
And I tell you the truth: all this punishment will fall on this generation!" Jesus' love for Jerusalem
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you! How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling.
And your house will remain a ruin for you.
And I say to you: you will not see me again until you say: 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'
Chapter 24 Jesus predicts the destruction of God's house
And Jesus went out and walked to the house of God, and his disciples came to him to show him the building of the house of God.
Jesus said to them, “Do you see all these things? Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.” Signs of the End Times
As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”
Jesus answered them, “Take care that no one leads you astray.
For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ!’ and they will mislead many.
And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
Where people will attack people, and a kingdom will attack a kingdom, and there will be famine, and earthquakes will strike many places.
But all this is just the beginning of the pain.
At that time they will deliver you up to be tortured and will put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of my name. When?
Then many people will lose their faith, sell each other out and hate each other.
And they have hidden many false prophets and will mislead many people.
And because of the many sins, the love of many people will grow cold.
But the one who remained steadfast until the end was that Ginga. When?
And the good news of the Kingdom of God will be proclaimed throughout the world, as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.” The great tribulation
And when you see the abomination of desolation in the holy place, which was spoken of by the prophet Daniel - he who reads, let him understand!
At that time, those in the land of Judea will flee to the mountains.
And the one on the roof should not come down to take what is in his house. Luke
And whoever was in the field would not turn back to get his cloak.
And woe to pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days.
Try not to escape in winter or on a Saturday.
And you will lose time, a great disaster will occur, the likes of which have never been seen since God created the world until now, and it will never happen again. The vision.
If God had not shortened those days, no human being would have survived. But because of those whom God chose on that day, the days will be shortened.
And if anyone says to you then: 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or 'There he is!' do not believe it.
For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
Ewa, I already told you before.
But if they tell you: He is in the desert! Do not go out, or he is in the inner houses! Do not believe them. Luke
For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
“Wherever there is a dead body, the vultures gather.” Luke 17:37 The coming of the Son of Man
3:15; Revelation 6:12; 3:15; Revelation 6:13 “And after these calamities of those days, the sun will quickly darken, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.”
And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. The vision
And He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His chosen ones from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.” The Parable of the Vineyard
Learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
And so, when you see all these things happening, know that he is near, even at the doors.
I’ll tell you the truth: this generation will not end until all these things happen.
The way of heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. The day and hour are unknown.
But about that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be at the coming of the Son of Man.
For the people of old, before the Flood, were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the Ark.
They did not know what would happen until the flood came and swept them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
At that time there will be two in the field; one will be taken and the other left.
There will be two women grinding at the mill; one will be taken and the other left.
Keep awake, because you do not know on which day your Lord will come.
And you should know that if the owner of the house knew what time the thief would come at night, he would stay up and not let him rob his house. Luke
That is why you must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.” The parable of the faithful servant.
And who is the wise and faithful servant whom his master has put in charge of his household slaves to give them food at the right time?
Blessed is that servant whom his master will find doing his work when he comes.
I’ll tell you the truth: it will cost him everything he owns.
But if that slave was ugly, he would have thought to himself: My master will be delayed in his return.
He started beating his slave friends and eating and drinking with the drunks.
One day, Gigi will be rid of that slave who is of no use to her, at a time she doesn’t know.
He will punish him severely and put him with the hypocrites. That is when there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
Chapter Twenty-Five An example of ten single women
And your time will be like the kingdom of heaven, which is like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Luke
And five of them were foolish, and five were wise.
And shake those five lanterns without taking too much oil with them.
But the five wise ones took their lamps and oil with them in bottles.
When the groom got tired, all the single women started to laugh until they fell asleep.
And in the middle of the night, you hear one loud voice saying: Here comes the groom, go out to meet him!
They woke up all the bachelors and found their lanterns.
The fools said to the wise: Give us some of your oil because our lamps are about to go out.
But the wise women answered them and said: It might not be enough for us and you, go and buy it from those who sell it.
And when they were going to buy oil, the groom came, and those who were present for the wedding went in with him and the door was closed.
Then the other virgins returned and said: O Lord, O Lord, open for us! Luke
But the groom answered them and said: The truth is, I don’t know you.
That is why you must stay awake, because you do not know either the day or the hour [when the Son of Man will come]. # 25.13 The end of this verse is not found in many ancient manuscripts.
"The kingdom of heaven is like a man who was going on a journey, and he called his servants and entrusted them with his money," Luke. The parable of the bags of money.
And he gave five bags of money to one, two to another, and one bag to a third, each according to his ability. Then he left on a journey.
And the one who received five bags of money went off and traded with them and made another five bags.
And the one who took two bags also won two other bags.
But the one who took one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master’s bag.
And after a long time, the master of those slaves came back and settled accounts with them.
And the one who took five bags came to him and paid him another five bags and said: "You gave me five bags, sir, so here are the other five bags I won as a bonus."
His master said to him: I have nothing to ask you, you are a good and honest servant! You were honest with me in little things, and now I will entrust you with much more. Come and rejoice with your master.
Then the one who took two bags came back and said: “Sir, you gave me two bags, so here are two more that I won in addition.”
And his master said to him: I have nothing to ask you, you are a good and honest servant! You were honest with me in little things, and now I will entrust you with much more. Come and rejoice with your master.
Then the one who took one bundle came to him and said: Sir, I know that you are a tough man, you reap what you have not sown and you gather what you have not done.
And that's why I was scared and went to hide your bundle in the ground. Now here is your fortune.
And his master answered him and said to him: But you are an ugly and insolent slave! Don't you know that I reap what I have not sown and gather what I have not planted?
You should have put my money with the money traders, so that when I come back I can take it with its profit.
Take this bag from him and give it to the one who has ten bags.
Wherever there is someone who has something, he will be given more than he needs. And whoever has nothing, even what he has will be taken away from him. When?
And this servant who is good for nothing, throw him out into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” Matthew 8:12; 22:13; Luke 13:28 The Son of Man will judge the nations.
“But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit upon the throne of his glory. When
And all the people will gather before him, and he will separate them from one another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He shall place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.
For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me,
And I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.
At that time, those who have fulfilled God’s will will answer and say: O Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you something to drink?
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you? Or naked and we clothed you?
When did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?
And the king will answer them and say to them: I tell you the truth: Every time you did this to one of my brothers who are of low status, you did it to me!
And say to those on His left: ‘Away with you! You are accursed, into the everlasting Fire prepared for Iblis and his hosts.’
For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not come to me.
And then they will answer him and say: O Lord! When did we see you hungry or thirsty, or a stranger or naked, or sick or in prison, and did not help you?
The king will answer them and say: I’ll tell you the truth: if you didn’t do this to these people of low status, you didn’t do it to me.
These will go to eternal torment, and those who do God’s will will go to eternal life.
Chapter Twenty-six: The Jews of Ketsha'uru plotted to kill Jesus
And when Jesus had finished all these words, he said to his disciples,
“As you know, the Passover is two days away—and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.”
And they spent the night gathering the chief priests and the elders of the people in the house of Caiaphas, the high priest.
And they conspired together to arrest Jesus by deceit and kill him.
But he said, "We will not do this during the feast, lest a riot arise among the people." The woman who poured perfume on Jesus.
And as Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,
A woman with a bottle of very expensive perfume came up to him and poured it on his head while he was sitting at the dinner table. Luke
When his students saw what he had done, they were not pleased and said: “Why this waste?”
“This scent could have been sold at a high price, and the money could have been distributed to the poor.”
When Jesus realized what they were discussing, he said to them, “Why do you embarrass this woman? She has done a good deed for me.
The poor will always be with you, but I will not always be with you.
She poured this scent all over my body, she poured it to prepare me for the burial.
I tell you the truth: wherever this good news is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done will be told in memory of her." The traitor Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
And then one of the twelve disciples, whom I called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
And he said to them, “What will you give me if I hand him over to you?” And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus. The Passover meal with the disciples
On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?”
He answered and said to them, “Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, ‘The Teacher says, My time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.’”
And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover meal.
And when the time for the evening meal came, Jesus sat down at the table with the twelve disciples.
While they were eating, he said, “I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me.”
The students were very sad and each of them began to ask: “Is it me, sir?”.
He answered them and said: "The one who has his hand in the dish with me, that is the one who will betray me!"
The Son of Man will die as it is written about him in the Book of God, but woe to that man who will betray the Son of Man. It would have been better for him if he had not been born.
Judas, who had agreed to betray him, asked him, "Is it me, Lord?" Jesus replied, "You have said it." The Lord's Supper
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks to God, broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take it; this is my body.”
Then he took the cup, thanked God, gave it to them and said: “Drink from it, all of you.”
For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
And I tell you: I will not drink this grape juice again until the day I drink it with you again in my father’s kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus predicts that Peter will deny him.
Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away tonight; for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’
But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee." Matthew
Peter replied, “Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will.”
Jesus said to him, “Truly I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”
Peter replied, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.” And all the other disciples said the same thing. Jesus prays in the Garden of Gethsemane
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”
Then he took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him. And he began to feel sorrow and distress.
He said to them, “My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me!”
Then he went a little further, fell on his knees and began to pray: “Father! If it is possible, let this cup pass from me, but not as I will, but as you will.”
Then he returned to the disciples and found them asleep, and he said to Peter, “Couldn’t you stay awake with me for one hour?
“Stay awake and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”
He walked for the second time, prayed and said: “Oh father! If this ordeal could not pass me by without me experiencing it, then let it be your will.”
He came back and found them asleep, for sleep had overcome them.
He left them and went away again, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.
Then he came to his disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Let’s go! There’s the one who’s going to hand me over. Jesus is arrested.
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived with a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and elders of the people.
And the one who handed him over had given them a sign, saying, “The man I will kiss is the one; arrest him!”
Then Judas, the one who betrayed him, came near Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him.
And Jesus said to him, "Why have you come, my friend?" And they came near to Jesus and seized him.
Then one of those who were with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.”
Do you think I can’t call my father right now and he’ll send me more than twelve squads of angelic soldiers?
But how will the words of God's book, which say that this is how it should be, come true?
At that time Jesus said to the crowd, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me, as though I were a thief? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me.” Luke
But all this happened so that what was written in the prophets' books would come true.” Then all the students left him and ran away. Jesus in the Jewish court
But those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the high priest’s courtyard. He went in and sat down with the guards to see how it would end.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But they didn’t find any, even though they brought many false witnesses. In the end, two witnesses came forward.
And they say: "This man said: 'I can destroy the house of God and then I will rebuild it in a few days.'" John
He then called the chief priests and asked Jesus, “Are you not going to answer anything to what these men testify against you?”
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, “I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.”
Jesus answered him, “You have said it yourself. But I tell you: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty and coming on the clouds of heaven!”
At that moment, the head of the clergy took off his clothes and said: “This is blasphemy! We don’t need witnesses anymore, you have all heard his blasphemous words.”
“What do you think of Ewa?”, they asked. They answered and said: “He deserves to die!”
They poured water on his face, beat him, and some of them slapped him.
And they said, "Tell us, Christ, who hit you?" Peter denies Jesus.
Peter was out in the courtyard when a servant came to him and said, “You were with Jesus of Galilee too!”
He denied it in front of everyone present and said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about!”
Then he went to the entrance of the house, and another servant saw him and said to those who were there: “This man was also with Jesus of Nazareth!”
And Peter denied it again, and swore, “I do not know the man!”
Then the men standing there said to Peter, “You must be one of them too, because your accent gives you away.”
He started cursing and swearing, saying, “I don’t even know this man!” And at that moment, the rooster crowed.
Peter thought about what Jesus had said to him: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” Then he went outside and wept bitterly.
Chapter Twenty-Seven
Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people reached an agreement to put Jesus to death.
They bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor. Judas Iscariot hanged himself.
And when Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus had been condemned, he repented and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders. Acts
He told them: “I feel guilty because I handed over an innocent man.” They told him: “It’s not our problem, you figure it out.”
And Judah cast the silver shekel into the temple of God, and then went and hanged himself.
The religious leaders took the silver and said: “It is not permissible to put it in the house of God, because it is the price of human blood.”
They agreed to buy Fadan El Fakhar with it and turn it into a garden for foreigners.
That is why people call this field the field of blood to this day.
At that time the word that the Lord spoke through Jeremiah the prophet will be fulfilled: “They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel,
And with it he bought the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.” Jesus before Pontius Pilate
Jesus stood before the governor who questioned him, saying, “Are you the king of the Jews?” Jesus replied, “You have said so.”
And when the religious leaders and elders accused him, he didn’t even answer them.
Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear all the evidence they are bringing against you?”
But Jesus did not answer him a single word, so the governor was very surprised.
It was the governor's custom at every Passover to release one prisoner, the one the people wanted.
Now at that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Jesus Barabbas.
When the people had gathered, Pilate asked them, “Whom do you want me to release to you: Jesus Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?”
When Pilate realized that it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him,
Now when Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man; for last night I suffered greatly in a dream because of him.”
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask Pilate to release Barabbas and kill Jesus.
Pilate asked them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” “Barabbas,” they answered.
Then Pilate said to them, “What shall I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?” They all said, “Crucify him!”
And he said to them, “What evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Crucify him!”
When Pilate saw that he could do nothing, but that the crowd was becoming more and more agitated, he took some water and washed his hands in front of the people, saying, “I am innocent of this man’s blood; you must deal with him yourselves!”
The whole people answered him and said: “Just let his blood be on us and on our children!”
Then he released Barabbas to them, but after having Jesus flogged, he handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor’s palace, and they gathered the whole cohort around him.
They stripped him and dressed him in a red burnous.
They plaited a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put a reed in his right hand, and they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”
They rushed at him, took the flute and hit him on the head with it.
After they laughed at him, they took off his cloak, put his clothes back on him, and led him away to be crucified. Jesus is crucified.
As they led him away, they seized a man, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the countryside, and they laid the cross on him, and made him carry it behind Jesus.
They arrived at the place called Golgotha, which means the place of the skull.
They gave him wine mixed with a herb called al-Mirr to drink, but when he tasted it, he did not want to drink it.
They crucified him, and divided his clothes among themselves, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take.
And they stayed there, guarding him.
And they put over his head a sign with the charge against him. It read, “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.”
At that time two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
And the people passing by would insult him while they turned their heads.
And they said: "O you who would destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days, save yourself, if you are the Son of God, and come down from the cross!" Matthew
And even the religious leaders, the scholars of Islamic law, and the sheikhs would laugh at him and say:
Other people were saved, but he couldn't save himself! If he was the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now and we will believe in him!
Yak, he put his trust in God! Now he will be freed if God wants it, because he said: I am the son of God!
Even the thieves who were crucified with him mocked him like the others. The death of Jesus
And darkness fell over the whole country from noon until three in the afternoon.
At about three o'clock in the afternoon, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lima sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
Some of those who were standing there heard him and said, “He is calling for Elijah.”
One of them ran, took a piece of cloth, soaked it in vinegar, put it on the end of a reed and gave it to him to drink.
And they said to one another, “Leave him alone and let’s see if Elijah comes to save him!”
And again, Gut cried out to Jesus in a loud voice and died.
The foundations of the House of God were divided into two, from top to bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks split.
And the graves will be sweet and you will send many holy people from death.
And they came out of the graves after Jesus' resurrection from the dead, and entered into the holy city of Jerusalem, and appeared unto many.
And when the centurion and those who were with him, guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified and said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”
And there were also many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee, who were ministering to Him; and they were standing at a distance, watching these things. Luke
among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. The tomb of Jesus
Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Joseph, a man of good standing and a member of the Council, who was also a disciple of Jesus.
Then this man came and said to Pilate, “Give me Jesus’ body.” And Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
And God took Joseph’s soul and wrapped her in pure linen.
He placed it in the new tomb he had carved out of the rock, rolled a large stone over the tomb's entrance, and walked away.
And Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb. The guard was at the tomb.
The next day, which is the day after the day they prepare for the Sabbath, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate.
And they said to him, "We thought, sir, that this liar, when he was alive, said that he would be sent away after three days. When?
Ewa, give your order to guard the tomb until the third day, so that his disciples do not come at night to steal it and tell the people: "He has risen from the dead!" And this last lie will be worse than the first one.
Then Pilate said to them, “You have a guard; go and guard the tomb as you see fit.”
Then they sealed the tomb and put a guard around it.
Chapter Twenty-Eight: Jesus Followed from the Dead
And when the sabbath was over, and the dawn of the first day of the week had come, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
And suddenly there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it.
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing was white as snow.
The guards trembled with fear and became like the dead.
But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.
The way is not here, because it follows death, as he said. Come and see the place where he was put.
He went quickly and told his students that he had escaped death and would meet them in Galilee, where they would see him. Well, I have told you.”
And the women came out of the tomb quickly, afraid yet very happy, and ran to tell his disciples.
And Jesus met them and said, “Peace be unto you!” And they came up to him, took hold of his feet, and worshipped him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me." The guards reported what had happened.
And when the women had gone, some of the tomb’s guards went to the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened.
They gathered with the elders and consulted on this matter, and they bribed the military with a lot of money.
He told them: “Tell them that his students came at night and stole him while we were asleep.”
Otherwise, the governor will hear about it. We will convince him, and nothing bad will happen to you.”
The guards took the money and did as they were told, and this story has been told among the Jews to this day. Jesus gives orders to his disciples.
But the disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain, as Jesus had instructed them, when
And when they saw it, they worshipped it, although some of them were averse.
Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me by God.
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Acts
And teach them to do everything I have commanded you, and I will be with you always, until the end of time.
Chapter One John the Baptist Prepares the Way for Jesus
This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah:
A voice cried out in the wilderness: “Behold, I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.”
And so John came to the desert, baptizing people and telling them about the baptism of repentance, so that God would forgive their sins. Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
Then the people of Judea and Jerusalem went out to him; and he baptized them in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
John the Baptist wore clothes made of camel's hair, had a leather belt around his waist, and ate locusts and wild honey.
He went on to tell the people: “After me will come one who is stronger than I am, and I am not worthy to bend down and untie his sandals.”
I baptised you with water, but he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit." John baptises Jesus
And Jesus, when he was baptized, came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in Jordan.
And it was at that moment, when he came out of the water, that he saw the sky open up and the Spirit of God descending upon him like a dove.
And a voice from heaven said, “This is my dearly loved Son, who makes me happy.” Matthew 3:17; 12:18; Mark 9:7; Luke 3:22 Satan tempts Jesus
And you are worth the time when the Spirit of God, Jesus, went out into the desert.
And he stayed there for forty days, and the devil tempted him. The beasts were around him and the angels mocked him. Jesus preached in Galilee.
And after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God,
And he said, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel." Matthew 3:2 Jesus chooses his first disciples
As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”
Then they left their nets and followed him.
Then He saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat mending their nets.
And Jesus called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and followed him. And Jesus healed a man with an unclean spirit.
And they went to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.
People were amazed by his teaching, because he taught them like someone who had authority, not like the teachers of the law. When
There was a man in the mosque who was possessed by a jinn, and he started shouting.
And they said, “What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: you are the Holy One of God!”
Jesus stood up and said to the demon, “Be silent and come out of the man!”
The jinn threw the man to the ground and he started rolling around. The jinn screamed loudly and came out of him.
And the people were all amazed and began to ask one another, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.”
And the fame of Jesus spread quickly throughout the whole region of Galilee. Jesus healed Peter’s mother-in-law and many other people.
And Jesus went out with James and John from the place of prayer, and they walked to the house of Simon and Andrew.
And there was a woman named Susanna, who was sick with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.
He came closer to her, grabbed her hand and she got up. The heat left her and she served them.
When evening came, after sunset, they brought to him all who were sick and those who were possessed by demons.
And all the people of the city had gathered near the door.
Jesus healed many people of many diseases, and drove out many demons from people, and did not allow the demons to speak because they knew him. Jesus was teaching.
And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed.
Simon and those who were with him went out looking for him.
When they found him, they said to him: "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus said to them, “Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.”
And he went about preaching in their synagogues, and casting out devils in all the region of Galilee. Matthew 4:23; 9:35 Jesus heals a leprous man
And a leper came to Jesus, knelt down, and said to him, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”
He felt sorry for him, reached out his hand, touched him and said to him: “I wanted it, so be pure!”
And then the leprosy left him and he became pure.
And Jesus strictly ordered him not to tell anyone, and sent him away.
“Be careful not to tell anyone anything! But go and show yourself to the priest and offer the purification that Moses prescribed, so that it may serve as a testimony to them.”
But that man went out and began to tell people everything that had happened, and the news spread. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter any town openly, but stayed outside in deserted places. And people came to him from all directions.
Chapter Two Jesus Heals a Paralytic
After a few days Jesus returned to Capernaum, and word got around that he was at home.
A large crowd gathered, so that there was no more room even at the door. And he began to teach them God’s word.
And they brought him a paralyzed man carried by four men.
And when they couldn’t get close to him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof above the place where he was sitting, made an opening, and lowered the bed on which the paralysed man was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralysed man, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”
And they were sitting, then some scholars of the Sharia came and said to themselves:
“Why does this man speak like this and say blasphemous words? Who can forgive sins other than God alone?”
Jesus immediately knew in his spirit what they were thinking, and said to them, “Why do you have these thoughts in your hearts?
As for Suhail, it is said to the paralyzed person: your sins are forgiven, but it is not said to him: get up, take your bed and go?
But you must know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” Then he said to the paralytic:
Let me tell you: get up, take your stuff and go home!
The man got up, rolled up his mat and walked out in front of the people. They were all amazed and praised God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!” Jesus calls Matthew
And Jesus returned to the Sea of Galilee, and the crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.
And as he passed by, he saw a man named Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office. And he said to him, “Follow me.” And he arose and followed him.
While Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.
When the scribes of the Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
Jesus heard them and said to them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.” The question of fasting
And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and said to Jesus, “Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”
Jesus answered them, “Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
But the time will come when the groom will be chosen from among them, and on that day they will fast.
No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If they do, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.
And no one puts new wine into old leather wineskins, because if he does that, the new wine will tear the wineskins, and the wine will spill and the wineskins will be lost.

He said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
Where man was born, God is even the God of Saturday.
Chapter 3 Jesus as a Healer on the Sabbath
Jesus entered the house of prayer again, and there was a man there whose hand was paralysed.
The Pharisees kept a close watch on Jesus to see if he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they could accuse him.
And Jesus said to the man with the withered hand, “Stand up in the middle!”
And He said to the Pharisees, “Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life or to kill?” But they were silent.
He looked at them angrily and sorrowfully, because of the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man, “Stretch out your hand!” He stretched it out, and it was restored.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill him. And a great multitude followed him.
And Jesus went out with his disciples to the side of the Sea of Galilee, and many people from Galilee and Judea followed them.
And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.
He told his students to prepare a boat for him so that people would not crowd around him. Mark
He healed many of them, so much so that the sick began to crowd around him to touch him.
And when the possessed saw Jesus, they fell at his feet and cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus warned them and told them not to say who he was. Jesus chose the twelve apostles.
He went up a mountain and called to the men he had chosen, and they came to him.
And he chose twelve, whom he called apostles, to be with him and to send them out to preach.
And they have the power to take the crazy people out.
And these are the twelve: Simon, whom Jesus named Peter,
And James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, whom Jesus surnamed Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder,
And Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot;
And Judas Iscariot, who will betray Jesus. Jesus and Beelzebub
Then Jesus went home, and a crowd gathered again, so that they could not even eat.
When Jesus’ family heard about this, they went to take him away, saying, “He’s out of his mind!”
The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul,” and, “By the ruler of the demons he casts out the demons.” Matthew
And Jesus called the scribes and Pharisees to him and said to them, “How can Satan cast out Satan?
If a kingdom is divided and its owners start fighting each other, that kingdom will not be able to remain stable.
Otherwise, if a family is divided and starts fighting among themselves, that family will not be able to remain stable.
