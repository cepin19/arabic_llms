Who is the greatest?
At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”
Then Jesus called a little child to him and put the child among them,
“Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.”
Whoever therefore humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And whoever welcomes a child like this in my name welcomes me.” A warning against stumbling blocks
But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
Woe to the world because of the offences! For offences must come, but woe to the man by whom the offence comes!
If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.
And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.” The Lost Sheep
Jesus said, “Take care that you do not despise one of these little ones; for, I tell you, in heaven their angels continually see the face of my Father in heaven.”
For the Son of Man came to save the lost.
“What man among you, if he had a hundred sheep and lost one of them, would not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the lost one until he finds it?
I tell you the truth, he will have more joy at finding that one lost sheep than he will for the ninety-nine that were safe.
So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should be lost. Be reconciled to thy brother.
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
But if he does not listen to you, take one or two more with you, so that every word may be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses. #Two or three witnesses. 16:18 See Deuteronomy 19:15.
If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. If he refuses to listen even to the church, then treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
“Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”
Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.
For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.” Forgiveness without limits.
Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?”
Jesus said to him, “Not seven times only, but seventy times seven!” #Seventy … times. 22:18 That is, without limit.
“Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves.
And when he began to settle accounts, one was brought to him who owed him a very large sum. #a very large sum. 24:18 Literally: "ten thousand talents or quintals, which is equivalent to about 300,000 kilograms of the coins used at that time."
Since he had nothing with which to pay the debt, the master decided that the debtor, his wife, his children and all that he had should be sold and the proceeds used to pay the debt.
Then the servant fell on his knees before the king and begged him, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay you everything I owe.’
So his master had compassion on him, canceled his debt, and let him go.
As he went out, he met one of his fellow slaves who owed him a little money. He grabbed him by the throat and demanded, ‘Pay me what you owe me!’
So the servant fell on his knees before him and pleaded, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.’
But he refused and had him thrown into prison until he should pay his debt in full.
When the other slaves saw what had happened, they were very sad and went to tell their master everything that had happened.
So his master called him in and said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you appealed to me.
‘Should you not have had mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?’
So his master became angry and handed him over to be punished until he had paid his entire debt.
“So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.”
Union in marriage
When Jesus had finished saying all this, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
And great crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to Jesus to test him, and they asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”
Jesus answered, “Haven’t you read in the scriptures that God created people male and female from the beginning?” #created … and female. 4:19 From Genesis 1:27, 5:2.
Then he said, ‘This is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.’ #leaves … one. 5:19 From Genesis 2:24.
So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”
They said to him, “Why then did Moses command that a man must give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?” #Certificate of divorce. 7:19 See Deuteronomy 24:1.
Jesus answered, “Moses permitted this because of your hard hearts, but it was not so from the beginning.
Therefore I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.
His disciples said to him, “If this is the case between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry!”
Jesus said to them, “Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given by God.
There are men who cannot marry because they were born without the ability to marry. There are men who cannot marry because people have deprived them of the ability to marry. And there are men who have chosen not to marry for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this teaching should accept it.” Jesus welcomes children
Then little children were brought to Him that He might put His hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.
Then Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”
Then Jesus laid his hands on them and went away from there. The obstacle of wealth
A man came to Jesus and asked him, “Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?”
Jesus answered him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. But if you want to enter eternal life, keep the commandments.”
The man asked, “What commandments?” Jesus replied, “Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal.
Do not bear false witness, honor your father and your mother.’ #Do not kill … and your mother. 19:19 From Exodus 20:12-16 and Deuteronomy 5:16-20. And ‘love your neighbor #neighbor. 19:19 Referring to Luke 10:25-37, we understand that a neighbor is anyone who needs help. As you love yourself.’ #Love … yourself. 19:19 Fromvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvatvat
The young man said to him, “I have kept all these commandments; what do I still lack?”
Jesus answered, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”
When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.
I tell you again, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”
When his disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved?”
Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”
Peter said to him, “Look, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?”
Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or fields, for my sake, will receive a hundred times more, and will inherit eternal life with God.”
For many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
Like vineyard workers
“For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He agreed with the workers to pay them a denarius for each day, and sent them to work in his vineyard.
And the owner of the vineyard went out about the ninth hour, and saw some men standing in the marketplace doing nothing.
He said to them, ‘You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.’
So they went to work in the vineyard. And he went out again about the sixth hour, and about the ninth hour, and did the same.
At around five o’clock he went out again and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing. He asked them, ‘Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?’
So they said to him, ‘No one has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard.’
And at the end of the day, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.’
So those who were hired at the fifth hour came, and each received a denarius.
Then those who were hired first came, thinking that they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius.
So they took her and began to grumble against the owner of the vineyard.
And they say, ‘Those who were hired last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us even though we bore the burden of the day and its heat!’
The owner of the vineyard said to one of them, ‘I’m not being unfair to you, friend. Didn’t you agree to work for a denarius?
Take your wages and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you.
Don’t I have the right to do what I want with what I own? Or are you jealous because I am kind to someone else?
"So the first shall be last, and the last shall be first." Jesus foretells his death and resurrection.
And as Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, he took the twelve aside and said to them:
“See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death,
They will hand him over to the unbelievers to be mocked, flogged and crucified. But on the third day he will rise from the dead.” The greatest among you is the one who serves.
Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, and kneeling before him, she made a request of him.
Jesus said to her, “What do you want?” She said to him, “Promise that these two sons of mine will sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.”
Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup #The cup. 22:20 i.e., the cup of suffering and pain. Also verse 23. that I am to drink?” They said to him, “We are able.”
He said to them, “You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father.”
When the other ten heard this request, they became very angry with the two brothers.
Then Jesus called them to him and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their leaders exercise authority over them.
But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister.
And whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.
For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” Jesus Heals Two Blind Men
As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
And there were two blind men sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”
People rebuked them and told them to be silent, but they shouted even more loudly, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”
Jesus stopped and called them, saying, “What do you want me to do for you?”
They said to him, “Lord, open our eyes.”
And Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their sight was restored, and they followed him.
Long live the king
And when they drew near unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,
And he said to them, “Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.
And if anyone says anything to you, say, ‘The Lord needs them, and he will send them back again soon.’”
This happened so that the words of the prophet might be fulfilled:
“Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘See, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’”
Then the disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.
So they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it.
Most of the people spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, “Hosanna to the King! #Hosanna to the King.” 9:21 Literally: “Hosanna.” In Hebrew it means “Save now.” It is probably a cry of praise here to God and his anointed king. Repeated in verse 15. Long live the Son of David. ‹Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.› Long live the king in the highest.”
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was shaken. People were asking, "Who is this man?"
The crowds that followed him said, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus in the Temple
Then Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.
He said to them, “It is written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ #My house … prayer. 13:21 From Isaiah 56:7. but you are making it a ‘den of robbers!’” #A den of robbers. 13:21 From Jeremiah 7:11.
Some blind and lame people came to him at the Temple, and he healed them.
When the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple courts, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they were indignant. “Do you hear what these children are saying?” they asked him.
Jesus replied, “Yes, but have you never read: ‘From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise’?”
Then Jesus left them and went out of the city into Bethany, and He lodged there. The power of faith
And as Jesus passed by early in the morning on his way to the city, he was hungry.
And seeing a fig tree by the wayside, he went to it, and found nothing thereon but leaves only. And he saith unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And immediately the fig tree withered away.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?” they asked.
He replied, “I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done.
And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith." Questioning Jesus' authority
Jesus went to the temple area, and while he was teaching, the high priests and the elders of the people came up to him and said, “By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?”
Jesus answered them, “I will also ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
Where did John’s baptism come from? Was it from God or from people?” They discussed this among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From God,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’”
And if we say, ‘From men,’ we are afraid of the people, for they all hold that John was a prophet.”
They answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” Jesus said to them, “I won’t tell you, then, by what authority I do these things.” The Parable of the Two Sons
And Jesus said: “What do you think about this story? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work in my vineyard today.’
The son replied, “I don’t want to go.” But he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing to him. The son answered, ‘Yes, sir, I will go,’ but he didn’t go.
Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?” They said, “The first.” He said to them, “Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you.
For John the Baptist came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him. The Parable of the Tenants
Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place.
And when the time came to harvest the grapes, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his share of the grapes.
But the peasants seized his slaves, beat one of them, killed another, and stoned another.
So the owner sent more slaves than he had sent the first time. The peasants treated them in the same way.
Finally he sent his son, saying to himself, ‘They will respect my son.’
But when the tenants saw the son, they said among themselves, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him and get his inheritance.’
And they laid hold on him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.
“What do you think the owner of the vineyard will do to those farmers when he returns?”
They said to him, “He will put those wretches to a wretched end and lease the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his share of the produce at harvest time.”
Jesus said to them, “Haven’t you read in the scriptures, ‘The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. The Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?”
Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.
And whoever falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and it will crush anyone on whom it falls.”
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus’ parables, they knew he was talking about them.
So they tried to arrest him, but they were afraid of the people who regarded Jesus as a prophet.
Like a wedding feast
Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:
“The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
The king sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they did not want to come.
But the king sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who have been invited, “Look, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fattened calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.”’
But the invited guests did not care, and each went his own way. One went to his field to work, another to his business.
The rest seized the king’s slaves, beat them, and killed them.
Then the king became angry and sent his army, which killed the murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those invited were not worthy to come.
So go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.
So they went out into the streets and gathered all they could find, both good and bad; and the wedding hall was filled with guests.
When the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
Then the king said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ But the man was silent.
Then the king said to his servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
For many are called, but few are chosen.” The Pharisees try to trap Jesus
The Pharisees went out and conspired how they might entangle Jesus in his talk.
So they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are sincere, and that you teach the way of God in accordance with truth, and show deference to no one; for you do not regard people with partiality.
So tell us, is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”
But Jesus knew their wicked intent, and he said to them, “You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?”
“Show me the currency you use.” They brought him a dinar.
He said to them, “Whose image and inscription is this on the coin?”
They said to him, “Caesar’s.” He said to them, “Then give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”
When they heard his answer, they were amazed and left him and went away. The Sadducees try to trap Jesus
On that day some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him,
"Teacher, Moses said #Moses said. 24:22 See Deuteronomy 25:5, 6. If a man dies and leaves no children, his brother must marry the widow and have a child who will be considered his brother's child.
We were seven brothers. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, his brother married his widow.
And the same happened to the second brother, the third, and even the seventh.
And after they all died, the woman died too.
To which of the seven will she belong on the Day of Judgment? They all married her.
Jesus answered them, “You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.
Understand that in eternal life after the resurrection of the dead, people do not marry or give their daughters in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
But about the resurrection of the dead—have you not read what God said to you?
‹I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.› #I am ... Jacob. 32:22 From Exodus 3:6. For God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”
When the people heard this, they were amazed at his teaching. The Greatest Commandment
And when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they came together.
A Sharia expert tried to trap him by asking him:
“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”
Jesus said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ #Love the Lord ... mind. 37:22 From Deuteronomy 6:5.
This is the first and greatest commandment.
The second commandment is like the first: ‘Love your neighbor #your neighbor. 39:22 Referring to Luke 10:25-37, we understand that a neighbor is anyone who needs help. As you love yourself.’ #Love your neighbor ... yourself. 39:22 From Leviticus 19:18.
The whole law and the writings of the prophets hang on these two commandments.” Christ Lord of David
And as the Pharisees were gathered around him, Jesus asked them:
“What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” They replied, “He is the son of David.”
He said to them, “How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him ‘Lord’?
“The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet”?
For if David calls him “Lord,” how can he be his son?”
No one could answer him, and no one dared ask him any more questions after that.
Jesus criticizes the clergy
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples
He said, “The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat as interpreters of the law.
So do and observe whatever they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.
They burden people with loads that are hard to carry, yet they themselves are unwilling to make any effort to follow them.
All the good deeds they do are done to be seen by people. They show their piety by making their phylacteries #phylacteries wider. 5:23 Some Jews wrote certain passages of Scripture and put them in small leather bags, which they then tied with cloth bands to their forehead or left arm, demonstrating their deep religiosity. , and they lengthen the tassels of their garments.
They love to sit at the best seats at feasts, and at the front seats in the assemblies.
They love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by people.
But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
And do not let anyone on earth call you 'father,' for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
And do not let people call you ‘master’, for you have one master, the Messiah.
The greatest among you must be your servant.
For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let in those who are trying to.
Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law, you hypocrites! You cheat widows out of their houses and then make long prayers just to show others how good you are. So your punishment will be all the worse.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.
Woe to you, blind guides, who say, ‘If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gold of the temple is bound by that oath.’
You blind fools! Which is greater: the gold in the temple or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
“You say, ‘If a man vows, “It is to the altar that I vow,” he is not bound by his vow. But if a man vows, “It is to the offering on the altar that I vow,” he is bound by his vow.’
Ye blind! which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?
For he that sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.
And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and by him who dwells in it.
And if anyone swears by heaven, he swears by God’s throne and by Him who sits upon it.
Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill #Dill. 23:23 A plant whose seeds were used in cooking as a spice and which also had some medicinal uses. and cumin. But you have neglected justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should have practiced these things, without neglecting the others.
Blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and wickedness.
Ye blind Pharisees, cleanse first that which is within the cup, that the outside of it may be clean also.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of bones and all kinds of impurity.
So you too are outwardly righteous before men, but inwardly full of hypocrisy and wickedness.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you say, ‘If only we had lived in the time of our forefathers, we would not have taken part in the killing of the prophets.’
In this way you confirm that you are the descendants of those who killed the prophets.
Continue what your ancestors started.
“You snakes, you brood of vipers! How can you escape the judgment of hell?
Therefore I send you prophets, sages, and teachers. You will kill some of them, crucify some, flog others in your synagogues, and chase them from city to city.
You will therefore be held accountable for the blood of every innocent person killed on earth: from the blood of innocent Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, #Abel…Zechariah. 35:23 The first and last to be killed, according to the time and text of the Old Testament scriptures. (See Genesis 4:8 and 2 Chronicles 24:20) He was killed between the temple and the altar.
Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation. Jesus warns the people of Jerusalem.
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent unto you by God! How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling!
Behold, your house will be left to you desolate and abandoned!
For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.’ #Blessed … the Lord. 39:23 From Psalm 118:26.”
Jesus predicts the destruction of the Temple
And Jesus left the temple and was going away, when his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple.
Jesus said to them, “Do you see all these buildings? I tell you the truth, not one stone will be left upon another; they will all be thrown down.”
As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”
Jesus answered them, “Take care that no one leads you astray.
Many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many.
You will hear of wars and revolutions, so you should not be afraid. These things must happen, but it will not be the end of the world yet.
For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes and famines.
But these will all be just the first birth pangs.
Then they will hand you over to be punished and will kill some of you. And all nations will hate you because you are my followers.
At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other.
False prophets will arise and deceive many.
And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
But the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.
And the gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to the Gentiles, and then the end will come.
When you see the "abomination that causes desolation" #AbominationOfDesolation. 15:24 See Daniel 9:27, 12:11, and also Matthew 11:31. which was spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place—let the reader understand—
Let those who are in the land of Judah flee to the mountains.
Let him who is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house.
A worker in the field does not go back home to get his cloak.
And how difficult were the conditions of pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days!
But pray that your flight will not be in winter or on a Sabbath.
For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be.
And had Allah not decreed a term for them, they would have been destroyed. But He has appointed a time for those who fear Him.
If anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or 'There he is!' do not believe it.
For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
Here I have told you everything before it happened.
Someone might say, “Look, here is the Messiah!” or “There he is!” Do not believe it.
For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
Wherever there is a corpse, the vultures will gather.
And immediately after the tribulation of those days, ‹The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.›
At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
And He will send His angels with a mighty blast of a trumpet, and they will gather His chosen ones from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches bud and its leaves begin to sprout, you know that summer is near.
So also, when you see all these things, you will know that the time #time. 33:24 Compare with the Gospel of Luke 21:31. is near, at the door.
Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all these things be accomplished.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. Only the Father knows.
But no one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
For as in the days of Noah, so will it be when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the Ark.
For they knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
At that time two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left.
Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left.
“Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.
Be sure that if the owner of the house knew at what time of night the thief was coming, he would stay awake and not let him break into his house.
Therefore, you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. The Good Servant and the Wicked Servant
“Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time?
Blessed is that servant whom his master will find at work when he arrives.
Verily I say unto you, he will appoint him over all his goods.
But the wicked servant says to himself, ‘My master is staying away a long time.’
He starts beating his fellow servants and eating and drinking with drunkards.
So the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know.
He will punish him and place him with the hypocrites, where people will weep and gnash their teeth.
Like Ten Girls
Then the kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them are stupid, and five are smart.
The foolish ones took their lamps, but they did not take any extra oil with them.
The wise ones, however, took extra oil in jars along with their lamps.
The groom was late, so all the girls got sleepy and fell asleep.
“But at midnight someone cried out, ‘The bridegroom is here! Come out and meet him!’
Then the girls woke up and prepared their lamps.
And the foolish said to the wise, “Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.”
But the wise ones answered, saying, ‘No, there will not be enough for us and for you; go instead to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.’
And while they went to buy oil, the bridegroom came. The wise ones were ready and went in with him to the wedding feast. Then the door was shut.
Finally the rest of the girls came and said, ‘Sir, sir, open the door for us.’
But he said to them, “Truly I say to you, I do not know you!”
Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on which day your Lord will come. The Parable of the Three Servants
The kingdom of heaven is also like a man who was about to go on a journey. He called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
He gave five bags to one of them. #Five bags. 15:25 Literally "talents or quintals"; a talent is equivalent to about 27 to 36 kilograms of gold, silver, or copper. of money, he gave two bags to the second, and one bag to the third. He gave to each according to his ability. Then he immediately went on a journey.
The man who received the five bags immediately invested them in business and earned five more bags.
And the one who took the two bags did the same as the first, and gained two more bags.
But he who had received one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master’s money.
And after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
The one who had received the five bags of gold came and brought the other five. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.’
His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’
Then the one who had received the two bags of gold came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with two bags of gold; here are two more that I have earned.’
His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’
Then the one who had received the one bag came and said, ‘Master, I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed.
I was afraid of you, so I went and hid your bag in the ground. Take your money.’
His master replied, ‘You are a wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather crops where I have not scattered seed?
So why didn’t you deposit your money in the bank, and when I came back I would take my money with interest?
“Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.
For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
But that useless servant, throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. The Son of Man is the judge.
And when the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit upon his glorious throne.
Then all the nations will be gathered before him. He will separate them from one another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats in his flock.
He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the king will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.
For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me.
I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you took care of me, I was in prison and you visited me.
The righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?
And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you?
And whenever we saw you sick or in prison, we visited you.
Then the king will say, ‘I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of my brothers, you did for me.’”
Then the king will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
For I was hungry and you gave me no food; I was thirsty and you gave me no drink.
I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’
The wicked will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or ill or in prison, and did not help you?’
Then the king will say, ‘I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of my brothers, you did not do for me.’
“Thus the wicked go to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.”
Jewish leaders plot to kill Jesus
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he said to his disciples:
“You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.”
The chief priests and the elders of the people had gathered in the palace of the chief priest Caiaphas.
And they plotted to arrest Jesus deceitfully and kill him.
They said, “We should not do this during the feast, lest there be a riot among the people.” A woman pours perfume on Jesus.
And as he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,
A woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at table.
When his disciples saw this, they were indignant. “Why this waste?” they asked.
This perfume could have been sold for a lot of money and given to the poor.
Jesus knew what they were thinking, and said to them, “Why do you trouble this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me.
The poor will always be with you, #the poor... always. 11:26 See Deuteronomy 15:11. But I will not always be with you.
I poured perfume over my body to prepare it for burial.
Verily I say unto you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. Judas Iscariot betrays Jesus
Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,
And he said to them, “What will you give me if I hand Jesus over to you?” And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that moment on, Judas began to look for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. At the Passover meal
And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to him, saying, “Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover?”
Jesus said to them, “Go into the village over there, and you will find a man carrying a jar of water. Tell him, ‘The Teacher says: My time has come; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.’”
Then the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover meal.
And as evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.
As they were eating, he said, “I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me.”
So they became sad, and one by one they began to ask Him, “Lord, is it I?”
Jesus answered, “It is he who dips his hand with me in the dish who will betray me.
The Son of Man will go as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.”
And Judas, who was going to betray him, asked, “Is it I, Rabbi?” Jesus answered, “You have said so.” The Lord’s Supper
And as they were eating, he took bread, and blessed God, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.”
Then he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. He gave it to them, and they all drank from it.
For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
And I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.”
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus predicts Peter's denial
Then Jesus said to them, “All of you will fall away because of me this night. For it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’
But after I am raised up, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.”
Peter replied, “Even if everyone else loses faith in you, I will never lose faith in you.”
Jesus said to him, “Truly I tell you, on this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”
Then Peter said to him, “Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you!” And all the disciples said the same thing. Jesus prays alone
Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”
Then he took Peter, James, and John with him. He began to feel terrible sorrow and distress.
Then he said to them, “My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.”
Jesus went a little farther away from them, fell to the ground, and began to pray: “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass me by #26:39 The cup of suffering and pain. Repeated in verse 42. . But not what I want, but what you want.”
And he came to his disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, “So, could you not stay awake with me for one hour?”
Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”
And He went away again a second time and prayed, saying, “My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, Your will be done.”
Then he returned to them again and found them sleeping, for drowsiness had overcome their eyes.
So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
Then he returned to his disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.
Get up, let us go. Here comes the man who betrayed me.” The arrest of Jesus
While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived, accompanied by a large crowd with swords and clubs, who had come from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
The traitor had given them a sign and said, "The man I kiss is the wanted man, so arrest him."
And he came to Jesus at once and said, “Hail, Master!” and kissed him.
Then Jesus said to him, “Friend, do what you came for.” Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him.
Then one of those who were with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.
Don’t you realize that I could ask my Father for help, and he would give me more than twelve armies of angels right now?
But if you do, how will the books that say these things will happen this way come true?”
At that moment Jesus said to the crowd, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me, as though I were a criminal? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me.”
But this happened so that the words of the prophets would come true.” Then all the disciples left him and ran away! Jesus before the Jewish leaders
Then those who had arrested him led him to the high priest Caiaphas, where the teachers of the law and the elders had gathered.
But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But they found nothing, although many false witnesses came forward and spoke lies about him. Finally two men came forward,
They said, “This is the man #This is the man. 61:26 That is, Jesus, for his enemies avoided pronouncing his name! He said, ‘I can destroy God’s temple and rebuild it in three days.’”
Then the high priest stood up and said to him, “Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?”
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, “I charge you under oath before the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.”
Jesus answered him, “You have said it yourself. But I tell you: From now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “He has blasphemed! Why do we still need witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.
“What is your verdict?” they asked. “He deserves to die,” they answered.
Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists. They slapped him.
And they said to him, "Prophesy to us, Christ, who is it that struck you?" Peter denies Jesus.
Meanwhile, Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant girl came to him and said, “You also were with Jesus of Galilee.”
But Peter denied it in front of everyone, saying, “I don’t know what you’re talking about!”
Then he went out to the gateway, and another servant-girl saw him there and said to the people, “This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.”
And Peter denied it again, and swore, saying, “I do not know the man.”
Then those who stood by came and said to him, “Surely you are one of them, for your speech betrays you.”
Then he began to curse #curse. 74:26 That is, he swore an oath to himself, cursing himself if he was lying! And he swore, saying, “I do not know this man.” And immediately the rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” And he went out and wept bitterly.
Jesus before the governor Pilate
The next morning the chief priests and the elders of the people met together to plan how to kill Jesus.
They bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pontius Pilate. Judas kills himself.
When Judas, who had betrayed Jesus, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
And he said to them, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood to death.” But they said, “What is that to us? See to it yourself.”
Then Judas threw the pieces of silver into the temple and left. He went away and hanged himself.
The chief priests took the silver coins and said, “It is against the law to put this into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.”
So they decided to use the money to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for foreigners.
That is why the field is called the Field of Blood to this day.
This is what the Lord had said through the prophet Jeremiah: “They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel.
And they bought the potter’s field with it, as the Lord commanded me.” #They took … the Lord. 10:27 See the book of Zechariah 11:12-13, and the book of Jeremiah 32:6-9. Jesus before Pilate
Jesus stood before the governor, who asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus replied.
And when the chief priests and the elders complained against him, he said nothing.
Then Pilate asked him, “Don’t you hear the accusations they are making against you?”
But Jesus did not give Pilate an answer to any of the charges they brought against him. Pilate was amazed at his silence. Pilate failed to release Jesus.
Now it was customary for the governor to release a prisoner to the people at the Passover festival.
And there was a notorious prisoner, named Barabbas. #Barabbas. 16:27 Or "Jesus Barabbas," as in some Greek manuscripts.
When the people had gathered, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you: Jesus, who is called the Messiah, or Barabbas?”
Pilate knew that they had handed him over because of envy.
While Pilate was sitting on the judge’s seat, his wife sent him this message: “Don’t have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.”
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas to be released and for Jesus to be put to death.
The governor said, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” “Barabbas,” they answered.
Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.
Then Pilate said to them, “Why? What crime has he committed?” But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!”
When Pilate saw that he could not prevail at all, but rather that a tumult was rising, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this man’s blood; see to it yourselves.”
Then all the people said, “His blood be on us and on our children!”
Then Pilate released Barabbas to them, and ordered that Jesus be flogged and handed over to be crucified. The soldiers mock Jesus
Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus to the governor’s palace, and they gathered the whole battalion around him.
Then they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him. #They put on him … a robe. 28:27 Or purple, as a mockery, for this is the color of a king’s robe.
They plaited a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put a reed in his right hand and knelt before him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”
Then they spat on him, and took the reed from his hand, and struck him on the head with it.
And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him. Jesus on the cross
And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.
And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means “Place of the Skull,”
They offered Jesus wine mixed with a bitter substance to drink. When he tasted it, he refused to drink it.
When they crucified Jesus, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
Then they sat there guarding him.
And they put up over his head the charge against him. This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.
And two criminals were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Passers-by cursed him and shook their heads.
And they said: “You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, if you are the Son of God, save yourself and come down from the cross!”
The chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him as well, saying:
Others he saved, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him!
He has put his trust in God; let God rescue him now if He really wants him. Did he not say, ‘I am the Son of God’?”
And the criminals who were crucified with him also insulted him in the same way. The death of Jesus
And from noon until three in the afternoon, darkness came over the whole land.
And about the third hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” #Eli … sabachthani. 46:27 From Psalm 22:1. That is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”
When some of the bystanders heard this, they said, “He’s calling for Elijah!” #He’s calling for Elijah. 47:27 The word “Eli” is Hebrew and “Ilo” is Aramaic, both of which resemble the name “Elijah,” a well-known prophet who lived around 850 B.C.
Then one of the men standing there ran, got a sponge and filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a reed, and offered it to him to drink.
The rest said, “Let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.”
Then Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up His spirit.
And the veil of the temple was torn in two #Temple_veil. 51:27 The veil that separated the "Holy of Holies" from the rest of the Jewish temple. The Holy of Holies represented the divine presence. from top to bottom, the earth quaked, and the rocks were split,
And the graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
And after Jesus rose, those bodies came out of the tombs, entered the holy city, and appeared to many people.
The Roman officer, #Roman officer. 54:27 Literally, "a centurion." and the guards who were guarding Jesus' body, when they saw the earthquake and the other events, were terrified and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
And there were also some women looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him.
Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. #sons of Zebedee. 56:27 James and John. Jesus was buried.
When evening came, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph arrived in Jerusalem. He was also a disciple of Jesus.
So he went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Then Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a new linen cloth.
Then he placed it in his new tomb, which he had carved out of rock, rolled a huge stone over the entrance to the tomb, and left.
And Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. Guarding the tomb of Jesus
And the next day, after the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together to Pilate,
They said to him, “Teacher, we remember that this deceiver said, while he was still alive, ‘After three days I will rise again.’”
So he gave orders to guard the tomb until the third day, so that his disciples would not come and steal the body and then tell the people, ‘He has risen from the dead.’ Then this deception would be worse than the first.”
Then Pilate said to them, “You have a guard; go your way, make it as secure as you can.”
So they went and made the tomb secure. They put a seal on the stone and posted the guard.
Resurrection of Jesus
And after the sabbath, on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to the tomb.
And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow.
So the guards were terrified of him and became like dead men.
And the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.”
He is not here; for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay,
Then go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and look, he is going ahead of you into Galilee; you will see him there.’ I have told you.”
Then the two women left the tomb quickly, their fear mingled with great joy, and ran to tell Jesus’ disciples what had happened.
And suddenly Jesus met them, and said, “Peace.” And they came and held his feet, and worshipped him.
Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.” The false report
And while they were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened.
Then the chief priests and the elders assembled and took counsel together, and gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,
And they said to them, “Tell the people that his disciples came by night and stole him away while you were asleep.
And if this news reaches the governor, we will convince him and keep you safe.”
The soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus speaks to his disciples
And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they worshipped him, although some doubted.
Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”
John the Baptist
This is the beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
For it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah, “Behold, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, and he will prepare your way.”
“A voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’”
John the Baptist came baptising in the wilderness and urging people to be baptised as a sign of their repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the inhabitants of the villages of the region of Judea and of Jerusalem went out to him. And they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
His clothes were made of camel hair, he had a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
He used to say, "A man will come after me who is better than I am, and I am not worthy to untie his sandal straps and bow down."
I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Baptism of Jesus
And in those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan river.
And as he came out of the water, he saw the heavens open, and the Holy Spirit descending upon him like a dove.
And a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased." The Temptation of Jesus
The Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness alone.
And he stayed there for forty days, facing the trials of the devil. He was there with the wild animals, and the angels served him. Jesus chooses some of his disciples.
After John was arrested, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
He said, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is near; repent, and believe the good news.”
As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”
So they immediately left their nets and followed him.
He walked a little farther and saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.
Then Jesus called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him. Jesus casts out an evil spirit
Then they went to Capernaum, and on the Sabbath Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.
And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.
And there was in the synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And the spirit cried out:
“What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”
Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!”
The unclean spirit convulsed the man violently, gave a loud cry, and came out of him.
And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? What new doctrine is this? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.”
And the news about him spread quickly throughout the region of Galilee. Jesus heals many people.
Then they left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon and Andrew with James and John.
And Simon’s mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her,
He went up to her, took her hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she waited on them.
And in the evening, at sundown, they brought unto him all that were sick, and them that had devils.
All the inhabitants of the city gathered at the door of the house.
Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. But Jesus did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Preparation for the Proclamation of the Gospel
Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.
So Simon and his companions set out to look for him.
And when they found him, they said to him, “Everyone is looking for you!”
Jesus answered them, “Let’s go elsewhere to the neighboring villages, that I may preach there also, because I came out for this reason.”
He went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. Jesus Heals a Man With Leprosy
A man with leprosy came to Jesus, knelt down, and begged him, “If you want to, you can make me clean.”
Jesus had compassion on him and touched him, saying, “I am willing; be cleansed.”
The man was cured of leprosy and became clean.
Then Jesus sternly warned him and sent him away.
And he said to him, “See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, # Go ... to the priest. 44:1 The priest was the one who decided according to the law when a leper was considered clean. and make the offering for your cleansing that Moses commanded假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名
But the man went away and began to proclaim throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him. And Jesus could no longer enter a town openly, but stayed outside in deserted places; and people came to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a paralytic
A few days later, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and word got around that he was back.
And many people came together, so that there was no longer room for them, not even about the door: and he preached the word unto them.
So they brought to him a paralysed man carried by four men.
But they could not bring him to Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above where Jesus was and lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”
Some doctors of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves:
“Why does this man talk like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Why do you think this in your hearts?”
But which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
But I will show you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” He said to the paralyzed man,
“I tell you,” he said, “get up, take your mat and go home.”
So he got up, took his mat at once, and walked in front of everyone. They were all amazed and praised God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this before!” Levi (Matthew) follows Jesus.
Jesus went back to the lake again. He taught the crowds that followed him there.
As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
And as Jesus sat at meat in the house of Levi, many publicans and sinners ate with him and his disciples. For there were many that followed Jesus when he called Levi, and they were there.
When the Pharisees and the teachers of the law saw him eating with tax collectors and sinners, they asked his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, “Healthy people don’t need a doctor, but sick people do. I didn’t come to call righteous people, but sinners.” A question about fasting
It was the time when the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting, and some people came to Jesus and asked him, “Why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”
Jesus said to them, “Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast.
No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse.
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, for the wine will burst the skins, and the wine will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed. New wine must be put into new wineskins.” Jesus: Lord of the Sabbath
One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, “Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?”
He said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?”
He entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the priest, and ate the loaves of bread offered to God, and also gave some to those who were with him, although it is not lawful for anyone to eat that bread except the priests.” #26:2 See 1 Samuel эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом
Then Jesus said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.”
So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”
Jesus heals on the Sabbath
And Jesus went again into the synagogue; and there was a man there who had a withered hand.
Some people were watching him closely to see if he would heal him, so that they could accuse him.
Then he said to the man with the paralysed hand, “Get up and come forward!”
Then he said to them, “Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save a life or to kill?” But they were silent.
Jesus looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.
So the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus. Many people followed Jesus.
Jesus went with his disciples to the lake of Galilee, and a great multitude from Galilee and also from Judea followed him.
And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.
Jesus asked his disciples to get a boat ready for him, so that he would not be crushed by the crowd.
Jesus had healed many people, so anyone who was sick tried to reach him and touch him.
The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, would fall down before him and shout, “You are the Son of God!”
He sternly warns her not to reveal who he is. The choice of the twelve
Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.
And Jesus chose twelve men, whom he called apostles, to be with him and to send them out.
and He gave them authority over unclean spirits.

And Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. Jesus' power is from God, and Jesus returned home.
Once again, so many people came together around him and his disciples that they didn’t even have time to eat.
When Jesus’ family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, because they said, “He is out of his mind.”
But the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beelzebul! #Beelzebul. 22:3 A name for Satan. By the prince of demons he is driving out demons.”
Jesus called them to him and began to speak to them in parables: “How can Satan drive out a demon?”
For if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
A house divided against itself cannot stand.
