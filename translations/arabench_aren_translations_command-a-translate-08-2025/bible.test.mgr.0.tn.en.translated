ером кто величайший в Царстве Небесном? (Марк 9:33–37; Лука 9:46–48)
At that time the disciples came to Jesus and said, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”
Jesus called a little child to him and put him in the middle of them.
He said, “I tell you the truth: unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.”
Whoever humbles himself and becomes like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Whoever accepts a little boy like this does so because of my name, and accepts me.
But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to sin! Such things must come, but woe to the man who brings them!
If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter eternal life with a maimed foot or hand than to be thrown into eternal fire with both your hands and feet intact.
And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter eternal life with one eye than to be thrown into hell with both eyes.” The lost sheep (Luke 15:3-7)
“Be careful not to despise any of these children. I tell you: their angels in heaven always see the face of my father who is in heaven.”
# 18:11 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: I, the Son of Man, have come to save the lost.
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them gets lost, doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine on the mountain and go to look for the lost sheep?
If he finds it, he will be more pleased to have it back than he would be about the other ninety-nine that were not lost.
“For this reason, my heavenly Father does not want any of these little ones to perish.” Forgiveness among brothers (Luke 17:3)
If your brother wrongs you, go and tell him about his mistake between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you will have gained your brother.
But if they will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
If he doesn’t want to listen to them, tell the church, and if he doesn’t want to listen to the church, consider him as an unbeliever and a tax collector.
I bring you the truth: what you tie on earth will be tied in heaven, and what you untie on earth will be untied in heaven.
Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
Where two or three gather in my name, I will be among them.” Like a servant who does not forgive.
At that time Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?”
Jesus said to him: “I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven.”
Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
He was being held accountable there, and they brought him someone who asked him for money without limit.
And when the star couldn’t pay, Seydou ordered that he, his wife, his children and all his belongings be sold to pay off his debt.
The servant fell on his knees and said: “My lord, my lord, be patient with me and I will help you with everything!”
And Sidu and Sibu mocked him and forgave him for his religion.
But that servant went out and found another servant like him, to whom he owed a little money. He grabbed him and said, “Pay me what you owe me!”
The other servant fell on his knees and tore his clothes and said, “Be patient with me, I will save you.”
He didn’t like it, left and was put in prison until he paid off his debt.
The other servants found out what had happened, were very worried, and went and told their master everything that had happened.
At that time, Nadal called his master and said: "You wicked servant! I have forgiven you all that debt because you have begged me.
And don’t you have the right to forgive your servant friend, just as I forgave you?”
He was then cheated by Seydou, who handed him over to the prison warden until he had paid off all his debt.
This is how your father in heaven will treat every one of you if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.
Marriage and divorce (Mark 10:1-12)
After saying this, Jesus went away and hid himself in the region of Galilee. He did not want to go into Judea, because the Jewish leaders there were looking for a way to kill him.
Many people followed him, and he healed them there.
Then some Pharisees came to him, to test him, saying, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”
He answered them: "Haven't you read that the one who created them in the first place created them male and female?"
# Gen 1:27; 2:24; Eph 5:31; 1 Cor 6:16 And he said, “That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and the two become one flesh?”
So they are no longer two, but one body. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.”
# Matt 24:1-4 The Pharisees said to him, “Why then did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?”
Jesus said to them, “Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.
And I tell you: anyone who divorces his wife for any reason other than adultery and marries another woman is committing adultery.
The students said to him: “If this is the situation of a man with his wife, it is better for him not to get married.”
But he said to them, “Not everyone accepts this teaching, but only those whom God allows to do so.
There are some who cannot marry from birth, and there are some who have been made unable to marry by what people have done to them, and there are some who do not want to marry for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can do this should do it.’ Jesus blesses little children (Mark 10:13–16; Luke 18:15–17)
And they brought young children to Jesus, that he should touch them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked those who brought them.
But Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”
And he laid his hand on him and passed by from that place. The Rich Young Man (Mark 10:17-31; Luke 18:18-30)
And one came to him and said, “Teacher, what good things must I do to obtain eternal life?”
Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. If you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.”
# Ex 20:12–16; Deut 5:16–20 They said, “What are the commandments?” Jesus said, “Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness,
# Leviticus 19:18 “Honor your father and your mother, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.”
The boy said: "I do all these things, what else am I missing?"
Jesus said to him, "If you wish to be perfect, go, sell what you own, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me!"
When the boy heard this, he went away sad, because he had many possessions.
And Jesus said to his disciples: “Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.
And again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
When the students heard this, they were very surprised and said, "Then who can be saved?"
But Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”
At that time Peter said to him, “See, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?”
Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And whoever has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for My name’s sake, will receive a hundredfold, and will inherit eternal life.
“Many of those who are first will be last, and the last will be first.”
Like the servants of the vineyard
For the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
And he agreed with the servants on a silver coin per day and sent them to the vineyard.
He went out with the nine, and then he saw another group standing in the market, unemployed.
He told them: “You too go to the vineyard, and I’ll give you your rights later. So they went.”
And he went out again about the sixth hour, and did likewise; and about the ninth hour again, he did likewise.
It was almost five in the evening when Uqayb went out and found other people sitting there. He said to them, "Why are you sitting here idle all day?"
They said to him: "No one has called us to work." He said to them: "You too, go and work in the vineyard."
And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to the steward, ‘Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.’
And the people who began to work at five o'clock in the evening each received a silver coin.
And when the governors came, they thought they would get more than the others, but each of them received a silver coin.
And when they finished, they cheated the owner of the grapes.
They said, “These two only worked for one hour, and you paid them the same as us, even though we worked all day in the heat!”
But one of them replied: “My friend, I have not wronged you. Didn’t you agree with me on a silver coin?”
Take your share and leave. I wanted to give this other person the same thing I gave you, just as I love you.
“Brother, don’t I have the right to spend my money however I want? Or are you jealous because I’m generous?”
And Jesus said, “The last will be first, and the first will be last.” Jesus foretells his death and resurrection a third time (Mark 10:32–34; Luke 18:31–34)
And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them:
“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes of the Jews, and they will condemn him to death
And they will hand me over to other peoples, and they will mock me and flog me and crucify me, and I will rise again on the third day.” What the mother of James and John asked for (Mark 10:35–45)
Then a woman came to him with butter and her children, knelt before him and asked him for something.
And Jesus said to her, “What do you want?” She said to him, “Order that my two sons may sit, one on your right and one on your left, in your kingdom.”
But Jesus answered, “You don’t know what you’re asking for. Can you drink the cup that I’m about to drink?” They said, “We can.”
He said to them, “You will drink my cup, but it is not for me to say who will sit at my right hand and at my left; that is for my Father to decide.”
When the other ten disciples heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers.
But Jesus called them to him and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.
But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;
Whoever among you would be first must be slave of all.
Even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” Jesus heals two blind men (Mark 10:46-52; Luke 18:35-43)
As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”
The people told them to be quiet, but they shouted even more loudly, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
And Jesus stood up and called them and said, “What do you want me to do for you?”
They said to him: "Sir, we would like to come back and see it again!"
And Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes, and immediately they regained their sight and followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem (Mark 11:1–11; Luke 19:28–40; John 12:12–19)
As Jesus and his disciples approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
And he said to them, “Go to the village opposite you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.
And if anyone says anything to you, say this: “The Lord needs them.” And he will send them back at the right time.
This happened so that what the Prophet said would come true.
# Isa 62:11; Zech 9:9 Say to the daughter of Zion, “Behold, your king is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.”
The two disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.
And they brought the colt and the ass, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.
Most people spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from trees and spread them on the road.
# Ps 118:26; Lk 2:14; Mt 21:15; 23:39 And the people who went before him and followed him cried out: Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!
And as Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, “Who is this?”
And the people said: "This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus drives the sellers out of the temple (Mark 11:15-19; Luke 19:45-48; John 2:13-22)
And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all those who were selling and buying in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those who were selling doves.
# Isa 56:7; 7:11 And he said to them, “It is written in the Bible: My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves!”
And the blind and the lame came to him at the temple; and he healed them.
But the chief priests and the scribes of the Jews were indignant when they saw the miracles that Jesus performed, and how the children were crying out in the temple: “Hosanna to the Son of David!”
# Matt 8:2 And they said to him, “Teacher, do you hear what they are saying?” And Jesus said to them, “Yes; have you never read this, ‘Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise for yourself’?”
He left them, went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there. Jesus curses the fig tree (Mark 11:12-14, 20-24)
And when he returned to the city in the morning, Jesus was hungry.
He saw a vine by the side of the road, and he went to it, but found only leaves, and said to it, “You shall never bear fruit again!” And the vine withered at once.
The students, who were investigating what had happened, were surprised and said: "Why did the vine wither at that time?"
Jesus answered them, “Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done.
“Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.” Jesus’ authority (Mark 11:27-33; Luke 20:1-8)
And as Jesus entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, “By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?”
Jesus answered them, “I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things:
Where did John’s baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?” They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’”
But if we say, “From men,” we fear the people, for all regard John as a prophet.”
They answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” Jesus said to them, “Then I won’t tell you by what authority I do these things.” The parable of the two sons
What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, "My son, go and work in the vineyard today."
His son replied: “I’m not going.” But then he regretted it and went.
He went to his other son and said the same thing he said to his first son, and he replied, "I'm going, sir!" But he didn't go.
“Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?” they asked. “The first,” they answered. Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you.”
And John came to you as a righteous man, but you did not believe him. Yet the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.” The Parable of the Vineyard Workers (Mark 12:1-12; Luke 20:9-19)
Listen to another parable: There was a man who planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another country.
When the time for the grapes to ripen drew near, he sent his servants to the vineyard to collect the harvest.
His five servants were tied up, one of them was beaten, another was killed, and another was stoned.
And the master of the grapes sent the servants again, more than he had sent the first time, but they did the same thing to them.
He separated his sons far from each other and said, “Now my sons can do it.”
But when the five brothers saw the boy, they said to each other, "This is the one who will inherit! Let's kill him and take his inheritance!"
They grabbed him, took him outside the vineyard and killed him.
So, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do with those farmhands?
The chief priests said to one another, “If we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation.”
# Ps 118:22–23; Ac 4:11; 1Pe 2:7 Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures: ‘The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.’”
That is why I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.”
# 21:44 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: I, the Son of Man, have come to save the lost.
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they knew that he was speaking about them.
But when they tried to seize him, they feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet.
Like the king’s party (Luke 14:15-24)
Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:
“The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
The servants went out to call the guests to the wedding feast, but they refused to come.
And he sent other servants again, saying, “Tell those who are invited, ‘Behold, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready; come to the wedding feast!’”
But they didn’t plan for the evening and went their separate ways, one went to his farm, and the other went to his shop.
And others seized his servants, humiliated them, and killed them.
The king was deceived and sent his soldiers to kill those criminals and burn their city.
And the master said to his servants, “The banquet is ready, but those invited are not worthy.”
So go out into the streets and invite as many people as you can to the wedding party.
And those servants went out into the streets and brought all the good and bad people, and the wedding house was filled with guests.
But when the king came to see the guests, he saw a man who was not wearing a suit. So he said to him:
How did you get in here without wearing a wedding dress? The man fell silent.
Then the king said to the servants, “Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
Many are called, but few are chosen. » Paying taxes to Caesar (Mark 12:13-17; Luke 20:20-26)
At that time the Pharisees went out and conspired how to catch Jesus in his words.
And they sent to him some of his disciples and some of the Herodians, saying to him, “Teacher, we know that you are true and do not care about anyone’s opinion. For you are not influenced by people’s status.
Tell us: what do you think? Is it permissible to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
But Jesus knew their wickedness, and said, "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?
“Give me my tax money!” So they brought him a silver coin.
Jesus said to them, “Whose image and inscription is this?”
They said, "Caesar's property!" He told them, "Then give Caesar's things to Caesar, and God's things to God!"
And when they heard this, they marvelled; and they left him and went away. The resurrection of the dead (Mark 12:18-27; Luke 20:27-40)
On that day some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and asked him a question.
# Deut 25:5 Then the elders of his city shall call him and speak to him, and say to him, “If the brother does not want to marry his brother’s wife, then let the brother’s wife go up to the elders and say, ‘My husband’s brother refuses to perpetuate his brother’s name in Israel; he is not willing to perform the duty of a brother-in-law for me.’”
And now there were seven brothers among us. The eldest brother got married and died without having children, and his wife was taken by his brother.
The same thing happened to the second, the third, and even the seventh khawaja.
And they all took him away, the woman died.
So on the Day of Judgment, which one of them will she be the wife of? Because she was married to all of them.”
Jesus answered them, “You are wrong, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God.”
On the Day of Judgment, they will neither marry nor be married, but will be like the angels in heaven.
As if you were at the resurrection of the dead, brother, didn't you read what God told you?
# Matthew 22:32 I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”
And when the people heard this, they were amazed at his teaching. The Greatest Commandment (Mark 12:28–34; Luke 10:25–28)
But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they came together.
One of them, a scholar of Islamic law, asked a question to test them:
“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”
# Matt 22:37 Jesus answered him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.”
This is the first and greatest commandment.
# Lev 19:18; Matt 19:19; Gal 5:14; Rom 13:9; James 2:8 And the second commandment is like it, Love thy neighbour as thyself.
The whole law and the prophets are based on these two commandments.” Jesus and David (Mark 12:35–37; Luke 20:41–44)
When the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question:
"What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?" They said, "He is the son of David!"
He said to them, “How then could David call him ‘Lord’ when he said,
# Ps 110:1; Acts 2:34–35; Heb 1:13; 10:13 The Lord said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”
If David called him "our Lord", how could he be his son?
And no one could answer him with a word. And from that day on, no one dared to ask him any questions.
Jesus warns against the scribes and the Pharisees (Mark 12:38–40; Luke 11:37–52; 20:45–47)
And Jesus said to the people and to his disciples:
The book of the Jews and the Pharisees is still on the chair of Moses.
Therefore do and observe whatever they tell you, but do not follow their example. For they preach but do not practice.
They put a heavy burden on people's shoulders, but they don't even touch it with their finger.
They do all these things so that people can see them. They make their turbans bigger and their robes longer.
They like to sit in the first rows at parties and in the front seats at gatherings.
And people like to greet them in the markets, calling them: "O teachers".
But you must not let anyone call you “teacher,” because you are all brothers and have only one teacher.
And do not call anyone on earth “father,” for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.
And don’t let anyone call you “master” either, for you have one master, the Messiah.
Let your elder serve you.
Whoever rises above his soul falls, and whoever humbles himself rises.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.
# 23:14 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You cheat widows out of their houses and then pretend to be devout by making long prayers. That is why you will receive a greater condemnation.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.
Woe unto you, ye blind guides! which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!
Who is more valuable, you ignorant and blind people? The gold or the temple that made the gold sacred?
And you say, “Whoever swears by the altar is not bound by anything, but whoever swears by the offering that is on it is bound by his oath.”
Who is more valuable, Anna, you blind people? The sacrifice or the altar that makes the sacrifice holy?
Anyone who swears by the altar is essentially swearing by it and by everything on it.
And whoever swears by the temple, swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.
And a ruler who swears by the heavens, swears by the throne, and by God who sits upon it.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.
You blind people who lead others! You filter out a mosquito from the water and swallow a camel.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside may also be clean.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.
And you too, you appear to people as righteous from the outside, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and evil.
You book of Jews and you hypocritical Pharisees! You build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the domes of the righteous saints,
And you say, “The jinn were present at the time of our ancestors, but we did not participate with them in killing the prophets.”
Behold, you bear witness against yourselves that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
So you have fulfilled your ancestors' legacy.
You sons of snakes, how will you escape the punishment of the torment of Hell?
That is why I sent you prophets, wise men and writers. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from city to city.
# Mt 4:8; Heb 11:4; Zech 1:1; 2 Chr 24:21 All the innocent blood that has been shed on earth will come upon you, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
You tell the truth: all these bad guys are going to come after this generation!" Jesus' love for Jerusalem (Luke 13:34-35)
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.
This is your home, so keep it a mess.
I tell you: you will not see me again until the time comes when you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'"
Jesus foretells the destruction of the temple (Mark 13:1–2; Luke 21:5–6)
Jesus left the temple. As he was walking away, his disciples came up to him and drew his attention to the temple buildings.
And he said to them: “Do you see all these things? Truly I say to you, not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down.” Disaster and persecution (Mark 13:3-13; Luke 21:7-19)
As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”
Jesus answered them, “Watch out that no one leads you astray.”
For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray.
And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be afraid. For it must happen, but it is not the end.
Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many places.
This is just the beginning of the pain of childbirth.
And then they will hand you over to be tortured and killed. And all nations will hate you because you are called by my name.
At that time, many people will stop being believers, betray each other and hate each other.
For many false prophets will arise and will mislead many people.
And most people will no longer have love, because evil will increase.
But whoever proves it to the other will have to pay.
And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” The Great Tribulation (Mark 13:14–23; Luke 21:20–24)
# Dan 9:27; 11:31; 12:11 When you see the “abomination that causes desolation” standing in the holy place, which was spoken of by the prophet Daniel (let the reader understand).
At that time, those who were Jewish fled to the mountains.
And let the one on the roof not come down to the ground to carry the things in his house.
And let the one in the farm not come back to pick up his hat.
Woe to those who are pregnant and those who are nursing on those days.
Ask your Lord that your escape be neither in winter nor on a Sabbath.
Because at that time there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now.
And if God had not been merciful on those days, no human being would have survived. But He was merciful to them because of the people He chose.
And at that time, if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.
For false Christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.
I warned you before, Hani.
Therefore if they say to you, ‘Look, He is in the wilderness!’ do not go out; or ‘Look, He is in the inner rooms!’ do not believe it.
I am Gianni, the Son of Man, like lightning that flashes in the east and shines in the far west.
Wherever there is a carcass, the vultures gather.” Jean, the Son of Man (Mark 13:24-27; Luke 21:25-28)
# Rev 8:12; Isa 13:10; Eze 32:7; Joel 2:10–11; Zeph 1:15 “At that time of trouble, the sun will grow dark, and the moon’s light will not shine. The stars will fall from the sky, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.”
And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.” The Parable of the Fig Tree (Mark 13:28-31; Luke 21:29-33)
Learn a lesson from the vine: as soon as its branches turn green and produce leaves, you know that summer is near.
And if you also see these things happening, you know that I am near, at the door.
You tell the truth: this generation will not be satisfied until all these things happen.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. Be always prepared. (Mark 13:32-37; Luke 17:26-30; 12:39-40)
But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only.
Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man.
Just as people used to eat, drink and get married in those days before the flood, so it was until Noah entered the Ark.
They were not aware of anything until the floods came and swept them all away. That is how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
At that time there were two men in the farm, one would be taken away and one would stay.
A buzz of women sitting on the millstone grinding wheat, one shakes and the other stays still.
Be vigilant, for you do not know the day when your Lord will come.
But know this: if the owner of a house knew when a thief would come, he would stay up and not let his house be broken into.
That is why you too must be ready, for the Son of Man will come at an hour you do not expect.” The faithful servant (Luke 12:41-48)
Who is the trustworthy servant who knows how to behave and whose master has entrusted him with his house to give them their food at the right time?
That’s why the servant returns to his master and finds that he has done his job.
I’m telling you the truth: he’s going to eat up all his property.
But if that servant is wicked, he will say to himself, 'My master is staying away a long time.'
He began to beat the other servants and eat and drink with the drunkards.
Sayed will come back one day when he least expects it, at a time he doesn’t know.
They will cut it into pieces and put it in the place where the hypocrites are going. Where will the crying and the grief of the years be?"
Like Girls
“The kingdom of heaven is like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were ignorant and five knew how to behave.
When the foolish virgins took their lamps, they did not take oil with them.
But those who knew how to act took bottles of oil with their lanterns.
And like the bridegroom, they were all overcome with sleep and lay down.
But at midnight there was a cry, ‘Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’
Dude, all the girls stood up and lit their lanterns.
The foolish ones said to those who knew how to act: "Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are about to go out."
But those who knew how to act replied: "It might not be enough for us and for you, go to the oil sellers and buy what you need."
And when they went to buy it, the groom arrived. The guests entered the house where the wedding was taking place with him and the door was closed.
And the other girls came and stood further away and said to the groom: “Our lord, our lord, open the door!”
But he answered them, “I tell you the truth, I don’t know you.”
Therefore, stay alert, because you do not know the day or the hour.”—The parable of the minas. (Luke 19:11-27)
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who wanted to travel, so he called his servants and gave them his money.
He gave each of them according to his ability. He gave one five bags of gold, another two bags of gold, and another one bag, and then he left.
The man who took the five bags walked quickly and traded with them, and made a profit of five more bags.
He took two bags of food, and won two more bags.
But the other took his bag, went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money.
After a long time, the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.
And the man who took the five bundles came back with five more bundles and said, "My lord, you gave me five bundles, and I have earned five more bundles."
His master said to him: “Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a little; I will put you in charge of much. Enter into the joy of your master.”
And he took the two bags and said, "My lord, you gave me two bags, and I have earned two more bags."
His master said to him: “Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a little; I will put you in charge of much. Enter into the joy of your master.”
And he took one bundle and came, and said, “My lord, I know that you are a cruel man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed.”
Brother, I was scared, so I walked away and hid your bag in the dirt. Here is your money.
But Seydou replied: “You are a wicked and lazy servant! I knew that you harvest what you did not plant and gather what you did not sow,
You should have put my money in the bank, and I would have come back to get it with interest.
And He said to His servants, “Take the mina from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.”
Whoever has something will get more and have plenty. But whoever has nothing, even what he has will be taken away from him.
And the servant who is of no use, throw him out into the darkness. Where will the weeping and gnashing of teeth be?" The Day of Judgment.
“But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit upon his glorious throne.
# Eze 34:17 And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.
I put the sheep on my right and the goats on my left.
And then I will say to the king on my right: 'Come, you who are blessed by my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.'
For my sake you were hungry and you fed me, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you gave me shelter.
I was naked and you dressed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was tied up and you came to me.
At that time the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?
When did we see you as a stranger and take you in? Or naked and clothe you?
"When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?"
And I, the King, will answer them: “I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me!”
And then I will say to those on my left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels:
For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.”
And they will answer: “Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, a stranger or naked, sick or in prison, and did not help you?”
And I would answer them, "The truth is that whenever you didn't do that for one of these little brothers of mine, you didn't do it for me."
And they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.”
The Jews tried to kill Jesus (Mark 14:1-2; Luke 22:1-2; John 11:45-53)
And when Jesus had finished all these words, he said to his disciples,
“You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.”
And at that time the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the house of Caiaphas, the high priest.
And they conspired together to catch Jesus by some trick in order to kill him.
But they said, "We didn't find him during the holiday, so that it wouldn't become a mess among the people." A woman pours perfume on Jesus (Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8)
Now when Jesus was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
My wife came with an expensive bottle of perfume in her hand and poured it over his head while he was eating.
But when the students saw it, they were upset and said, “Why this waste?”
This perfume could have been sold for a lot of money and given to the poor!
But Jesus knew it, and said to them, “Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a good deed to me.”
The poor will always be with you, but I will not always be with you.
If she had poured perfume on my body, she would have prepared me for burial.
And you shall bear true witness: This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached throughout the whole world, and what this woman has done shall be spoken of in memory of her.” The betrayal of Judas (Mark 14:10-11; Luke 22:3-6)
At that time one of the twelve disciples, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
# Jer 21:32; Zech 11:12 And I said to them, “If you think it best, give me my wages; but if not, keep them.” So they paid me thirty pieces of silver.
And from that time he began to look for an opportunity to betray him. The Passover meal with the disciples (Mark 14:12-21; Luke 22:7-23; John 13:21-30)
On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you to eat?”
He said to them, “Go into the city, and a certain man will meet you. Tell him, ‘The Teacher says, My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.’”
And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover meal.
And in the evening, Jesus sat down to eat with his twelve disciples.
While they were eating, Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me.”
They were very sad and began to say to him one by one, “Is it me, Lord?”
He answered them: "The one who put his hand in the dish with me is the one who will betray me."
# Mark 14:21 The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.”
Judas, the betrayer, asked: “Is it I, Master?” Jesus answered: “You have said it.” The Lord’s Evening Meal (Mark 14:22-26; Luke 22:15-20; 1 Corinthians 11:23-25)
And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.”
And he took a cup and gave thanks and said, “Drink of it, all of you.”
This is my blood, the blood of the covenant that was poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
We tell you: I will not drink this grape juice again until the day comes when we drink it again with you in my father's kingdom.
And they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus tells Peter that he will deny him (Mark 14:27–31; Luke 22:31–34; John 13:36–38)
Zech. 13:7; John 16:32 After this, Jesus said to them, “All of you will leave me tonight, for it is written: ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’
But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.”
Then Peter said to him, “Even if everyone else abandons you, I will never leave you.”
Jesus said to him, “Truly I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”
Peter said to him, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.” And all the other disciples said the same. Jesus prays at Gethsemane (Mark 14:32–42; Luke 22:39–46)
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”
And he took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
At that time he said to them, “My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch.”
Then he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.”
And he came back and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, “Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch with me one hour?
Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”
And again he went away and prayed, saying, “Father, if this cup cannot pass from me unless I drink it, your will be done.”
And he came back again and found them sleeping, because they could not lift up their heads for sleep.
But he left them again and went to pray for the third time, and he spoke again by himself.
Then the Master came to the disciples and said to them: “Are you still sleeping and resting? The hour has come, and the Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of sinners.”
Let’s go! Here comes the one who is going to betray me.” Jesus’ arrest (Mark 14:43-50; Luke 22:47-53; John 18:3-12)
And while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, came, accompanied by a large crowd with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and elders of the people.
But their father gave them a sign and said: “The one I kiss is him, arrest him!”
And he came up to Jesus at that moment and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” And he kissed him.
Jesus said to them, "My friend, do what you came for." Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him.
Then one of those who were with Jesus reached out, drew his sword, and struck the high priest’s servant, cutting off his ear.
At that moment Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back in its place. For all who take up the sword will perish by the sword.
Do you think I can't ask my father, who at the same time will send me more than twelve armies of angels?
But how can the sacred texts that say this must happen be fulfilled?”
And Jesus said to the people: “Have you come to arrest me as a criminal, with swords and clubs? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.”
But all this happened so that what was written in the prophets’ books would come true.” At that time, the disciples left him and ran away.

Then they seized Jesus and led him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.
And the chief priests and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put him to death,
But they couldn’t find a way, even though many people gave false testimony. Then they brought two witnesses.
And they said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.’”
And the high priest stood up and said to him, “Have you no answer? What is it that these men testify against you?”
But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, “I put you under oath before the living God: tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.”
Jesus said to him, “You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven!”
The top one among the priests, Dabsho, cut in and said: “Rahou kefr! Brother, do we still need witnesses? You just heard him say kefr.”
What was he sentenced to?" they answered: "He must die!"
They spat on him and slapped him, and some of them beat him.
And they said, “Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you?” Peter denies Jesus (Mark 14:66–72; Luke 22:56–62; John 18:15–18, 25–27)
At that time Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came up to him and said, “You were also with Jesus the Galilean!”
But he denied it in front of everyone, saying, “I don’t understand what you mean.”
And when he went out to the outer gate, another servant saw him and said to those who were there, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth!”
And Peter denied it again, swearing, “I do not know the man!”
Then the bystanders came up and said to Peter, “Certainly you too are one of them, for your accent betrays you.”
At that moment he started swearing and crossing his arms: “I don’t know this man.” At that moment the rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered Jesus’ words: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Jesus before Pilate (Mark 15:1; Luke 23:1–2; John 18:28–32)
And in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death.
They seized him, shook him, and handed him over to Pilate, the governor. The death of Judas (Acts 1:18-19)
And when Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He told them: “I committed a sin by selling the blood of an innocent man.” They said to him: “We don’t care. Sort yourself out.”
He threw the silver into the temple and went out, and went and hanged himself.
But the chief priests, having taken the silver pieces, said, “It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since it is blood money.”
So they came to an agreement and bought the potter’s farm to make it a cemetery where they could bury the brains.
That is why that farm is still called the Farm of Blood today.
Zech. 11:12-13; Jer. 32:6-15; 18:2-3 Thus was fulfilled what the prophet Jeremiah had said: “They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the one on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel,
And they gave it to them to buy the potter’s field, just as my Lord commanded me.” Pilate questions Jesus (Mark 15:2–5; Luke 23:3–5; John 18:33–38)
Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus replied.
But when the high priests and the elders accused him, he gave no answer.
Then Pilate said to him, “Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?”
But he did not answer any of them, so much so that the governor was amazed. Jesus is sentenced to death (Mark 15:6–15; Luke 23:13–25; John 18:39–19:16)
Every Eid, the governor would release one of the marabouts that the people loved.
At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
When they had gathered, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?”
because he knew they gave it to him out of jealousy.
Furthermore, while Pilate was sitting on the bench, his wife sent him a message saying, “Do not do anything to that innocent man, for I have suffered greatly because of him today in a dream.”
The chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas to be released and for Jesus to be put to death.
The governor said to them again, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” And they said, “Barabbas!”
Pilate said to them, “What then shall I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?” They all said, “Let him be crucified!”
And he said, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
When Pilate saw that he could do nothing, but that instead a riot was beginning, he took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this man’s blood! Do with him what you want.”
And all the people answered: “We and our children are wanted for his blood!”
Then Pilate released Barabbas to them, but after having Jesus flogged, he handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mock Jesus (Mark 15:16-20; John 19:2-3)
Then the soldiers led Jesus away to the governor’s palace, and they called together the whole cohort.
We tried to dress him up and put on a red outfit for him.
And they made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put a reed in his hand, and they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”
They spat on him, took a reed and struck him on the head with it.
Then, after mocking him with the red robe, they dressed him in his own clothes and led him away to be crucified. Jesus on the Cross (Mark 15:21-32; Luke 23:26-43; John 19:17-27)
As they led him away, they seized a man, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the countryside, and they laid the cross on him, and made him carry it behind Jesus.
And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means "Place of the Skull",
He was given a drink mixed with something called al-Mirr to drink, but when he tasted it, he did not like to drink it.
# Psalm 22:18 They divide my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment when they crucify me.
They sat down and kept watching him over there.
They put his accusation over his head on a sign that read: “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.”
And two criminals were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
# Ps 22:7–8; 109:25 And the people who passed by wagged their heads at him and reviled him, saying:
“You who will destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself and come down from the cross if you are the Son of God.”
The chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the Jews mocked him even more, saying:
"He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel; let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
Mao trusted God and said, "I am the son of God. Let God save him if he is pleased with him."
And the criminals who were crucified with him also insulted him with their words. The death of Jesus (Mark 15:33-41; Luke 23:44-49; John 19:28-30)
And at noon, darkness fell over the whole land until three in the afternoon.
# Psalm 22:1 And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?” that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”
Some of the bystanders said, “This man is calling for Elijah!”
# Mark 15:23 And one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.
But others said, “Wait, let’s see if Elijah comes to save him!”
And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.
And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom. And the earth quaked, and the rocks were rent.
And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
And they came out of the graves after Jesus rose, and went into the holy city and appeared to many people.
When the centurion and those who were with him, who were keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified and said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”
And there were also many women there, watching from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee and had served him.
Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. The burial of Jesus (Mark 15:42–47; Luke 23:50–56; John 19:38–42)
And in the evening a rich man came, Joseph by name, from Arimathea, who was also a disciple of Jesus.
Then he went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. So Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
And Joseph took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in a clean shroud.
And they buried him in a new tomb they had carved out of rock, and they placed a large stone at the entrance of the tomb and left.
And Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. The guard at the tomb
And early in the morning, after the day on which they had prepared, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
And they said to him, “Lord, remember how that deceiver said, while he was still alive, ‘After three days I will rise again.’”
That is why he ordered the tomb to be guarded until the third day, so that his disciples would not go and steal it and tell the people, “He has risen from the dead,” and mislead the people even more than they were before!
Pilate said to them, “You have a guard; go and make it as secure as you can.”
So they went and put wax on the room and soldiers to guard the tomb.
The resurrection of Jesus (Mark 16:1–8; Luke 24:1–12; John 20:1–10)
And after the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
There was a big earthquake, an angel sent by God descended from the sky, moved the rock and sat on it.
And its lightening was like theorists, and its dust was white like snow.
The guards were trembling with fear of him and became like the dead.
But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.
He’s not here, he left just like he said he would. Come and see the place where he was.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and look, he is going ahead of you into Galilee; you will see him there.’ That is what I have to tell you.”
And they left the tomb quickly, with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
And turning to them, Jesus said, "Peace." Then they came and took hold of his feet and worshipped him.
Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me.” This is what the soldiers reported.
And when the women were on their way, some of the soldiers returned to the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened.
And when the chief priests and the elders had met together and consulted, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,
and say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.’”
"When the governor hears about it, we will appease him and get you out of this problem."
The soldiers took the money and did what they were told. This story has been told among the Jews to this very day. Jesus appears to his disciples (Mark 16:14–18; Luke 24:36–49; John 20:19–23; Acts 1:6owoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoędneędneędneędneędneędneędneędneędneędneędneędneędneędneędneędneędneędneędneędneędneędneędneędne
Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
When they saw Jesus, they worshipped him; but some doubted.
And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
And teach them to do all that I have commanded you, and I will be with you always, until the end of time.”
John the Baptist (Matthew 3:1–12; Luke 3:1–18; John 1:19–28)
This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah: “Behold, I send my messenger before you, who will prepare your way.”
# Isaiah 40:3 A voice cries out in the wilderness: “Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight his paths.”
John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And he went about through all the region of Judaea and all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins.
And John's clothing was made of camel's hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
He preached and said, “He who is stronger than me is coming, and I am not worthy to untie his sandal straps.”
“I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” Jesus’ Baptism and Temptation by Satan (Matthew 3:13-17; Luke 3:21-22)
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And as soon as he came out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him.
# Ps 2:7; Is 42:1 A voice came from heaven saying, “You are my beloved Son, and I am pleased with you.” Satan tempts Jesus ( Matthew 4:1–11 ; Luke 4:1–13 )
And at that time the Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness.
And after forty days, the devil tempted him, and he was with the animals, and the angels served him. Jesus in Galilee (Matthew 4:12-22; Luke 4:14-15; 5:1-11)
After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
He says, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe in the gospel!"
As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”
And in time they left their nets and followed him.
Then, going on a little farther, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending their nets.
And at that time, they left their father Zebedee with the servants in the boat and followed him. Jesus casts out an unclean spirit (Luke 4:31–37)
And Jesus went with his disciples to Capernaum; and on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.
The audience was amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.
And there was in the compound a man inhabited by an evil spirit named Jesus.
And he said, “What is between us and you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!”
And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!”
The demon possessed the man, screamed loudly and came out of him.
Everyone was amazed and began to ask each other: "What is this? A new teaching with authority! Even the unclean spirits he commands, and they obey him!"
And at the same time, the news about Jesus spread throughout the whole region of Galilee. Jesus heals Simon’s mother-in-law (Matthew 8:14–17; Luke 4:38–41)
And when Jesus and his disciples had left the synagogue, they went to the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
And Susanna was lying in bed with a fever, and at that time they spoke to Jesus about her.
He approached her, grabbed her by the hand, and pulled her up. At that moment, the heater fell on her, and she started to work on them.
And in the evening, when the sun had set, people brought the sick, and also those who were possessed by demons, all of them.
And all the people of Jerusalem gathered before the gate.
He healed many people who had various diseases and drove out many demons. He did not let the demons speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus goes to Galilee (Luke 4:42-44)
And early in the morning, Jesus got up and went to a deserted place and began to pray.
And Simon walked with him, looking for him.
When they found him, they said to him: "Everyone is looking for you!"
He said to them, “Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby cities—so that I can preach there also. That is why I have come.”
And he went about preaching in the synagogues of all Galilee, and casting out devils. The leper is healed (Matthew 8:1-4; Luke 5:12-16)
And a leper with a good appearance came to him and fell on his knees before him and said, “If you want to, you can heal me.”
And Jesus had compassion on him, and put forth his hand, and touched him, and said unto him, I will; be thou clean.
And as soon as Jesus had spoken, the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.
At that time, Jesus was ordered to leave and was warned.
# Mark 1:40–45; 2:1–32 And they said to him, “Be careful, don’t tell anyone. But go and show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded, for your healing, so that this may be a testimony to them эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом эконом

But he went out and began to proclaim it freely, and to spread the news around, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in the country; and people came to him from every quarter.
Jesus heals a paralysed man (Matthew 9:1–8; Luke 5:17–26)
A few days later, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and word got around that he was at home.
A lot of people gathered until there was no more room for anyone in front of the door. And he began to tell them about the word of God.
They brought a paralysed man carried by four men.
But they could not come near him because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and lowered the bed on which the paralysed man was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”
And among the people there was a group of Jews who began to think in their hearts:
"Does someone like this man speak like this? He is an infidel! Who but God alone can forgive sins?"
At that moment Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he asked, “Why are you thinking these things?”
Which is easier? To say to a paralysed person: "Your sins are forgiven" or to say: "Get up! Pick up your bed and walk."
But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” he then said to the paralytic,
"Move it, man! Shake your bed and walk to your house."
He stood up, shook his mat, and walked in front of all the people. They were all amazed and praised God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this before!” Jesus calls Levi (Matthew 9:9-13; Luke 5:27-32)
And Jesus went out again by the seaside; and all the people came to him, and he taught them.
As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him.
When Jesus was eating in Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were sitting with him and his disciples. Many of them were following him.
When the scribes and Pharisees saw that Jesus was eating with tax collectors and sinners, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
Jesus heard this and answered them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have come to call sinners, not the righteous.” The discussion about fasting (Matthew 9:14–17; Luke 5:33–39)
And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked him, “Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”
He answered them: "How can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is still with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
But there will come days when the groom will be taken away from them, and that is when they will fast.
No one mends an old garment with a piece of new cloth, for the new patch will shrink and pull away from the old cloth, making the tear worse.
“No one puts new wine into old wineskins, because the new wine would burst the wineskins. New wine is put into new wineskins.” The Sabbath discussion (Matthew 12:1–8; Luke 6:1–5)
And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, “Look, why do your disciples do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”
Answer them: "Brother, didn't you read what David and his companions did when they were in need and hungry?"
# 1 Sam. 21:1–6; 2 Sam. 8:17 How did he enter the house of God in the time of Abiathar, who was the highest of the high priests, and eat the bread of the offering, which only the priests

He added, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.”
Anna, the son of man, is the Lord of the Sabbath, Zada.
The man with the withered hand is vindicated (Matthew 12:9-14; Luke 6:6-11)
And Jesus entered the synagogue again, and there was a man there who had a withered hand.
They started watching him to see if he would heal that man on Saturday, so they could accuse him.
Then he said to the man with the withered hand, “Stand up in front of us!”
And He said to them, “Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life or to kill?” But they were silent.
Jesus became angry and distressed at their stubbornness; he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and it was restored whole, like the other.
The Pharisees left the council chamber and immediately began to plot with the members of Herod’s party to kill him.
Jesus and his disciples walked along the shore of the lake, and many people from Galilee and Judea followed him.
And Jerusalem, and Idumea, and beyond Jordan; and many that dwelt at Tyre and Sidon, because they had heard what great things he had done.
Jesus told his disciples to get a boat ready for him, so that the people would not crowd him.
Because he has healed many people, now every sick person comes to him to be touched.
And the spirits of the dead and the slain of Chufu bowed down to him, crying, "Thou art the Son of God!"
He commanded them sternly not to spread the news about him. The twelve apostles (Matthew 10:1-4; Luke 6:12-16)
And Jesus went up to the mountain and called those he loved to follow him, and they came.
And he chose twelve of them to be with him, and he called them apostles and sent them out to preach.
They have the power to expel the demons.
And the twelve he chose were: Simon, whom he named Peter;
And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, whom he named Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder.
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot
Judas Iscariot, who would betray him. Jesus and Beelzebul (Matthew 12:22–32; Luke 11:14–23; 12:10)
And Jesus went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they and his disciples could not even eat.
When his relatives heard about it, they came to take him away, for they said, “He is out of his mind.”
And the book of the Jews who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, and it is by the prince of demons that he casts out demons!"
Jesus called them to him and spoke to them in parables: “How can Satan drive out Satan?”
If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
