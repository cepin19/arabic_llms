The origin of Jesus Christ (Luke 3:23-38)
This is the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah the son of David, the son of Abraham:
Abraham begat Isaac. And Isaac begat Jacob. And Jacob begat Judah and his brothers.
And Judah begat Perez and Zerah of Tamar; and Perez begat Hezron, and Hezron begat Aram.
And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,
And Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab; and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse.
And Jesse begat David the king. And David begat Solomon, by her that had been the wife of Uriah.
And Solomon begat Rehoboam. And Rehoboam begat Abijah. And Abijah begat Asa.
And Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Uzziah.
Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah.
And Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah.
And Josiah begat Jechoniah and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon.
And after the end of their exile in Babylon, Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel. And Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel.
Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
And Azor begat Sadoc. And Sadoc begat Achim. And Achim begat Eliud.
And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob.
And Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David until the Jews were exiled to Babylon, and fourteen generations from that time until the Christ was born. The birth of Jesus Christ (Luke 2:1-7)
And this is how Jesus Christ was born: Mary, his mother, was engaged to a man named Joseph. But before they got married, she became pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit.
Her fiancé, Youssef, decided to leave her without exposing her, because he was a man who feared God.
While he was still thinking about it, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. For she has conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit.
“She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”
And all this happened so that the words spoken by God through the mouth of the Prophet would be fulfilled:
# Isaiah 7:14 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. (which means God is with us)
When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took his wife home.
But he didn’t sleep with her until she had given birth to a son, and he named him Jesus.
Gian the Wise
Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, Wise Men from the east came to Jerusalem,
And they said, “Where is the king of the Jews who has been born? We have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him.”
Now when King Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
And he gathered together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, and asked them where the Christ should be born.
They answered him, “In Bethlehem in Judea, for this is what the prophet wrote:
Micah 5:2 “But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times.”
Then Herod secretly called the wise men and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared.
After he had called them together to Bethlehem, he said: “Go and look for the child. When you find him, come back and tell me, so that I too can go and worship him.”
After hearing the king’s words, they left. And as they were on the road, the star they had seen in the east before began to move in front of them until it reached and stopped over the place where the child was.
And when they saw the star, they were overjoyed.
And they came into the house and saw the child with his mother, Mary. They knelt down and worshipped him, and opening their bags they presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Then their Lord warned them in a dream that they should not return to Herod, and they took another route and went back to their own country. The Flight to Egypt
After the wise men had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Get up! Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.”
Then Joseph got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and left for Egypt.
# Hos 11:1; Ex 4:22 And he stayed there until Herod died, so that what the Lord said through the prophet would come true: “I called my Son out of Egypt.” The killing of the children in Bethlehem
When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious and gave orders to kill all the boys in and around Bethlehem who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.
It’s what the prophet Jeremiah said, brother.
# Jer 31:15 Thus saith the Lord: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted for her children, because they are no more. The return from Egypt to Nazareth.
And when Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
And they said, “Man, take the child and his mother and go back to the land of Israel, because those who wanted to kill him are dead.”
He got up, shook the child and his mother, and returned to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee.
He went and lived in a city called Nazareth, so that what was said through the prophets might be fulfilled: “He will be called a Nazarene.”
The preaching of John the Baptist (Mark 1:1–8; Luke 3:1–18; John 1:19–28)
And in those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
He says, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near!"
# Isa 40:3 And this is John, the one that Isaiah the prophet spoke of when he said, ‘There is a voice shouting in the wilderness: Prepare the way for the Lord; make his pathways level!’
John wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
And people came to him from Jerusalem, all Judea, and the surrounding region of the Jordan.
and confess their sins, and their iniquity in the valley of Jordan.
When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Do things that show you have repented.
Do not say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
The axe is now laid to the roots of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He shakes the bale of the board in his hand and pours the harvest into the hall, collects the wheat in the warehouse, and as for the straw, he burns it with a fire that does not go out." John baptizes Jesus (Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21-22)
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
But John tried to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”
But Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfil all righteousness.” Then he consented.
And when Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.
And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”
The Temptation of Jesus by Satan (Mark 1:12-13; Luke 4:1-13)
And the Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
Brother, he fasted for forty days and forty nights until he became hungry.
They came to him to test him, and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.”
# Matt. 8:3 Jesus answered him, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”
And they shook the Holy City, and stood on the edge of the temple roof,
# Matthew 4:6 and said, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written: ‘He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’”
# Matt 4:7 Jesus answered him, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”
Then Satan led him up a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
And they said: "We will give you all this, if you kneel down and worship me."
# Deut. 6:13; Mark 8:33 Then Jesus answered him, “Get away from me, Satan! For it is written in the Bible, ‘You must worship the Lord your God and serve only him.’”
Then Satan left him, and angels came and began to serve him. Jesus Preaches in Galilee (Mark 1:14-15; Luke 4:14-15)
And when Jesus heard of John, he went back to Galilee.
And he left Nazareth and came and lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,
so that what the prophet Isaiah had said would come true:
# Isa 9:1-2 Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.
The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light, and to those who sat in the region and shadow of death, light has dawned.
And from that time Jesus began to preach, saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” Jesus calls the first disciples (Mark 1:16–20; Luke 5:1–11)
As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
And He said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.”
And in time they left their nets and followed him.
As he walked by, he saw two other brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were in a boat with their father, Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them.
And they left their boat and followed him. Jesus teaches, preaches, and heals the sick (Luke 6:17-19)
And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.
And spread the news throughout all Syria. And they brought to him all the sick, those suffering from various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, and paralytics, and he healed them.
And many people followed him from Galilee, and from the region called the Ten Cities, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and from the region across the Jordan.
The Sermon on the Mount (Luke 6:20–23)
And seeing the multitudes, Jesus went up into a mountain, and when he was seated, his disciples came to him.
He began to teach them, saying:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the good people! They are the ones who will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for justice! They will be satisfied.
May God have mercy on those who show mercy! They will be shown mercy.
May God bless those who have pure hearts! They are the face of God that we see.
May God bless those who reconcile people! They are God’s children, and that’s what they should be called.
Blessed are those who suffer for the sake of justice! They will inherit the kingdom of heaven.
May you be healthy, even when people insult you, torture you and say all sorts of bad things about you, all because of me!
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven. For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.” Salt and light (Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34–35)
“You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.”
You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hid,
No one lights a lamp and puts it under a bowl; instead he puts it on a lampstand, so that it gives light to all who are in the house.
Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” Sharia
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
I tell you the truth: Heaven and earth will pass away before a single letter or a single stroke of the law disappears until everything is accomplished.
Whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
“I tell you, unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.” Fraud
# Ex 20:13; Dt 5:17; 16:18 “You have heard that it was said to your ancestors, ‘You shall not kill; and whoever kills will be liable to judgment.’”
But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca,’ is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, ‘You fool’ will be in danger of the fire of hell.
So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you,
Leave your gift at the altar and go first and make peace with your brother, then come back and offer your gift.
And if someone complains about you, you should reach an agreement with him quickly before you go to court, so that he does not complain to the judge, who will then tell the police officer about you and you will go to prison.
"You're telling the truth: you won't get out of there until you pay the last penny." Adultery
# Ex 20:14; Dt 5:18 You have heard that it was said to your ancestors, “Do not commit adultery.”
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose a part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.” Divorce (Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11-12; Luke 16:18)
# Deut. 24:1-4 “If a man marries a woman and then she becomes displeasing to him because he finds something indecent about her, he shall write her a certificate of divorce and give it to her.”
But I’m telling you: whoever divorces his wife for a reason other than adultery makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.” The oath
# Num 19:12; Ezek 30:2; Deut 23:21 “You have heard that it was said to your ancestors, ‘Do not break your oath, but fulfill your vows to the Lord.’
But I tell you not to swear at all, not even by heaven, because it is God’s throne.
# Isa. 66:1; Acts 7:49; Ps. 48:2 nor the earth, because it is the place where his feet rest, nor Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King.
And don’t swear by your head, because you can’t change a single white or black hair.
Let your speech be either yes or no; anything more than this comes from the evil one.” — REVENGE (Luke 6:29-30).
# Ex 21:24; Lev 24:20; Deut 19:21 You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’
But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
And if someone wants to fight you to take your hat, let him take your cloak as well.
If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.
“Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone wants to borrow from you, do not turn him away.” Love your enemies. (Luke 6:27, 28, 32-36)
You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’
But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you,
so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
What salary do you deserve if you love those who love you? But isn't it the tax collectors who do this themselves?
And what did others do to you if you didn’t surrender except to your sisters? Isn’t it those who don’t know God who do this thing themselves?
Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Charity
Take care not to do good deeds in front of people so that they can see you, otherwise you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
When you give alms, do not blow a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that people may praise them. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.
But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
“So that your almsgiving may be done in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.” Prayer (Luke 11:2-4)
And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
But you, when you pray, go into your inner room, close the door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
And when you pray, do not keep babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.
Do not be like them; for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Let your kingdom come to us, let your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, just as we forgive those who sin against us.
We did not enter into an experiment, and we were saved from evil.
And if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you your trespasses.
But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father who is in heaven will not forgive your sins.” Fasting
“When you fast, do not look sullen like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.
But you, when you fast, comb your hair and wash your face.
“Make sure that your act of righteousness does not become obvious to others; otherwise, you will have no reward from your Father who is in the heavens.” — Matthew 6:1-4, Luke 12:33-34.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.
Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” The lamp of the body (Luke 11:34–36)
The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye is diseased, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!” God or money? (Luke 12:22-31; 16:13)
“No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.”
Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the sky: they neither sow nor reap nor store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
And who among you thinks he can add a single hour to his life?
Why worry about clothes? Look at the flowers of the cactus and how they grow: they do not work or spin.
But I tell you: even King Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these!
If God dresses up hashish like this, even though hashish grows today and will be thrown into the oven fire tomorrow, then how much more deserving are you, whose faith is weak, to be dressed up by Him!
That is why you should not worry and say, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’
All these things are sought by unbelievers. Your Father in heaven knows that you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
That is why you should not think about tomorrow, for tomorrow is the day when it thinks about itself. Each day has enough evil in it.”
Do not judge others (Luke 6:37-38, 41-42)
Do not judge others, so that you will not be judged.
The judgment you use to judge people will be used to judge you, and the measure you use will be used to measure you.
Why do you see the speck in your brother’s eye, but don’t notice the log in your own eye?
Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when you yourself have a plank in your eye?
Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly and remove the speck from your brother's eye.
“Don’t give what is holy to dogs, and don’t throw your pearls before pigs, or they will trample them under their feet and turn around and attack you.” Keep asking, and you will receive (Luke 11:9-13).
Ask and you shall receive, seek and you shall find, knock and the door will be opened for you.
Ask and you shall receive, seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you.
Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
Is it like when you ask for a fish and they give you a snake?
If you, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him?
So do to people what you want them to do to you. This is what the law and the prophets are all about.” The narrow gate (Luke 13:24)
Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.
But how narrow and difficult is the road that leads to life, and few are those who find it!” The Tree and Its Fruit (Luke 6:43-44)
“Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.”
You know what their harvest is. Does the thorn produce grapes, or does the blackberry produce dates?
So every good tree produces good fruit, and every bad tree produces bad fruit.
Neither a good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.
Every tree that doesn’t bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
“Then you will start to try to get in, but will not be able to, because the master of the house will get up and shut the door.” Words and deeds (Luke 13:25-27)
Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
On the Day of Judgment many people will say to me, “Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?”
And I will say to them: ‘I never knew you! Go away from me, you workers of lawlessness!’” Like the two houses (Luke 6:47-49)
Whoever listens to my words and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock.
The rain poured down, floods came, and the wind blew strongly against that house, but it did not fall, because its foundation was built on rock.
Whoever hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
It rained, floods came, the wind blew on that house and it fell down, and nothing remained of it.”
And as Jesus finished saying these things, the people were amazed at his teaching,
Because he taught them how to be someone with authority, not like their book.
The man with leprosy takes revenge (Mark 1:40-45; Luke 5:12-16)
When Jesus came down from the mountain, great crowds followed him.
And a leper came to him and knelt before him, saying, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”
He stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I do will it, be made clean!” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
# Mark 14:2 And Jesus said, “Tell no one. But go and show yourself to the priest, and make the offering that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.” Healing of a Centurion’s Servant (Luke 7:1–10; John 4:43–54)
And Jesus went into Capernaum, and a centurion came to him, and besought him,
“Sir, my slave is lying paralysed at home, suffering a lot and unable to move.”
And Jesus said, “I will go and heal him.”
But the commander of the hundred replied, “My lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
I am a man, I have people who obey me and I have soldiers who obey me. I tell one, "Go!" and he goes. I tell another, "Come!" and he comes. I tell my slave, "Do this!" and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, “Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.
Many people will be brought from the East and the West to sit at the table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven.
But the children of the kingdom will be thrown out into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
And Jesus said to the centurion: “Go, and let it be done to you according to your faith.” And the slave was healed at that very moment. Peter’s mother-in-law is healed (Mark 1:29-34; Luke 4:38-41)
When Jesus entered Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
He touched her hand, brother, she felt the heat. She got up and started serving him.
At eventide, he brought many people who were possessed by demons to him, and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
# Isaiah 53:4 This happened so that what the prophet Isaiah said would come true: "He took our suffering on him and bore our pain." Jesus and the world (Luke 9:57-62)
When Jesus saw that a crowd was gathering around him, he ordered his disciples to cross over to the other side of the lake.
One of the Jewish scribes came and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”
And Jesus said: "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but I, the Son of Man, have nowhere to lay my head."
Another of the disciples said to him, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”
But Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.” Jesus calms the storm (Mark 4:35–41; Luke 8:22–25)
Now when Jesus had stepped into a boat, his disciples followed him.
And a great wind arose on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but he was asleep.
His disciples went to him and woke him up, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!”
Then Jesus said to them, “Why are you so afraid? You have so little faith!” Then he stood up and ordered the wind and the waves to be still. And there was a great calm.
And the people were amazed and said, “Who is this man that even the wind and the sea obey him?” Expelling demons and drowning pigs (Mark 5:1-20; Luke 8:26-39)
When Jesus went to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, two demoniacs coming out of the tombs met him. They were so fierce that no one could pass that way.
And they shouted: “What’s between us and you, son of God? Did you come here to torture us before it’s time?”
There were a lot of donkeys grazing in a place far away from them.
They cursed the devils and said: “If we graduate, send us to the allies!”
He said to them: "Go away!" They went out and entered the caves, and all the caves fell from the edge of the mountain into the sea and they drowned in the water.
They escaped, were released and entered the city, and told everything that happened to the two men who were inhabited by the demons.
Then all the people of the city came out to meet Jesus. And they begged him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a paralysed man (Mark 2:1–12; Luke 5:17–26)
And Jesus got into a boat and crossed over and came to his own city.
And they brought to him a paralytic lying on his bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven.”
And a group of the People of the Scripture say, "Believe in that which has been revealed to the disbelievers at the beginning of the day and reject its end so that perhaps they will desist [from belief]."
But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, “Why do you think evil in your hearts?
Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” Then he said to the paralyzed man, “Get up! Pick up your mat and go home.”
Go on, get up and go home.
And when the people saw what had happened, they were afraid and praised God, who had given such authority to men. Jesus calls Matthew (Mark 2:13-17; Luke 5:27-32)
As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him.
While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
But when Jesus heard that, he said, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.”
# He 6:6 Go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have come to call not the righteous, but sinners." Fasting (Mark 2:18-22; Luke 5:33-39)
The disciples of John came to Jesus and said to him, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?”
Jesus said to them, “How can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch will pull away from the garment, and the tear will be made worse.
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. Rather, new wine is poured into new wineskins.” The little girl comes back to life, and the woman who touched Jesus’ clothes is healed (Mark 5:21-43; Luke 8:40-56)
While Jesus was still speaking, one of the synagogue leaders came and knelt before him. “My daughter has just died,” he said, “but you can bring her back to life again if you come and lay your hand on her.”
Jesus stood up and followed him with his disciples.
There was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years, and she came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.
That's why she said to herself: "If only he had a stroke, I would be cured."
Jesus turned to her and said, “Daughter, your faith has healed you.” And the woman was instantly healed.
When Jesus arrived at the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,
He said: "Go away! The girl is not dead, she is just sleeping."
And when the people left, he came in, grabbed the girl by the hand, and she got up.
And the news of this thing was spread throughout that whole region. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, crying out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”
When he had gone indoors, the two blind men came to him. Jesus asked them, “Do you believe that I can do this?” They answered him, “Yes, Lord!”
Then Jesus touched their eyes and said, “According to your faith let it be done to you.”
Their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them: “See that no one knows about this!”
But they went out and spread the news about him throughout that whole region. Jesus Heals a Paralytic Man
And when the two blind men were leaving, a group brought a man possessed by a demon.
Jesus cast out the devil, and the Bechukite did not speak. The people were amazed and said, "We have never seen anything like this in Israel!"
But the Pharisees said, “He drives out demons by the power of the prince of demons.” Jesus had compassion on the people.
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
And when he saw the people, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
And he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.”
So ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers into his harvest field.”
The Twelve Apostles (Mark 3:13–19; Luke 6:12–16)
And he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.
And these are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus,
And Simon the Zealot, who was a patriot, and Judas Iscariot, who would betray Jesus. Jesus sends out the twelve apostles (Mark 6:7–13; Luke 9:1–6)
Jesus sent out these twelve and commanded them: “Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.
But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Heal the sick, judge the dead, heal the lepers, cast out demons. You have received freely, give freely.
Do not carry gold, silver or copper in your belts.
Neither a bag, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff, for the servant is worthy of his food.
And whatever town or village you enter, find out who is the most worthy there, and stay with him until you leave.
When you enter a house, greet the people in it.
And if the people of that house deserve it, let your peace come upon them, but if they do not deserve it, then your peace will return to you.
And if any will not receive you, nor hear your words, then go out of that house, or that city, and shake off the dust from your feet.
You are telling the truth: The condition of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment will be more bearable than that of that city!” The persecution that will take place (Mark 13:9-13; Luke 21:12-17)
“I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.”
Take care, however, that you are not handed over to the Jewish council and flogged in their synagogues.
And you shall reproach the rulers and kings on my behalf, so that you may testify before them and before other nations.
And when they deliver it to you, do not think about how to speak or what to say, for at that moment you will be given the words to say.
Because you don’t talk, it’s your father’s soul that talks for you.
The brother wanted to hand his brother over to death, and the father his son, and the children were looking for their parents to kill them.
And all people will hate you because of my name. But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
And when they persecute you in one city, flee to another. For truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If the master of the house is called Beelzebul, how much more will his household be called? Fear God (Luke 12:2-7).
So don’t be afraid of them. There is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and there is nothing secret that will not be known.
What I say to you in the dark, tell in the light. What you hear whispered in your ear, proclaim from the rooftops.
And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in Hell.
Brother, aren’t two birds sold for a franc? And they don’t fall to the ground unless your father in heaven knows about them.
Even the hair on your head is counted.
Don’t be afraid, you are better than many birds!
For if you confess with your mouth and believe in your heart, you will be saved.
But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven.” Jesus and the world (Luke 12:51-53; 14:26-27)
Do not assume that I came to bring peace to the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I came to separate the son from his father, the daughter from her mother, and the daughter-in-law from her mother-in-law.
And man’s enemies will be those of his own household.
Whoever loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
Whoever does not carry their own cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
Whoever saves his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.” The reward (Mark 9:36-41)
Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
Whoever accepts a Prophet because he is a Prophet will receive the reward of a Prophet. And whoever accepts a righteous man because he is righteous will receive the reward of a righteous man.
“If someone gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is my disciple, I tell you the truth, his reward will not be lost.”
The disciples of John the Baptist (Luke 7:18-35)
And when Jesus had finished giving instructions to his twelve disciples, he went from there to teach and preach in the cities of that region.
Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,
They said, “Is it you who has come, or should we wait for someone else?”
Jesus answered them, “Go and tell John what you have seen and heard,
# Isa 35:5-6; 61:1; Luke 4:18-19 The blind will see, the lame will walk, those with leprosy will be healed, the deaf will hear, the dead will be raised, and the Good News will be preached to the poor.
«And good health to those who don’t doubt it!»
And when the disciples of John had gone away, Jesus began to speak to the people about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
So what did you go out to see? To see a man wearing expensive clothes? Those who wear expensive clothes live in the palaces of kings!
So what did you go out to see? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
# Mal. 3:1; Mark 1:2 This is what is written in the Bible: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way."
I tell you the truth: Among those born of women there has risen no one greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful people have been seizing it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
And if you want to believe, it is Elijah who is coming.
Let him who has ears hear!
What do I compare this generation to? They are like children sitting in the market and calling out to each other:
We played music for you and you didn’t dance, we cried for you and you didn’t weep.
When John came neither eating nor drinking, they said, “He has a demon.”
I came as the Son of Man to eat and drink, and you said, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' But wisdom is vindicated by her children.” The cities that did not repent (Luke 10:13-15)
And he began to reproach the cities in which most of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent.
But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you. And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
But I tell you: Tyre and Sidon will fare better on the day of judgment than you.
And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will go down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.” Jesus rejoiced. (Luke 10:21-22)
At that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.
Yes, yes, father, that was your will.
The father gave me everything. No one who knew the son knew the father, and no one who knew the father knew the son, and everyone chose the son to show him to them.
I see that you are tired and your burden is heavy, and I will relieve you.
Shake my hand and learn from me, I am kind and my heart is humble, and you will find peace in your souls.
“My scales are not accurate and my load is light.”
Saturday (Mark 2:23-28; Luke 6:1-5)
At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.
But when the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.”
# 1 Sam. 21:1–6; Lev. 24:9 Jesus said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him?”
How did he enter the house of God and eat the bread of the Eucharist, which was not lawful for him or for those who were with him, but only for the priests to eat?
# Matthew 28:9-10 Brother, haven't you read in the law how the priests in the temple break the Sabbath commandment on the Sabbath and no one blames them?
But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple.
# Hos 6:6; Matt 9:13 If you had known what this saying means, ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless.
And He said to them, “The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.” And He said to the man who had the withered hand, “Get up.” (Mark 3:1–6; Luke 6:6–11)
And Jesus went out from there and entered their synagogue.
And there was a man there whose hand was withered. And they asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”—so that they might accuse him.
Jesus said to them, “Which one of you, if you have a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?”
And a human being is worth so much more than an animal! That’s why it’s okay to do good on a Saturday.”
Then Jesus said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he stretched it out and it was restored, just as whole as the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Jesus, to see how they might kill him. Jesus is the servant whom God has chosen.
Jesus knew this and withdrew from that place. Many people followed him, and he healed them all.
He ordered them not to tell anyone about him.
This happened so that what the prophet Isaiah said would come true:
# Isa 42:1-4 Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.
He doesn’t work, he doesn’t shout, and no one in the streets can hear his voice.
A weak reed that he cannot break, a wick of smoke that he cannot extinguish. Until he lets justice prevail.
And the people had hope in his name. Jesus and Beelzebul (Mark 3:20-30; Luke 11:14-23; 12:10)
And at that time they brought to him a man who was blind and possessed by a demon. And Jesus healed him, and he began to speak and see.
And all the people were amazed and said, “Could this be the Son of David?”
But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.”
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.
If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then can his kingdom stand?
And if we go out to the beaches with Beelzebub, who will your students go out with? That's why they will judge you.
But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.
How can someone enter a strong man’s house and carry off his belongings unless he first ties up the strong man? Only then can he rob his house.
Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.
That is why I tell you that people’s sins and blasphemy will be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.” The Tree and Its Fruit (Luke 6:43–45)
“Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for the tree is known by its fruit.
You sons of snakes, how can you say good things when you are evil? The tongue speaks what is in the heart.
A good man brings forth good things from the good treasure of his heart, and an evil man brings forth evil things from his evil heart.
Your transport: Every empty word people say, they will be held accountable for on the Day of Judgment.
“You are acquitted by your words, and you are condemned by your words.” The Pharisees ask for a miracle (Mark 8:11-12; Luke 11:29-32).
At that time some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Jesus, “Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.”
But He answered them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.”
# Matthew 12:40 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
# Matthew 12:41 The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.
# I Mel 10:1–10; II Chr 9:1–12 The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here!” The return of the unclean spirit (Luke 11:24–26)假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名假名
When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.
At that time, he said, “I will return to the house I left.” And when he returned, he found it empty, swept, and organized.
Then he walks and takes with him seven other spirits worse than him, and they enter that man and live in him, and his condition becomes worse than it was before. That is also how it will be with this wicked generation.” Jesus’ mother and brothers (Mark 3:31-35; Luke 8:19-21)
While Jesus was still speaking to the people, his mother and brothers stood outside wanting to speak to him.
One of them said, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside and want to speak with you.”
But he answered the man who spoke to him, “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”
He stretched out his hand toward his disciples and said, “Here are my mother and my brothers.”
Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother, my sister, and my mother.
Parable of the Sower (Mark 4:1-9; Luke 8:4-8)
And Jesus went out of the house that day, and sat by the lake.
And a lot of people gathered around him, until he got into a boat, and all the people stood on the shore.
And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, “Behold, a farmer went out to sow.
And when he sowed, some seed fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured it.
And another fell on rocky ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth.
But when the sun rose, it withered and dried up because it had no roots.
And another fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it.
Another seed fell on good soil and produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.
“He who has ears, let him hear!” Why did Jesus speak in parables? (Mark 4:10-12; Luke 8:9-10)
At that time Jesus’ disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”
He answered them, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.
Whoever has it will be given more, so that he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.
That is why I speak to them in parables, because they look but do not see, and hear but do not understand.
# Isa 6:9–10; Mrk 8:18; Jn 12:39–41; Acts 28:26–27 Isaiah’s prophecy was fulfilled in them, which says: You will hear but never understand, and you will look but never see.
This people has a hardened heart; they close their ears and shut their eyes, so that they do not see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn to me, so that I may heal them.
But you, why, your eyes are for seeing and your ears are for hearing!
I tell you the truth: Many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.” Explanation of the Parable of the Sower (Mark 4:13-20; Luke 8:11-15)
So listen to what the farmer's proverb means:
And whenever anyone hears the word of the kingdom and doesn’t understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the one sown along the path.
And that which was sown among the thorns, this is he who heareth the word; and the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.
But he has no roots inside him, he can endure for a while, but when a difficult time comes or when he is persecuted for his words, he will fall over time.
And the one who sows among thorns is the one who hears the word, but the worries of the world and the love of wealth choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
But the one that was sown on good soil is he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.” The parable of the tares
And Jesus told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.
But when the crop sprang up and bore grain, then the darnel appeared also.
The servants of the landowner came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?
He said to them, “An enemy has done this.” The servants said to him, “Do you want us to go and gather them?”
But he said, “No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them.
Let both wheat and weeds grow together until harvest time, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, 'First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'"

And he gave them another parable, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.
It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it grows up, it becomes the largest of all vegetables and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the sky come and nest in it.
And another said: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.”
Jesus spoke all these things to the people in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable.
# Matthew 13:2 This was done so that what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled: “I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.” The explanation of the parable of the weeds
Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”
He answered, “The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.
The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom; the darnel, for the sons of the evil one;
The enemy who planted them is Satan, the harvest is the end of time, and the harvesters are the angels.
But just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so shall it be in the last days.
For I am the Son of Man, and I will send my angels to gather out of my kingdom all causes of sin and all who do evil.
They throw them into the middle of the fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth for years to come.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in their Father’s kingdom. He who has ears, let him hear!” It is like a treasure, a diamond, and a net.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.
He found a valuable piece of gold, went and sold everything he had, and bought it.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind of fish.
When it was full, the fishermen took it to the shore, sat down, put the good fish in boxes and threw away the bad ones.
And so it will be at the end of time: the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous.
They throw them into the middle of the fire, and there will be crying and grief for years to come. The new and the old.
And Jesus said to his disciples, “Do you understand all these things?” They answered, “Yes.”
And he said to them, “Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.”
And when Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there,
And when He began to teach in their synagogue, they were amazed and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these miracles?”
Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother’s name Mary? And aren’t his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
And aren’t all his sisters here with us? So where did this man get all this stuff from?”
And so they doubted him. Jesus said to them, “A prophet is respected everywhere except in his own hometown and among his relatives.”
And He did not do many miracles there because they did not believe in Him.
The death of John the Baptist (Mark 6:14–29; Luke 9:7–9)
At that time King Herod heard about Jesus,
And he said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.
And Herod arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.
Because of John, they said: "It's a sin if you take her."
And they wanted to kill him, but they were afraid of the people, because they considered John a prophet.
But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod,
That’s why he promised her and swore to give her anything she asked for.
As her mother had instructed her, she said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter!"
The king was sad, but he ordered that she be given what she had asked for, because of the oath he had sworn and the guests.
And Shkon sent, cut off John's head in prison.
They brought his head on a plate and gave it to the girl, who took it to her mother.
And John’s disciples came and took up his body and buried it, and went and told Jesus. Jesus feeds five thousand men (Mark 6:30–44; Luke 9:10–17; John 6:1–14)
When Jesus heard of this, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart. And when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.
As the Malfuka descended, he saw many people, so he took pity on them and healed their sick.
When evening came, his disciples went to him and said, “This is a remote place, and the day is now over. Send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves.”
Jesus said, “They don’t need to go away. You give them something to eat.”
They said to him, “We have only five loaves of bread and two fish.”
Jesus said, “Bring them to me.”
He told the people to sit down on the grass. Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up toward heaven, and blessed them. Then, breaking the loaves into pieces, he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were full. They took twelve baskets full of leftovers.
And the people who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children. Jesus walks on water (Mark 6:45–52; John 6:15–21)
Then he ordered his students to get on the boat and go to the other side of the lake before he sent the people away.
And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
But at that time the boat was far from the shore and was overwhelmed by the waves, because the wind was against it.
Before dawn Jesus went to them, walking on the water.
But the disciples were terrified when they saw him walking on the water and said, “It’s a ghost!” And they cried out in fear.
But Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, “Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid.”
Peter replied, “Lord, if it’s you, tell me to come to you by walking on the water.”
Jesus said to him, “Come.” So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus.
But the robot was afraid of the strong wind, and when he started to sink, he cried out: “Lord, save me!”
Then Jesus reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying, “You of little faith, why did you doubt?”
And as they went out in the felucca, the wind calmed down.
And in the boat they fell down before him and said, “Truly you are the Son of God!” Jesus heals many sick people (Mark 6:53-56)
When Jesus and his disciples had left that place, they came to the region of Gennesaret.
And when the people of that country came to know Jesus, they spread his message throughout the whole region and brought to him all who were sick.
They asked him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak. And all who touched it were healed.
The Traditions of the Elders (Mark 7:1-13)
Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked,
"Why don't your students respect the elders' customs? And why don't they wash their hands when they eat?"
He replied, “And why do you not obey God’s commandment and persist in your traditions?”
# Ex 20:12; Deut 5:16; Ex 21:17; Lev 20:9 God said, “Honour your father and your mother, and whoever curses his father or his mother must be put to death.”
But you say, if a man says to his father or mother, ‘What I owed to you I have given to God; you will not get anything from me.’
Thus you have nullified the word of God by your tradition.
Hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:
# Isaiah 29:13 The Lord says: These people come near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
“They worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.” What defiles a person? (Mark 7:14–23)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, “Listen and understand.
It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a man, but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.”
His disciples came to him and said, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?”
He answered them: “Every tree that my father in heaven did not plant will be uprooted.”
Stay away from them! They are blind people leading the blind. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.”
But Peter said to him, “Explain the parable to us.”
And Jesus said: “Brothers, do you still not understand?”
Brother, don’t you see that anything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach, and then comes out of the body?
But what comes out of the mouth comes from the heart, and this is what defiles a man.
For it is from the heart that evil thoughts, murder, adultery, corruption, theft, false testimony and unbelief come.
These are the things that defile a man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.” The faith of the Canaanite woman (Mark 7:24-30)
And Jesus went out from there and came to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and cried, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon.”
But he did not answer her a single word. His disciples came to him and begged him, saying, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.”
Jesus answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
But she came and fell on her knees before him, saying, “Lord, help me!”
He replied: “It’s not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”
She said: “Yes, sir! Even dogs eat the leftovers that fall from their master’s table.”
Jesus answered her, "Woman, you have great faith! Let it be done for you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus heals many people
And Jesus went away from there and came beside the Sea of Galilee; and He went up on the mountain and sat there.
And many people came, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the mute, the crippled, and many others, and they put them at his feet, and he healed them.
And the people were amazed when they saw the dumb speaking, the deformed healed, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel. Jesus feeds four thousand men (Mark 8:1-10)
Jesus called his disciples to him and said, “I have compassion on these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way.”
The disciples said to him, “Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to feed such a crowd?”
And Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”
Jesus told the people to sit down on the ground.
And he took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks to God, divided them, and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate until they were full, and took away the remaining seven large baskets full of food.
The men who were killed numbered four thousand, not counting women and children.
And after the people had left, he got into a felucca and went to the Majdal area.
Signs of the times (Mark 8:11-13; Luke 12:54-56)
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus and asked him to show them a miracle from heaven.
Jesus answered them, “When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.’
In the morning you say, ‘Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and threatening.’ You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.
An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.” Then he left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees (Mark 8:14-21)
When the students reached the other shore, they forgot to bring bread with them.
Jesus said to them, “Be careful and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
The students discussed among themselves and said: "That's because we don't have bread."
But Jesus knew it, and said, “Why are you discussing among yourselves that you have no bread, you of little faith?”
Don’t you understand it yet? Don’t you remember the five loaves of bread that were distributed to five thousand people and how many big baskets you collected of what was left?
And the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many large baskets did you fill?
How can you not understand that I am not talking about bread? Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!”
At that time, he told them to beware of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees, not the yeast of bread. Peter testifies that Jesus is the Messiah (Mark 8:27-30; Luke 9:18-21).
When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say the Son of Man is?”
They answered him, “Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
He said to them, “But who do you say I am?”
Simon Peter replied, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
And Jesus said: "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
And I tell you: You are Peter, which means a big rock, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”
And at that time he instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus speaks for the first time about his death and resurrection (Mark 8:31; 9:1; Luke 9:22-27).
From that time Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes of the Jews, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.
Then Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “God forbid it, Lord! This must never happen to you.”
But Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get away from me, Satan! You are an obstacle in my path, because you are thinking like a human being, not like God.”
At that time Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone wants to follow me, let him not love his life but take up his cross and follow me.
Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his life? Or what can a man give in exchange for his life?
Verily, I am the Son of man, and I will come with my angels in the glory of my Father, and then I will reward every man according to what he has done.
I tell you the truth: some of those standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Jesus shows his spirit to his disciples (Mark 9:2–13; Luke 9:28–36)
And after six days Jesus took with him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and led them up into a high mountain apart.
And he changed before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothing became white as light.
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with him.
Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters: one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.”
And while he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.”
When the students heard this, they fell on their faces and were very afraid.
But Jesus came and touched them. 'Don't be afraid,' he said. 'Get up.'
And when they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus alone.
As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, “Do not tell anyone about what you have seen, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.”
And the disciples asked him, “Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
He answered them, “Elijah certainly will come and restore everything.
But I will send you Elijah the prophet before that great and dreadful day of the LORD comes. But they did to him whatever they pleased. Then the Son of Man will also suffer at their hands.”
At that time the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy possessed by a demon (Mark 9:14-29; Luke 9:37-43)
And when Jesus and his disciples came to the people, a man came to him, knelt down before him, and said:
“Oh God, have mercy on my son, he has seizures and suffers a lot, and he always falls into fire and water.”
And I brought it to your students, but they couldn’t heal it.”
And Jesus answered and said, “You unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him here to me!”
And Jesus cast out the devil, and he went out of him, and the child was healed at that time.
At that time Jesus’ disciples came to him and asked, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?”
He said to them, “Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.” эконом

# 17:21 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: But this kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting. Jesus speaks again about his death and resurrection (Mark 9:30-32; Luke 9:43-45).
And while the disciples were together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men,
They will kill me and I will rise on the third day.” You worry too much. Jesus pays the temple taxes.
When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax went to Peter and said, “Does your teacher pay the temple tax?”
He answered, “Yes, from foreigners.” And when he came home, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect toll or tribute? From their sons or from strangers?”
Peter said, "From the Brainians." Jesus said, "Then the children of the country are free."
But we don’t want to cause them any trouble. Go to the lake, throw in your line, and catch the first fish you find.
