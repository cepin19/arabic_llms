And Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Uzziah.
Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah.
And Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah.
Jeconiah and his brothers were born in the time of Josiah, during the Babylonian exile.
And after Jeconiah had been carried away captive to Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Salathiel; and Salathiel became the father of Zerubbabel.
Zerubbabel was the son of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the son of Jeconiah, and Jeconiah the son of Jehozadak.
And Azor begat Sadoc. And Sadoc begat Achim. And Achim begat Eliud.
And Eliud begat Eleazar. And Eleazar begat Matthan. And Matthan begat Jacob.
And Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David to the Babylonian exile, fourteen generations; and from the Babylonian exile to the Messiah, fourteen generations. The birth of Jesus Christ
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this: After his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.
But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.”
And this all happened, that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,
“Look, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel,” which means, “God is with us.”
And when Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him, and took his wife.
He did not know her until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.
Adoration of the Magi
Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, Wise Men from the east came to Jerusalem,
Who said: 'Where is He Who is born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the east and have come to worship Him.'
Now when Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
So he gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together and asked them, “Where is the Christ to be born?”
And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,
And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.
Then Herod secretly called the magi, and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared.
Then he sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.”
When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.
And they came into the house and saw the child with Mary his mother. And falling down they worshipped him, and opening their treasures they offered him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Then, being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed for their own country by another route. The Flight to Egypt
And when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Get up! Take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.”
He got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt.
And he was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.
When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,
A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more. Return to Nazareth
After Herod’s death, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt.
saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child’s life are dead.”
He got up, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee.
And he came and lived in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled: “He will be called a Nazarene.”
John the Baptist prepares the way
And in those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,
saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”
This is the one referred to by the prophet Isaiah when he said, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.’”
This John wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
Then Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him.
And they took of it in Jordan, confessing their sins.
But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Bear fruit, then, that befits repentance.
And do not think that you can say, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
Now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. So every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He who has a winnowing fork in his hand will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.” The Baptism of Jesus Christ
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
But John tried to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”
Jesus answered him, “Allow it now, for this is the way for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he allowed him.
And when Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him;
And a voice from heaven said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”
Jesus faces temptation
Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
After fasting for forty days and forty nights, he was finally hungry.
Then the tempter came to him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.”
Then he answered and said, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes out of the mouth of God.’”
Then Satan took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
He said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written that ‘He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’”
Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, ‘You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.’”
Then the devil took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. 9 He said to him, “I will give you all these things if you fall down and worship me.”
Then Jesus said to him, “Be gone, Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.’”
Then Satan left him, and angels came and began to serve him. The beginning of his ministry in Galilee
And when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee.
And leaving Nazareth, He came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,
so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled,
The land of Zebulun, the land of Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.
The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shined.
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” The Call of the First Disciples
As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
He said to them, “Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.”
At once they left their nets and followed him.
Then He went from there and saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them.
And immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed him. Jesus teaches and heals the sick.
And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.
And his fame spread throughout all Syria. And they brought to him all sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and pains, and those who were possessed by demons and were epileptic and paralyzed, and he healed them.
And great multitudes followed him from Galilee, and from the ten cities, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.
The Sermon on the Mount - The Beatitudes
And seeing the multitudes, He went up on a mountain, and when He was seated His disciples came to Him.
He opened his mouth and taught them, saying:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you. You are the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
“You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.
Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven. The fulfillment of the law
“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
Verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
Whoever, then, breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
“For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.” Anger
“You have heard that it was said to the ancients: ‘You shall not murder,’ and whoever murders shall be liable to judgment.
But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.
So when you bring your offering to the altar, and there you remember that your brother has something against you,
So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.
Be reconciled quickly with your opponent while you are on the way with him, lest your opponent hand you over to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.
Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt not come out thence, until thou hast paid the last mite. Adultery
“You have heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not commit adultery.
But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell. Divorce
And it was said: “Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.
But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, except for fornication, causeth her to commit adultery; and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. The oath
“You have also heard that it was said to the men of old, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but carry out the vows you have made to the Lord.’
But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne:
Neither by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.
And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.
But let your speech be, ‘Yes, yes; no, no.’ What goes beyond this is from the evil one.” Vengeance
“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’
But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
And whoever wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat as well.
And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two miles.
Whoever asks you, give to him; and whoever wants to borrow from you, do not turn him away. Love your enemies
“You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’
But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;
So that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
For if you love those who love you, what reward will you have? Do not even tax collectors do the same?
And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even pagans do that?
Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.
Charity
“Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of people to be seen by them. Otherwise, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
So that your almsgiving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. Prayer
And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward.
But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.
So do not imitate them. For your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
So you should pray like this: Our Father in heaven, may your name be sanctified.
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive those who sin against us.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
And forgive not the people their trespasses, your Father will not forgive your trespasses. Fasting
And when you fast, do not look sullen like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.
But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;
So that you do not appear to people to be fasting, but to your Father who is in secret. Your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you openly. Treasures in heaven
“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.
If your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money. God takes care of us.
Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?
And who of you, by being anxious, can add a single cubit to his stature?
And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin.
But I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
And if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O men of little faith?
Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear.
For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Condemnation of others
“Judge not, that you be not judged.
For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and the measure you give will be the measure you get.
Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?
Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is the log in your own eye?
You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye!
Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces. Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.
Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.
Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?
Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a snake?
So if you, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets. The narrow gate
Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.
How narrow is the gate and how difficult is the road that leads to life, and few are those who find it! The tree and its fruit
“Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves!
You will know them by their fruits. Do they gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
So every good tree produces good fruit, but the bad tree produces bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
So by their fruits you will recognize them.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord!' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Then many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’
Then I will say to them: I never knew you! Go away from me, you evil-doers! Wise builders and foolish builders
Whoever hears these words of mine and acts on them is like a wise man who built his house on rock.
And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.
Everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
And the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.
And when Jesus had finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching,
For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
Healing of a leper
And when He came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him.
And behold, a leper came to him and knelt before him, saying, “Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.”
Then Jesus reached out his hand and touched him. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!” And instantly the leprosy disappeared.
Then Jesus said to him, “See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.” The Faith of a Centurion
And when Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for a favor.
He said, “My Lord, my son is one of my family, and your promise is ever true. You are the most just of all judges.”
Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.
The centurion replied, “Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, “Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.
And I tell you that many will come from the east and the west and will eat with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
But the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go; let it be done for you according to your faith.” And the servant was healed at that very moment. The healing of Peter’s mother-in-law and others
When Jesus came to Peter’s house, he saw his mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she got up and began to serve them.
When evening came, they brought to him many who were possessed with demons; and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.
So that what was said through the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: “He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases.” The cost of discipleship
And when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.
Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”
Jesus said to him, “The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”
And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
And Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.” Calming the storm
And when He went aboard the ship, His disciples followed Him.
And a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but he was asleep.
And his disciples went and woke him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!”
Then He said to them, “Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?” Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
And the people were amazed, saying, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!” Exorcism of demons
And when he came to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met him, coming out of the tombs, so fierce that no one could pass through that place.
And behold, they cried out, saying, “What have we to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?”
And there was there a herd of many swine feeding at a distance from them.
Then the devils said to him, “If you cast us out, let us go into the herd of pigs.”
He said to them, “Go!” They came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the waters.
As for the shepherds, they fled and went into the city and told everything, and about the demoniacs.
And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their neighborhood.
Healing a paralytic
So he got into a boat and crossed over and came to his own city.
And they brought to him a paralytic lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven.”
And some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man blasphemes!”
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, “Why do you think evil in your hearts?”
Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'?
But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he then said to the paralytic—“Get up, take your mat and go home.”
He got up and went home.
When the crowd saw this, they were amazed and praised God, who had given such authority to men. The calling of Matthew
And as Jesus passed thence, he saw a man sitting at the receipt of custom, called Matthew; and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.
And as he sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, “Healthy people don’t need a doctor, but sick people do.”
Go and learn what this means: I desire mercy, not sacrifice. For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” Question about fasting
Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?”
Jesus said to them, “Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.
No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear results.
And they do not put new wine into old wineskins, lest the wineskins burst, and the wine be spilled, and the wineskins be destroyed. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.” The Raising of Jairus’ Daughter and the Healing of the Bleeding Woman
And while he was still speaking to them, behold, a ruler came in and knelt before him, saying, “My daughter has just died; but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”
And Jesus arose, and followed him, and his disciples.
And a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the tassel of His robe.
For she said to herself, “If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed.”
Jesus turned and saw her. “Take heart, daughter,” he said, “your faith has healed you.” And the woman was healed at that moment.
And when Jesus came to the ruler’s house, and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,
He said, “Move aside, for the girl is not dead but asleep.” And they laughed at him.
When the crowd had gone out, he came and took her by the hand, and the girl got up.
And that report went out into all that land. The healing of two blind men.
And as Jesus passed by, two blind men followed him, crying out, and saying, Have mercy on us, thou son of David.
And when he came to the house, the blind men came to him. And Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They said to him, “Yes, Lord.”
Then he touched their eyes and said, “According to your faith let it be to you.”
Then their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, “See that no one knows about this!”
But they went out and spread it throughout that whole land. Another healing of a mute
And as they were going out, they brought to him a dumb man possessed by a demon.
But when the devil went out, the dumb man spoke; and the multitudes marveled, saying, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!”
But the Pharisees said, “He casts out demons by the prince of demons.” The workers are few.
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
And when he saw the multitudes, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed, and scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.
Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;
“Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.”
Sending of the Twelve
Then He called His twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.
Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother.
Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, who was surnamed Thaddaeus;
Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not.
But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
And as you go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.
Do not acquire gold, silver or copper for your belts.
And take neither a bag for the journey, nor two tunics, nor shoes, nor a staff; for the laborer deserves his food.
And into whatsoever city or village ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go forth.
And when you enter the house, greet him.
If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you.
And whoever does not receive you or listen to your words, go out of that house or that city, and shake the dust off your feet.
Verily, on the Day of Judgment, the land of Sodom and Gomorrah will be in a better state than that city.
“Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.”
But beware of men, for they will hand you over to the courts and flog you in their synagogues.
But you will be handed over to governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles.
But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.
For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.
And a brother will hand over his brother to death, and a father his child; children will rise up against their parents and have them killed.
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.
And when they persecute you in one town, flee to another. For truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel, before the Son of Man comes.
A disciple is not above his master, nor a servant above his lord.
It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more shall they call them of his household?
So do not fear them, for nothing is covered up that will not be revealed, and nothing secret that will not be known.
What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops.
And fear not those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father’s care.
But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
So don’t be afraid! You are worth more than many sparrows!
Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.
But whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.
Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.
I came to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
The enemies of man are the people of his household.
If anyone loves his father or mother more than me, he is not worthy of me; and if anyone loves a son or daughter more than me, he is not worthy of me.
Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
Whoever accepts you accepts me, and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.
Whoever accepts a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and whoever accepts a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person’s reward.
And whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward.”
John the Baptist and Jesus
And when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities. Jesus and John the Baptist
When John heard in prison what the Messiah was doing, he sent word by means of two of his disciples,
And he said to him, “Are you the one who is to come, or shall we wait for another?”
Jesus answered and said to them, “Go and tell John what you hear and see:
The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
Blessed is he who does not stumble.
And when they had gone away, he began to say to the crowds concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothes? Behold, those who wear soft clothes are in the houses of kings.
But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
For from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force.
For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
And if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come.
He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
“To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others:
And they say, "We played the flute for you, but you did not dance! We mourned for you, but you did not weep!"
For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.” Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida!
Then he began to rebuke the cities where most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent.
Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You shall go down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
But I tell you that on the day of judgment it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom than for you.” Rest for the weary.
At that time Jesus answered and said, “I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and prudent and have revealed them to babes.
Yes, Father, for so it has pleased you.
All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
“For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”
Lord of the Sabbath
At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.”
He said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?”
How he entered the house of God, and ate the bread of the offering, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?
Or have you not read in the Torah that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple desecrate the Sabbath and are guiltless?
But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple.
For if you had known what this means, I desire mercy and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the innocent.
For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”
Then he left that place and went to their synagogue.
And there was a man whose hand was withered, and they asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”—so that they might accuse him.
And He said to them, “Which one of you who has a sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?
Man is better than a sheep! So it is permissible to do good on Saturdays.
Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and it was restored, as sound as the other. The chosen one of God.
When the Pharisees had gone out, they plotted how they might destroy Him.
And Jesus taught and departed from there. And many people followed him, and he healed them all.
And He enjoined them that they should not make it known,
so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled,
Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.
He does not quarrel or cry out, nor is His voice heard in the streets.
A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till he brings justice to victory.
And upon his name shall the Gentiles hope.” Jesus and Beelzebub
Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see.
Then the crowd was amazed and said, “Is this not the son of David?”
But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, “This man casts out demons only by Beelzebul the ruler of the demons.”
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.
For if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
But if it is by Beelzebul that I cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.
But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you!
Or how can anyone enter a strong man’s house and plunder his belongings, unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.
He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.
Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.
Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.
Make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt. For from the fruit the tree is known.
You offspring of vipers! How can you speak good things, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, but an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart.
But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.
For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.” Jonah verse
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.”
He answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.
For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and indeed a greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here!
When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.
Then he says, “I will return to my house from which I departed.” Then he comes to it and finds it empty, swept, and adorned.
Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter and dwell there, and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So shall it be also for this wicked generation.” Doing the Will of God
And while he was speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him.
Then someone said to him, “Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.”
Then he answered and said to him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?
Then he stretched out his hand toward his disciples and said, “Here are my mother and my brothers.”
For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother, and sister, and mother.”
The Parable of the Sower and its Interpretation
On that day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.
And great crowds came together to him, so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the whole crowd stood on the beach.
And he spoke to them at length in parables, saying: “Behold, a sower went out to sow.
And as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured it up.
And another fell on rocky ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:
But when the sun came up, it was scorched; and since it had no root, it withered away.
And another fell on the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it.
And another fell on good ground, and brought forth fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.
He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?
He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.
Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
For the prophecy of Isaiah applies to them: ‘You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed look but never perceive.’
For the heart of this people has become dull, and they scarcely hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes, so that they may not look with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn, and I would heal them.
But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.
Truly I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, but did not see it, and to hear what you hear, but did not hear it.
Hearken therefore unto the parable of the sower.
Anyone who hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path.
And that which fell among thorny ground, these are they who have heard the word,
But it has no root in itself, and is short-lived. When trouble or persecution arises because of the word, he immediately stumbles.
And that which was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word; and the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
But that which was sown on good ground is he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and produces, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.” The Parable of the Wheat and the Tares
He gave them another example, saying, “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.
But when the grain sprouted and produced a crop, then the weeds also appeared.
Then the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?
He said, “An enemy has done this.” The servants said, “Shall we go and gather it?”
He said, “No, lest you uproot the wheat along with the weeds while you gather them.”
Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn. The Parable of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast
He gave them another example, saying, “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and planted in his field.
It is the smallest of all seeds; but when it has grown it is larger than all the plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches.
He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a woman who took yeast and hid it in three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.”
All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and He did not speak to them without a parable.
This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet: ‘I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.’ The Parable of the Weeds Explained
Then Jesus sent the crowd away and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”
He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man.
The field is the world. The good seed are the sons of the kingdom. The tares are the sons of the evil one.
The enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world, and the harvesters are angels.
For as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of the age.
The Son of Man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evil-doers.
and cast them into the fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear. The parables of the treasure, the pearl, and the net
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
The Kingdom of Heaven is also like a man who is a merchant seeking good pearls.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
The kingdom of heaven is also like a net that was cast into the sea and gathered fish of every kind.
So when it was filled, they drew it up on the shore; and they sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but threw the bad away.
Thus it will be at the end of the world: the angels will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous,
and cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
Jesus said to them, “Do you understand all this?” They said, “Yes, Lord.”
He said to them, “Therefore every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.”
And when Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there. Nazareth rejects Jesus
And when he came to his homeland, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?”
Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t His mother called Mary, and His brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Aren’t all his sisters with us? Where did he get all this from?”
And they stumbled over Him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.”
And He did not create many of them, for He found them unfaithful.
The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus,
And he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead; that is why these powers are at work in him.”
For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife.
For John had been saying to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”
And when he wanted to kill him, he feared the people, because they considered him to be like a prophet.
Then on Herod’s birthday Herodiah’s daughter danced in the middle and pleased Herod.
He then swore an oath that he would give her whatever she asked for.
For she had learned it from her mother: “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.”
The king was grieved, but because of his oaths and the guests who were with him, he commanded that it be given.
So he sent and had John beheaded in the prison.
So he brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and she took it to her mother.
So his disciples went and took up the body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. The Feeding of the Five Thousand
When Jesus heard of this, he departed from there in a boat and went to a deserted place by himself. But the crowds heard of it and followed him on foot from the cities.
And when Jesus went out He saw a great multitude; and He was moved with compassion for them, and healed their sick.
When evening came, his disciples went to him and said, “This is a remote place, and the hour is now late. Send the crowds away so that they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves.”
Jesus said to them, “They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.”
They said to him, “Here we have only five loaves of bread and two fish.”
He said, “Bring her to me.”
He ordered the crowd to sit down on the grass. Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, blessed them, broke them, and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowd.
And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.
The number of men who ate was about five thousand, apart from women and children. The miracle of walking on water
And straightway Jesus compelled his disciples to get into a boat, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
When he had sent the crowds away, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
And the ship was in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.
And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.
When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, “It’s a ghost!” And they cried out in fear.
Then Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”
Peter answered him and said, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.”
He said, “Come.” So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus.
But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, “Lord, save me!”
Then Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, “O you of little faith, why did you doubt?”
And when they boarded the ship, the wind ceased.
And those who were in the boat came and worshipped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God!”
And when they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret,
And the men of that place recognised him. And they sent into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were sick,
And they begged him that they might only touch the hem of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well.
The Pure and the Impure
Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said,
“Why do your disciples go beyond the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.”
He answered and said to them, “Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?
For God said, “Honor your father and your mother”; and, “Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.”
But you say, “Whoever tells his father or his mother, ‘Whatever you might benefit from me is an offering,’” and does not honor his father or his mother.
You have nullified the word of God by your tradition!
Hypocrites! Isaiah rightly prophesied about you,
This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.
And they worship Me in vain, while they are teaching doctrines that are human commandments.”
Then he called the crowd to him and said to them, “Listen and understand.
It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a man, but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.
Then his disciples came to him and said, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?”
He answered and said unto them, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.
Leave them alone; they are blind guides. If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.”
Peter said to him, “Explain the parable to us.”
Jesus said to them, “Do you not yet understand?”
Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is expelled into the sewer?
But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a man.
For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.
These are the things that defile a man. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.” The faith of the Canaanite woman
And Jesus went out from there and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and cried, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely demon-possessed.”
But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
And he answered and said unto me, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
So she came and worshipped him, saying, “Lord, help me!”
But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to dogs.
And she said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table!”
Then Jesus answered and said to her, “O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that very hour. The Feeding of the Four Thousand
Then Jesus went from there and came to the side of the Sea of Galilee, and went up to the mountain and sat there.
Then great multitudes came to Him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others; and they laid them down at Jesus’ feet, and He healed them.
And the people were amazed when they saw the dumb speaking, the lame walking, the blind seeing, and they glorified the God of Israel.
Jesus called his disciples to him and said, “I have compassion on these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way.”
His disciples said to him, “Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to feed such a crowd?”
Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”
Then He commanded the crowds to sit down on the ground.
Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.
And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
Then he sent the crowds away and got into the boat and went to the region of Magdala.
Request for a verse
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test him, and they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
And he answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.
And in the morning: It is winter today, for the sky is red and gloomy. You hypocrites! You know how to discern the face of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times!
An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed. The leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
When His disciples had come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
And Jesus said to them, “Watch out and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
And they said to one another, “We did not take bread.”
And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, “Why are you thinking to yourselves, you of little faith, that you have no bread?”
Do you still not understand? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
And the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets did you take?
How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?
Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter's Confession of Christ
When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say the Son of Man is?”
They said, “John the Baptist; others say, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?”
Simon Peter answered and said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!”
Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”
Then he instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was Jesus the Messiah. Jesus foretells his death and resurrection
From that time Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.
Then Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you.”
Then he turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.”
Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.
For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it.
For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and suffer the loss of his soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each one according to his works.
Verily I say unto you, there are some standing here who shall not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.
Theophany
And after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain apart.
And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with him.
Then Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.”
And as he was speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.”
When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground, terrified.
Then Jesus came to them and said, “Get up. Don’t be afraid.”
Then they raised their eyes, and saw no one except Jesus alone.
As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, “Tell no one what you have seen until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.”
And his disciples asked him, saying, “Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things.
But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.”
Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Healing a boy possessed by a demon
And when they came to the assembly, a man approached him and knelt before him.
And he said, “Lord, have mercy on my son, for he has seizures and suffers terribly; he often falls into the fire and often into the water.”
And I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.”
Jesus answered, “You unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him here to me.”
Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “Why could we not cast it out?”
Jesus said to them, “Because of your unbelief. For truly I tell you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for эконом эконом эконом

But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.
And as they were walking in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.”
They will kill him, and on the third day he will rise again.” And they became very sad. The temple tax
And when they came to Capernaum, those who collected the two-drachma tax came to Peter and said, “Does your teacher not pay the two-drachma tax?”
He said, “Yes.” And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect toll or tribute? From their sons or from strangers?”
Peter said to him, “Of foreigners.” Jesus said to him, “Then the children are free.”
But lest we cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. When you open its mouth, you will find a shekel. Take it and give it to them for me and for yourself.”
