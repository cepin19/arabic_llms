There is a good seat available.
I’m sorry, the toilet is not working. I need help.
It is neither difficult nor obscure.
I'll take you to your seat. This street, please.
Excuse me, can I ask you a question?
I think so.
Hi. It's nice to meet you.
I’d like to check in my luggage to Tokyo, please.
Can you show me a bigger one?
I think clothes made in Japan are definitely better designed.
You should have surrendered.
Please say that again.
Could you write down the address and phone number for me, please?
Is it hot?
Which airport am I departing from?
Didn’t you receive the form on the plane?
I need an iron.
It comes to thirty-eight dollars altogether.
Thank you for sharing your unique thoughts with us.
I go skiing twice a month during the season.
I was born on April 1st, 1955.
Can I rent a racket?
Is this the right bus to the city centre?
How much does the perfume cost?
What is it for?
Where can I go for the official procedures?
Fifty pounds.
Does that include taxes?
What are cysts?
Please call an ambulance.
I'll bet three bucks on that.
How is Jay?
I don’t eat what I don’t like.
