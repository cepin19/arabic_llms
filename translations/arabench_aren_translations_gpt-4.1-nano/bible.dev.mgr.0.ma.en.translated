The first chapter: The ancestors of Jesus Christ
These are the ancestors of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:
Ibrahim, son of Ishaq, Ishaq, son of Yaqub, and Yaqub, son of Judah and his brothers.
And Judah begat Perez and Zerah of Tamar, and Perez begat Hezron, and Hezron begat Ram.
And Aram, son of Aminadab, and Aminadab, son of Nahshon, and Nahshon, son of Salmon.
And Salmon the son of Nahshon, of the tribe of Judah; Boaz the son of Salmon, of the tribe of Judah; and Obed the son of Boaz.
Waisy, the son of King David. And David, the son of Solomon, from the woman he was married to, Uriah.
And Solomon son of Rehoboam, Rehoboam son of Abijah, Abijah son of Asa.
And Asafof was the son of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat was the son of Joram, and Joram was the son of Azariah.
And Azariah son of Uzziah, Uzziah son of Ahaz, Ahaz son of Hezekiah.
Hizkiah was the son of Manasseh, and Manasseh was the son of Amos, and Amos was the son of Josiah.
Josiah was the son of Jehoiakim and his brothers at the time when the Jews were exiled in Babylon.
And after the Jews returned from Babylon, Keniah son of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel son of Zerubbabel,
Zurbabel was the son of Ebedhoad, Ebedhoad was the son of Eliakim, and Eliakim was the son of Azor.
Wa'azor, son of Sadooq, Sadooq, son of Akhim, Akhim, son of Elyod.
Eliud was the son of Eliezer, and Eliezer was the son of Matan, and Matan was the son of Jacob.
And Jacob, the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.
All the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, from David until the time they were taken captive to Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the time they were taken captive to Babylon until the birth of Christ are fourteen generations. The birth of Jesus Christ
And so was the birth of Jesus Christ: when Mary was engaged to Joseph, and before they married, she became pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit. Luke
And Yusuf, her fiancé, was a God-fearing man who didn't want to expose her, and he decided to part ways with her in secret.
And whenever he thought about this, he saw in a dream an angel of the Lord and he said to him: "O Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child she is carrying is by the power of the Holy Spirit."
Behind her, she will give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus, because he is the one who will save his people from their sins. Luke
All of this happened so that the word of the Lord could be fulfilled through the mouth of the prophet who said:
This farm will bear fruit, and a son will be born, named Emmanuel, which means: God with us.
And when Joseph woke up from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and married Mary.
But he did not have any relation to her until she gave birth to a son, and he named him Jesus. Luke 2:21
Chapter Two: The scientists of the stars came to see Jesus
And when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, during King Herod's reign, some wise men from the East came to Jerusalem guided by a star.
Kisulo: "Where is the king of the Jews who was born? Because we saw his star rising in the East and we came to worship him."
And when King Herod heard this, he was afraid, and all the people of Jerusalem with him.
Then the heads of the religious scholars and the learned men of Sharia gathered and asked them: "Where was Jesus born?"
And they answered him: "In Bethlehem of Judea, where the prophet foretold:"
And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, you are the smallest among the clans of Judah, for from you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.
Then Herod sent for the wise men of the stars in secret, and questioned them about the time the star appeared.
Then he sent them to Bethlehem and told them: "Keep a close watch on the boy. When you find him, come and tell me so I can also go and worship him."
And when they heard the king's words, they left. And the star that they had seen in the east appeared to them again, and it continued ahead until it reached the place where the child was, and it stopped.
And they didn't see the star, so they were very happy.
And when they entered the house, they saw the boy and Mother Mary, and they were kneeling and prostrating to him, opening their chests and giving him gold, frankincense, and pure musk.
And when they understood from the dream that they should not return to Herod, they took another route and returned to their country. Jesus' family flees to Egypt.
And after the scholars left, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said to him: "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Yusuf woke up, took the boy, and they went to Egypt at night.
And he remained until Herod died to fulfill the word of the Lord spoken through the prophet who said: "Out of Egypt I called my son." Herod kills the little children.
When Herod saw that the wise men had played him, he became very anxious and ordered all the boys in Bethlehem and its surroundings, two years old and under, to be killed, because that was the time he had learned from the wise men of the stars.
Thus, the word of the Lord was fulfilled through the prophet Jeremiah who said:
From Ramla, you hear screams, crying and wailing a lot, Rahel is crying for her children and doesn't want anyone to comfort her, because her children have died. Jesus' family is returning from Egypt.
And when Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream while he was in Egypt.
He told him: "Get up, take the boy and go back to the land of Israel, because those who wanted to kill the boy are dead."
And Joseph woke up, took the boy, and went back to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Herodias had taken control of the land of Judea instead of Herod, he was afraid to return there. And because God warned him in a dream, he went to the Galilee region.
A man came to a city called Nazareth and settled there, so that the word of God would be fulfilled through the prophets who said: "He will be called a Nazarene." Mark 1:24; Luke 2:39; John 1:45
Chapter Three: John the Baptist prepares the way for Jesus
To your days, John the Baptist came to the wilderness of Judea to tell people,
And he says to them: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near." Matthew
And this is the man that the prophet Isaiah spoke about when he said: "A voice crying out in the wilderness, saying: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
And John's clothing was made of camel hair, and the belt he wore was made of leather, and he lived on locusts and wild honey.
And people would come to him from Jerusalem and all the land of Judea, and all the surrounding areas of the Jordan Valley.
And they deliberately caused the fall of Jordan through his hands, and they are confessing to their sins.
And when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to him to be baptized, he said to them: "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath of God? When
Well, Benny, your repentance is through your good deeds.
And don't start telling yourselves: I am Abraham. I tell you: God is able to make children of Abraham from this stone. John
Now the axe is placed on the tree trunk, and every tree that does not yield good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. When?
I will baptize you with water so you can repent, but the one who comes after me is stronger than I am, and I do not deserve to carry even his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
And his beneficial milk nourishes her with study and gathers the honey in its hives, but the straw will burn it with the force that will never extinguish it. John baptizes Jesus
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
But John didn't leave him and said to him: "I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?"
And Jesus answered and said to him: "Let it be so now; for it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he permitted him.
And Jesus deliberately went up from the water, and the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and resting upon him.
And you hear a voice from heaven saying: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Matthew 12:18; 17:5; Mark 1:11; Luke 9:35
Chapter Four: Satan Tempts Jesus
And then God’s Jesus went to the desert to be tested by Satan. The Hebrews
He fasted for forty days and forty nights, and then hunger came to him.
Then Satan came to him who was testing and said to him: "If you are the son of God, tell this stone to become bread."
And Jesus replied to him: "It is written in the book of God: Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God."
And then, Satan took him to the holy city of Jerusalem, and set him on a high place above the house of God,
And he told him: "If you are a son of God, cast your head down, because it is written in the Book of God: God will command His angels concerning you, and through them He will lift you so that your foot will not strike against a stone."
And Jesus answered him: "It is written in the book of God again: Do not test the Lord your God."
And after that, Iblis ascended to a very high mountain, and behind him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He told him: "I'll give you all this unless you bow down to me and worship me."
And Jesus replied to him: "Go away, Satan! For it is written in the book of God: You shall worship the Lord your God and serve Him alone."
And after this, Satan left him, and some angels came to mock him. Jesus preaches in Galilee.
And when Jesus heard that John the Baptist was imprisoned, he withdrew to Galilee. Matthew
And he left Nazareth and went to dwell in Capernaum, which is by the Sea of Galilee, in the land of Zebulun and Naphtali. John
And thus, what the Prophet Isaiah said is fulfilled:
Oh land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, on the road by the sea from the other side of the Jordan Valley, the land of Galilee of the nations that are not Jews!
The people who were wandering in darkness saw a great light, and those living in the land of death and among it, a light shone upon them.
From that time on, Jesus began to preach to the people and say: "Repent! The kingdom of heaven is near." Matthew 3:2 Jesus chooses his first disciples
And when Jesus was going along the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
And Jesus told them: "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
At that time, they left their window and followed him.
Then, he went after and saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John, with their father Zebedee in a boat repairing their nets. And he called them.
And they leave the boat and follow Jesus. Jesus teaches and heals.
And Jesus went throughout all the towns and villages of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God, and healing people from every disease and weakness. Matthew
He told me all the news about Syria, and brought me all the patients who are suffering because of the illness: the possessed, those with wind-related issues, and the Zohafa, and he heals them.
And many groups from Galilee, the ten towns, Jerusalem, and the land of Judea, and from the other side of the Jordan River followed them.
Chapter Five: The Sermon of Jesus on the Mountain
And when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain; and when he sat down, his disciples came to him.
And he started teaching them and said:
The happiness of the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Lucky are those who cry, because God will comfort them.
The happiness of the humble, because they will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who are hungry and thirsty for the obedience of God, because they will be satisfied.
Blessed are those who show mercy, because God will have mercy on them.
Blessed are those whose hearts are pure, because they will see God.
Blessed are those who help people live happily, because they will be called the children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 1 Peter 3:14
Blessings upon you, except that people insult you, pass by you, and say all bad things about you with lies, for His sake. 1 Peter 4:14
They rejoiced and flew with happiness because your reward is great in the heavens, for it is like this that they surpassed the prophets who came before you. Acts 7:52 The burden of the earth and the light of the world
Salt of the earth, and if the salt loses its saltiness, what can make it salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet. Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34,35
We are the light of the world, a city on a hill cannot be hidden. John
There is no one who lights the lantern and puts it under the bucket of water, but it is placed in its proper place to illuminate everyone in the house. Mark.
And thus, let your light shine before people, so they may see your good deeds and give glory to your Father in heaven." 1 Peter 2:12 The Law
He doesn't think I came to abolish the law of Moses or the prophets; I didn't come to abolish them but to complete them.
And I tell you the truth: He removes the sky and the earth, and not a single letter or dot of the Law is removed until everything in it is fulfilled. Luke
The one who does not do any of these small commandments and teaches others to do the same will be the least in the kingdom of heaven. And the one who does and teaches them will be great in the kingdom of heaven.
And I tell you: if your obedience is not greater than that of the scholars of the law and the Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. The tradition
You have probably heard the saying: Do not kill, and whoever kills must be punished.
But I tell you: everyone who worries about his brother should take control of him, and whoever tells his brother: "Oh, there's no benefit in you," should take him to court. And whoever tells his brother: "Oh, fool," deserves the fire of Hell.
Otherwise, you brought your gift and placed it on the altar, and you remembered that your brother is right about you.
Leave your gift in front of the slaughterhouse and go reconcile with your brother first, then come and give your gift.
Make peace with those who are feuding with you; none of you remain on the road to the court, before the judge takes you, and the judge puts you in the custody of the security forces, and the security forces imprison you.
I tell you the truth: you won't leave until you pay the other person the money you owe. Corruption
And I heard him say: Don't spoil it.
But I tell you: anyone who sees a woman and desires her, has already sinned in his heart.
Otherwise, your right eye would cause you to fall into sin; remove it and cast it away from you, because, by Allah, you will lose part of your sight or cast all of it into Hell. When?
Otherwise, your right hand would cut you off from sin; cut it off and throw it away, because it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell." Matthew 18:8; Mark 9:43 Divorce
And the second saying: Anyone who divorces his wife must give her her dowry. When
But I tell you: whoever divorces his wife for any reason other than unfaithfulness causes her to commit adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11,12; Luke 16:18; 1 Corinthians 7:10,11.
And I heard you again telling your ancestors: If you swear, you won't break it, but you will die for the Lord with your sacrifices.
As for me, I tell you: never swear, not by the sky, for it is the throne of God. ʿAqūb
Neither on the earth where his feet are placed, nor in Jerusalem where the city of the great King is.
And don't swear by yourself either, because you can't restore a single hair of it to black or white.
But if your talk is yes, say: Yes. And if no, say: No. And the extra talk beyond that is from Satan. Revenge
And I heard him say: Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.
But I tell you: do not repay evil with evil, but if someone has wronged you on your cheek, turn to him the other also.
And whoever wants to take you to court to seize your belongings, leave him even your shoes.
Otherwise, if someone insists on you walking with them for a thousand steps, walk with them for two thousand.
And whoever asks you for something, give it to him; and whoever wants to borrow from you, do not refuse him empty-handed. They want to deceive you.
And I heard him say: You love those close to you and hate your enemy.
But I tell you: they want to harm you, and pray for those who persecute you.
So that you become the children of your father who is in the heavens. Because he is the one who makes his sun shine on the wicked and the good, and sends the rain on those who do good and those who do evil.
Because if you only love those who love you, what reward do you have? Isn't it even the tax authorities who do this?
Otherwise, you only greet your own brothers. Why would you be better than others? Isn't it the case that those who worship idols do the same?
Yes, be all of you, just like those in the sky above.
Chapter Six: Charity
Be careful not to do good in front of people just to be seen by them, or you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. When
Or if you want to give charity, do not boast about it in public like the hypocrites do in prayer houses and markets to be praised by people. I tell you the truth: those people have already taken their reward from others.
But unless you give some charity, your hand must be free; you don't know what your right hand is doing.
To keep your charity secret, the sky that cannot be hidden from will reward you. Prayer
And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. I tell you the truth: they have already received their reward from people. Luke
When you pray, enter your house, close the door behind you, and pray to your Lord who is in secret; your Lord, whom nothing is hidden from, is the one who will reward you.
And when you pray, do not start repeating a lot of empty words like those who worship idols, who think that if they talk too much, God will respond to them.
So don't be like them, because the one in the sky knows what you need before you ask for it.
And thus, you pray this prayer: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,
And your kingdom will come, and your wish will be as in heaven, so on earth.
The bread that suffices us for our sustenance today.
And He forgave us our sins, just as we forgive those who wrong us.
And we vowed not to fall into temptation, and to be saved from Satan.
Because if you forgive people's mistakes, the One in the sky will forgive your mistakes.
But unless you forgive people their mistakes, He will not forgive you, even if the mistakes are in the heavens. Fasting
Except for silence, do not be angry like the hypocrites who frown to show people that they are fasting. I tell you the truth: those have taken their reward from the people.
But when you fast, oil your hair and wash your face.
It's not for people to see that you are fasting, but for the one who knows what's in your heart, and the one who sees what is hidden from others—that is who will reward you. Treasures in the sky
Don't gather treasures for yourselves on the earth, where they decay with rust and corrosion, and where thieves dig and steal them. Yaqub
But they gather treasures for you in the sky, wherever they are covered with mold and rust, and wherever they are guarded by the guards and not stolen.
Wherever your treasure is, there your heart will be also. Noor Al-Dhat
The eye is the lantern of the soul. If your eye is good, your entire soul will be illuminated.
But if your eye is ugly, your whole body will be dark. And if the light in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!» God and wealth
No one can be a stubborn slave to their master, because either they will hate one of them and love the other, or they will be loyal to one and fall out with the other. And so, you cannot be slaves to God and money at the same time. Don't worry about it.
And I tell you: do not worry about your livelihood, what to eat or drink, nor about your dignity, what to wear. Isn't life more important than food, and dignity more important than clothing?
Look at the birds of the sky, they neither plant nor harvest nor gather in storage houses, and the sky’s provision for them is what they eat. So, aren’t we much better than them?
Who among you is the one who, if he lifts his worries, can only add an hour to his life?
Why do you burden yourself with worries about clothing? Look carefully at the roses in the field and how they grow; they don't suffer or struggle.
But I tell you the truth: even Solomon himself, in all his glory, never wore a flower like one of theirs.
Well, the little faith! If the spring in the field, which we see today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, God dresses it like this, how could it not dress you better?
And on this, everyone worries and says: What are we going to eat? Or what are we going to drink? Or what are we going to wear?
Even those who don't know God ask for all this, and maybe those in the sky know that you all need all of this.
But his heart was initially on the Kingdom of God and His purpose, and all of this will be added to you.
And do not burden yourself with worries for the coming day; leave tomorrow's worries for tomorrow. Every day, focus only on its own concerns.
Chapter Seven: Don't Judge Anyone
Do not judge anyone so that they do not judge you.
Because the rulers, to rule over you, with it will they be ruled over; and the words you use to express yourselves, with it will be expressed to you. Mark.
Why do you look at the straw in your brother's eye and not notice the beam in your own?
And how are you going to tell your brother, "Let me remove the hay from your eye," when your own eye is full of a stick?
Oh this hypocrite, take a step back at first to see clearly, then you'll understand how to remove the straw from your brother's eye.
Do not give the sacred thing to the dogs so they do not harm you and cut you off, and do not throw your essence to the swine so they do not trample on it with their feet. Ask, turn, and knock.
They ask and they take. They turn around and you will find them. Knock on the door and it will open for you.
Everyone who asks will be given, everyone who searches will find, and everyone who knocks the door will have it opened for them.
Who among you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?
There is no one except that he asks for a little fish to give to Faa?
Well, if you are the ones who are not good, you know how to give your children good things. How come the one in the sky doesn't give good things to those who ask for them?
As people want to do with you, you should do the same with them, because this is what teaches the law of God and the prophets. Luke 6:31 The narrow door
They enter through the narrow door, while the door that leads to destruction is wide and easy to walk, and many enter through it.
How narrow is the Bosphorus and how difficult is the road that leads to life, and how few find it. The tree knows its fruit.
Beware of the lying prophets, who come to you dressed as sheep but are inside ravenous wolves.
My way is their mistake, you know them. Can you harvest grapes from thorns, or jujubes from the sidr tree?
Thus, every good tree bears good fruit, and every bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot give a bad harvest, and a bad tree cannot give a good harvest.
Every tree that does not give good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. When
Thus, you will recognize them by their fruits." Matthew 12:33 We must do God's will.
Everyone who says to him: "Sir, Sir!" will enter the kingdom of the heavens, but the one who enters it is the one who does God's will in the heavens.
I sacrifice the day for you, many will tell me: Oh sir, oh sir! Isn't it in your name that we prophesied? And in your name that we went mad? And in your name that we performed many miracles?
At that moment, I will tell them: I never knew you! Still, I am among the sinners! The example of two houses.
Everyone who listens to my words and acts upon them is like a man who, with his mind, built his house on the rock.
And when the rain fell and the valleys overflowed, and a strong wind came and struck that house, it did not collapse, because its foundation was built on rock.
The one who listens to my words and does not act on them is like a man who foolishly built his house on the sand.
And when the rain fell and the valleys overflowed, a strong wind came and struck that house, and the storm was fierce and its fury intense.
And when Jesus finished speaking these words, the crowds were amazed at his teaching. Mark
Because he taught them as if he had authority, not like the scholars of their religion.
Chapter Eight: Jesus Keshafi, a Strong Man
And when Jesus came down from the mountain, a large crowd followed him.
And one of the servants approached him, bowed to him, and said: "O my master, if you wish, you can make me pure."
And Jesus reached out his hand, touched him, and said: "I want to; be clean!" At that moment, the disease left him, and he became clean.
And Jesus told him: "Be careful not to tell anyone about it, but go and show yourself to the priest, and give the gift that Moses commanded, so that this may be a testimony to them." The servants of the military leader are being healed.
And when Jesus entered Capernaum, a military officer came to Him seeking help.
And he told him: "Oh my lord, my servants at home are in bed, paralyzed and suffering a lot."
And Jesus says to him: "I am going to go to heal him."
And the military commander replied: "I don't deserve, sir, to enter under my roof, but just say one word and my workers will be healed."
Because even I, there are those who judge me and I judge my army, I tell her: Go! And she goes, and I tell the other: Come! And he comes, and I tell my servant: Do this! And he does it.
And when he heard this, Jesus was amazed and said to those following him: "I tell you the truth: I have not found anyone in Israel with such strong faith."
I tell you that many people will come from the east and the west and sit down to eat with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. Luke
As for those who should have been in the kingdom, they just wander outside in the dark, where there will only be crying and gnashing of teeth.
And then, Jesus said to the military commander: "Go! According to your faith, it will be done for you." And at that very moment, his servant was healed. Jesus heals Nseeba Peter and many people.
And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he found Peter's sister-in-law lying in bed because she had a fever.
And Jesus touched her hand, and as she walked away, the fever left her, and she was healed.
And when evening came, many possessed people were brought to him, and he cured all the patients with a word from him.
And thus the words of the Prophet Isaiah are fulfilled: "He took our pain and bore our sickness." How should those who follow Jesus be?
And when Jesus saw the crowd of people distressed about him, he ordered his disciples to cross to the other side of the sea.
And he approached one of the scholars of Sharia and told him: "O my master, I will follow you wherever you go."
And Jesus answered and said: "Foxes have dens, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
And another of his students told him: "Oh my master, let me go now to bury my father."
But Jesus answered him: "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus causes a shudder.
And when Jesus got into the boat, his disciples followed him.
A very strong wind came on the sea, even sinking the boat, and Jesus was sleeping.
They brought the children close to him, woke him up, and said to him: "Save us, sir, we're dying!"
And he says to them: "Why are you afraid, O little faith?" Then he got up and rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.
And the men were amazed and said: "Who is this that even the wind and the sea obey him?" Jesus casts out the demons from two men possessed by demons.
And when Jesus reached the other side of the sea, near the country of the Gerasenes, he encountered two men possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs, and they were very dangerous, so much so that no one could pass along that road.
And when they saw him, they started shouting and saying: "What is between us and you, son of God? Did you come here to torment us before the time?"
And there was a large piece of livestock grazing in a place near Tam.
And the crazy ones wanted Jesus and said to him: "If you save us, send us to enter the place of the animals."
And he told them: "Go!" and they went in, and the whole piece slid and fell from the edge of the mountain into the sea and sank in the water.
And they fled quickly and went to the city and told about everything that happened, and about what happened to the men who were possessed by the madness.
And all the inhabitants of the city went out to meet Jesus. When they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Chapter Nine: Jesus the Healer of the Paralyzed
And Jesus got into the boat, crossed the sea, and returned to his city.
And some people brought him, a man who was paralyzed, lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man: "Take heart, my son, your sins are forgiven you."
Some of the scholars of the Sharia said out of their concern: "This man is uttering words of disbelief!".
And Jesus knew what they were thinking and said: "Why are you thinking about bad things in your hearts?"
As Sahl, he says: "Your sins are forgiven," or he says: "Get up and go."
But I will show you that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins." And he said to the paralytic: "Get up, take your bed, and go to your house."
And the man got up and went to his house.
And when the crowds saw what had happened, they were afraid and praised God, who had given such authority to people. Jesus chooses when
And when Jesus was going from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax booth. And he said to him: "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
Afterward, Jesus sat down to eat in Matthew's house, and many tax collectors and sinners came to sit with him and his disciples. Luke
And when the Pharisees saw him, they said to his disciples: "Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
And when Jesus heard them, he answered them and said: "It is the sick who need a doctor, not the healthy."
Come on, learn the meaning of this speech: I really want mercy, not sacrifice, because I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners. Question about fasting
Then John the Baptist's disciples came to Jesus and asked him: "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
And Jesus answered them and said: "Can the wedding guests be sad while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
No one patches old clothes with a piece of new fabric, because the patch will shrink and the tear will get bigger.
And no one makes new wine in old leather bottles because if they do, the bottles will burst and the wine will be lost and the bottles broken. But we put the new wine in new leather bottles so that neither the wine nor the bottles are lost. The president's daughter and the woman who touched Jesus' belongings
And when he was telling them this, a president came to him, bowed to him, and said: "My daughter has died, but come and put your hand on her, and she will live."
And Jesus and his followers and disciples went out.
There was a woman who was ill, for twelve years she was bleeding, she approached Jesus from behind and touched his cloak.
Because she thought to herself: "If I just touch his belongings, I will be healed."
And Jesus looked around and saw her, and said: "Take heart, daughter; your faith has healed you." And at that moment, the woman was healed.
And when Jesus arrived at the house of the ruler and saw that they were mourning with the lira and the crowd of people causing a commotion,
He told them: "Get out of here! The girl didn't die, she's just sleeping!", and they were laughing at him.
And when Jesus brought them out, he entered and took the girl by the hand, and she got up.
Goodbye to the news, all of that gossip. Jesus heals two blind men.
And whenever Jesus passed by, two blind men followed him, shouting and saying: "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
And when he entered the house, the blind men came to him. And Jesus asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to heal you?" They answered him, "Yes, Lord!"
At that moment, Jesus touched their eyes and said: "According to your faith, it will be done for you."
And their eyes deceive them, and Jesus forbade them and said: «You have it, tell it to someone else!».
But they went out and started spreading rumors all over that neighborhood. Zizou is getting better.
And they didn't even bother to take the blind people out, until they brought him a man, Zizon, possessed by madness.
And when Jesus cast out the demon, the swallows chirped. The crowds were amazed and said: "We've never seen anything like this in Israel!"
As for the Pharisees, they said: "He is casting out demons by the prince of demons!" Matthew 10:25; 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15 The trial of Jesus
And Jesus was walking through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God, and healing every disease and sickness. Matthew
And when he saw the crowds of people, he had compassion on them because they were distressed and scattered like sheep without a shepherd. Mark
And he says to his students: "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few." Luke
So they asked the harvest master to send the harvests to his harvest.
Chapter Ten: Jesus Sends His Disciples to the Desert
Then Jesus called his disciples the Twelve and gave them authority to cast out demons and to heal people from every disease and every sickness.
And these are the names of the apostles: the first is Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew, and James son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot who will betray Jesus.
So Jesus sent this parable and told them: "Do not go to the Gentiles and do not enter the town of the Samaritans,"
But Siro went to the sheep of the chosen ones from the people of Israel.
And tell your people that the time of the Kingdom of Heaven is near.
They healed the patients, revived the dead, returned the purified corpses, and cured madness. You took it for free? Yes, give it for free.
Don't put in your pockets gold, silver, or copper.
No package, no two slippers, no shoes, no cane, because the worker deserves his wages. 1 Corinthians 9:14; 1 Timothy 5:18
Neither the city nor the neighborhood you entered for them; ask someone who deserves to host you, and stay with them until you leave on your own.
Otherwise, if you enter someone's house, greet the people there.
Otherwise, if they fill the house, they deserve your greeting; your greeting reaches them. Otherwise, if they do not deserve it, your greeting returns to you.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have accepted you filling a house or a city, nor would they have listened to your words. They came out of their sleep and stirred up the dust that you revealed. The deeds
I tell you the truth: the condition of the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the Day of Judgment will be lighter than that of that city. Luke 10:4-12 The upcoming judgment
I'm sending you like sheep among wolves, so be as clever as foxes and as gentle as doves. Luke
Be careful of people, because they will take you to court, and in their prayer houses they will beat you, Marcus
And they will bring you before judges and kings on my behalf, so you may testify before them and before the nations that are not Jews.
And when they take you, do not worry about how or what you will say, because at that time they will give you what to say.
Actually, it's not me who will speak, but the spirit of Bacum in the sky that will give you the words you say.
Khou Ghislam hands over his brother to be killed, and Bou Ghislam hands over his son to be killed, and the children will rise against their parents and kill them, Marcus
And all people hate you for the sake of my name. But those who remain steadfast until the end, I will come. When
But whenever they pass through a city, they run away to another one. I'm telling you the truth: don't come near any Israeli settlement until the son of man comes.
The student's way is not better than his teacher's, nor are the workers better than their master. Luke
Beware of the student if he is like his teacher, and the servants if they are like their master. And if they call the owner of the house Beelzebul, then what will they call the inhabitants of his house? Matthew 9:34; 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15
Don't be afraid of them, because everything hidden will be revealed, and everything concealed will become apparent. Mark.
And about that, which I told you at night, say it during the day. And everything you heard in secret, reveal it from above the rooftops.
Don't be afraid of those who kill the body and cannot kill the soul, but fear the one who can destroy both the soul and the body in hell.
Two birds are sold for one dirham! And I won't let one of them fall to the ground unless the one in the sky wants it.
So you don't even realize that your entire head is being counted.
Well, don't be afraid, you're better than many birds.
Whoever confesses him in front of people, I will also confess him before my Father in heaven.
But the one who denies me before people, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven." 2 Timothy 2:12 Not God but the sword
He counts on you that I came to bring happiness to the earth; I did not bring happiness, but I brought the sword.
I want to distinguish between the boy and his father, between the girl and her mother, and between the bride and her old woman.
And July will pass, and people will be tired of their homes.
The one he cares about more than me, his father or mother, doesn't deserve me. And the one he cares about more than me, his son or daughter, doesn't deserve me.
And whoever doesn't shake my cross and follow me, doesn't deserve me. When
For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for my sake will save it. Matthew 16:25; Mark 8:35; Luke 9:24; 17:33; John 12:25 The reward
Who welcomed you, I welcome him, and who welcomed me, I welcome him too. Luke
And the one who welcomes a Prophet, knowing he is a Prophet, will receive a reward similar to that of the Prophet. And the one who welcomes a God-fearing person, knowing he is God-fearing, will receive a reward similar to that of the God-fearing person.
Anyone who gives even a glass of cold water to one of these children, because he is my student, I tell you the truth, his reward will not be lost.
The chapter of John the Baptist sending his disciples to Jesus
And when Jesus finished the commandments he gave to his disciples, he went from there to teach and proclaim the gospel in the region of the Jews.
And when John heard in prison about the deeds of Christ, he sent his disciples to ask him.
He said to him: "Are you the one coming, or are we waiting for someone else?"
And Jesus answered them and said: "Go and tell John what you hear and see:
The blind can now see, the lame can walk, the lepers are made clean, the deaf can hear, the dead are raised, and the poor hear the good news.
And happiness to that one who doesn't bother you.
And when John's disciples went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John and said: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
And what did you go out to see? Is there a man wearing fine clothes? Because those who wear fine clothes, they live in the palaces of kings!
Tell me, what did you see? Is he a prophet? I'll tell you, yes, he's a prophet and more than a prophet.
And this is the one that God mentioned in His Book: I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare the way for you.
And I tell you the truth: none of the women born is greater than John the Baptist, but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than him.
And from John the Baptist until today, the kingdom of heaven is advancing forcefully, and the violent are trying to seize it. Luke
The prophets' events and Moses' law prophesied even for the time when John the Baptist would come.
If you believe, John the Baptist is Elijah who must come. Matthew
So, anyone with ears, listen!
But what do we compare this generation to? It's like some kids in the market calling each other and saying:
We inflated the lira for you and you didn't fly off the handle, and we mourned for you and you didn't cry!
John's way, and he neither eats nor drinks, and they say: He's possessed by a jinn.
And the son of man came to eat and drink, and they say: "This is a glutton and a drinker, and friends only with those who pay taxes and the sinners!" But God's wisdom appears to be good from its harvest. Woe to the sinner who does not repent.
At that time, Jesus began to speak about the scribes who performed more miracles among them than others, because their people did not repent.
Oh, Wailik, O Korzin! And Wailik, O Beit Saida! If the miracles that happened to you had happened in Safur and Saida, how long ago would they have been covered up? They would have worn burlap and sat on ashes # 11:21. Wearing burlap and sitting on ashes: to show their repentance.
But I tell you: the consequence of posting pictures and insults on the Day of Judgment will be lighter than your consequence.
Oh, Kafr Nahaoum! And are you going to shake even the sky? You're going to fall into the abyss. If only the miracles performed in Sodom had been done to you, none would have believed and they would still be present today.
And on this, I tell you: the punishment of Sodom on the Day of Judgment will be lighter than yours." Matthew 10:15; Luke 10:12 Come to me and rest.
At that moment, Jesus spoke and said: "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have revealed to little children what you have hidden from the wise and understanding."
Oh, Father, so it was Your will.
The Father has given me everything, and no one knows who the Father's son is except the Father, nor who the Father is except the Son, and the Son whom the Father has chosen to reveal to him. John 3:35; John 1:18; 10:15
Come to me, all of you who are tired and burdened, and I will give you rest.
My light is upon you and learn from me, because I am kind and humble, and you will find peace for your souls.
Because my burden is easy and my load is light.
The chapter is about Jesus teaching on the Sabbath
And on that day, on a Saturday, Jesus passed between the wheat fields, and His disciples were hungry, and they began to cut the stalks and eat.
And when the Pharisees saw them, they said to him: "Look, your disciples are doing things they shouldn't do on the Sabbath!"
He replied to them: "Didn't you read what David did when hunger came upon him and those with him?"
And how he entered the House of God, and ate the bread that was offered to God, which neither he nor those with him were supposed to eat except the clergy alone.
Don't you read in the Torah that religious men, when they serve in the house of God on the Sabbath, violate the Sabbath, and yet there's no blame on them?
But I tell you: there is here what is greater than the House of God.
And if you understood the meaning of the verse that says: I want mercy, not sacrifice, then you would not judge those who are not to blame.
Because the son of man is the Lord of the Sabbath. Jesus heals on the Sabbath.
And he went out and came to their prayer house,
And one man met him with a paralyzed hand. They asked him and said: "Is healing allowed on Saturday?" They questioned him to find a charge against him.
And he answered them: "Is there anyone among you who has one sheep and it falls into a pit on Saturday? Wouldn't he grasp it, lift it out, and rescue it?" Luke
Yeah, a person is worth much more than a sheep! And that's why doing good is permissible on Saturday.
And Jesus said to the man with the paralyzed hand: "Stretch out your hand!" and he stretched it out, and it became healthy like the other hand.
And the Pharisees went out to conspire how to kill him. Jesus is the chosen one of God.
And when Jesus finished the news, he went from there and followed him, many crowds of people, and he healed them all.
And he advised them not to tell anyone about him.
So that the words the Prophet Isaiah said come true:
Here is my servant whom I have chosen, my dear one in whom I take great pleasure. I will put my spirit on him, and he will proclaim the truth to the nations.
I won't argue and I won't shout, no one will hear his voice in the alleys.
A split fortress that does not collapse, a wick that releases smoke that does not extinguish, until truth prevails, it is the one that is victorious.
And in his name, the peoples will put their hope." Jesus and Beelzebul
And some people brought to Jesus a man who was blind, deaf, and possessed by a demon, and when he healed him, he was able to speak and see.
And the crowds were amazed and said: "Is this really the son of David?"
And when they heard the Pharisees say this, they said: "This man casts out demons only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons." Matthew 9:34; 10:25
And Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them: "Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
Well, if Satan casts out Satan, then his kingdom will be divided and fall apart. But if he divides and falls apart against himself, how can his kingdom remain stable?
Otherwise, I would be with Beelzebub casting out demons. So who is this with whom your children are casting them out? Regarding this, it is your children who will judge you.
But unless I am the Spirit of God, I cast out demons; the kingdom of God has come among you.
And how can someone enter someone's house legitimately and steal their belongings without being caught at first, and then steal their house?
He who is not against me is for me, and he who does not gather with me scatters. Mark 9:40
That is why I tell you: every sin and blasphemy that is spoken will be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
Whoever says a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven him, but whoever says a word against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven him, neither in this world nor in the age to come." Luke 12:10 The tree and its fruit
Plant a good tree, and its fruit will be good; or plant a bad tree, and its fruit will be bad. From the fruit, you recognize the tree. When?
Ati Rika Al-Lafa'i! How can you say something nice when you're not feeling well? What comes out of the heart is spoken by the mouth. Matā
A good person brings out good things from the good treasure in their heart, and a bad person brings out bad things from the bad treasure in their heart.
And I tell you: all this empty talk that people say will be accounted for on the Day of Judgment.
Never again, with your words, will they judge you as either innocent or guilty. The scholars of Sharia and the Pharisees wanted to see a sign.
At that time, some of the scholars of law and the Pharisees responded to him and said: "Sir, we want to see a sign from you."
And he says to them: "A wicked and corrupt generation asks for a sign! And you will not give it to them except the sign of the prophet Jonah." Matthew
Moreover, just as Jonah remained inside the whale's belly for three days and three nights, so too will the child of man stay in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
The people of Nineveh will be sent on the Day of Judgment with this generation and will testify against it, because they are taboo since Jonah warned them, and now here is someone better than Jonah.
And the Queen of the South is going to testify on the Day of Judgment with this generation and bear witness against it, because she came from a distant land to hear Solomon's wisdom, and now here is someone greater than Solomon.
The national way that drives out the jinn from a person is to walk around places where there is no water, searching for comfort but not finding it.
And he says: I will return to my house from which I left, and the agent returns to it and finds it empty, cleaned, and tidy.
And he walks and carries with him seven other crazy ones worse than him. And when they enter, they settle down, and that other person’s condition becomes worse than his original state. This is what will happen to this generation that also does evil. Brothers Jesus and Mah.
And whenever he was talking with the groups of people, his mother and his brothers came and stood outside wanting to speak with him.
And one of the attendees says to him: "Here are Mak and your brothers standing outside, wanting to talk to you." # 12.47 This verse is not found in many old manuscripts.
And Jesus answers him and says: "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
He pointed with his hand towards Tlamdh and said: «Here they are, my brothers,
Because those who do good are like those in heaven, they are my brother, my sister, and me.
Chapter Tlatash, the example of the farmer
For your sake, the day itself, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.
Many groups of people gathered around him, and with the crowd pressing hard, he got into the boat and sat down in it, while all the people stood on the shore. Luke 5:1-3
And he told them many things with patience and said: "This man went out to plant,"
And whenever he was planting, some seeds fell on the road and the birds came and ate them.
They threw some other seeds on a rocky ground with not much soil, and quickly they sprouted because the soil wasn't too deep.
And when the sun rises, they burn, and since they have no courage, they dry out.
They fell grains of dirt among the thorns, and when the thorns grew, they choked them.
They threw grains of wheat on a good land and harvested a crop, some of them gave a hundred, some sixty, and some thirty.
So, anyone with ears, listen!». The purpose of the molar
And they brought students closer to him and said: «Why do you speak to people in a rude manner?»
And he answers them and says: "Because to you it is given to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given."
For those who have, it will be given to them and they will have more than the measure. And for those who do not have, even what they have will be taken from them. When
And I was talking to them in the middle because when they see, they don't see, and when they hear, they don't hear, and they don't understand.
Thus, the prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled in them: even though you hear what you hear, you do not understand at all, and even though you see what you see, it does not appear to you at all.
Because the heart of this people is hard, their hearing is limited, and their eyes are closed, so they don't see with their eyes, and don't hear with their ears, and with their hearts they don't understand, and they come back to me so I can heal them.
But we are fortunate because your eyes see, and your ears hear. Luke
And I tell you the truth: many prophets and righteous people wished to see what you see and did not see it, and to hear what you hear and did not hear it. The meaning of the parable of the sower.
So listen, the meaning of the example of the man who plants:
Those who listen to the words of the Kingdom of God but do not understand them, Satan comes and snatches away what was sown in their hearts, and this is what I compare to the seed that falls on the path.
And whoever plants in the rocky land, that is the one who listens to the words of God and accepts them quickly with joy.
But the word of God is not firmly rooted in his heart, and his faith lasts only for a short time. When problems and temptations occur, he quickly distances himself from faith.
And the one planted among thorns is the one who listens to the word of God, but the worries of the world and the love of money choke the word of God in him and prevent it from bearing fruit.
That one planted in good land is the one who listens to God's word, understands it, and is the one who yields fruit—some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. The example of the wheat among the weeds.
And Jesus gave them another example and said: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field."
And when the people were asleep, his enemy came and sowed wild oats among the wheat and went his way.
And when the crop grew and the stalks appeared, the chaff also became evident with it.
And the servants of the master of the house come to him and say: Sir, isn't the good seed that you planted in your field? So where did this weed come from?
And he answers them: "Is this the enemy who did this?" And his servants tell him: "Do you want us to go and remove him?"
And he answered them and said: No! So that the wheat doesn't get mixed with the chaff.
Let the wheat grow with the weeds until harvest time, and at that moment I tell the harvesters to gather the weeds first and make bundles so they can be burned, while the wheat is gathered and taken to my storage house. The example of the mustard seed and the example of the yeast.
And he repeated to them another example: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field."
And even though she is the youngest in love, when she grows up, she becomes a tree taller than all the plants, so much so that the birds of the sky come to nest in its branches.
And he added another example and said: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three kilos of flour until the whole dough was leavened." Jesus speaks in parables.
And all of this, Jesus told the crowds of people with the mother, and without example, he didn't tell them anything.
In order for the words the Prophet said to be fulfilled: «With the birth, we speak and reveal everything that was hidden since the day the world was created». The meaning of this example is about the dawn.
At that time, Jesus left the crowds and went back home, and his disciples came to him and said: "Explain to us the parable of the wheat in the field!"
And he replied to them and said: «The one who sows good seeds is the son of man,
The feddan is the world, and good wheat is the children of the kingdom of God, and the weeds are the children of Satan.
And the enemy who sowed the thorns is Iblis, and the harvest is the end of times, and the harvesters are the angels.
Just as wheat is gathered and burned forcibly, so will happen at the end of times:
He will send his son, the angels, and they will gather from his kingdom all the things that cause sins and all those who commit them.
They throw them into the hospital of health, because there will be crying and grinding of teeth.
But those who obey God, I will illuminate them like the sun in the kingdom of Bahem. So, whoever has two ears, listen! » The example of the treasure, the jewel, and the net.
And the Kingdom of Heaven is like a buried treasure in a field; a man found it, and then reburied it. Out of his joy, he went and sold everything he had and bought that field.
And the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls.
And when he found a very precious jewel, he sold everything he owned and bought it.
And the kingdom of the heavens is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered fish of every kind.
And when they finished, the fishermen took it to the seaside, sat down, and started to cut it up. Those who did it well put it in the basket, and those who were not skilled at all threw it away.
And so it will be at the end of time: the angels will come and separate the sinners from among those who fear God.
They throw the sinners into the pit of health, then where will the crying and the grinding of teeth be? The new and old treasure
And Jesus asked his disciples, "Did you understand all this?" and they answered, "Yes!"
And he tells them: "Well, regarding this, each of the scholars of the Shariah knows the kingdom of the heavens, like a house owner who, from his treasure, brings out everything new and old." Nazareth did not accept Jesus
And when Jesus finished this speech, he left from there.
And he returned to his city, Nazareth, teaching people in the prayer houses until they were amazed, and they began to ask: "Where did he get this wisdom and these miracles?"
Isn't this the son of the carpenter? Isn't this the one whose name is Mary, and her brothers are Jacob, Joseph, Simon, and Judah?
And isn't it true that all his brothers live in our city? So where did all this come from?
And they did not find it strange, but Jesus told them: "A prophet is honored everywhere except in his own country, and among his own family." John 4:44
There weren't many miracles in that place because they lacked faith.
The chapter of John the Baptist's death
For your sake, Herod the ruler heard the news of Jesus.
And he says to his servants: "This is John the Baptist who was raised from the dead, that's why miraculous signs are performed through him."
Herod had John arrested, cut off his head, and imprisoned him because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. Luke
Actually, Yohanna was telling him: "It's not permissible for you to marry her."
He wanted to kill him, but he was afraid of the people because they believed he was a prophet.
And at Herod's birthday party, Herodias's daughter danced at the party, and Herod was pleased.
And that's why he swore until he gave her what she asked for.
And her daughter greeted her, asking what to do. Herod said to her: "Bring me the head of John the Baptist on a platter!"
And the king was sad, but for the oath he swore and the people present, he ordered that she be given whatever she wanted.
He sent someone to behead John in prison.
They took him to a small room and gave him to the girl, and she took him to her.
And the students of John came, took his body, and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed five thousand people.
And when Jesus heard these things, he went from there by boat to a deserted place alone. And when the crowds learned that he was going there, they followed him on foot from the towns.
And when he got off the boat, he saw a large group of people, and he felt sorry for them and healed their patients.
And when evening came, his students approached him and said: "Things have gone well here in this wilderness, so tell the people to go to the markets to buy food for themselves."
But Jesus told them: "There is no need for them to go; give them something to eat."
They told him: "We only have five loaves of bread and two fish here."
He told them: «Show them here!»
And he commands the people's groups to sit on the spring. He took those five loaves and the two fish, looked up to the sky, and thanked God. When he broke the loaves, he gave them to his disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people's groups.
And all of them, until they were full, and then they gathered twelve baskets full of bread crumbs they had eaten.
And those who ate about five thousand one, excluding women and children. Jesus walks on the water.
And Jesus ordered his disciples to get into the boat at that hour and to go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the crowds away.
And when he sent them, he went up to the mountain alone to pray. He stayed alone until evening.
And many of the small boats of the Tlamd were in the middle of the sea, and they were overwhelmed by the waves because the wind was against them.
And at dawn, Jesus came to his disciples while he was walking on the water.
When the students saw him walking on the water, they were terrified and said: "This is a ghost or a jinn," and they screamed out of fear.
At that moment, Jesus spoke to them and said: "Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid!"
And Peter says to him: "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you walking on the water."
And Jesus said to him: "Come!" and Peter stepped down from the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when he saw the wind was strong and frightening, he started to drown, and he shouted: «Save me, sir!»
And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him: "O little faith, why did you doubt?"
And when they went out to the boat, the wind calmed down.
And those in the boat bowed down to him and said: "In truth, you are the son of God." Jesus heals many sick people in Capernaum.
And when Jesus and his disciples crossed to the other side of the sea, they arrived at the country of Gerasenes.
And they knew the people of that country, and they informed him of all their news, and brought him all their patients.
And they asked him to touch it, even just lightly. And everyone who touched it was healed.
Chapter fifteen: Discussions on the customs of the elders
Then, some Pharisees and teachers of the law from Jerusalem came to Jesus, and they asked him:
Why don't your students follow the elders' tradition? Because they don't wash their hands before eating.
But he answered them and said: «Why do you even disobey God's commandment to follow your customs?»
Because God says: Take care of your family and your wife, and whoever insults his wife or her, he must be killed.
But we say: whoever said "Leba" or "Meh": that's what I need to help you with, I have given it as a gift to God.
He no longer has to take care of him. And thus, he canceled God's word to follow your custom.
O hypocrites! Truly, Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you and said:
People, this nation only praises me with their mouths, but their hearts are far from it.
And uselessly, they worship me, because they teach teachings that are just people's recommendations. The things that bother a person
He called the group of people and told them: "Listen and understand:"
It's not what enters the mouth that harms a person, but what comes out of the mouth that harms him.
Then the students came to him and said: "Did you know that the Pharisees were upset when they heard your words?"
And he answered them and said: "All the planting that they didn't plant, what is in the sky will grow."
Leave them! Those are blind, they are blind leading the blind, or if blindness leads to blindness, they will both fall into a pit. Luke
Peter said to him: "Explain to us the meaning of this parable!"
And he responds: "Are you still not understanding anything yet?"
Don't you know that everything that enters a person's mouth goes to their stomach, and then comes out?
What comes out of the mouth, you see, comes from the heart, and it is what makes a person. When
Never from the heart do bad ideas come out: like murder, corruption among the married and the unmarried, theft, perjury, and insults.
And this is what corrupts a person, but food with unwashed hands does not defile a person." The faith of the Canaanite woman
And Jesus went out from Tyre and Sidon and went through the midst of the region of Decapolis.
And a Canaanite woman came to him from those regions, and she cried out and said: "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is possessed by a demon and suffers greatly."
But he didn't answer her even with a word. They brought his students closer to him and asked him, and he told them: "Send it as it is, because she's following us and shouting!"
And Jesus answered them and said: "God did not send me except for the lost sheep of the people of Israel."
But that woman came and prostrated to him and said: "Help me, sir!"
And he replied: "It's not reasonable to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
The woman told him: "Yes, sir! But even dogs eat from the leftovers that fall from the plates of those who fill them."
And Jesus answered and said to her: "Your faith is great, woman! You will have what you desire." And at that moment, her daughter was healed. Many people are being healed.
And afterward, Jesus went from there to the side of the Sea of Galilee, and he went up the mountain and sat down there.
And many groups of people came to him, including lame, blind, crippled, and other people, and they placed them at his feet and he healed them.
And the crowds were amazed at the people because they saw the lame walking, the blind seeing, the deaf hearing, and the mute speaking, and they glorified the God of Israel. Jesus fed four thousand one.
Jesus called his disciples and said to them: "Stay with these people, because for three days now they have been with me, and they have nothing to eat. I don't want to send them away hungry, or they might faint on the way."
And his students say to him: "Where are we going to get bread in this wilderness that will feed a large group like this?"
And Jesus said to them: "How many loaves do you have?" and they answered: "Seven, and a few small fish."
And Jesus commanded the group of people to sit on the ground.
And God took the seven loaves and the fish, blessed them, broke them, and gave to His disciples, and His disciples gave to the crowds of people.
And they all ate until they were full, and they carried away seven baskets full of bread crumbs they had gathered.
And the people who ate four thousand, one of them without women and children.
And when Jesus sent out the crowds of people, he boarded the boat and came to the land of Magdan.
Chapter Sattash: Signs of the Times
And some of the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus to test Him, and they asked Him to show them a sign from heaven. Matthew
But he answered them and said: "When the sun sets, you tell him: the weather will be clear, because the sky is red."
And early in the morning, he tells you: Today it will rain, because the sky is red and cloudy. You can interpret the weather, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times!
A wicked and corrupt generation asks for a sign, and you will not give it to them except the sign of Jonah." Then Jesus left them and went away. Matthew 12:39; Luke 11:29 The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees
And when the students reached the other side of the sea, they forgot to take bread with them.
And Jesus said to them: "Watch out, beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees!" Luke
And they say to themselves: "He tells us this because he didn't bring the bread with us."
And Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them: "Why are you questioning among yourselves, O little faith, because you have no bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Haven't you realized that five loaves of bread are divided among five thousand people, and how many pieces of bread did you gather from the crumbs? When
And you didn't understand about the seven loaves that were distributed to four thousand and how many baskets you collected? When
How come you couldn't understand that I wasn't talking about bread in my words to you? Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees!
At that time, his disciples understood that he was telling them to beware of the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees, not of the yeast of bread. Peter testified that Jesus is the Messiah.
And when Jesus arrived in the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples: "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
And they answered him: "Some say John the Baptist, and some say Elijah, and others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets." Matthew
And he asked them: «And who am I in your eyes?»
And Simon Peter answered and said: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!" John
And Jesus said to him: "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! Not because of any human being who is behind this truth, but because what is in heaven is behind it for you."
And I tell you: you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the power of death will not overcome it.
And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. Matthew
And afterwards, Jesus advised his disciples not to tell anyone that he is the Messiah. Jesus prophesies his death and resurrection.
From that hour, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer greatly at the hands of the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed, and on the third day be raised from the dead.
Peter turned to the side and started arguing about it, saying: "God forbid, sir, for this to happen to you!"
He looks around and says to Peter: "Get away from me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you are thinking about human things, not God's things."
And Jesus said to his disciples: "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me, whenever."
No one who wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for my sake will find it. When
What benefit does my soul have with a person if they only gain the whole world and waste their life? Or what will they give a person in exchange for their life?
The way of the son of man is to come with his angels in the glory of the Father, and He will reward each one according to their deeds. When?
And I tell you the truth: there are those present here who will not die until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.
Chapter seventy-eight: Jesus appears in His glory
And after six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and his brother John, and led them up a high mountain alone.
And his appearance changed before them, his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as bright as glowing light.
And it appears to them that Moses and Elijah are talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus: "How good it is for us to stay here, Lord. If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And at the time when he was speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; listen to him!" 2 Peter 1:17,18
When the students heard this, they fell on their faces and were very afraid.
And Jesus came near to them, touched them, and said to them: "Get up, do not be afraid!".
And they looked into their eyes and saw only Jesus alone.
And at the time when they were descending from the mountain, Jesus advised them and said: "Do not tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
And his students asked him: "So why do the scholars of Sharia say that initially Prophet Elijah should come?"
And he answered them and said: «In truth, Elias will come first and will fix everything,
But I tell you: Elias has come, and they did not recognize him, and they did with him whatever they wanted, and thus a son of man will also suffer at their hands.
At that time, the children understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a possessed boy.
And when Jesus and his disciples arrived among the people, a man came up to him and knelt before him.
He said: "May my son have mercy, sir, because he is in pain and suffers a lot, and many times he falls into illness and fever."
His meal for your students and they couldn't heal it.
And Jesus answered and said: "Oh, this generation that has no faith! How long shall I stay with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring me the boy here!"
And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and it came out of him; and the boy was healed at that very moment.
And they brought the children close to Jesus and asked him among themselves, saying: "Why couldn't we cast out the demons?"
He said to them: "Because of your lack of faith!" And I tell you the truth: if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain: 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. And nothing will be impossible for you. [
And this type of madness can only be cured through prayer and fasting. # 17.21 This verse is not found in many old manuscripts: Matthew 21:21; Mark 11:23; 1 Corinthians 13:2. Jesus once again predicts his death and the sending of his messenger.
And the students were gathered in the land of Galilee, and Jesus was saying to them: "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of people."
And they killed him, and on the third day he will be sent." And the students were very sad. Jesus pays the temple tax.
And when Jesus and his disciples returned to Capernaum, they found the tax collectors at the house of God with Peter and asked him: "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
And he answered them: "Yes, he pays it." And when he entered the house, Jesus preceded him and said to him: "What do you think, Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tax? From their children or from others?"
And Peter answered him, "From foreigners." And Jesus said: "Because of this, their children are exempt from tax."
But just so we don't cause them any trouble, go to the sea and cast your fishing line. The first fish you catch, open its mouth, and you'll find four dirhams inside. Take it and go pay for yourself and me.
