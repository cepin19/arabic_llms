There are fourteen generations from Abraham to David. Fourteen generations from David to the time of the exile, and fourteen generations from the time of the exile to Christ. The birth of Jesus Christ
The birth of Jesus Christ took place as follows: His mother Mary was engaged to a man named Joseph. But before they married, she learned that she was pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit.
But Joseph, her husband, was a righteous man and did not want to expose her, so he decided to leave her quietly.
And while Joseph was thinking about this, an angel appeared to him in a dream and said: "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
And she will give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.
This happened so that what the Lord said through the prophet would be fulfilled:
Behold, the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and his name will be called Immanuel, which means: God with us.
And when Joseph woke up from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to his house.
But he did not know her until she gave birth to the child whom he named "Jesus."
Wise Men of the East
And when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod, some wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
And they asked: "Where is the newborn child, who will be king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and we have come to worship him."
King Herod was disturbed when he heard this, as were all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Herod gathered all the chief priests and teachers of the law, and asked them where the Messiah was to be born.
They said to him: "In the city of Bethlehem in the territory of Judea, for this is what is written by the prophet:"
You, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times.
Then Herod summoned the wise men and met with them secretly, learning from them the exact time the star appeared.
Then he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search for the child. When you find him, tell me, so that I too may go and worship him."
Then the wise men listened to the king and then went away. And behold, the star they saw in the east was moving ahead of them until it came and stopped above the place where the child was.
So they rejoiced greatly when they saw the star.
They entered the house and saw the child with his mother Mary, so they knelt on the ground, prostrating to him. Then they opened their treasure chests and presented him with gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Then God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod, so they traveled back to their country by another route. The flight to Egypt
After the wise men traveled, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said to him: "Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the child to kill him."
Joseph got up, took the child and his mother at night, and went to Egypt.
And he remained there until Herod's death. This happened to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son." #Out of ... my son. 15:2 From the book of Hosea 11:1. Herod kills the children of Bethlehem
And when Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him, he was very angry, and he ordered the killing of all the male children in Bethlehem and the surrounding region, from two years old and under, according to the time he had been told by the wise men.
Then what was said on the tongue of the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:
A voice heard in Ramah, a voice of crying and great mourning. It is the voice of Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted because they are dead. Return from Egypt
After Herod's death, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream in Egypt.
He said to him: "Get up, take the child and his mother, and go back to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to kill the child have died."
Then Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus had become king in the region of Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. After God warned him in a dream, he went to the region of Galilee.
And he lived in a town called Nazareth. This happened to fulfill what the prophets said that the Messiah would be called a Nazarene. #Nazareth. 23:2, named after the city of Nazareth. It is also a word similar to the Hebrew word meaning "branch," mentioned in Isaiah 11:1, referring to the promise of the coming of the Messiah from the lineage of David.
John the Baptist
In those days, John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
And he was saying: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near."
And this is the one John spoke of when the prophet Isaiah said: "A voice of one calling in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"
John was wearing camel hair garments, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
At that time, everyone began to come from the city of Jerusalem and from all the region of Judea, and from the surrounding area of the Jordan River to hear him.
And he would baptize them in the Jordan River after they confessed their sins.
And when John saw that many of the Pharisees and Sadducees were coming to him for baptism, he said to them: "You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?"
Create a fruit that proves your repentance.
And do not boast by saying: ‹Abraham is our father.› For I tell you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
Here is the axe placed on the roots of the tree trunks. Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water for repentance, but the one who comes after me is greater than me, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He will carry his weapons in his hand and clean his sword; he will gather his grains into the storehouse, and burn the hay with an unquenchable fire.» Baptism of Jesus
Then Jesus came from the region of Galilee to the Jordan River, because he wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him and said, "I need to be baptized by you, so why are you coming to me?"
Jesus answered him, "Allow it now, for it is proper to fulfill all righteousness." Then John permitted him to be baptized.
Jesus deliberately immersed himself in the water. As he ascended from the water, the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and resting upon him.
And a voice came from heaven saying: "You are my beloved Son. I am well pleased with you."
The experience of Jesus
And the Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, to be tempted by Satan.
And after Jesus abstained from eating for forty days and forty nights, he became hungry.
Then the tested one came to him #the tested one. 3:4 That is, Satan. And he said to him: "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."
But Jesus answered: "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'"
Then Iblis took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
He said to him: "If you are truly the Son of God, throw yourself down from here. For it is written: 'God commands his angels concerning you.' 'And they will lift you up with their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'"
Jesus answered him: "It is also written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
Then Iblis took him to a high mountain, and displayed before his eyes all the kingdoms of the world and their grandeur.
Then he said to him: "I will give you all of this if you bow down to me."
Jesus said to him: "Away with you, Satan! For it is written: 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.'"
Then Satan left him, and the angels came to serve him. Jesus begins his ministry in Galilee.
And when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he returned to Galilee.
But he did not stay in Nazareth, but went and dwelled in the city of Capernaum near the Sea of Galilee in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali.
This happened to fulfill what God said through the prophet Isaiah:
Land of Zebulun and Naphtali, the way of the Mediterranean Sea, across the river, land of Galilee, where the nations dwell.
The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them has the light shined.
From that time, Jesus began to preach and say: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near." Jesus chooses some of his disciples
And while Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the lake; they were fishermen.
He said to them: "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
So they immediately left their window and followed him.
Then Jesus moved on from there, and saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in the boat with their father Zebedee, repairing their nets, and he called them.
They immediately left the boat and their father and followed him. Jesus teaches and heals.
And Jesus traveled throughout all the region of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. And he healed all the diseases and ailments among the people.
News about him spread throughout all of Syria, so they brought to him all the sick with various diseases and pains, those possessed by evil spirits, and those with epilepsy and paralysis; and he healed them.
A large crowd of people followed him, coming from the Galilee region, from the ten cities, and from Jerusalem, as well as from the Judea region, and from the eastern side of the Jordan River.
Teaching of Jesus
And when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him,
And he began to speak and teach them, saying:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Congratulations to the crying, for Allah will comfort them.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. #They shall inherit the earth. 5:5 See Psalm 37:11. This may refer to a future spiritual inheritance.
Congratulations to the hungry and thirsty for doing the will of God, #for doing the will of God. 6:5 Literally: "to righteousness." Because God will satisfy them.
Blessed are the merciful, for Allah will have mercy on them.
Blessed are the pure-hearted, for they shall see God.
Blessed are those who work for peace, for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely accuse you of doing evil because of me.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven. For in this way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. Salt and light
You are the salt of all people. But if the salt loses its taste, what do we treat it with to make it good again? It is no longer useful for anything, except to be thrown outside the house to be trampled by feet.
You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.
People do not light a lamp and put it under a bowl! Instead, they place it on a high stand so it can illuminate everyone in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father who is in heaven." Jesus and the Law of Moses
Do not think that I have come to abolish the law of Moses or the teachings of the prophets. I have not come to abolish them but to give them their full meaning.
I tell you the truth, until the sky and the earth pass away, not the smallest letter or dot of the law will pass away until everything written in it is fulfilled.
Therefore, whoever breaks the smallest of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be considered the least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever obeys these commandments and teaches others to obey them will be considered the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
For I tell you, unless your obedience to God exceeds that of your teachers of the law and the Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Anger
You know that it was said to your fathers: ‹Do not kill. #Do not kill. 21:5 from the Book of Exodus 20:13, and the Book of Deuteronomy 5:17. And everyone who kills deserves to be tried.›
But I say to you, whoever is angry with another person deserves judgment; and whoever insults another person should stand before the court. And anyone who says to another: "You fool" deserves hell.
Therefore, if you are offering a gift on the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,
So leave your offering there in front of the altar, go and reconcile with that person first, then come back and present your offering.
Salem, your opponent, quickly, as you walk with him on the way to the court. Otherwise, he will hand you over to the judge, and the judge will hand you over to the jailer who will throw you into prison.
I tell you the truth, you will not leave there until you settle your last penny. Adultery
You have heard that it was said: "Do not commit adultery." #Do not commit adultery. 27:5 From the Book of Exodus 20:14, and the Book of Deuteronomy 5:18.
But I say to you: whoever looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
Therefore, if your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better to lose one part of your body than to have your whole body thrown into hell.
And if your right hand pushes you toward sin, cut it off and cast it away from you. It is better to lose one member of your body than to have your whole body thrown into hell. Divorce
It was also said: "If someone divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce." #If he divorces... that. 31:5 from the Book of Deuteronomy 24:1.
But I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. The oath
You have heard it said to your ancestors: "Do not swear falsely, but fulfill what you have sworn to the Lord." #Do not break your oath ... to the Lord. 33:5 See Leviticus 19:12, Numbers 30:2, and Deuteronomy 23:21.
But I say to you: do not swear at all.
Do not swear by the sky, for it is the throne of Allah, nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet, #footstool of His feet. 35:5 meaning it belongs to Him and is under His sovereignty. And do not swear by the Holy City, for it is the city of the Great King.
Do not swear by your head, for you cannot make a single hair of it black or white.
If you want to say "yes," then say "yes." And if you want to say "no," then say "no." Anything beyond that is from the evil one. #The Evil One. 37:5 Satan. Resisting Evil
You have heard that it was said: "Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth." #Eye ... for tooth. 38:5 from the Book of Exodus 21:24, and the Book of Leviticus 24:20.
But I say: Do not resist evil. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.
And if anyone wants to judge you to take your shirt, let him also take your coat.
If someone forces you to go with him a mile, go two miles with him.
And if someone asks you for something, give it to them. Do not refuse to lend to anyone who asks to borrow from you. Love for everyone
You have heard it said: "Love your friend, and hate your enemy." #Love ... your enemy. 43:5 from the Book of Leviticus 19:18.
But I say to you: Love your enemies, pray for those who persecute you,
Thus, you become children of your Father in heaven. For God makes the sun rise on the wicked and the good, and sends rain to the righteous and the unrighteous.
If you only love those who love you back, what reward do you deserve? Don't tax collectors do the same?
And if you only revive your brothers, what sets you apart from others? Won't even idol worshippers do that as well?
Therefore, be perfect, just as your Heavenly Father is perfect.
Generosity
Beware of giving your charity in front of people so that they see you; otherwise, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpeting as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be praised by people. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
So that your giving is in secret. And your father, who sees what happens in secret, will reward you. Prayer
And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
But when you pray, go into your room and close the door, and pray to your Father in secret. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
And when you arrive, do not speak words without understanding as idolaters do, for they think their prayers will be answered because of their many words.
Therefore, do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
Therefore, pray as follows: ‹Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name,
Let your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
And forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. #The Evil One. 13:6 Satan (Iblis). For yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.
For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Fasting
And when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites who show sorrow on their faces. For they alter their appearance so that people may see that they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
But when you fast, put oil on your head, and wash your face.
So that people do not notice that you are fasting. Your unseen father sees that. Then your father, who observes what happens in secret, will reward you. God or money
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
Because your heart will be where your treasure is.
The lamp of the body is the eye. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light within you is actually darkness, then how great is that darkness?
No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth. #wealth. 24:6 literally "mamona." It is an Aramaic word meaning "wealth," in a negative sense, as it represents here a god that people serve apart from God. The kingdom of God first
Therefore, I tell you, do not worry about your livelihood, that is, about what you will eat and drink. And do not worry about your body, that is, about what you will wear. For life is more important than food, and the body more important than clothing.
Look at the birds of the sky, they neither sow nor reap, nor gather wheat into barns, and your Heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not more valuable to God than the birds?
Who among you can add an hour to his life when he worries?
And why are you worried about what you will wear? Look at how wildflowers grow. They do not tire or spin.
But I tell you, not even one of them has been clothed like one of these, nor even Solomon in all his glory.
If Allah dresses the grass of the fields that you see here today and tomorrow throws it into the oven, will He not care for you more, O you of little faith?
Therefore, do not worry and do not ask yourselves: "What will we eat?" or "What will we drink?" or "What will we wear?"
These are matters that other people in the afterlife seek, and your heavenly father knows that you need all of them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
Don't worry about tomorrow; each day has enough trouble of its own, and tomorrow will have its own worries.
Judging others
Do not judge others, so that God does not judge you.
For he will judge the way you judge others. And with the measure you use for others, it will be measured to you.
Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye but do not notice the plank in your own eye?
And how can you tell your brother: "Let me remove the speck from your eye," when there is a large plank in your own eye?
O hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
Do not give what is sacred to dogs, and do not cast your pearls before swine! For swine trample them with their feet, and dogs turn to you and tear you apart. Perseverance in seeking
Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, it will be opened.
Which of you, if his son asks for a loaf of bread, would give him a stone?
Or if he asks for a fish, does he give him a live one?
You, despite your wrongdoing, know how to give good gifts to your children. Surely, the Father in heaven is much more worthy of giving good gifts to those who ask Him? The Golden Rule
Treat others the way you want to be treated. This is the essence of Moses' law and the teachings of the prophets. The path to heaven and the path to hell
Enter through the narrow door, which leads to heaven. For the door that leads to destruction is wide, and the way to it is easy, and many enter through it.
The door leading to life is very narrow, and the way to it is full of difficulties; only a few find this path. Warning against false teachings.
Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
You will recognize them by their deeds. People do not harvest grapes from thornbushes, nor figs from brambles!
Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, and every bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.
And every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Therefore, you will recognize false prophets by their fruits.
Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.
Many will say to me on that last day: "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name? Did we not cast out demons in your name? Did we not perform many miracles in your name?"
Then I will tell them clearly: I have never known you. Stay away from me, you evil-doers. The smart man and the foolish man
Whoever listens to my teachings and practices them is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
Then the rain fell, the floodwaters rose, the wind blew and struck that house, but it did not fall because its foundation was on the rock.
And whoever listens to my words and does not act on them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
Then the rain fell, the floodwaters rose, the wind blew and struck that house, causing it to collapse with a tremendous fall!
And when Jesus finished this teaching, the people were amazed at his teaching.
Because he taught them with authority and not like my teachers of the law.
Jesus heals the leper
Then Jesus descended from the mountain area, and many followed him.
A leper man came to him, bowed before him, and said: "Lord, you are able to make me clean if you wish."
Then Jesus reached out his hand, touched him, and said, "Yes, I want to; be clean." Immediately, his leprosy was cleansed.
Then Jesus said to him: "See that you tell no one anything, but go your way, show yourself to the priest, #go ... to the priest. 4:8 The priest was the one who, according to the law, determined when the leper was considered clean. And offer the gift that Moses commanded, so that you may be a testimony to them." Faith of a Roman officer
And Jesus entered the city of Capernaum, and a Roman officer came to Him. #Roman officer. 5:8 literally "a centurion." Repeated in verses 8, 13.
He said: "Sir, my servant is very ill, bedridden at home. He is immobile and suffering from severe pain."
Jesus said to him: "I will go and heal him."
The officer replied: "Sir, I do not deserve for you to enter my house; all you have to do is say a word, and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man under authority, and I have soldiers who obey my command. I say to this soldier: "Go!" and he goes. I say to another: "Come!" and he comes. I say to my servant: "Do this!" and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him: "Truly I tell you, I have not found such faith even among the people of Israel."
I tell you, many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
But those who were meant to inherit the kingdom will be cast into outer darkness. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth!
Then Jesus said to the officer: "Go, let it be done according to your faith." And the servant of that officer was healed at that very moment. "He bore our diseases"
And when Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed, and her fever was very high.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her; she got up and began to serve him.
That evening, many people possessed by evil spirits came to him; he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all the patients.
This happened to fulfill what God said through the prophet Isaiah: "He took our infirmities and carried our diseases." Followers of Jesus
And when Jesus saw that a large crowd was around him, he instructed his disciples to go to the other side of the lake.
Then one of his Sharia teachers came to him and said: "O teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus said to him: "Foxes have dens, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."
And another of his disciples said to him: "Lord, allow me to wait until I bury my father."
But Jesus said to him: "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm
And Jesus got into the boat, and his disciples followed him.
Then a fierce storm arose on the lake, so much so that the boat was covered with waves. But Jesus was sleeping.
They approached him and woke him up, saying: "Sir, save us, we are drowning."
Jesus said to them, "Why are you afraid, you of little faith?" Then he got up, rebuked the winds and the lake, and there was a great calm.
But they were amazed and asked, "What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?" Jesus casts out evil spirits from two men.
Then Jesus arrived at the region of the Gerasenes on the other side of the lake, and two men who were possessed by evil spirits came to Him from among the tombs. The men were dangerous, so no one dared to travel on that road.
The evil spirits shouted: "What do you want from us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the appointed time?"
And there was a large herd of pigs grazing at a distance from them.
The evil spirits begged him and said: "If you cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Then Jesus said, "Go." The evil spirits came out of the two men and entered the pigs. At once, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and the pigs drowned in the water.
The shepherds fled to the town and told the people what had happened to the possessed with evil spirits.
Then all the people of the town went out to see Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a crippled person
Jesus got into a boat to cross to the other side of the lake, and he arrived at his hometown.
Then some people brought to him a paralyzed man lying on his bed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, "Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven."
Some of my Islamic law teachers used to say: "This man insults Allah with his words."
Then Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said to them: "Why are you thinking evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Which is easier: to say, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Rise and walk"?
But I will show you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." And he said to the paralytic, "Rise, take up your bed, and go to your house!"
He got up and went to his house.
And when the people saw this, they were filled with awe and glorified God because He had given such authority to men. When does Jesus follow?
And as Jesus was passing by, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. He said to him, "Follow me!" And he got up and followed him.
While he was eating at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said: "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
Go and understand what the scripture means when it says: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." #I desire ... sacrifice. 13:9 from the book of Hosea 6:6. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners." A question about fasting
Then John's disciples came to him and asked, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them: "Where is the bridegroom's guest, and the bridegroom among them? But the day will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
No one mends an old garment with a new piece of cloth, because the new cloth will shrink and tear the old garment, making the hole worse.
And people do not put new wine into old leather bottles. If they do, the bottles tear, the wine leaks, and the leather is ruined. Therefore, new wine is put into new leather bottles, so that both the wine and the bottles are preserved. » Jesus raises a dead girl // and heals a bleeding woman
While Jesus was speaking, a synagogue leader came up to him and bowed before him and said, "My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Then Jesus got up and went with the synagogue leader, and his disciples followed him.
There was a woman who had been suffering from severe bleeding for twelve years. She came from behind Jesus and touched the edge of His cloak.
She said to herself: "If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed."
Then Jesus turned around and saw her. He said to her, "Take courage, daughter; your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that moment.
And when Jesus arrived at the synagogue leader's house, he saw those playing funeral tunes, and the people were in chaos.
He said: "Go outside. The girl did not die, she is asleep." And they laughed at him.
And when the people left the house, Jesus entered the girl's room, took her hand, and she got up.
News spread throughout the entire region about Jesus. Jesus heals the blind // and casts out evil spirits
And after Jesus left that place, two blind men followed him, crying out: "Son of David, have mercy on us."
And when Jesus entered the house, the two blind men came to Him. Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to heal you?" They answered Him, "Yes, Lord."
Then their eyes were opened, and He said: "According to your faith, let it be done for you."
The two blind men regained their sight. Then Jesus warned them sternly and said: "Do not let anyone know about what happened to you."
But they went and spread the news throughout that entire area.
And while they were going, some people brought to Jesus a man who was mute, because he was possessed by evil spirits.
Jesus cast out the evil spirit, and the mute began to speak. The people were amazed and said, "Nothing like this has been seen in Israel before."
But the Pharisees began to say, "It is by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that he drives out demons." #Beelzebul. 34:9. One of the names of Satan. The harvest is plentiful.
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom. He healed every disease and every sickness among the people.
And when Jesus saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Jesus said to his disciples: "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few."
Pray to the Lord of the harvest to send two harvests to the harvest.
Jesus sends his disciples
And Jesus called his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out and to heal all diseases and ailments.
And these are the names of the twelve apostles: First Simon, who is also called Peter, and his brother Andrew, James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John,
Phelps and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, James son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus.
Simon, also called "the Zealot," #the Zealot. 4:10 A Jewish political party resisting Roman rule, called the "Zealots." And Judas Iscariot who betrayed Jesus.
And Jesus sent these twelve out and gave them the following instructions: "Do not go to the non-Jewish region, nor enter a Samaritan city,"
But go to the lost sheep of the children of Israel,
And they proclaimed that the kingdom of heaven is near.
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those with leprosy, cast out demons. You have received authority to do these things freely; give to others freely as well.
Do not carry money made of gold, silver, or copper in your belts.
Do not carry an extra bag, an extra shirt, an extra shoe, or a cane. The worker deserves his food.
And when you enter any city or village, look for someone worthy to host you, and stay with them until you leave the city.
And when you enter a house, greet its inhabitants.
If the people of the house are deserving, then your peace will come upon them. And if they are not deserving, then your peace will return to you.
If anyone does not welcome you in your house or in your city, and does not listen to your message, leave that house or city, and shake off the dust that is on your feet.
I tell you the truth, on the Day of Judgment, the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah will have a more tolerable condition than that city. Jesus warns of tribulations.
Here I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.
Beware of people, for they will hand you over for trial in their courts, and will scourge you in their assemblies.
And they will deliver you to rulers and kings because you are my disciples. This will be your opportunity to testify about me to the Jews and to the Gentiles.
And when they seize you, do not worry about what you will say, because you will give the appropriate words at that moment.
Remember that it is not you who will speak, but the Spirit of your Father who will speak in you.
The brother will hand over his brother for killing, and the father will hand over his son. The children will turn against their parents and kill them.
And all people will hate you because of My name, but the one who remains faithful until the end, that one will be saved.
And when they persecute you in one city, flee to another. I tell you the truth, you will not finish going through all the towns of Israel until the Son of Man comes again.
There is no student better than his teacher, nor a servant greater than his master.
Let the student be content to become like his teacher, and the servant to become like his master. If they call the head of the house "Beelzebul," #Beelzebul. 25:10 From the names of Satan. A reference to Matthew 9:34. » Then what will they call the rest of the members of the house? Fear of God, not of people
So do not fear them; there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing concealed that will not be made known.
Whatever I tell you in the dark, proclaim it in the light; and whatever is whispered in your ears, proclaim it from the rooftops of the houses.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Aren't two birds sold for a penny? However, neither of them falls to the ground except with your father's permission.
As for you, even all the hair on your head is counted.
So do not be afraid, for you are more valuable than many sparrows. Confessing Christ before people
Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven.
And whoever denies me before people, I will deny him before my Father who is in heaven. Christ first
Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth. I have not come to bring peace but a sword!
I came: ‹Let the man be divided against his father, the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.›
Then man's enemies are his own household!
For whoever loves his father and mother more than me does not deserve to be mine. Whoever loves son or daughter more than me does not deserve to be mine.
And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
Whoever tries to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for my sake will gain it.
Whoever welcomes you, welcomes me. And whoever welcomes me, welcomes the one who sent me.
So, the one who welcomes the Prophet because he is a Prophet will receive the reward of a Prophet. And the one who welcomes Bar, because he is pious, will receive the reward of a pious person.
And whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of my humble disciples, because he is my disciple, I tell you the truth, will not go unrewarded.
John the Baptist and Jesus
And when Jesus finished teaching his twelve disciples, he left that place and went to teach and proclaim his message in the region of Galilee. Jesus and John the Baptist
While John the Baptist was in prison, he heard about all that Christ was doing, so he sent a message with some of his disciples.
And he asked him: "Are you the one we are waiting for, or should we wait for another?"
Jesus answered them and said: "Go and tell John what you have heard and seen:"
Here they are, the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor hear the good news.
And congratulations to those who do not hesitate to believe in Me.
And when John's disciples left the place, Jesus began to speak to the people about John and said: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
Why did you go out then? To see a man wearing soft clothes? Those who wear soft clothes live in kings' palaces.
Then why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, that is so. But I tell you, you have seen someone greater than a prophet!
This is what he wrote about: "Behold, I send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way."
I tell you the truth, among those born of women, there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
Since the time of John the Baptist, the kingdom of God has been facing fierce assaults, and violent men are trying to seize it by force.
Because the Law of Moses and all the prophets prophesied until the time of John.
If you wish to accept what the prophets and the Shariah say, then John is Elijah who was prophesied about his coming. #Elijah… his coming. 14:11 Elijah was one of God's prophets around 850 BC. The Jews expected his coming based on Malachi 4:5-6.
He who has ears, let him hear.
What is this generation like? It is like children sitting in markets, calling out to their friends and saying:
We sang for you, but you did not dance. We sang funeral songs for you, but you did not mourn!
John came, who neither ate like others nor drank wine like others, and people said about him: "He has an evil spirit."
Then the Son of Man came, eating and drinking wine like others, and people said about him: "Look at this man, he is gluttonous and a drunkard, and a friend of tax collectors and sinners!" But the fruits of wisdom are what prove that it is true wisdom." Jesus warns the sinful cities
Then Jesus began to rebuke the cities where He had performed most of His miracles, because their inhabitants did not repent of their sins.
He said: "Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, house of Sidon! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
But I say to you, the people of Tyre and Sidon will have an easier time than you on the Day of Judgment.
And you, O Capernaum, do you think you will be raised to the sky? No, but you will be brought down to the depths! If the miracles that occurred in you had happened in Sodom, it would have remained until today.
But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.» Jesus is the source of comfort
At that time, Jesus spoke and said: "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth. You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to infants."
Yes, Dad, because you were pleased with this work.
The Father has given me everything. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son, and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Carry my yoke #Yoke. 29:11 The yoke is a wooden tool placed on animals to help them carry heavy loads, and it is a Jewish symbol of the Law. Come to me, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
For the yoke I give you is easy, and the burden I place on you is light."
Jesus: Lord of the Sabbath
At that time, Jesus went for a walk in the fields on a Saturday. His disciples became hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and eat them.
But when the Pharisees saw this, they said to him: "Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath."
Jesus said to them: "Have you never read in the Scriptures: what David did when he and his companions were hungry?"
He entered the house of God and ate from the loaves of bread offered to God, although it is not permissible for him or those with him to eat that bread; only the priests are allowed to do so.
Did you not also read in the Law of Moses how the priests on the Sabbath do not keep the law concerning the Sabbath? And yet, they are not held accountable for this work.
But I tell you, there is something greater than the temple here.
And if you knew what the Book means when it says: ‹I desire mercy for people, not animal sacrifices.› #I desire … animal. 7:12 From the book of Hosea 6:6. When you judged those innocent people.
For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.» Healing on the Sabbath
Then he left that place and went to their gathering.
There was a man whose hand was paralyzed. So the people asked Jesus: "Does the law allow healing this man's hand on the Sabbath?" They asked him this so they would have a reason to accuse him.
He said to them: "Suppose one of you has a sheep that falls into a pit on the Sabbath, would you not hold it and lift it out?"
And man is more important than the sheep. Therefore, doing good on Saturday complies with the law.
Then Jesus said to the man with the paralyzed hand: "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and it was completely restored, just like the other hand.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot how they might kill Jesus. Jesus: The chosen servant of God
Then Jesus knew their plan, and left that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed them all.
And he commanded them not to reveal who he is.
This happened to fulfill what God said through the prophet Isaiah:
Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul delights. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
No one will argue or shout, and no one will hear his voice in their streets.
He will not break even the bent reed, nor will he extinguish even the smoldering wick. And he will continue until justice prevails.
And all nations will put their hope in Him." The authority of Jesus
Then they brought to him a man who was blind and mute because he was possessed by an evil spirit, and he healed him. So the mute man spoke and saw.
And the people were amazed and said: "Could this man be the son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons." 24:12 Also in verse 27. The prince of the evil spirits.
And when Jesus knew their thoughts, he said to them: "The fate of every kingdom divided against itself is ruin. And any city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If Satan expels spirits and fights himself, how can his kingdom stand?
If I cast out evil spirits with the power of Beelzebul, with what do your disciples cast them out? They are the ones who judge you.
But if I cast out evil spirits by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
How can someone enter a strong man's house and steal his possessions unless the strong man is first bound? Only then does he become capable of plundering his house.
Who is not with me is against me. And whoever does not gather with me scatters.
Therefore I tell you: every sin and blasphemy can be forgiven to people, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
Whoever speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. The fruit reveals the truth.
To harvest good fruit, plant a good tree. As for the bad tree, it gives you bad fruit. Because the tree is known by its fruit.
O sons of snakes, how can you speak good things while you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
The righteous person brings forth what is good from his good treasure, and the wicked person brings forth what is evil from the evil stored within him.
But I tell you, on the Day of Judgment, people will be asked about every word they have spoken.
And your words will determine your innocence or guilt." Jewish leaders demand proof.
Then some of his teachers of the law and the Pharisees asked him, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He answered them: "This wicked and adulterous generation seeks a sign to believe. It will not be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
Just as Jonah remained in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will remain in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
The people of Nineveh will stand against this generation on the Day of Judgment, and they will condemn it because they repented when they heard Jonah's warning. And now here before you is someone greater than Jonah.
And the Queen of the South will stand #Queen of the South. 42:12 Queen of Sheba. She traveled nearly two thousand kilometers to hear the wisdom of God from the mouth of King Solomon. See 1 Kings 10:1-13. On the day of judgment against this generation, and He will judge it. She came from the ends of the earth to hear Solomon's wisdom. And now here before you is someone greater than Solomon. The empty soul
When an unclean spirit leaves a person, it passes through arid places seeking a resting place, but finds none.
Then he says: ‹I will return to my house from which I came.› He goes and finds the house empty, swept, and tidy.
Then he goes and brings with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there. And so the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. This is how it will be with this wicked generation.» Jesus' disciples are his family
And while Jesus was speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers came and stood outside, asking to speak to him.
One of the people said to Jesus: "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside and want to speak to you."
Jesus answered him: "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"
Then he pointed with his hand to his disciples and said: "These are my mother and my brothers,"
For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.
Like sowing seeds
On that day, Jesus left the house and sat by the lake.
A large crowd gathered around him. He got into a boat and sat in it, while people stood on the shore.
And he told them many things in parables. He said to them: "A sower went out to sow."
And while he was sowing, some of the seed fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it.
Some of the seeds fell on rocky ground, where there was not enough soil, so the grains grew quickly because the soil was not deep.
But when the sun rose, it burned; and because it was rootless, it withered.
Some of the seeds fell on the thorns. The thorns grew and hindered its growth.
And other seeds fell on good ground, and produced fruit: some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.
He who has ears, let him hear.» Hearing and understanding
And the disciples came to him and asked: "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
Jesus answered them: "God has given you the privilege of knowing the secret of the kingdom of heaven, but He has not given it to them."
Because everyone who owns #who owns. 12:13 Perhaps it means "who owns understanding." It will be increased for him and overflow from him, but the one who does not own it will have what he has taken away.
Therefore, I speak to them in parables, for though they see, they do not perceive; and though they hear, they do not understand.
And thus, the prophecy of Isaiah applies to them: "You will hear and hear, but you will not understand. You will see and see, but you will not perceive."
So the mind of this people has become dull, and their hearing has become heavy. They closed their eyes, so they cannot observe with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their hearts, so that I may not return to them and heal them.
As for you, congratulations to your eyes because they see, and to your ears because they hear.
I tell you the truth, many kings and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and desired to hear what you hear but did not hear it. The meaning of the parable of the sower
So listen to an explanation like planting seeds:
When a person hears the message of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one #the evil one. 19:13 That is Satan. (Also in verse 38) And takes the seeds that were planted in his heart. This is the meaning of the seeds that fell along the path.
As for the one who fell on the rocky ground, she resembles someone who hears the word and immediately accepts it with joy,
But because he has no roots within himself, he endures only for a short time, and when distress and persecution come because of the word he received, he quickly loses his faith.
As for the one who fell among the thorns, she resembles someone who hears the word, but the worries of life and the temptations of money choke the word, so it does not bear fruit.
«The one who sows on good soil is the one who hears the word and understands it; he indeed bears fruit, producing a hundredfold, sixtyfold, or thirtyfold.» Like wheat and weeds.
He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seeds in his field."
But while the people were sleeping, the enemy of the man came and sowed weeds among the wheat, then went away.
And when the wheat sprouted and the ears took shape, the weeds also grew.
Then his servants came to him and said, "Sir, did you not sow good seeds in your field? Where then did these weeds come from?"
The man replied to them: "My enemy did that." His servants asked him: "Do you want us to go and uproot it?"
The man replied: "No, because when you uproot the weeds, you might uproot the wheat along with them."
Let them grow together until harvest time, then I will say to the harvesters: "First, gather the weeds and bundle them for burning. But gather the wheat and put it in my barn." For example, mustard and yeast.
Then Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.
It is the smallest of seeds. But when it grows, it becomes the largest plants in the orchards, turning into a big tree, so much so that the birds of the sky come to it and make their nests in its branches.
He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until all the dough was leavened."
Jesus spoke all these things using parables. He did not speak to the people except in parables.
This is what God said through the Prophet: "I will open my mouth with parables, and I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world."
Then Jesus dismissed the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and asked, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He said to them: "The one who sows good seeds is the Son of Man,"
And the field is the world, and the good seeds are those who have the kingdom. As for the weeds, they are those who belong to the evil one.
And the enemy who sowed them is Iblis. The harvest is the end of the world. The harvesters are the angels.
And just as weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will be the end of the world.
For the Son of Man will send his angels who will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers,
Then they throw them into the blazing oven. There, people cry and clench their teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear. The parable of the treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. In his joy, he went and sold all he had and bought that field.
The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for beautiful pearls.
And when he found a very precious pearl, he went and sold everything he owned and bought it. Like a fishing net.
The kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the sea, which caught fish of various kinds.
And when the net was full, the fishermen pulled it to the shore. Then they sat down and began selecting the good fish and placing it in baskets, while the bad fish they threw out.
This is what will happen at the end of the world, as the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous.
Then the wicked are thrown into the blazing furnace. There, people cry and clench their teeth.
And Jesus asked his disciples: "Do you understand all these things?" They answered: "Yes."
He said to them: "Therefore, every teacher of the law who learns about the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his storeroom new things as well as old." Jesus goes to his city
When Jesus finished telling those parables, He left that place.
And when he went to his town, he began to teach them in their synagogue. Everyone was amazed and said: "Where did this man get such wisdom and these miracles?"
Isn't he the son of the carpenter? Isn't his mother Mary? Aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Don't all his sisters live among us? So where did he get everything he has?
That was an obstacle preventing them from accepting him. But Jesus said to them: "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house!"
He did not perform many miracles there because of their lack of faith.
Herod hears about Jesus
At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard about Jesus. 1:14 literally "tetrarch." The Romans had divided Palestine into four provinces, so the ruler of each province was called a tetrarch or tetrarch governor. See Luke 3:1. about Jesus.
He said to his servants: "It is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and because of this, miracles are performed through him!" The martyrdom of John the Baptist
Herod was the one who arrested John and put him in prison, because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
Because John told Herod: "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
Therefore, Herod wanted to kill him, but he was afraid of the people because they considered John a prophet.
But when Herod's birthday came, Herodias' daughter danced before him and his guests, which greatly pleased Herod.
He even promised and swore to give her whatever she asked for, no matter what.
But her mother had already taught her what to ask for, so she said: "Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter."
The king was saddened, but he ordered her request to be fulfilled because of his oath and out of respect for his guests.
So he sent to have John’s head cut off in prison.
Then he brought his head on a platter and gave it to her, so she gave it to her mother.
Then the disciples of John came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus what had happened. Jesus feeds more than five thousand.
And when Jesus heard this, he got into a boat and went to a solitary place. The crowds learned of this and went out on foot from their towns and followed him.
And upon reaching the shore, he saw a large crowd, took pity on them, and healed the sick among them.
In the evening, his disciples came to him and said, "This place is isolated and the time is very late; dismiss the people so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
But Jesus said to them, "You do not need to go; give them something to eat."
His disciples said to him, "We have nothing here but five loaves and two fish."
Jesus said to them, "Bring her here to me."
And he commanded the people to sit on the grass. Then Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish, and looked up to heaven, giving thanks to God. He broke the loaves and gave them to his disciples, who distributed them to the people.
So they ate and were all satisfied. They collected what was left of the food, which amounted to twelve baskets filled with scraps.
And the number of those who ate five thousand men, besides women and children. Jesus walks on water.
Then Jesus asked his disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd.
And after he dismissed them, he went up the mountain alone to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.
The boat had reached the middle of the lake, and the waves were crashing against it fiercely, because the wind was blowing against the direction of the boat.
Just before dawn, Jesus came to them walking on the lake.
When his disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified and said, "It is a ghost," and in their fear, they cried out.
Jesus immediately said to them: "Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid."
Peter answered him, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water."
He said to him: "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter noticed the strong wind, he was afraid and began to sink, and he cried out: "Lord, save me."
Then Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, and said to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
And when Jesus and Peter got into the boat, the wind stopped.
And those in the boat worshiped Jesus and said, "You are truly the Son of God." Jesus heals many.
And when they crossed the lake, they reached the region of Gennesaret.
And when the inhabitants of that region recognized Jesus, they announced His arrival throughout the surrounding area, and they brought all the sick to Him.
And they begged him to allow them to touch only the edge of his cloak. And everyone who touched him received healing.
God's Law and People's Traditions
Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law from Jerusalem came to Jesus and asked him:
Why do his students break the traditions we inherited from our ancestors? They do not wash their hands before eating.
Jesus answered them, "And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?"
So Allah commanded and said: "Honor your father and your mother," #Honor ... your mother. 4:15 from the Book of Exodus 20:12, and the Book of Deuteronomy 5:16. And He said: "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." #Whoever curses ... shall be put to death. 4:15 from the Book of Exodus 21:17.
But you say: "Whoever says to his father or mother: I have nothing to help you with, because I have given everything I have to the Lord," is not bound to honor his father or mother.
And thus you ignored God's commandment because of your traditions.
O hypocrites, Isaiah was truthful when he prophesied about you, saying:
This people glorifies me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
Their worship is useless, because they know teachings that are nothing but human commandments.
And Jesus called the people to Him and said to them: "Listen to me and understand what I say:"
What enters a person's mouth does not defile him; what comes out of his mouth, that defiles him.
Then the disciples came to him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard your words?"
Jesus answered: "Every plant that my Father has not planted will be uprooted from its roots."
Leave them, for they are blind leading the blind. And if a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into the pit.
Peter answered: "Explain to us the meaning of this parable."
Jesus said: "Don't you understand yet?"
Don't you understand that everything that enters a person's mouth goes into the stomach, and then exits outward?
But what comes out of a person's mouth originates from the heart. And this is what defiles a person.
Because from the heart come evil thoughts, murder, fornication, theft, false testimony, insult.
These are the things that make a person impure, but eating with unwashed hands does not make a person impure." Jesus helps a stranger woman
And Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman who was living in that region came to him and began to cry out: "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David. My daughter is possessed by an evil spirit, and she is suffering greatly."
Jesus did not answer her a word. Then his disciples came and urged him, saying, "Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us."
He said: "I only sent to the lost sheep of the children of Israel."
But the woman approached him, prostrated before him, and said: "O Lord, help me."
Jesus answered her, "It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
She said: "That's true, sir, but even dogs eat what falls from their owners' table."
Then Jesus answered her, "Woman, your faith is very great. Let it be done for you as you wish." And at that moment, her daughter was healed. Jesus heals many.
And Jesus left that place and went to the area near the Sea of Galilee. He climbed a hill and sat there.
A large crowd came to him, including the lame, the blind, the crippled, the deaf, the mute, and many other sick people. They placed them at Jesus' feet, and he healed them.
And the crowds were amazed when they saw the deaf mute speaking, the lame walking, the paralyzed moving, and the blind seeing, and they praised the God of Israel. Jesus feeds more than four thousand.
Jesus called his disciples and said, "I have compassion for these people; they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."
His disciples said to him, "Where can we get enough bread to feed this crowd in such a remote place?"
Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said to him, "Seven, and a few small fish."
Then Jesus ordered the people to sit on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples to distribute to everyone.
So everyone ate and was full. Then they gathered the leftover broken pieces, which filled seven baskets.
And the number of eaters was four thousand men, excluding women and children.
And when Jesus dismissed the crowds, he went up into a boat and went to the region of Magdala.
Jewish leaders test Jesus
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus to test Him, and they asked Him to give them a sign from God to prove His authority.
Jesus answered them: "At sunset you say, 'It will be good weather because the sky is red.'"
In the early morning, you say: "It will be a stormy day, because the sky is red and cloudy." You interpret weather signs well, but you do not understand the times you are living in!
This wicked, corrupt generation seeks a sign to believe. And only the sign of Jonah will be given to them.» Then Jesus left them and went away. Lack of understanding
And Jesus' disciples crossed to the other side of the lake, but they forgot to bring bread.
Jesus said to them: "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees."
Then the students began to talk among themselves and say: "But we didn't bring bread!"
Then Jesus knew what they were saying, and he said to them: "O you of little faith, why are you arguing among yourselves about not having bread?"
Have you not realized yet? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered from the leftovers?
Don't you remember the seven loaves for four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered from the broken pieces?
Why don't you understand that I wasn't talking to you about ordinary bread, but I was warning you to keep yourselves from the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
Then his disciples understood that he was not talking about the yeast of bread, but about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter declares that Jesus is the Messiah.
And when Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, "Who do people say that I am, the Son of Man?"
His disciples answered him: "Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
He asked them, "And you, who do you think I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered him: "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, because it is not flesh and blood that has revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven."
And I say to you that you are Peter, #Peter. 18:16 From Greek "Petros" meaning "rock." And on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades #gates of Hades. 18:16 That is, the power of death. It will not prevail against it.
And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then he strongly warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he is the Messiah. Jesus speaks about the inevitability of his death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law. He also must be killed and be raised on the third day.
But Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, "God forbid it, Lord! This shall never happen to You!"
Then Jesus turned to Peter and said, "Away from me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me because you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns."
Then Jesus said to his disciples: "If anyone wishes to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me."
Whoever wants to save their life will lose it. But whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.
What does a person benefit if he gains the whole world and loses himself? And what can a person do to recover his life?
For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and He will reward each according to his deeds.
I tell you the truth, some of those standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Jesus with Moses and Elijah
After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and his brother John, and led them up a high mountain to be alone.
And while they were there, Jesus' appearance changed, and he shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.
Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared before the disciples, and they were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus: "Lord, it is good for us to be here! If you wish, I will put up three shelters here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was speaking, a shining cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, saying: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; listen to Him."
When the students heard that, they were terrified and fell face down to the ground.
Jesus approached and touched them and said, "Rise, do not be afraid."
And when they looked around them, they saw no one but Jesus.
And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus instructed them, saying: "Do not tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man is raised from the dead."
His disciples asked him: "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?" #Elijah ... first. 10:17 Elijah was one of God's prophets around 850 BC. The Jews expected his coming based on Malachi 4:5-6.
Jesus answered them: "Yes, Elijah is coming to restore all things."
But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they did not recognize him, but treated him as they wanted. The Son of Man will also face that treatment from them.
Then his disciples understood that he was talking about John the Baptist. Jesus casts out an evil spirit from a boy.
And when they returned to the crowd, a man came to Jesus and bowed before Him.
He said: "Have mercy on my son, Lord, for he is epileptic and suffers greatly. He often falls into fire or water."
And I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.»
Then Jesus said: "O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and how long shall I bear with you?" Then he said to the man: "Bring your son here to me."
And Jesus commanded the evil spirit to come out of him, and the boy was healed instantly.
Then his disciples came to him privately and asked, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"
Jesus answered them, "Because of your little faith. I tell you the truth, if your faith were the size of a mustard seed, you could say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it would move, and nothing would be impossible for you."
But this type can only be expelled through prayer and fasting." Jesus forewarns of his approaching death
And while they were traveling together in Galilee, Jesus said to them: "The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men."
And they will kill him. But on the third day he will rise from the dead." The disciples were very sad. Temple tax
And when Jesus entered Capernaum, those who collected the two-drachma tax for the temple came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the two-drachma tax?"
Peter answered them, "Yes, he does." Then Peter went to the house. Jesus immediately spoke to him and said, "Tell me, Simon, from whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes? From their own children, or from others?"
Then Peter answered, "They are gathering them from other peoples." Jesus said, "Then the children are exempt from it."
But so as not to cause them trouble, go to the lake, and cast your fishing line. Then take the first fish you catch, and open its mouth. You will find inside a coin worth four dirhams. Take it and give it to them on my behalf and yours.
