All the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, from David to the exile to Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the exile to Babylon to the Messiah are fourteen generations. The birth of Jesus Christ
The birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: When his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
Yusuf was her man when he was righteous, and he did not want to expose her; he wanted to keep her secret.
But as he was pondering these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying: "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit."
And she will give birth to a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
And all of this was so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled:
Behold, the virgin shall conceive and give birth to a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which means: God with us.
When Joseph woke up from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took his wife.
He did not know her until she gave birth to her firstborn son. And he named him Jesus.
The visit of the Magi
Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.
Saying: "Where is the newborn King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him."
When King Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
Then he gathered all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and asked them, "Where is the Messiah to be born?"
They said to him: "In Bethlehem of Judea. For so it is written by the prophet:"
And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are not the least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you shall come a Governor who will shepherd My people Israel.
Then Herod secretly summoned the Magi and ascertained from them the time the star had appeared.
Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying: "Go and search carefully for the child. And when you find him, tell me, so that I too may come and worship him."
When they heard from the king, they went. And the star they saw in the east led them forward until it came and stopped above where the boy was.
When they saw the star, they rejoiced with great joy.
And they came to the house and saw the child with Mary his mother. And they fell down and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Then, when it was revealed to them in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed on a different route to their country. Fleeing to Egypt
And when they had gone, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying: "Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him."
He got up, took the boy and his mother at night, and set out for Egypt.
And there was until the death of Herod, so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled: "Out of Egypt I called my son."
Then Herod, when he saw that the wise men had mocked him, was very angry. He sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time he had ascertained from the wise men.
Then what was said by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:
A voice heard in Ramah, weeping, crying, and loud wailing. Rachel weeps for her children and refuses to be comforted because they are not present. Return to Nazareth
When Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt.
Saying: "Go and take the boy and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the boy's life are dead."
He got up, took the boy and his mother, and came to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in place of Herod his father, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the parts of Galilee.
And he came and settled in a city called Nazareth, so that what was said by the prophets would be fulfilled: "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way
In those days, John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
saying: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near."
For this is what was spoken about him by the prophet Isaiah, saying: A voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
And this John had clothing of camel's hair, and a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
Then Jerusalem went out to meet him, along with all Judea and all the surrounding region of the Jordan.
And they relied on Him in Jordan, confessing their sins.
When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them: "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?"
So produce fruits worthy of repentance.
And do not say to yourselves: We have Abraham as our father. For I tell you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
And now the axe has been laid to the root of the tree; therefore, every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water for repentance, but the one who comes after me is more powerful than I am, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He who flicks in his hand, will purify his sword, and gather his grain into the storehouse, and the straw he will burn with an unquenchable fire. The baptism of Jesus Christ
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
But John prevented him, saying: "I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me!"
Jesus answered him, "Allow it now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed him.
When Jesus had been baptized, he immediately came up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him; and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon him.
And a voice from the heavens saying: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
Jesus faces the temptation
Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
After fasting for forty days and forty nights, he finally became hungry.
The experienced one approached him and said: "If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."
He replied and said: "It is written: Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God."
Then Satan took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
And he said to him: "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written: He will command His angels concerning you, and they will bear you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone."
Jesus said to him: "It is also written: Do not put the Lord your God to the test."
Then Iblis also took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said to him: "I will give you all of these if you bow down and worship me."
Then Jesus said to him, "Go, Satan! For it is written: You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve."
Then Satan left him, and behold, angels came and began to serve him. The beginning of his ministry in Galilee.
When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew to Galilee.
And he left Nazareth and came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali.
So that what was said by the prophet Isaiah may be fulfilled:
Land of Zebulun, land of Naphtali, on the way to the sea, across the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.
The sitting people in darkness have seen a great light, and those sitting in the land of death and its shadows, a light has shone upon them.
From that time Jesus began to preach and say: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near." The calling of the first disciples
And as Jesus was walking along the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers: Simon, called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
He said to them: "Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately, they left the window and followed him.
Then he passed by and saw two other brothers: Jacob son of Zebedee and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. He called them.
Immediately, they left the ship and their father and followed him. Jesus teaches and heals the sick.
And Jesus was going about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every weakness among the people.
His fame spread throughout all of Syria. So he brought to him all the sick, those afflicted with various diseases and pains, the insane, the possessed, and the paralyzed, and he healed them.
A large multitude from Galilee, the ten cities, Jerusalem, Judea, and across the Jordan followed him.
The Sermon on the Mount - The Beatitudes
When the crowds saw this, he went up the mountain; and when he sat down, his disciples came to him.
So he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are the mourners, for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are the hungry and thirsty for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for my sake.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for they persecuted the prophets who were before you. The salt of the earth and the light of the world.
You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt loses its flavor, with what will it be salted? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
They do not light a lamp and put it under the measure, but on the lampstand, so it gives light to all who are in the house.
Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. Complete the law
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to abolish but to fulfill.
For I truly tell you: until the heavens and the earth pass away, not the smallest letter or dot from the Law will pass away until everything is fulfilled.
Whoever breaks one of these least commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever practices and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
For I tell you: unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Anger
You have heard that it was said to the ancients: Do not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to judgment.
But I say to you: whoever is angry with his brother without cause is liable to judgment; and whoever says to his brother, Raca, is liable to the council; and whoever says, You fool, shall be liable to hell fire.
If you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,
Leave your gift there in front of the altar, go and reconcile with your brother first, and then come and present your gift.
Be quick to satisfy your opponent as long as you are on the road with him, so that the opponent does not hand you over to the judge, and the judge does not hand you over to the policeman, and you end up in prison.
I tell you the truth: do not leave there until you pay the last penny! Adultery
You have heard that it was said to the ancients: Do not commit adultery.
But I say to you: whoever looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and cast it away from you; it is better for you that one of your members perish than that your whole body be cast into hell. Divorce
And it was said: Whoever divorces his wife should give her a divorce certificate.
And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife except for the reason of adultery, causing her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman, he commits adultery. The oath.
You also heard it said to the ancients: Do not break your oaths, but fulfill to the Lord your vows.
But I say to you: Do not swear at all, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God,
Neither the earth, for it is the place of his feet, nor Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black.
But let your speech be: Yes, yes; no, no. Anything beyond that is from the evil one. Revenge
You have heard that it was said: eye for eye and tooth for tooth.
But I say to you: Do not resist evil; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.
And whoever wants to argue with you and take your cloak, also leave him the garment.
Whoever has caused you to go one mile, go with him two.
Ask you, so give him; and whoever wants to borrow from you, do not refuse him. Love of enemies
You have heard that it was said: Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
But I say to you: Love your enemies. Bless those who curse you. Do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute you.
So that you may be children of your Father in heaven, for he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
And if you only greet your brothers, what virtue do you do? Do not the ten also do the same?
Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Charity
Beware of doing your charity before people to be seen by them; otherwise, you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
So when you give to the needy, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be praised by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward!
And as for you, when you give charity, let not your left hand know what your right hand does.
So that your charity remains secret. Your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you openly. Prayer
And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward!
As for you, whenever you pray, go into your room and close the door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
And when you pray, do not repeat empty words like the nations, for they think that by their many words they will be answered.
So do not imitate them. For your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
Pray like this: Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Your name.
Come, your kingdom. Let your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Our bread is sufficient; give us today.
And forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.
For if you forgive people their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
And if you do not forgive people's slips, your Father will not forgive your slips either. Fasting
And when you fast, do not be gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.
And as for you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face.
So that you do not appear to people as fasting, but to your Father who is in secret. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. Treasures in heaven
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
The lamp of the body is the eye; if your eye is simple, your whole body will be full of light.
And if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will cling to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth. God takes care of us.
Therefore I tell you: do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink, nor about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the sky: they do not sow or reap or gather into barns, and your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?
And among you, if he is concerned, can he add one cubit to his stature?
And why do you care about the clothing? Observe the lilies of the field how they grow! They neither toil nor spin.
But I tell you: not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these.
If the grass of the field that exists today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, God clothes it like this, then is it not much more appropriate that He clothes you, O you of little faith?
So do not worry, saying: What shall we eat? Or what shall we drink? Or what shall we wear?
For all of these things, the nations seek them. Because your Heavenly Father knows that you need all of these.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Sufficient for the day is its own evil.
Condemning others
Do not judge so that you will not be judged,
For with the judgment you pronounce, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but do not notice the plank in your own eye?
Or how can you say to your brother: "Let me remove the speck from your eye," while there is a plank in your own eye?
You hypocrite, first remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye!
Do not give the Holy to the dogs, and do not cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them with their feet and turn around to tear you apart. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and you will receive. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened to you.
For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, it will be opened.
Does anyone of you, when his son asks him for bread, give him a stone?
And if he asks him for a fish, will he give him a live one?
For if you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. This is the law and the prophets. The narrow door
Enter through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it!
How narrow is the door and how difficult is the way that leads to life, and few are those who find it! The tree and its fruit
Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves!
You will recognize them by their fruits. Do they gather grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?
Thus, every good tree produces good fruit, but a bad tree produces bad fruit.
A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
So you will recognize them by their fruits.
Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day: Lord, Lord! Did we not prophesy in Your name, and cast out demons in Your name, and do many mighty works in Your name?
Then I will declare to them: I never knew you! Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness! The wise builders and the foolish builders
So whoever hears my words and acts on them, I compare him to a wise man who built his house on the rock.
Then the rain fell, the rivers came, the winds blew, and it fell upon that house but did not collapse, because it was founded on the rock.
And whoever hears my words and does not act on them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
Then the rain fell, the rivers came, the winds blew, and it struck that house, causing it to collapse, and its fall was great!».
When Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were amazed at His teaching.
Because he was teaching them as one having authority and not as the scribes.
Cure for Leprosy
And when he descended from the mountain, many crowds followed him.
And a leper came and bowed before him, saying: "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I want to; be clean." Immediately, his leprosy was cleansed.
Jesus said to him: "See that you tell no one. But go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." The faith of the centurion
When Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, pleading with Him.
And he says: "Sir, my servant is lying in the house, paralyzed and suffering greatly."
Jesus said to him: "I am coming and will heal him."
The captain of the hundred replied: "O sir, I am not worthy for you to come under my roof, but just say the word, and my servant will be healed."
Because I am also a human under authority. I have soldiers under my command. I say to this one: Go! and he goes; to another: Come! and he comes; and to my servant: Do this! and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him: "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such faith!"
And I tell you: many will come from the east and the west and will recline with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
And the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then Jesus said to the centurion: "Go, and as you have believed, let it be done for you." And his servant was healed in that hour. The healing of Peter's mother-in-law and others
And when Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever.
He touched her hand, and the fever left her, so she got up and served them.
And when evening came, many lunatics were brought to Him, and He cast out the spirits with a word, and all the sick He healed.
So that what was said by the prophet Isaiah: "He took our illnesses and carried our diseases." The cost of followership
When Jesus saw the great crowds around him, he ordered to go to the crossing.
Then a writer stepped forward and said to him: "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus said to him: "Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
Another of his disciples said to him: "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead." Calming the storm
And when they entered the ship, His disciples followed Him.
And a great disturbance occurred in the sea until the waves covered the ship, and he was sleeping.
Then his disciples came and woke him, saying, "Lord, save us! We are perishing!"
He said to them: "Why are you afraid, you of little faith?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
People were amazed, saying: "What kind of person is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!" He cast out the demons.
And when he came to the region of the Gerasenes, two madmen who were coming out of the tombs met him, exceedingly violent, so that no one could pass by that way.
And they both cried out, saying: "What have we to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the appointed time?"
And far from them, a herd of many pigs was grazing.
The devils asked him, saying: "If you cast us out, permit us to go into the herd of pigs."
He said to them: "Go." So they went out and went to the herd of pigs, and behold, the entire herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea and drowned in the waters.
As for the shepherds, they fled and went to the city, and they reported everything, including the matter of the two madmen.
So the whole city went out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they asked him to leave their outskirts.
Healing of the paralyzed
So he entered the ship, sailed away, and came to his city.
And when a paralyzed man is brought to him, laid on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
And a group of scribes said about themselves: "This is blasphemy!".
And Jesus knew their thoughts, and he said: "Why are you thinking evil in your hearts?"
Which is easier, to say: "Your sins are forgiven," or to say: "Rise and walk"?
But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins, he said to the paralytic, "Rise, take up your bed and go to your house."
He got up and went to his house.
When the crowds saw this, they were amazed and praised God, who had given people such authority. The calling of Matthew
As Jesus was passing by from there, he saw a man sitting at the tax booth, named Matthew. He said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
And while he was reclining in the house, forty and many sinners came and reclined with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them: "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
Go and learn what this means: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. The question about fasting
Then John’s disciples came to him and asked, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?”
Jesus said to them: "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast."
No one patches a new piece onto an old garment, because the filling takes from the garment, making the tear worse.
They do not put new wine into old wineskins, lest the skins burst; the wine will spill, and the skins will be ruined. Instead, they put new wine into new wineskins, so that both are preserved. The raising of Jair’s daughter and the healing of the bleeding woman
While he was speaking to them, a ruler came and bowed before him, saying: "My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Then Jesus got up and followed him, along with his disciples.
And a woman who has been bleeding for twelve years came from behind him and touched the hem of his garment,
Because she said to herself: "If I only touch his garment, I will be healed."
Then Jesus turned and saw her, and said, "Be of good cheer, daughter; your faith has made you well." And the woman was made well from that hour.
And when Jesus came to the house of the ruler, he saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,
He said to them: "Step aside, for the girl is not dead but asleep." And they laughed at him.
When the crowd was brought out, he entered and took her hand, and the girl stood up.
And that news spread to all that land. Healing of the blind.
As Jesus was passing by from there, two blind men followed him, shouting and saying, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
And when he came to the house, the two blind men approached him, and Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord!"
Then He touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith let it be done for you."
Then their eyes were opened. Jesus rebuked them, saying: "Look, no one knows!"
But they went out and spread it throughout that land. A mute healing.
And as they were leaving, a mute madman was brought to him.
When Satan was expelled, the mute spoke, and the crowds were amazed, saying: "Never has anyone like this appeared in Israel!"
And the Pharisees said: "It is by the ruler of demons that He casts out demons." The perpetrators are few.
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every weakness among the people.
And when the crowds saw their mercy upon them, for they were distressed and scattered like sheep without a shepherd.
Then He said to His disciples: "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few."
So they asked the Lord of the harvest to send laborers to His harvest.
Sending the Twelve
Then he called his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every weakness.
And as for the twelve apostles' names, they are these: the first Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew. James son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
Philippus, Bartholomew. Thomas, Matthew the tax collector. James son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, called Thaddaeus.
Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot who betrayed him.
These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them, saying: "Do not go the way of the Gentiles, nor enter a city of the Samaritans.
But they took the free man to the sheep of the lost House of Israel.
And as you go, proclaim, saying: The kingdom of heaven has come near.
Heal the sick. Purify the lepers. Raise the dead. Cast out demons. Freely you received, freely give.
Do not acquire gold, silver, or copper in your regions.
Neither a provider for the road nor two garments nor shoes nor a staff, because the doer deserves his food.
And any city or village you enter, examine who is worthy in it, and stay there until you leave.
And when you enter the house, greet him.
If the house is deserving, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not deserving, let your peace return to you.
And whoever does not accept you or listen to your words, go out from that house or from that city, and shake off the dust from your feet.
Truly I tell you: Sodom and Gomorrah's land will have a more likely state on the Day of Judgment than that city.
Here I am sending you out like sheep among wolves; therefore, be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
But beware of the people, for they will deliver you to councils, and in their synagogues they will flog you.
And you are brought before rulers and kings as witnesses for me, bearing testimony for them and for nations.
So when they convert to Islam, do not worry about how or what you speak, because at that moment you will be giving what you speak about.
For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.
And the brother will deliver his brother to death, and the father his son, and the children will rise up against their parents and kill them.
And you will be hated by everyone for my name's sake. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.
And whenever they persecute you in this city, flee to the next. For I truly say to you: you will not complete the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.
The student is not better than the teacher, nor is the servant better than his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they called the Lord of the house Beelzebul, how much more so His household!
So do not fear them. For what is hidden will not be revealed, and what is concealed will not be known.
What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in your ear, proclaim on the rooftops.
And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Aren't two birds sold for a penny? And one of them does not fall to the ground without your father.
And as for you, even the hairs of your heads are all counted.
So do not be afraid! You are better than many birds!
Whoever confesses me before people, I will also confess him before my Father who is in heaven.
But whoever denies me before people, I also will deny him before my Father who is in heaven.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace but a sword.
For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
And the enemies of man are his own family.
Whoever loves a father or mother more than I do does not deserve me, and whoever loves a son or daughter more than I do does not deserve me.
And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
Whoever accepts you accepts me, and whoever accepts me accepts the One who sent me.
Whoever accepts a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive the reward of a prophet, and whoever accepts a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive the reward of a righteous person.
And whoever gives one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, I truly tell you: he will not lose his reward.
John the Baptist and Jesus
When Jesus finished instructing his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their towns. Jesus and John the Baptist
But John, when he heard in prison about the works of the Christ, sent two of his disciples,
He said to him: "Are you the one coming, or shall we wait for another?"
Jesus answered them, and said: "Go and tell John what you hear and see:"
The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news preached to them.
Blessed is he who does not stumble upon it.
And while these two went, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
But what have you come out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Behold, those who wear fine clothes are in the houses of kings.
But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
This is what is written about him: Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.
Truly I tell you: among those born of women, there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.
For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
And if you want to accept, this is Elijah who is to come.
He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
And who does this generation resemble? It resembles children sitting in the markets calling out to their companions.
And they say: We played for you, but you did not dance! We mourned for you, but you did not weep!
Because John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say: He has a demon.
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say: "Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners." But wisdom is justified by her children. Woe to the cities that did not repent.
Then he began to rebuke the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent:
Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you: that both Sodom and Gomorrah will have a more tolerable condition on the Day of Judgment than you.
And you, O Capernaum, raised to the heavens! You will be brought down to the depths. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.
But I tell you: it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. Rest for the weary
At that time Jesus answered and said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to children."
Yes, Father, for thus the joy has come before You.
All things have been handed down to me by my Father; no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Carry my burden upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, so you will find rest for your souls.
Because my fire is gentle and my burden is light.
Lord of the Sabbath
At that time, Jesus went on the Sabbath among the crops, and His disciples became hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and eat.
And the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to Him: "Behold, Your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!"
He said to them: "Have you not read what David did when he and those with him were hungry?"
How did he enter the house of God and eat the bread of the offering that was not lawful for him or for those with him to eat, but only for the priests?
Have you not read in the Torah that the priests on the Sabbath in the temple desecrate the Sabbath and are innocent?
But I tell you: here is greater than the temple!
If you knew what it is: I desire mercy, not sacrifice, then you would not have condemned the innocent!
For the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.
Then he left from there and came to their assembly,
And if a man has a dry hand, they ask him, saying: "Is healing permissible on the Sabbath?" so that they may accuse him.
He said to them: "If any of you has one sheep, and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, won't he hold it and lift it out?"
How much better is man than a sheep! If only the act of goodness could be performed instantly!
Then He said to the man: "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out. And it was restored, like the other. The chosen son of God.
When the Pharisees went out, they conspired against him to destroy him.
Then Jesus knew and departed from there. And a great multitude followed Him, and He healed them all.
And he advised them not to reveal it.
So that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah may be fulfilled:
Behold my chosen one, my beloved in whom my soul delights. I will put my spirit upon him, and he will declare the truth to the nations.
He does not argue or shout, and no one hears his voice in the streets.
A battered minaret that cannot be toppled, and a smoldering wick that cannot be extinguished, until the truth emerges for support.
In His name is the hope of the nations». Jesus and Beelzebul
Then a blind, deaf-mute madman was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the blind and deaf-mute spoke and saw.
Then all the crowds were amazed and said, "Is this the son of David?"
As for the Pharisees, when they heard this, they said: "This man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
And Jesus knew their thoughts, and he said to them: "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If Satan casts out Satan, he has divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, then your sons, by whom do they cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges!
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you!
Or how can anyone enter the house of the strong and steal his belongings, if the strong one does not first secure it, and then his house is robbed?
Who is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.
Therefore I tell you: every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven people.
Whoever says a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven him, but whoever says against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, neither in this world nor in the age to come.
Make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad, for by its fruit you will recognize the tree.
O children of snakes! How can you speak good things when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
The good person from the good treasure in the heart brings forth good things, and the evil person from the evil treasure brings forth evil things.
But I say to you: for every idle word that men speak, they will give an account on the Day of Judgment.
For with your words you justify yourself, and with your words you condemn yourself." Jonah 3:4
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
He answered them and said: "An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
The men of Nineveh will do penance in this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, a greater than Jonah is here!
The Queen of Sheba will come in religion with this generation and judge it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear Solomon's wisdom, and behold, someone greater than Solomon is here!
When the impure spirit leaves a person, it passes through places where there is no water, seeking rest and finding none.
Then he says: Return to my house from which I left. He comes and finds it empty, swept, and decorated.
Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there, so that the last state of that person becomes worse than the first! So it will also be for this wicked generation. Doing the will of God
While he was speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him.
One of them said to him: "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak to you."
He replied and said to the one who asked him: "Who is my mother and who are my brothers?"
Then he reached out his hand toward his disciples and said: "Here are my mother and my brothers."
For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.
Like the planter and its interpretation
On that day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.
A large crowd gathered around him, so much so that he entered the boat and sat down. The entire crowd stood on the shore.
So He spoke to them many things in parables, saying: "Behold, the sower went out to sow,"
As he was planting, some fell on the road, and the birds came and ate them.
And the other fell on the stony places, where it did not have much soil, so it immediately sprouted because it had no depth of earth.
But when the sun rose, it burned, and since it had no origin, it dried up.
And another fell on the thorn, and the thorn grew up and choked it.
And another fell on good ground and yielded a crop, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.
He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
Then the students approached him and asked, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
And he answered them, and said: "Because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given."
For whoever has will be given and will be added to; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.
For this I speak to them in parables, because they are seeing but do not perceive, and hearing but do not understand.
In them was fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah that says: "You will hear but never understand, and see but never perceive."
For the heart of this people has become calloused, and their ears are heavy to hear. They have closed their eyes, so they may not see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn, so I may heal them.
But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
For I truly tell you: many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see and did not see it, and to hear what you hear and did not hear it.
So listen, you like the sower:
Whoever hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path.
And the one planted on the rocky places is the one who hears the word, and immediately accepts it with joy.
But it has no inherent origin; it is temporary. So, if hardship or persecution occurs because of the Word, he immediately stumbles.
And the planted seed among thorns is the one who hears the word, but the worries of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, making it unfruitful.
But the one sown on good ground is the one who hears the word and understands it. He is the one who bears fruit, producing some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty. » Like wheat and tares
He gave them another example, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field."
And while the people were asleep, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, then went away.
When the plant sprouted and bore fruit, then adultery also appeared.
Then the servants of the householder came and said to him: "Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where then does the tares come from?"
He said to them: "It is a human enemy who did this." The servants said to him: "Do you want us to go and gather him?"
He said: No! So that you do not uproot the wheat along with the barley while you are gathering it.
They both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I say to the harvesters: First gather the chaff and bundle it to burn, and gather the wheat into my barn. Like a mustard seed and like yeast.
He gave them another example, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field,"
And it is the smallest of all seeds. But when it grows, it becomes the largest of shrubs, and it turns into a tree, so much so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches.
He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour until all was leavened."
All this Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables; He did not speak to them without a parable.
So that what was said by the Prophet, peace be upon him, may be fulfilled: "I will open my mouth in parables, and I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world." Interpretation of the parable of wheat and tares
Then Jesus dismissed the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and asked, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
And he answered them, saying: "The sower of good seed is the Son of Man."
And the field is the world. And good seed is the children of the kingdom. And the weeds are the children of the wicked one.
And the enemy he sowed is Iblis. And the harvest is the end of the world. And the harvesters are the angels.
Just as the spouses gather and are burned by fire, so it will be at the end of this world:
The Son of Man sends his angels to gather from his kingdom all causes of stumbling and those who do evil,
And they will be cast into the fire's furnace. There will be crying and grinding of teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear. Parables of the treasure, the pearl, and the net.
Also, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid. And in his joy, he went and sold all that he had and bought that field.
It also resembles the kingdom of heaven to a man, a merchant seeking fine pearls,
When he found a single pearl that was very valuable, he went and sold everything he had and bought it.
It also resembles the kingdom of heaven, a net cast into the sea, gathering of every kind.
When it was filled, they carried it up onto the shore, sat down, and gathered the horses into containers, while the rags were thrown outside.
Thus will be at the end of the world: the angels will come out and separate the wicked from among the righteous,
And they will be cast into the fire's furnace. There will be crying and grinding of teeth there.
Jesus said to them: "Do you understand all this?" They answered: "Yes, Lord."
He said to them: "Therefore, every educated scribe in the kingdom of heaven is like a man, a householder, who brings out of his treasure new things and old."
And when Jesus finished these parables, he moved on from there. Nazareth rejects Jesus.
And when he came to his hometown, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astounded and said: "Where does this man get this wisdom and these powers?"
Isn't this the son of the carpenter? Isn't his mother named Mary, and his brothers are James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? So where does he have all of these from?
And they would stumble over him. But Jesus said to them: "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house."
And there he did not create many forces due to their disbelief.
The beheading of John the Baptist
At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard about Jesus.
He said to his servants: "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! And therefore, powers are at work in him."
For Herod had seized John, bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother.
Because John was telling him: "You shall not have it."
And when he wanted to kill him, he feared the people, because they regarded him as a prophet.
Then, when Herod's birthday was celebrated, Herodias's daughter danced in the midst, and Herod was pleased.
Then he promised her on his oath that whatever she asked for, he would give her.
For she, having learned from her mother, said: "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist."
So the king seized the opportunity. But because of the oaths and those leaning on him, he ordered that it be given.
So he sent and beheaded John in prison.
He brought his head on a platter and handed it to the boy, who took it to his mother.
Then his disciples came forward, lifted the body, and buried him. Then they came and told Jesus. The feeding of the five thousand men.
When Jesus heard this, he withdrew by boat to a solitary place. The crowds heard about it and followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus went out, he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
When evening came, his disciples approached him and said, "The place is deserted, and the hour has already passed. Send the crowds away so they can go into the villages and buy themselves some food."
Jesus said to them, "They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat."
They said to him: "We have here only five loaves and two fish."
He said: "Bring her here to me."
Then He commanded the crowds to recline on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, blessed, broke them, and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.
Everyone ate and was satisfied. Then they lifted the leftover broken pieces, twelve full baskets.
And the eaters were about five thousand men, excluding women and children. The miracle of walking on water
And immediately Jesus compelled his disciples to enter the boat and to go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd.
And after the crowds dispersed, he ascended the mountain alone to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.
And as for the ship, it had become in the middle of the sea, battered by the waves, because the wind was contrary.
And in the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went to them walking on the sea.
When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, "It is a ghost." And they cried out in fear!
Immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying: "Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid."
Peter answered him and said, "Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water."
He said: "Come." So Peter stepped down from the boat and walked on the water to come to Jesus.
But when the wind became strong, he was afraid. As he began to drown, he shouted: "O Lord, save me!".
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand, caught him, and said, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
And when they entered the ship, the wind calmed down.
And those in the ship came and worshiped Him, saying: "Truly, You are the Son of God!"
When they crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.
The men of that place recognized him. They sent to all the surrounding villages and brought all the sick to him,
And they asked him to just touch the hem of his garment. So all who touched it received healing.
Purity and Impurity
Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem, saying:
Why do my students surpass the tradition of the teachers, for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread?
And he answered them: "And you also, why do you violate the commandment of God because of your tradition?"
Indeed, Allah commanded: Honor your father and mother; and whoever insults father or mother, let him die a death.
But you say: Whoever says to his father or mother, "It is a gift that benefits me from you," he does not honor his father or his mother.
You have nullified God's will because of your tradition!
O hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied about you:
This people come close to me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips, but their heart is far away from me.
And they worship Me in vain, while they know the teachings are the commandments of the people.
Then he called the assembly and said to them: "Listen and understand."
For what enters the mouth does not defile a person, but what comes out of the mouth, that defiles a person.
Then his disciples came and told him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?"
He replied and said: "Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted."
Leave them. They are blind leaders of the blind. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter answered him and said, "Explain to us this parable."
Jesus said: "Are you also still so dull?"
Don't you understand yet that everything that enters the mouth goes into the abdomen and is expelled through the exit?
And what comes out of the mouth originates from the heart, and that makes a person impure.
Because from the heart come evil thoughts: murder, adultery, fornication, theft, perjury, blasphemy.
This is what defiles a person. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a person." The faith of the Canaanite woman
Then Jesus left there and went to the regions of Tyre and Sidon.
And a Canaanite woman who was coming out from that region cried out to him, saying: "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely possessed."
He did not answer her a word. Then his students approached and asked him, saying: "Send her away, for she is crying out after us!"
He replied and said: "I have only been sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then she came and prostrated before him, saying: «O Lord, help me!»
And he answered and said: "It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
She said: "Yes, sir! And the dogs also eat from the scraps that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that hour. Feeding the four thousand men
Then Jesus went from there and came to the side of the Sea of Galilee, and went up on the mountain and sat there.
Then a great crowd came to him, including lame, blind, deaf, mute, and many others, and they laid them at Jesus' feet. And he healed them.
Until the crowds are amazed when they see the mute speaking, the deaf hearing, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.
And Jesus called his disciples and said: "I have compassion on the crowd, for they have been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."
His disciples said to him, "Where are we to buy bread so that these people may eat?"
Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They replied, "Seven, and a few small fish."
And the troops were commanded to lie down on the ground.
And took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to His disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowd.
Everyone ate and was satisfied. Then they lifted what remained of the broken pieces—seven baskets full.
And the eaters were four thousand men, excluding women and children.
Then the crowds dispersed, and he boarded the boat and came to the outskirts of Magdiel.
Request for a verse
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to him to test him, and they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
And he answered them and said: "If in the evening you say: clear, because the sky is reddened."
And in the morning: today is winter because the sky is reddened and frowning. O hypocrites! You know how to distinguish the face of the sky, but you cannot recognize the signs of the times!
A wicked, sinful generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet. Then He left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
And when his disciples came to the crossing, they forgot to take bread.
Jesus said to them: "Watch out and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
Then they thought to themselves, saying: "We have not taken any bread."
Then Jesus knew and said to them: "Why are you thinking to yourselves, you of little faith, that you have no bread?"
Even now, you do not understand? And do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you took?
And seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets did you take?
How do you not understand that I was not talking about bread? I told you to beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. Peter's confession of Christ
When Jesus came to the vicinity of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that I am, the Son of Man?"
They said: "The people: John the Baptist, and others: Elijah, and others: Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
He asked them, "And you, who do you say I am?"
Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!"
Jesus answered him, and said: "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
And I also say to you: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.
And I give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then he instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he is the Messiah. Jesus predicts his death and resurrection.
From that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and on the third day rise again.
Then Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you."
Then He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on God's interests, but man's."
Then Jesus said to his disciples: "If anyone wishes to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me."
For whoever wants to save their soul will lose it, and whoever loses their soul for My sake will find it.
For what does a person benefit if he gains the whole world and loses his soul? Or what can a person give in exchange for his soul?
For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his work.
Truly, I say to you: there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.
The Manifestation
And after six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain privately.
His appearance changed before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.
And Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with him.
Peter then said to Jesus: "Lord, it is good for us to be here! If you wish, we will make three tabernacles here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And as he was speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear him."
And when the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were very afraid.
Then Jesus came and touched them and said, "Rise, and do not be afraid."
They looked up and saw no one but Jesus alone.
And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus instructed them, saying: "Do not tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man is raised from the dead."
And his disciples asked him, saying: "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus answered them, and said: "Elijah will come first and restore all things."
But I tell you: Elijah has come, and they did not recognize him, but they did to him whatever they wanted. In the same way, the Son of Man will suffer at their hands.
Then the disciples understood that He was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Healing a boy possessed by a demon
And when they came to the gathering, a man who was kneeling before him approached.
And he said: "O sir, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic and suffers greatly, often falling into fire and water."
And I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.
Jesus answered and said: "O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him here to me!"
Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him. And the boy was healed from that hour.
Then the students approached Jesus privately and said, "Why couldn't we cast him out?"
Jesus said to them: "Because of your unbelief. Truly I tell you: if you had faith as small as a mustard seed, you would say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it would move; nothing would be impossible for you."
And this species can only be eliminated through prayer and fasting.
While they were hesitating in Galilee, Jesus said to them: "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of people."
He kills them, and on the third day He rises." They were very sorrowful. Temple tax
When they came to Capernaum, those who collected the two denarii approached Peter and said, "Does your teacher not pay the two denarii?"
He said: "Yes." When he entered the house, Jesus preceded him, saying: "What do you think, Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tax— from their children or from others?"
Peter said to him, "From the foreigners." Jesus said to him, "Then the sons are free."
But so that we do not disturb them, I went to the sea and cast a fishing line, and the first fish that comes up, take it. When it opens its mouth, you will find a curtain; take it and give it to them on my behalf and yours.
