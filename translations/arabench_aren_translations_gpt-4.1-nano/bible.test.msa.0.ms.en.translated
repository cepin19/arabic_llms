Who is the greatest
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him: "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Then Jesus called a child to him, and placed it among them.
And he said: "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And whoever accepts a child like this in My name accepts Me.» Warning of pitfalls
Whoever finds one of these little believers in me, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea to drown!
Woe to the world from these inevitable stumbling blocks, but woe to those who cause them!
Therefore, if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away! It is better to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire.
And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you! For it is better to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the fire of hell." The Prodigal Son
And Jesus said: "Beware not to despise one of my humble disciples. For I tell you, their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven."
For the Son of Man came to save the lost.
So what do you say about a man who has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray? Would he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountain and go to find the one that is lost?
I tell you the truth, when he finds it, he will be happier with it than with the ninety-nine sheep that did not stray.
Thus, your Father in heaven also does not want any of these little ones to perish. Be good to your brother.
If your brother sins against you, go to him privately and speak with him. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
But if he does not listen to you, take one or two others with you, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. #Witnesses or three. 16:18 Look at the book of Deuteronomy 19:15.
If he refuses to listen to them, tell the church. If he refuses to listen to the church, then you must treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. And whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
I tell you the truth, if two of you agree on any matter you pray for, my Father in heaven will grant it to them.
For where two or three gather in my name, I am there among them.» Unbounded forgiveness
Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus said to him: "Not just seven times, but seventy times, and each time seven times!" #Seventy... times. 22:18 That is, without limits.
Therefore, the kingdom of heaven can be likened to a king who decided to settle accounts with his servants.
When he began settling his accounts, a man who owed him a very large amount was brought to him. #a very large amount. 24:18 literally: "Ten thousand dinars or a hundredweight, which is equivalent to about 300,000 kilograms of coins used at that time."
And since he did not have anything to settle the debt, the gentleman decided to sell the debtor along with his wife, children, and everything he owned, and to use the proceeds to pay off the debt.
Then the servant knelt on his knees before the king, pleading with him and saying: "Be patient with me, and I will pay you all the debt."
The gentleman felt sorry for him, canceled the debt entirely, and let him go.
And as he was going, he found one of his slave companions, who owed him a small amount. He grabbed him by the neck, began to choke him, and said: "Pay what you owe me."
The servant prostrated himself on his knees before him, and begged him, saying: ‹Be patient with me, and I will pay what I owe.›
But he refused, instead taking him and throwing him into prison until he paid all his debt.
And when the other slaves saw what happened, they were very sad, and they went to tell their master everything that had happened.
So the lady called him and said: "O wicked servant, I have forgiven you all the debt you owed because you begged me."
Wasn't it your duty to have mercy on the servant, your companion, as you have had mercy on me too?
And his master was very angry, and handed him over to be punished until he paid all his debt.
In the same way, your Heavenly Father will treat you, unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart.
Unity in marriage
And after Jesus finished speaking about these matters, he left the region of Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
And a large crowd of people followed him, and he healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to Jesus trying to test Him, and they asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered: "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'In the beginning God made them male and female'? #created ... and female. 4:19 From the Book of Genesis 1:27, 5:2."
Then he said: ‹For this reason a man leaves his father and mother, and is united to his wife, so that the two become one flesh.› #leaves ... one. 5:19 from the Book of Genesis 2:24.
And thus they are no longer two, but one. Therefore, let no one separate what God has joined together.
They said to him: "Why then does Moses order that a wife be given a divorce certificate, #divorce certificate. 7:19 See Deuteronomy 24:1."
Jesus answered them: "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart; but from the beginning it was not so."
Therefore, I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery.
His disciples said to him: "If this is the case between a husband and wife, then it is better not to marry!"
Jesus said to them: "Not everyone can accept this teaching, only those to whom God gives the ability to do so."
There are men who cannot marry because they were born without the ability to marry. And there are men who cannot marry because people have deprived them of the ability to marry. And there are men who have chosen not to marry for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this teaching, let him accept it." Jesus welcomes the children
Then they brought children to Him so He could lay His hands on them and pray, but His disciples rebuked them.
Then Jesus said: "Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Then Jesus laid his hands on them, and left that place. The obstacle of wealth
A man came to Jesus and asked him: "Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?"
Jesus answered him, "Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only One who is good. But if you want to enter life, keep the commandments."
The man said: "What commandments?" Jesus said: "‘Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal.'"
Do not testify falsely, honor your father and your mother.› #Do not kill … your mother. 19:19 from the Book of Exodus 20:12-16, and the Book of Deuteronomy 5:16-20. And ‹love your neighbor as yourself.› #Love … yourself. 19:19 from the Book of Leviticus 19:18.
The young man said to him: "I obey all these commandments, so what more do I lack?"
Jesus said to him: "If you want to be perfect, go and sell all you have and give to the poor. Then you will have a treasure in heaven. Come, follow me."
When the young man heard that, he went away sad because he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples: "Truly I tell you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."
I tell you again that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.
When his disciples heard this, they were amazed and said, "Then who can be saved?"
Then Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Then Peter said to Him, "Look, we have left everything and followed You! What then will we have?"
Jesus said to them: "Truly I tell you, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne in the new age, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
And whoever leaves behind houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for My sake will receive a hundredfold, and will inherit eternal life with God forever.
Many are the first people who will become the last, and many are the last people who will become the first.
Like vineyard workers
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who owns land, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He agreed with the workers to pay them one dinar for each day, then sent them to work in his vineyard.
The owner of the vineyard went out around nine o'clock, and saw some men standing in the market area doing nothing.
He said to them: "Go also and work in my vineyard, and I will give you the wages you deserve."
So they went to work in Al-Karam. "He went out again around twelve o'clock and again at three o'clock, hiring other workers."
Around five o'clock, he went out again and found others standing in the market area. He asked them: ‹Why have you been standing all day without working?›
And they said to him: "No one has hired us." He said to them: "Go also and work in my vineyard."
At the end of the day, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward: "Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last ones hired and ending with the first."
Then those who had hired them came at the fifth hour, and each of them received a denarius.
Then those who had hired first came, thinking they would get more, so each of them also took a dinar.
They took her, and began to complain about the owner of the vineyard.
And they say: "Those who hired last, only worked for one hour, and I paid them the same as I paid us, even though we worked all day in the heat of the sun!"
The owner of the vineyard said to one of them: ‹I did not wrong you, my friend! Did you not agree with me to work for one dinar?
Take your reward and go. I want to give the one I hired at the end of the day the same wage I gave you.
Isn't it my right to do whatever I want with what I own? Or are you jealous because I am good with others?
Thus, the first shall be last, and the last shall be first. Jesus foretells His death and resurrection.
And while Jesus was on his way to the city of Jerusalem, he took the twelve aside and said to them:
Here we are going to the city of Jerusalem where the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and they will condemn him to death.
And they deliver him to the non-believers to mock him, beat him, and crucify him. But on the third day, he will rise from the dead.» The greatest is the one who serves
Then Zubayr's mother came to him with her two sons, and she prostrated herself to him to ask him for something.
Jesus said to her: "What do you want?" She said to him: "Promise that my two sons will sit in your kingdom, one at your right and the other at your left."
Jesus said: "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup #thecup. 22:20 the cup of suffering and pain. Also in verse 23. that I am going to drink?" They said to him, "Yes, we can."
He said to them: "As for my cup, you will drink it; but to sit at my right and at my left, I cannot grant it—these are for those for whom my Father has prepared them."
When the remaining ten heard this request, they were very annoyed with the two brothers.
Then Jesus called them to him and said: "You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over their people, and their officials exercise authority over them.
But this should not be among you; rather, whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant.
And whoever wants to be the first among you, let him be your servant.
Also, the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." Jesus heals the blind.
And while they were leaving the city of Jericho, a large crowd of people followed him.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted: "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us."
People reproached them and told them to be quiet, but they raised their voices even more: "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us."
Then Jesus stopped, called them, and said, "What do you want me to do for you?"
They said: "O Lord, open our eyes."
Jesus opened their eyes, touched them, and immediately they saw and followed him.
The king lives
And when they approached the city of Jerusalem and came to the village of Bethphage near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples.
He said to them: "Go to the village in front of you. You will find a small donkey tied with its mother; untie them and bring them to me."
And if anyone says something to you, say to him: "The Lord needs them, and He will return them soon."
This happened so that what the Prophet said would be fulfilled:
Tell the dear city of Zion: #Dear Zion. 5:21 Literally "the daughter of Zion." ‹Behold, your king is coming to you, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.›
The two students went and did as Jesus said.
Then they brought the little donkey and its mother, and placed their clothes on them; Jesus sat on the clothes.
Most people spread their rugs on the road. But others cut branches from the trees and laid them on the road.
And the crowds of people walking in front of him and behind him were shouting: "Long live the king! #Long live the king." 9:21 Literally: "Hosanna." It means in Hebrew: "Save now." Most likely, it is a shout of praise to God and His Messiah, the King. Repeated in verse 15. "Long live the son of David." ‹Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.› Long live the King in His highest.
And when Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was shaken. The people were asking, "Who is this man?"
And the crowds following him were saying, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus in the temple
Then Jesus entered the temple courtyard, and drove out all those who were selling and buying there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of the dove sellers.
He said to them: "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer' #MyHouse ... prayer. 13:21 From the Book of Isaiah 56:7. But you turn it into a 'den of thieves' #Den of thieves. 13:21 From the Book of Jeremiah 7:11."
And some blind and lame people came to him in the temple courtyard, and he healed them.
And the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the miracles he performed, and saw the children shouting in the temple courtyard: "Hosanna to the King! Hosanna to the Son of David," and they were very angry and said to him: "Do you hear what these children are saying?"
Jesus answered, "Yes, but have you never read in the Scriptures: 'Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies, you have perfected praise'?"
Then Jesus left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there. The power of faith
And as Jesus was going early in the morning to the city, he became hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the side of the road, so he approached it, but he found only its leaves. He said to it: "You will not bear fruit in the future." Immediately, the fig tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and asked him: "How did the fig tree wither like this?"
He answered them: "I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will be able to do what I did with the fig tree, and if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' your command will be fulfilled."
And whatever you ask for while you are praying, you will receive if you believe." Doubting the authority of Jesus
And Jesus went to the temple courtyard, and the chief priests and elders of the people came to him while he was teaching, and they said to him: "Tell us by what authority you do these things, and who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered them: «And I will also ask you; tell me, by what authority am I doing these things?»
Where did John’s baptism come from? From God or from people? » So they began to discuss it among themselves and said: «If we say it is from God, He will ask us: ‹Why did you not believe in Him?›
And if we say that she is among the people, we fear the people, because they all consider John a prophet.
Therefore they answered Jesus and said, "We do not know." Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." The parable of the two sons
And Jesus said: "What do you say about the following story: There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said to him: 'My son, go today and work in my vineyard.'"
The son replied: "I don't want to go." But he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to his other son and asked him the same thing. The son replied, "Yes, sir, I will go." But he did not go.
Which of the two sons did what the father wanted? » They said: «The first.» He said to them: «I tell you the truth, the tax collectors and the prostitutes will precede you into the kingdom of God.
For John the Baptist came to show you the way of truth, and you did not believe in him. But tax collectors and prostitutes believed in him. And even when you saw what they did, you did not repent and believe in him. Like the son of the vineyard owner.
And listen to another parable: There was a man who owned land, and he planted a vineyard, surrounded it with a wall, dug a winepress in it, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to some farmers and traveled far away.
And when the time came to harvest the grapes, he sent his servants to the farmers to get his share of the grapes.
But the farmers seized their slaves, beat one of them, killed another, and stoned another.
So the owner sent more servants than he did the first time. The farmers treated them in the same way.
Finally, he sent his son, and he said to himself: ‹They will respect my son.›
But when the farmers saw that this was the landowner's son, they conferred among themselves and said: "This is the heir; let us kill him so we can take his inheritance."
So they seized him, threw him outside the vineyard, and killed him.
So, what do you think the owner of the vineyard will do to those farmers when he returns?
They said to him: "He will punish them in a terrible way because they are wicked, then he will give the vineyard to other farmers who will give him the fruit in the harvest season."
Jesus said to them: "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone'? The Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes."
Therefore I say to you: the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation producing its fruit.
Everyone who falls on this stone will be broken, and anyone on whom the stone falls will be crushed!
And when the chief priests and Pharisees heard Jesus, they realized he was speaking about them.
So they tried to arrest him, but they were afraid of the people who considered Jesus a prophet.
Like a wedding feast
And Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who gave a wedding feast for his son.
And the king sent his servants to summon the invited guests to the wedding feast, but they refused to come.
Then the king sent other servants and said to them, "Tell those invited that the feast is ready. My oxen and fattened calves have been slaughtered, and everything is prepared. Come to the wedding feast."
But the guests did not care about the matter, and each of them went on his way. One went to work in his field, and another to his trade.
As for the others, they seized the king's slaves, beat them, and killed them.
Then the king was angry and sent his army, who killed those murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants: "The wedding feast is ready, but those invited did not deserve it."
Therefore, go to the street corners, and invite everyone you find to the wedding feast.
They went out into the streets and gathered everyone they found, whether wicked or righteous, until the banquet hall was filled with guests.
And when King Lear entered to see the guests, he saw a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
The king said to him: ‹O friend, how did you enter here without wearing wedding clothes?› But the man remained silent.
The king said to his servants: "Bind his legs and hands, and cast him out into the darkness, where people cry and gnash their teeth."
Because many claim, but only a few choose." The Pharisees try to trap Jesus
Then the Pharisees went out and conferred together on how they might catch Jesus in something he said.
So they sent their disciples to him along with some of the Herodians, and they said to him: "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth. And you do not regard anyone's status, for you do not look at people's positions."
Tell us your opinion, is it permissible to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said to them: "You hypocrites, why do you try to catch me?"
Show me the currency you use.» So they brought him a dinar.
He asked them: "To whom do this engraving and this inscribed name on the dinar belong?"
They said to him: "They belong to Caesar." He said to them: "Then give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
When they heard his response, they were very amazed, left him, and went on their way. The Sadducees try to trap Jesus.
On that day, some Sadducees came to him, those who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him:
O teacher, Moses said #Moses said. 24:22 See the Book of Deuteronomy 25:5, 6. If a man dies without leaving children, his brother must marry his widow and have a son who is considered the son of the deceased.
There were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died. Since he had no children, his brother married his widow.
And this happened to the brother, the second, the third, and even the seventh.
And after they all died, the woman also died.
Which of the seven will be the wife on the Day of Resurrection? For they have all married her.
Jesus answered them: "You are mistaken because you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God."
Understand that in eternal life after the resurrection of the dead, people do not marry or give in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
As for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God has said?
‹I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.› #I am … Jacob. 32:22 From the Book of Exodus 3:6. And God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
When people heard this speech, they were very amazed by his teaching. The greatest advice
And when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had answered the Sadducees, they gathered together.
A Sharia expert asked him, trying to trap him, and said:
Teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the law?
Jesus said to him: "‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind,’ #Love the Lord … your mind. 37:22 from the Book of Deuteronomy 6:5."
This is the first and greatest commandment,
The second commandment is like the first: "Love your neighbor as yourself." #Love your neighbor ... yourself. 39:22 From the Gospel of Luke 10:25-37, we understand that the one referred to as "neighbor" is every person in need of help.
The entire Sharia and the books of the prophets pertain to these two commandments.» Christ, Lord of David
And while the Pharisees were gathered around him, Jesus asked them:
What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he? The Pharisees answered him: "He is the son of David."
He said to them: "So how did David call him 'Lord' when he said, inspired by the Spirit:"
The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies Your footstool.
If David calls the Christ Lord, how can He be His Son?
No one was able to answer him anything, and after that, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
Jesus criticizes the clergy
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples
He said: "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees have inherited Moses in the interpretation of the law."
So keep and practice everything they tell you, but do not do their deeds. For they say, but do not do according to what they say.
They burden people with heavy loads, while they themselves are unwilling to make any effort to follow them.
All the good deeds they do are only to be seen by people. They display their piety, thus increasing the size of their headbands #headbands. 5:23 Some Jews used to write certain passages from the Holy Book and place them in small leather pouches, then tighten them with cloth headbands around the forehead or the left arm, thereby showing their extreme piety. They also lengthen the fringes of their garments.
They love to sit in the best seats at banquets and in the front seats at gatherings.
And they like people to greet them with special greetings in the markets, and to call them: "O Teacher."
But do not let people call you: "Teacher," for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
And do not let anyone on earth call you ‹Father,› for you have one Father, the Heavenly Father.
And do not let people call you ‹Sir,› for you have only one Lord, Christ.
The greatest among you should be your servant.
Whoever elevates himself, God will humble him; and whoever humbles himself, God will elevate him.
Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. Neither do you enter nor allow those who are trying to enter to go in.
Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law, hypocrites! For you exploit widows and rob their houses. And you pray long prayers to attract attention, so you will receive a harsher punishment.
Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law, hypocrites! For you travel across land and sea to make a single disciple, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.
Woe to you, blind guides, you who say: "If someone swears by the temple, he is not bound to keep his oath; but if he swears by the gold in the temple, he is bound to keep it!"
You fools! Which is greater: the gold in the temple, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
And you say: "He swore by the altar. He is not obliged to keep his oath, but if someone swears by the offering on the altar, then he is obliged to keep it!"
O blind one! Which is greater: the offering on the altar, or the altar that makes the offering holy?
Because if someone swears by the altar, he swears by it and everything on it.
And if someone swears by the Temple, he swears by it and by the One who dwells in it.
And if someone swears by the sky, he is swearing by the Throne of Allah and the one sitting upon it.
Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law, hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill, and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy, and
O blind guides, you lift the mosquito from your cup, but you swallow the camel!
Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.
You blind Pharisees, first clean the inside of the cup and dish, so that the outside also may become clean.
Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law, hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but are full of bones and all kinds of impurity on the inside.
So are you also, appearing righteous outwardly, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and evil.
Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law, hypocrites! For you build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you say: ‹If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have participated in killing the prophets.›
And with this, you confirm that you are the descendants of those who killed the prophets.
So complete what your ancestors began.
You serpents, you offspring of vipers! How will you escape the judgment of hell?
Therefore, I tell you that I will send you prophets, wise men, and teachers. Some of them you will kill, and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town.
Therefore, you will be held accountable for the blood of every innocent person killed on the earth: from the blood of Abel the innocent to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, #Abel … Zechariah. 35:23 The first and last to be killed according to the time and text of the Old Testament. (See Genesis 4:8 and 2 Chronicles 24:20) who was killed between the temple and the altar.
I tell you the truth, the punishment for all these crimes will fall upon this generation. Jesus warns the people of the city of Jerusalem.
O Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and persecute the messengers of Allah to you! I have often longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings! But you refused.
Behold, your house will be left to you empty and abandoned!
For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." #Blessed ... the Lord. 39:23 from Psalm 118:26.
Jesus prophesies the destruction of the temple
And Jesus left the temple area. As he was walking, his disciples came to him, because they wanted to show him the buildings of the temple.
Jesus said to them: "Do you see all these buildings? I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another; they will all be torn down!"
And while Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately and asked, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming and the end of the age?"
Jesus answered them: "Watch out so you are not deceived."
Many will come and impersonate my name, saying: "I am the Christ," and will deceive many.
You will hear news of wars and revolutions, so you should not be afraid. These things must happen, but they will not be the end of the world afterward.
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. Earthquakes and famines will occur.
But all of these will be the first pains of labor.
They will deliver you over to punishment, and will kill some of you. And you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.
At that time, many will abandon their faith, and one will hand another over to the authorities, and they will hate each other.
And many false prophets will appear and deceive many.
And due to increased evil, the love of many believers will grow cold.
But the one who remains faithful until the end, he will be saved.
And the proclamation of the kingdom of God will be announced throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, then the end will come.
So when you see "the abominable destroyer" #the abominable destroyer. 15:24 See the book of Daniel 9:27, 12:11, and also Matthew 11:31. Which the prophet Daniel pointed to, standing in the holy place – so that the reader may understand this statement –
Then let all those in the region of Judea flee to the mountains.
And the one on the roof does not come down to take his belongings from the house.
The worker in the field does not go home to take his cloak.
And how difficult the circumstances of pregnant and nursing women are during those days!
But pray that your escape does not happen in winter or on a Saturday.
For at that time there will be great distress such as has not been since the beginning of the world until now, and never will be.
And if Allah had not decreed the shortening of those days, no one would remain alive. But for His chosen people, Allah will shorten those days.
If anyone says to you: "Here is the Messiah," or "He is over there!" do not believe their words.
Because more false messiahs will appear, and more false prophets. They will perform miracles and wonders to deceive those whom God has chosen, if they can.
Here I have told you everything before it happened.
Someone might say: "Here is Christ in the wilderness," so do not go there. Or they might say: "Here he is in one of the rooms," so do not believe them.
For as lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
Wherever you find the corpse, you will also find the vultures.
And immediately after the distress that will occur in those days, ‹the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.›
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. The tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
And He will send His angels accompanied by the sound of a loud trumpet, gathering those He has chosen from the four directions, from the farthest sky to its utmost extent.
Learn from the fig tree. As soon as its branches become tender and its leaves appear, you know that summer is near.
Likewise, when you see all these things, you will know that the time #the time. 33:24 Compare with Luke 21:31. Near at the door.
I tell you the truth: this generation will not pass away until all these things happen.
The sky and the earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. Only the Father knows.
But no one knows when that day and hour will be, not the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father knows.
And as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating, drinking, marrying, and giving their daughters in marriage until the day Noah entered the ark.
They did not know what would happen until the flood came and took them. So will it be at the coming of the Son of Man.
At that time, two men are working in a field; one is taken and the other is left.
And there are two women grinding grains on a millstone; one is taken, and the other is left.
So, stay alert, because you do not know when your Lord will come.
Make sure that if the homeowner knew at what hour of the night the thief intended to come, he would wake up and not let him break into his house.
Therefore, be also ready, for the Son of Man will come at an hour you do not expect. The faithful servant and the wicked servant
So who is the faithful, perceptive servant whom the master appoints over his servants to give them their food at the proper time?
Congratulations to that servant who, when his master arrives, finds him performing his duty.
I tell you the truth, he will entrust him with all his possessions.
And the wicked servant says to himself: "My master will be late."
He begins by beating his servant companions, and starts eating and drinking with the drunkards.
Then the master of that servant comes on a day he does not expect, and at an hour he does not know.
He punishes him and places him with the hypocrites, where people cry and grind their teeth.
Like the ten girls
Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them are stupid, and five are smart.
The foolish ones took their lamps, but they did not take extra oil with them.
As for the smart ones, they took extra oil in their pitchers along with the lamps.
Then the groom was late, so all the girls fell asleep and dozed off.
But at midnight, someone shouted: "The groom is coming, go out to meet him."
Then the girls woke up and prepared their lamps.
The foolish women said to the wise women: "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are about to go out."
The intelligent women replied: "We cannot, for it is not enough for us. But go to the vendors to buy oil yourselves."
And while they were going to buy the oil, the groom arrived. The wise women were ready, so they entered the wedding feast with him. Then the door was closed.
Finally, the other girls came and said: "O sir, O sir, open the door for us."
But he said: ‹I tell you the truth, I do not know you!›
Therefore, stay alert, because you do not know the day or the hour when the Son of Man will come. Like the three servants
Similarly, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who was about to travel. He called his servants and entrusted them with his possessions.
So one of them was given five bags #five bags. 15:25 literally "weights or quintals," and the weight equals about 27 to 36 kilograms of gold, silver, or copper. of money, and the second was given two bags, and the third one bag. He gave each according to his ability. Then he traveled immediately afterward.
So the one who took the five bags began to invest them immediately in trade, thus earning five more bags.
And the one who took the two bags did the same as the first, and gained two more bags.
As for the one who took a single bag, he went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money there.
And after a long time, the master of these slaves returned and began to settle accounts with them.
Then the one who took the five bags came, earning five more bags, and said: ‹Sir, you gave me five bags, and I earned another five bags.›
His master said to him: "Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master."
Then the one who took the two bags came and said: ‹My lord, you gave me two bags, and these are two other bags I earned.›
His master said to him: "Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master."
Then the one who took a bag came and said: "O sir, I know you are a harsh man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter."
I was afraid of you, so I went and hid your bag in the ground. Take your money.
His master replied to him: "You wicked and lazy servant. As long as you know that I harvest where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered seed,"
Why didn't you deposit my money in the bank, and when I returned, I was taking my money with interest?
So take the bag from him, and give it to the owner of the ten bags.
For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance; but whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.
As for that useless servant, throw him outside into the darkness, where people cry and grind their teeth. The Son of Man is the judge.
And when the Son of Man comes in His glory with all His angels, He will sit on His glorious throne.
Then all nations will gather before Him. And He will separate some from others, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats in his flock.
The sheep will be placed to his right, and the goats to his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right: ‹Come, you who are blessed by my Father. Take the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.
For I was hungry, and you fed me. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you took me in.
I was naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and you took care of me. I was in prison, and you visited me.
The righteous reply: "O Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink?"
And whenever we saw you as a stranger, we sheltered you, or as naked, we clothed you?
And whenever we saw you sick or imprisoned, we visited you.
The king says: "Truly, I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."
Then the king will say to those on his left: "Depart from me, you cursed ones, and go to the eternal fire prepared for Satan and his angels."
For I was hungry and you did not feed me. I was thirsty and you did not give me drink.
I was a stranger, and you did not welcome me. I was naked, and you did not clothe me. I was sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.
The wicked answer: "O Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?"
The king says: "I tell you the truth, when you neglected to do that for one of my weak brothers, you actually neglected to do it for me."
And thus the wicked go to eternal punishment, while the righteous go to eternal life.
The leaders of the Jews are planning to kill Jesus
After Jesus finished this speech, he said to his disciples:
You know that Easter is the day after tomorrow, and the Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of his enemies to be crucified.
The chief priests and elders of the people had gathered in the house of the high priest Caiaphas.
And they plotted to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him.
And they used to say: "We should not do this during the festival, to avoid unrest among the people." A woman anoints Jesus with perfume.
And while Jesus was in the town of Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
A woman came to him, and she had a precious perfume in a marble bottle, which she poured over his head while he was eating.
And when his disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, "Why this waste?"
It was possible for this perfume to be sold for a large amount of money given to the poor.
Then Jesus knew what they were saying, and he said to them: "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a wonderful thing for me."
The poor will always be with you, #the poor ... always. 11:26 See Deuteronomy 15:11. But I will not always be with you.
I poured perfume on my body to prepare it for burial.
I tell you the truth: wherever this good news is proclaimed in the world, it will also be fulfilled by what this woman has done, so that everyone may remember her.» Judas Iscariot betrays Jesus
Then one of the Twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,
He said to them: "What will you give me if I deliver Jesus to you?" So they counted out thirty pieces of silver.
And from that moment, Judas began to look for a suitable opportunity to deliver Jesus to them. at the Passover table
On the first day of the unleavened bread festival, the disciples came to him and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?"
Jesus said: "Go to so-and-so in the village, and tell him: 'The Teacher says: My appointed time has come, and I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.'"
So the students did as Jesus told them and prepared the Passover meal.
And when evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with his twelve disciples.
And while they were eating, he said to them: "Truly, I tell you: one of you will betray me."
And they were saddened and began to ask him one after another: "Is it I, Lord?"
Jesus answered, "The one who dips his hand with me in the dish is the one who will betray me."
The Son of Man is going as it is written about him, but woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man. It would have been better for him if he had never been born!
So Judas, who was about to betray him, asked, "Is it I, Rabbi?" Jesus answered him, "You have said so." The Lord's Supper
And while they were eating, he took bread, blessed God, broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying: "Take, eat; this is my body."
Then he took a cup of wine, thanked, and gave it to them, saying: "Drink from this, all of you."
For this is my blood, the blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
And I tell you, I will not drink this wine again until that day when I drink it new in my Father's kingdom.
Then they recited some psalms and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus predicts Peter's denial.
Then Jesus said to them: "All of you will lose your faith in me tonight. For it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'"
But after I rise from the dead, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.
Peter replied: "Even if everyone else loses their faith in you, I cannot lose my faith in you."
Jesus said to him, "Truly I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
Peter said to him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you!" And all the disciples said the same. Jesus prays alone.
Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
And he took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him, and he began to feel sorrow and distress.
Then he said to them: "My sorrow is so great that it almost kills me! Stay here and keep watch with me."
And Jesus withdrew a little from them, knelt down and faced the ground, and began to pray: "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me #the cup. 39:26 That is, the cup of pain and suffering. Repeated in verse 42. But not as I will, but as You will."
He came to his disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
Stay awake and pray so that you do not fall into temptation. Your spirit is willing, but your body is weak.
And he stepped back again to pray, and said: "My father, if it is not possible for this cup to pass from me unless I drink it, your will be done."
Then he returned again and found them sleeping, because drowsiness was heavier than their eyes.
So he left them and went away a third time to pray, saying the same words he had said before.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them: "Are you still sleeping and resting? The hour has come, and the Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of sinners."
Let's go and let's go. The man who betrayed me has now approached. » The arrest of Jesus
While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared with a large crowd carrying swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and elders of the people.
The traitor had given them a sign and said: "The one I accept is the wanted man, so arrest him."
Then he approached Jesus and said to him: "I salute you, Teacher!" and kissed him.
Jesus said to him: "Friend, do what you came for." Then they approached, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
So one of those who were with Jesus reached out his hand, drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him: "Put your sword back in its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you not realize that I can call on the Father, and He will send me more than twelve legions of angels immediately?
But if I do, how will the books that announced these things happening like this be verified?
At that moment, Jesus said to the crowd: "Did you come out against me with swords and clubs as you would against a criminal? I was sitting every day in the temple courts teaching, and you did not seize me!
But this happened to fulfill what the prophets wrote.» Then all the disciples abandoned him and fled! Jesus before the Jewish leaders
Then, those who arrested him took him to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders gathered.
But Peter followed from a distance, and entered the courtyard of the high priest's house. He went in and sat with the guards to see what would happen in the end.
The chief priests and all the members of the Jewish council were seeking false testimony against Jesus to put him to death.
But they did not find, although many perjured witnesses came forward and lied about him. Finally, two men stepped forward.
They said: "This man #this man. 61:26 That is Jesus, for his enemies avoided mentioning his name! He said: ‹I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.›"
Then the high priest stood up and said, "Will you not defend yourself against all the accusations these two men are bringing against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him: "I charge you by the living God to tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
Jesus answered him, "Yes, I am he, as you say. And I tell you: From now on, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the throne of God, and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said: "You have blasphemed God. What further need do we have of witnesses? You have now heard his blasphemy against God."
What do you judge? » They answered him: «He deserves death.»
Then they spat in his face, punched him with their fists, and kicked him.
And they said to him: "Prophesy to us, Christ, who is it that struck you?" Peter denies Jesus
Meanwhile, Peter was sitting in the courtyard outside. A servant of the high priest came up to him and said, "You also were with Jesus of Galilee."
But Peter denied this in front of everyone and said: "I don't understand what you're saying!"
Then he went out to the gate of the courtyard, and another servant who was there said: "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
But Peter denied it again, and he swore, saying, "I do not know this man."
After a while, those standing there came to him and said: "You really are one of them; your accent reveals that you are from Jaleel."
Then he began to curse #curse. 74:26 That is, he swore by himself to curse if he was lying! And he swore and said: "I do not know this man." And immediately, the rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered the words Jesus had spoken to him: "You will deny me three times before the rooster crows," and he went out and wept bitterly.
Jesus before the governor Pilate
And the next morning, the chief priests and elders of the people gathered together and conferred to kill Jesus.
They arrested him, led him away, and handed him over to the governor Pilate. Judas kills himself.
When Judah, who betrayed Jesus, saw that they had decided to condemn Jesus to death, he regretted what he had done. He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He said to them: "You have made a mistake by handing over an innocent person to be killed." They replied to him: "What does this have to do with us? Deal with this matter yourself."
Then Judah threw the pieces of silver into the temple and left; he went away and hanged himself.
The chief priests took the coins and said, "It is not permitted to put this money into the temple treasury because it is the price of a human life."
So they decided to buy the Fakhari field with it to serve as a cemetery for strangers.
And for this reason, the field is known as the "Blood Field" to this day.
And thus was fulfilled what God said through the prophet Jeremiah: "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price agreed upon by the children of Israel to pay."
And they bought him the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." #They took ... the Lord. 10:27 See the Book of Zechariah 11:12-13, and the Book of Jeremiah 32:6-9. Jesus before Pilate
And Jesus stood before the governor, and he asked him: "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said: "It is as you say."
And when the high priests and elders complained about him, he did not say a word.
Then Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the many accusations they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus did not answer Pilate on any of the accusations brought against Him. Pilate was amazed at His silence. Pilate failed to release Jesus.
And the governor was accustomed during Easter to release a prisoner chosen by the people.
There was a prisoner known for his skin, named Barabbas. #Barabbas. 16:27 or "Jesus Barabbas" as in some Greek versions.
When the people gathered, Pilate said to them: "Whom do you want me to release for you: Jesus called the Messiah, or Barabbas?"
Pilate knew that they handed Jesus over to him out of envy.
While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message saying: "Do not do any harm to this innocent man, for I have been troubled all night because of a dream concerning him."
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
The governor said: "Which one of the two do you want me to release to you?" They said: "Barabbas."
Pilate asked them: "What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ?" They all answered: "Let him be crucified."
Pilate said to them, "Why? What has he done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify him."
When Pilate saw that his efforts were useless and that chaos had already begun, he took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying: "I am not responsible for the death of this man; it is your responsibility."
All the people said: "His blood be on us and on our children."
Then Pilate released Barabbas to them, and ordered that Jesus be scourged and handed over to be crucified. The soldiers mock Jesus.
Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus to the governor's palace, and a battalion of guards gathered around him.
So they stripped him of his clothes and clothed him in a crimson robe. #Clothe him... the color. 28:27 Or purple, as a mockery of him; this is the color of kings' robes.
And they argued with him, placing a crown of thorny branches on his head, and put a reed in his right hand, and they knelt before him mockingly, saying: "Long live the King of the Jews!"
Then they spat on him, took the cane from his hand, and began hitting him on the head.
When they finished mocking him, they took off his cloak, put his clothes back on him, and led him out to be crucified. Jesus on the cross
When they went out, they found a man from the city of Cyrene named Simon, and they compelled him to carry the cross.
And when they arrived at a place known as "Al-Jaljitha," meaning "the place of the skull,"
They gave Jesus wine mixed with a bitter substance to drink. When he tasted it, he refused to drink.
And when they had crucified Jesus, they divided his garments among them, casting lots.
Then they sat there guarding him.
They hung a sign above his head that read: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews," as his accusation.
They were crucified with Jesus, one on his right and the other on his left.
And the passersby cursed him and shook their heads.
And they say: "You who will tear down the temple and rebuild it in three days, if you are the Son of God, save yourself, and come down from the cross!"
And the high priests, the scribes, and the elders mocked him and said:
He has saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of the Children of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him!
He placed his trust in God; may God save him now if he truly wishes. Did he not say: "I am the Son of God"?
And the two criminals crucified with him were also insulting him with similar words. The death of Jesus
And from twelve noon, darkness covered the whole earth until three in the afternoon.
Around three o'clock, Jesus cried out in a loud voice and said: "Eli, Eli, why have you forsaken me?" #Eli ... forsaken me. 46:27 from Psalm 22:1. Meaning: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
When some of those standing there heard him, they said, "He is calling Elijah!" #Calling Elijah. 47:27 The word "Eli" in Hebrew and "Eilo" in Aramaic resembles the name "Eliyah," which is the name of a well-known prophet who lived around 850 BC.
Then one of the bystanders there quickly took a sponge, dipped it in vinegar, placed it on a long reed, and offered it to him to drink.
The others, however, would say: "Let's wait and see if Elijah will come to save him!"
Then Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and gave up His spirit.
And the veil of the temple was torn in two #veil of the temple. 51:27 The veil that separated the Holy of Holies from the rest of the Jewish temple. The Holy of Holies represented the divine presence. It was torn in two from top to bottom, the earth shook, and the rocks were split.
And the graves were opened, and many of the holy believers who had died arose.
And after Jesus had died, those bodies came out of the graves, entered the holy city, and appeared to many.
As for the Roman officer, #Roman officer. 54:27 Literally "Commander of a hundred." And the guards who were guarding Jesus' body, when they saw the earthquake and other events, were very afraid and said: "This truly was the Son of God!"
And there were women standing and watching from a distance, and they had followed Jesus from Galilee to serve Him.
Among them are Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and also the mother of the sons of Zebedee. #Sons of Zebedee. 56:27 James and John. Jesus was buried
And when evening came, a wealthy man named Joseph, from the town of Ramah, came to Jerusalem. He was also a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a new linen cloth.
Then he placed him in his new grave that he had dug in the rock, rolled a large stone over the entrance of the grave, and left.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. Guarding Jesus' tomb
The next day, after Friday had ended, the chief priests and Pharisees gathered with Pilate.
And they said to him: "Sir, we remember that this deceiver said before he died: 'I will rise from the dead after three days.'"
He issued an order to guard the tomb until the third day, so that his disciples would not come and steal the body and then say to the people: "He has risen from the dead." This falsehood would be worse than the first deception.
Pilate said to them, "Take a guard of soldiers, go and verify everything to your knowledge."
They went and secured the grave. They placed a seal on the stone and stationed guards of soldiers around it.
Resurrection of Jesus
And after the end of Saturday, the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to the tomb.
At that moment, a strong earthquake occurred, for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, went to the tomb, rolled away the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
And his appearance was as bright as lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow.
The guards were very afraid of him and became like the dead.
And the angel said to the women: "Do not be afraid, I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
He is not here; he has risen from the dead as he said before. Come, see the place where he was.
Then go quickly and tell his disciples: He has risen from the dead, and he will go ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him. Now I have told you.
Then the two women quickly left the tomb, their fear mixed with great joy, and they ran to tell Jesus' disciples what had happened.
Suddenly, Jesus met them and said, "Peace." They approached him, grasped his feet, and worshiped him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and they will see me there." The false report
And while the two women were on their way, some guards went to the city and told the high priests everything that had happened.
The high priests and elders gathered, conferred among themselves, and then gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
And they said to them: "Spread among the people that the disciples of Jesus came at night and stole his body while you were asleep."
And if this news reaches the governor, we will persuade him and keep you safe.
The soldiers took the money and did as they were told. And so this story spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus speaks to His disciples.
The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
And when they saw him, they prostrated to him, although some of them had doubts.
Then Jesus approached them and said: "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
And teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. Remember that I will be with you always, until the end of the age.
John the Baptist
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the Book of the Prophet Isaiah: "Behold, I send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way."
A human voice crying out in the wilderness, saying: "Prepare the way for the Lord. Make straight paths for Him."
John the Baptist came baptizing in the wilderness and calling people to repentance as a sign of their forgiveness of sins.
And all the inhabitants of the villages of the Judea region and the city of Jerusalem went out to him. He would baptize them in the Jordan River after they confessed their sins.
His clothes were made of camel hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
And he would declare and say: "After me will come a man greater than I, and I am not worthy to bend down and untie his sandal."
I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Baptism of Jesus
In those days, Jesus came from the town of Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
And at the moment he emerged from the water, he saw the heavens open, and he saw the Holy Spirit descending upon him in the form of a dove.
And a voice came from heaven: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." The temptation of Jesus
And the Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness alone.
And he remained there for forty days facing the temptations of Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels ministered to him. Jesus chooses some of his disciples.
After John was arrested, Jesus went to Galilee and began to proclaim the good news of God.
And he says: "The time has come, and the kingdom of God is near; repent and believe in this gospel."
And while he was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
So they immediately left their window and followed him.
Then he walked a little further and saw Jacob son of Zebedee and his brother John in their boat preparing the nets.
Jesus called them, and they left their father Zabdī in the boat with the workers and followed him. Jesus casts out an evil spirit.
Then they went to Capernaum, and Jesus entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach.
They were amazed by his teaching, because he taught them as one with authority, not like my teachers of the Sharia.
And there was in the assembly a man with an unclean spirit. And the spirit cried out:
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are; you are the Holy One of God.
Jesus rebuked him and said, "Be silent and come out of him!"
Then the impure spirit entered the man in a fit of convulsions, then he let out a loud scream and came out of him.
Everyone was amazed, and they began to say to one another: "What is this new teaching? For he commands unclean spirits with authority, and they obey him."
News about him spread quickly throughout the Galilee region. Jesus heals many.
Then they left the compound and went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
And Siman's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
He approached her, took her hand, and seated her. She left the fever behind and began to serve them.
That evening, at sunset, they brought to him many patients, including those possessed by evil spirits.
The entire town's residents gathered at the house's door.
Jesus healed many who were suffering from various diseases, and cast out many evil spirits. But Jesus did not allow the spirits to speak because they knew who he was. Preparing to proclaim the gospel
Early in the morning, before sunrise, Jesus went out alone to a secluded place to pray.
Then Simon and those who were with him went out to search for him.
And when they found him, they said to him: "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered them, "Let us go to the nearby villages so I may preach there also; for this is why I came."
He went throughout the entire region of Galilee, preaching in the synagogues of the Jews, and casting out evil spirits. Jesus heals a leper.
A leper came to Jesus, knelt down and begged Him, saying: "If You are willing, You can make me clean."
Jesus stretched out his hand, touched him, and said, "Yes, I want to; be clean."
The leprosy left the man, and he became pure.
Then Jesus warned him strongly before dismissing him.
He said to him: "Do not tell anyone what happened to you, but go and show yourself to the priest, #go ... to the priest. 44:1 The priest is the one who determines according to the law when a leper is considered clean. And he offered a sacrifice for your cleansing as commanded by Moses, #as commanded by Moses. 44:1 See Leviticus 14:1-32. So that people will know that you are healed."
But the man went out and began to spread the news of his healing everywhere, so it became difficult for Jesus to enter any city openly; instead, he stayed in remote places, and people came to him from all over.
Jesus heals a crippled person
After several days, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and news of his return spread.
Many people gathered together so that there was no room left, not even outside the door. Jesus was speaking to the people about the word of God.
They came to him with a paralyzed man carried by four men.
But they were unable to bring him to Jesus because of the crowd. So they tore the roof above the place where Jesus was, opened the roof, and lowered the bed on which the paralytic was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Some of the scholars of Shariah were sitting there, and they began to think to themselves:
Why does this man speak in this way? He insults God with his words! Who else but God alone can forgive sins?
Jesus knew their thoughts, and he said to them: "Why are you thinking this in your hearts?"
Which is easier: to tell the paralyzed person, "Your sins are forgiven," or to tell him, "Get up, carry your bed, and walk"?
But I will show you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." And he said to the paralyzed man:
I tell you, get up, take your bed, and go to your house!
He got up, immediately carried his bed, and walked in front of everyone. Everyone was amazed and praised God, saying: "We have never seen anything like this before!" Levi (Matthew) follows Jesus
And Jesus returned again to the lake. He was teaching the crowds that followed him there.
And as he was walking, Levi saw sitting at the tax collection place. He said to him: "Follow me!" So he got up and followed him.
And while Jesus was sitting at the house of Levi, eating dinner, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples. For there were many who had followed Jesus when he called Levi, and they followed him.
When the Pharisees and the teachers of the law saw him eating with tax collectors and sinners, they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard them, he said to them: "Those who are healthy do not need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners." A question about fasting
It was the time of fasting among John’s disciples and the Pharisees, so some people came to Jesus and asked him: "Why do John’s disciples and the Pharisees’ disciples fast, but your disciples do not?"
Jesus said to them: "Can the wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast.

And no one puts new wine into old leather bottles, because the wine will tear the leather bottles, causing the wine to spill and the bottles to be damaged. Therefore, new wine is put into new leather bottles." Jesus: Lord of the Sabbath
One Saturday, Jesus was passing through some fields, and his disciples began to pluck the heads of grain as they walked with him.
The Pharisees said to Jesus: "Look! Your disciples are doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath!"
He said to them: "Have you never read in the Scripture what David did when he was hungry and in need, he and those with him?"

And so, the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.

Then he said to them: "Is it permissible to do good or harm on the Sabbath? Is it permissible to save a life or to kill?" They remained silent.
Then Jesus looked around at them in anger and grief at their hardness of heart. He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand," and he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
The Pharisees went out and began to conspire with Herod's followers to find a way to kill Jesus. Many were following Jesus.
And Jesus went with his disciples to the Sea of Galilee, followed by a large crowd from Galilee and Judea as well.
From Jerusalem, Adummim, and the east of the Jordan River, and the areas surrounding Tyre and Sidon, they were a large gathering. They all came to him because of what they had heard about his deeds.

And the impure spirits would fall before him and cry out: "You are the Son of God!"

And Judas Iscariot who betrayed him. Jesus' power from God and Jesus returned to the house.
People gathered around him and his disciples again, so much so that they didn't even find time to eat.

As for the teachers of the law who came from Jerusalem, they were saying: "He is possessed by Beelzebul, #Beelzebul. 22:3 One of the names of Satan. And he casts out evil spirits by the power of the prince of demons."
