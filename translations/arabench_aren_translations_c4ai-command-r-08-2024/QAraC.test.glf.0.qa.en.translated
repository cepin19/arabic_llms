If you don't want it, I do.
Hey Sultan, what are you talking about?
It's a shame on you, an opportunity, an opportunity that came to us, we let it slip away from us, it's a shame.
I'm not being a child about this topic. I have the right to take [something], and you actually have the right to take it before me.
Sultan, for God's sake, don't bring any trouble our way.
Saleh, don't be like that. Astaghfirullah.
By your life, is there a brother who would advise his brother with what you're telling him?
Are you hungry?
I found a tray in front of you with bread and meat on it.
She has no one to turn to, no protector, and no one to rely on.
Speak the truth to yourself.
This Chinese dish won't be served in front of us again.
Don't be a fool, Saleh.
I don't want to miss this opportunity.
La la la, don't even try, it's impossible, absolutely impossible, I'm not the one to do such a thing.
Problem is he's afraid.
I fear what tomorrow may bring.
This is a government project where everyone takes and sucks.
This is a rule.
Now, people who have no involvement in the projects are taking [something].
He is the head of a major project committee.
Why her specifically? He has all the resources and control.
Global Beaches Project of the Third Millennium (Infrastructure Phase One)
The bull charged at him.
This is the one with the extractor fan.
If he's taking it.
What business do you have?
You have no right to take from their project.
When his car was broken.
I wasn't the one who used to guide him to the project site.
No, if that's the case, you're absolutely right.
Whoever gives you the right to fill up your car with petrol four times and five times.
Let it be on me.
Don't be a stubborn monkey and dig your heels in.
Reach out and grab it.
# The Hole of Thursday, Your Aunt's Real One
Now, as they say, they call you a millionaire.
One third of the amount is the legal right.
One third is commission.
He who dances to the popular band's music.
They say we're throwing a party for the state.
We bought our mother a fan.
What have they all done?
We put the page down.
There's no hope, my aunt.
Allah will guide him, God willing.
He eats it with him.
Last night, all night long, I tried with him.
This is an opportunity.
May goodness prevail.
May goodness prevail, God willing.
This is a well-known fact.
Let's keep this matter between us.
Get out!
I'll be needing some recommendations.
Just us mates.
A problem that can choke us like a bone in the throat.
The real began until
I'm with him today.
I wake up at 6 am.
He began to convince himself.
I'll be with him shortly; we have a meeting.
We need to work on it together, you and I, properly.
He who cuts off our livelihood.
They started the meeting with their heads full of hope.
My brother Ali, my brother Osman.
I have no idea.
I started work today.
No problem.
How can it not happen?
Sure, but are you sure I'll get it?
Now, I'm asking you.
Are you hungry and walking down the street?
Are you eating or not?
I'm a foodie at heart.
What you need to do
# الصينية عودة # Chinese Comeback
We are still on the first item on the agenda.
If you're okay.
If you have any concerns.
I just want to know.
I and you guys are from the project.
May God guide you, Saleh.
You might be because it's your first time participating as a committee chair in a government project.
"This is simple, brother."
We get what is destined for us.
Within the project budget
How else, then?
So no one catches on.
We put a clause for the amount on the same day.
This amount has been deducted.
I am already working on the project.
It's not possible.
No, no, no, Saleh.
Do you know the basics?
I'm afraid, there's a bit of fear inside you.
This is his right, of course.
In the first place and in the last.
Everything is in our hands.
You're so attractive.
What's wrong with you? In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. What's wrong with you?
The new car's clutch, I believed my friend.
Ah, he's saying.
The car is fine, just great.
In a prime location
He who has money has a way.
I told you so, didn't anyone else say that or did you hear it?
He who bought the land and registered it under his name.
He said, "Please."
He now has the money in his hand.
He's getting attractive now, really.
We are friends.
Alright then.
Our religion is rational.
We exit through the eastern gate.
He wants to eat alone.
Don't shake your head.
Or else, your brother.
Come here, sit down, and you'll get nothing but kindness. Come.
I sat with him all night.
He told him that it doesn't matter who it is, he deserves it.
I softened him up until he agreed.
Oh, this is supposed to be
God willing, you won't get it all at once.
This is the Millennium Beach project.
(infrastructure)
They then proceed to the second stage.
You keep going with him.
Thank you so much, may God reward you, you didn't fall short.
"Lucky he agreed to it."
You're no better than anyone else.
There's nothing wrong with it.
I hope I convinced him.
We want a percentage.
They all agree on that.
He even said it after he agreed.
They seem to be blocking a quarter of them so that they can't attend the budget-setting meeting for the project.
They are permissible and we must follow them.
They're certain about it.
Submit it as soon as possible so it can be approved.
Take your time.
Who is this guy? Do you know him?
This becomes my wife's brother, he's a partner with me.
This means that.
Do you have doors, windows, and all the finishing touches?
Sweet, sweet.
How much is enough for you so we can be done?
You set a limit for yourself.
We take something.
Let's give ourselves a week to think about it.
We determine the amount we're taking.
We have people waiting and wanting.
Abdulaziz's words are just.
I'll take half a million for my soul.
He calms himself down this week.
He determines the amount he wants.
They have decided, thought, and determined.
What's up, man?
Boy, do as you wish.
You don't have to, you don't have to care about them.
She's a companion. What are you? What's wrong with him?
I have no idea why God has stuck her with us.
Hey, what are you doing here in this project?
This is a government project.
My brother's name is Sultan.
This is my neighbor's door.
We kept driving until the car broke down.
Please write it down for me.
# **Contract of Abdullah**
Lala has three others after him.
What do I do with it, I'm tired of it.
I'll tell him, but let's get our budget sorted out and finished.
No, no, this is a lump sum.
I'm not sure what you mean by "وجم احط له." Could you please provide some context or clarify the meaning of this phrase? I'll be happy to assist with the translation once I understand the intended meaning.
Poor fellow, he has children to support.
He has Zaydi beliefs, let him be twenty-five and a quarter percent.
One-fourth illiterate.
They are all so sticky.
How many people are you going to distribute this to?
He came back.
The good mother is mentioned with praise.
Yes, Mom.
I'll never do it again, dad, I promise!
No, dad, you don't want to go to Thailand for treatment.
Moment by moment, what's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you? Why are you making it so difficult?
You're still in the first stage (infrastructure).
# Used Bikes
Add three thousand to that.
Buy me watches from Thailand, the ones with the whole dial sparkling like this.
I recorded it.
I am the Imam.
Mom, I already saved it, I just wanted to confirm the name with you.
My love, I tell you, I'm scared.
Uncover the tray.
We must set a budget, it can't be open-ended like this.
Tomorrow we'll have a meeting and everyone will state the amount they have in mind.
No problem!
One million is enough.
My love, so much.
Hey, everyone, hold on a second! What's all this noise? Give us a chance, please!
Committee members are now discussing the adoption of the project budget. The topic of funding is now closed.
I tend to overthink.
We told you to keep quiet about the scandal; you're sitting right in the ministry's courtyard.
Oh no, don't shout, don't embarrass us.
Hey, what's going on? Why are you all gathered here?
We turned on the electricity, it's sparking, and there's a short circuit.
You are causing confusion in the ministry's courtyard.
Come on, bring it! Come on, bring it!
Cut, did you hear?
Hey man, how long were you with them? What was the budget you reached?
I am nothing without my brother.
With the project, all of us, all fifty million of us.
This is the first stage, just fifty million.
How much was the amount?
Hey, Saleh.
Oh, Real, the keeper of honor, Salim.
In general, enjoy your meal.
Come on, calm down and let's get to work. All the beneficiaries are waiting for us, you know.
It's not a problem, but the most important thing is that we don't want any discussions. They should just approve the budget and be done with it.
We start implementing the project tomorrow.
He serves a very large segment of society.
This, may God protect you, is the Global Beaches Project for the Third Millennium.
This, God protect you, is the first stage.
(infrastructure)
This project is for the generations to come.
Of course, on behalf of the program's family, I'd like to congratulate you and also extend my blessings on the opening of the project, which I believe will take place tomorrow, God willing.
It took a million and a half years to complete the work.
One and a half years.
Once again, of course, in the name of the Future Tenders Program.
This is the project.
For the generations to come.
May God continue to bestow upon us the blessings of oil.
Second, third, and tenth stages.
In the presence of a delegate.
Welcome.
We're waiting here, when will the cars come to take us?
Where are you going, my dear? What's wrong?
Alhamdulillah, Rabb al-'Alamin. You've grown old and senile.
We sat in the sun and died from the heat.
Girl, listen.
I don't see anything.
I stand before the sea.
Why Sherlock?
Eman told me that your sister, Munira, is doing well.
My father's story in the desert.
I said, "Be fair, then. See who lied to her and gave her false information."
This is the land I seek.
When one sees a farm in the countryside, they think, "This must be my father's."
Then what's with all this talk?
Do you have any brothers?
They work hard, praise be to God, invest in land, and put effort into real estate and businesses.
I am the head of the department.
Ava, oh Iman.
And then my sister.
How do you mean you don't know?
They'll give it to me whether they like it or not.
Hathaleen akhwanj.
There's nothing better than honesty.
Because of the money.
We started to believe that we had to take her to the hospital.
It's been years now in court with her brothers.
It's been nineteen years, maybe more.
No more.
Brothers of this year, they are thieves.
He returned yesterday and told me.
Dad, just build me a mosque before I die.
Do you have any idea?
I'm not saying that your brothers are like that, God forbid.
Now that my father has passed, how many years?
Why now, you come to ask?
I saw the farm.
What do you want?
Every three months, he goes to check on her.
Falcon, let's figure out what's going on.
I don't feel like it.
We've changed, by God, our sisters won't see a cent.
The solution is with me.
Where from?
I can't make any sense of the text you provided. Could you please clarify or provide additional context?
Monira Šahović
I surrender, just look at him.
I became fifty thousand.
I dared to ask for my father's land in the desert.
I'm sure my right is more than this.
Each one of them lives in that villa.
Their children are in the best schools.
Vertical, Monira.
I am not staying silent about my rights.
I'll take my share.
We invest our money in the company, it's better this way, I don't want to.
All F in the second head.
Mercy has died in people's hearts.
Don't say they're like the Muslim Brotherhood, they'll turn out better than my brothers.
Giovani, it's me.
Twelve years old.
I'm struggling in these courts.
In the end.
If I take, I take neither right nor wrong.
Okay, why do they do that?
I tell you, mother, control them.
Take them gently.
WeBuildTogether
Okay, so why do courts take so many years?
We are all four hundred thousand.
We could reach millions like the rest of the countries.
"I don't think the verdict will be out anytime soon, Mom, I really don't."
Jovie, you are my siblings.
I swear, Mom, I don't want anything.
Oh my god, what do I say?
I don't say a word. According to the oppressor, God is sufficient, and He is the best disposer of affairs.
"We put our trust in God, the ever sufficient."
I had a court appointment last week.
I'm coming, mom!
Write a memo, the judge said.
This is us, mom, from one memo to another.
They're investing millions, Mom, and you're just watching.

She's fifty-two, it's too much for her husband to handle.
Do you want me to translate this, or will you bang your head against the wall?
What made her talk now?
But greed.
No paradise is my fate.
My dad left me a will, you can take what you want or not, it's up to you.
I nor he can be defined.
This is God's command.
Why are they tormenting my father in his grave?
I expected my brothers to act like this.
"Money can't buy you happiness."
She's been working for thirty forty years.
I don't know how to act, Nasser.
# Lands, Buildings, and Properties: Easy to Identify
I have no idea how much they earn.
Even the company.
You have every right to go and find out everything.
I'm not interested.
How do you go back to them?

You can't do whatever you want. I have the right to know everything.

At your service, your honor.
Come on, all of you, follow me!
Sure, here's the translation: "If you don't mind, let's go."
Don't let him catch us on anything.
I'll definitely complain right now.
He said you beat him up.
I'll let him do as he pleases.
He holds an official document.
Formal, we can't prevent it.
He has the right to know everything.
If the budget and accounts are dry.
We give her forty thousand every three months.
If you skim the budget and scrutinize it thoroughly.
Multiply twelve by eight.
Zayn divided it into three parts.
Thirty-two
Do you know how much it costs?
This is what I'm asking for.
This is a whole different story if one is aware of the lands and projects.
We're doing well.
We're not afraid of anything, we're not afraid.
If they want it, welcome. If they don't, this is what we have.
He should act with her.
They give their sisters small amounts to live on.
Married woman.
Her husband provides for her.
What do you want with the money?
Hey, man, this is the right talk!
At your service, sir.
Let him be.
Even my office.
My brother Rashid, so you mean that was the plan from the beginning?
At your service.
File by file.
When I discovered my true inheritance.
I don't own any villas or lands that I'm unaware of.
They came out seven.

Stick with them.
"Please, father, don't even mention the court. May the souls of your parents rest in peace."

He can influence them.
God willing, he can.

Courts see nothing but memos behind them.
Delays, and lawyers slaughtering me with their fees.

You don't take a single riyal from them.
May God have mercy on her, the mother of Salmins.
She told me the day before she died.
She said, "Bear it and go to the courts."
Tell me about our courts.
She died without taking a penny from her inheritance.
She died, and the case is still with the judge.
How would it be if we were like the other countries?
Hello Abdullah.

# Family and Brotherhood
Brother Rashid
You're like my brother.
I don't want problems, money, and [untranslatable].
Do you have another topic to discuss besides your sister's topic?
You, please.
Why did you shut him up?
He's right.
They begrudge me the fruits of my father's labor.
Yesterday my mother told me that my sister-in-law is happy.
Her father is a correspondent at the ministry.
It's all thanks to my father's hard work and earnings.
We've endured all this.
Let's see this last attempt.
I sent your friend Abdullah to them.
They disrespected him, so they were rude to him and he kicked them out.
Let's see what the cleric Abdulrahman will do with them.
Absolutely kind.
He said, "God willing, Nasser."
May your eye be blessed.
Threaten them with a lawsuit.
Did you forget the late Umm Salmeen and her pilgrimage regarding the courts?
# Brothers Am Salmeen, it's normal for them to go to court.
Just hold on, brothers.
They might be scared of what people say.
They might say it's shameful to go to court; what will people say about us?
Let's see the preacher Abdulrahman, what are you going to do?
May Allah welcome you and make you feel at home.

Why postpone it for later, until tomorrow?
Then I decide, not you.
I'm gonna be honest with you, mate, I've got no idea what you're on about.
Hey, my brother Rashid.
Take my word for it.
I've told you before.
I'll threaten them with a lawsuit.
Now he's begging me to postpone my departure.
Because they saw the truth, my love.
It's necessary to go to your sister Manar's place.
What is this?

Goodbye.
He came back today for dinner at my sister's house.
Oh, the ministry approved his project for Abu Walid.
You're flying with joy, can't believe it.
They said they'll rely on my project, dinner's on me.
Oh my god, thank God, it's my destiny, it's happening all at once.
Oh my, Abu Walid, your joy knows no bounds now!
Who can match him?
My sister, tell me, yesterday he couldn't sleep from happiness.
Praise be to God, oh Manal.
I don't know anything about these things, but God has blessed me with good people.
Inshallah, tell it to your dad.
Forgive us, it's beyond our means.
We're going to Qusur, Abu Walid.
May God keep you safe, Abu Walid. You didn't fall short.
May God bless you with abundance and prosperity, and may your goodness and generosity thrive, God willing.
Good cook, indeed, oh Yam Walid.
Now, get yourself a good accountant and a secretary to organize your work.
They told me, just rent the office and leave the rest to us.
My pleasure, sir.
Oh, my love, my precious one.
Daddy, I want a BlackBerry.
We want to build a big house.
Take a look at her reaction.
Dad, we agreed today that you'd get a word after dinner.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to introduce the project owner, Abu Walid. Please, Abu Walid, you may take the stage.
Forgive us, please.
Congratulations, congratulations, Abu Walid!
You deserve it, you deserve it, may God bless you, you deserve it.
You really have no business in business and trade.
Real, this project has a story, my friends.
How are you?
Take a look, that's how it is, praise be to God.
That year.
One day, the Japanese national team will play against us.
I am in Souk Waqif.
I have no idea about him.
# Catalog for the Multi-Hall Factory The ministry has requested that we submit this catalog to them.
Any contractor will build it for you.
What is understood.
# **Contractor**
Those Japanese guys are not a joke.
Shut up already about the damn computer.
I want to go to the cinema.
I wanted a kitchen, so I bought a kitchen.
I told you when I submitted the catalog to the ministry's committee.
Zayn, how is your agreement with the factory going?
I paid them an amount.
"مقدم" means "introduction" or "foreword".
The most important thing is to communicate with the factory.
I signed it, thank God.
Give me some time, I'll place my first order later.
I'm waiting, then.
Adopt it correctly.
We're just waiting for Abu Fahd's signature.
Hey, what's up, secretary?
He said to me, "Abu Fahd didn't show up for work."
I'll get you some tea.
Hey, Abu Walid, tell me, have you done it?
The problem with Abu Fahd is that you can't predict him; he might come, and he might not.
Today is here.
He doesn't have time.
Okay, come here now.
You're the boss here.
I wish Abu Fahd would kill me.
He is the one who has to sign.
My desk is piled high with all these files, and I need Fahad's signature.
The solution means...
May God help you.
It's two fifteen, Abu Walid.
The shift is over.
I doubt that Bu-Fahad will come.
May God help you, come tomorrow.
You claim you've known the manager for a long time and that you're friends.
What's wrong with you?
The manager is taking a picture of himself on his desk.
They blame the times while sitting at their desks.
It's a shame, but it's just starch on their headscarves.
I swear, I quit the office, I said I'm taking an opportunity, I came for an opportunity.
They don't do anything worthwhile.
They won't move a chair unless ordered by Abu Fahd.
The manager didn't ask about you yesterday.
The interests of God's creation are paralyzed.
You look great today, you're going to see them.
I'm in a mess, I swear.
Every day I face a problem.
The factory is giving me a deadline.
No, God forbid, may God not let it happen.
Okay, so if he asks about you.
You're not the only ones waiting for Abu Fahd.
Take a look at these files.
They're all waiting for Abu Fahd's signature.
I'm expecting someone today.
Take it easy, you guys.
Or else, go for a walk.
I'll talk to you later.
If anything happens, I'll message you, but don't call, you'll scare the poor guys.
Good bye, God bless.
# Sorry, we scared the lady.
Boy, it's been a month since we agreed on my appointment.
When men fall, my brother, what is this talk?
My father, the registration deadline is approaching for my daughter at the university, the scholarship papers are still not ready.
I have an issue with the slow and inefficient factory.
You guys just hold on a sec.
All your transactions are signed.
Real is drinking his coffee, and when he's done, they'll come in.
Alright, he told you to calm down, alright.
Hello, your highness.
Goodbye.
Hold on, hold on, guys!
Hey, where are you going? Hold on a sec!
Understand what happened.
What happened next?
I have an important journey ahead.
He has a special door.
Is this a joke?
Brother, our interests have stopped, brother.
Every day, press Enter, Enter, Move, Fahd.
What can we do? Wait for Abu Fahd.
I'm not sure what you mean by "الساعيكم يبه". Could you please clarify or provide more context for a more accurate translation?
Blame God for those who blame you.
He's getting it from where, or from his mother?
The factory in Japan.
It's raining cats and dogs, the deadline is over.
My aunt from the other side.
She is poor, indebted, and broke.
He's facing troubles from every angle.
Mom, I'm really scared for dad.
I won't leave him alone.
I am speaking.
Hello there.
Bu Walid
Because you told me about the factory and your wife's sister's money.
Look at Abu Fahd, wow!
I'm waiting, dad, for how long?
They don't say anything but
We're waiting for Bou-Fahad.
Dad, you've never let me down.
All my friends will be going to university next week.
Shadow of Eve
The phone, my friend.
I'll do whatever it takes to make you happy, just be patient.
Okay, who am I talking to?
Hey, look at Boufahid.
I don't know what to tell you, sister.
You've been very patient with us.
May God help you.
# Bou Walid's Condition His condition is not good.
My poor baby, he's so hot, shivering and trembling.
The deadline is approaching soon.
He has five days left.
He's going to lose all his money.
"God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs."
It's better, better, better.
Inshallah, I'll feel better.
This place is weird.
The text above walks on its hind legs.
The second text is under the tree, it doesn't move.
I'm listening, but it's making me fifty percent tired.
I've made a discount for you.
Don't worry.
Your affairs, God willing, will all turn out fine.
My sister didn't fall short.
She said she's waiting for her money a bit longer.
May Allah reward her with goodness.
I got rid of your sister, but...
He's our boss, God help us with him, he's our boss.
It seems our boss heard about it.
God knows what this manager is up to now.
I'll get it from him or from Bu-Fahad.
> Attorney, God help me, God is a problem.
Tomorrow is the last day.
I'm wasting my blessings.
Let us not forsake God.
Aim for the brain, aim for the brain.
Where have you been?
You got me, I see the connection.
al-akh Bu Walid
I'm calling you because you make me feel sorry for you.
Just stay on standby on the phone.
Goodbye.
You've always been a committed person.
We used to set you as an example.
Don't think I'm oblivious to your daily escapades after work.
I can deduct from you.
And this phone is driving me crazy!
I'll add to your total instead of deducting.
I put you on the inventory committee.
# Trip Inventory Are you going today with them for the inventory?
Let's not leave work early.
And when it rises.
Don't blame me for it afterward.
Poor guy, today is his last chance.
My mother is waiting for her phone to ring, hoping they will call her.
I'm afraid he'll get fired from his job.
Hello, father of Waleed, it's my phone that's ringing.
Breaks the heart.
Let him go, poor thing.
Hello, father of Waleed.
Hey man, how are you?
What's wrong, Abu Walid? I'm calling you, not the phone.
# Subject: Complete your transaction Dear [Recipient], Please proceed with finalizing your transaction. Best regards, [Sender]
I'm not worried.
You're welcome, my friend.
Al-Zahir Dawam Bou-Fahd
What would you like me to do for you?
This is a senior official.
Where is he going?
Oh God, go to Pakistan.
Brother, which way to Oz Pakistan?
Oz Pakistan thalath maktab aaliyameen.
I don't cough.
Look at Abu Fahd.
Don't sit down.
Don't stare at me.
Or else you want
House to house.
Forward!

Do you know how long it's been now?
This is you for all these years.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure what you mean by "امودي اوراق ويايب اوراق". It seems to be a phrase in a language other than English. Could you please provide me with the original language or a context so I can assist you better?
**Arabic:** اركبي طاحت **English:** She fell off the horse.
Winding and walking between these ministries.
We were young.
Hey, what you see in front of you, I'm a sack of bread, I put it on my shoulder like this, as if I'm carrying a kid's plaster cast.
May God protect you, and may God protect you too. I learned to ride a bicycle.
I especially miss the computer I learned on and bought.
Really careful with oil.
They flirt with me when I ride my bike, oh my!
The struggle to make a living and raise the kids.
The manager has arrived.
When I finish, God willing, we'll have some sweets.
Alhamdulillah, Alhamdulillah.
I guess that's it, I'll quit my job.
I testify that you, Abu Saeed, have not fallen short.
Now, we just need some rest, my brother. Farewell, alas.
We're here for you.
What else do you want? I can extend it for a year.
Shush.
May Allah reward you with goodness.
You extended my life by four years.
I should have been retired a long time ago.
All the kids are working.
Last one yesterday I didn't show up.
He's back now, Abu Abdulaziz.
I'm seeking comfort.
No, and your job is a correspondent.
# خنفروش A sweet treat, oh so delightful, A traditional delight, a true delight.
Do you really believe it, mate?
I've been four years, maybe five, since I last had *khanfroush*.
Hey, that's nice.
I smell it with my nose.
Everything you command will happen, God willing.
Request a meeting with the HR department.
Did you finish the paperwork?
I was there yesterday.
Your application is delayed like this.
Dude, I'm bored.
Enough is enough.
Don't be a stranger.
Hello, dad, Khalid.
From this moment on, it's over.
Inshallah, we'll find peace, my dear, we'll find peace. Oh my, yes, indeed.
Sweet, sweet.
I'm at work and I can't leave.
Can you manage the general administration in human resources?
I have business over there.
I want you to take her and go to the Civil Service Commission.
Cheers, cheers dad, you're the best.
Where are you going?
My yacht is raining, I should go to the bank.
Our determination is unwavering.
Now, please.
The bank is waiting for me.
Pickles with someone.
I can't leave work, dad.
Okay, okay, let's go, bye.
His appearance doesn't seem right.
He says he can't go out.
What are you doing now?
Tomorrow morning, I'll stop by the bank on my way.
I've been studying for years and I still go to school.
He must be feeling sad.
That's better for him.
You're letting him rest, aren't you?
Poor Farhan, happy to be going home.
He called me and said Khalid is coming.
He was deaf so he could finish his paperwork.
Fear God.
Everyone relies on themselves.
My mom regrets not having khonafrosh.
This one next to me is broken.
I'm not sorry for the khunafrah, oh mother.
I just think that whoever left work and relaxed like that...
Let Khalid go and employ him.
Lying in his room.
They who were lost in their sea.
Good morning, dad.
Hello, my daughter.
Dad, I swear to you.
They just called and said the manager is very angry.
Bring your business here.
Hello, Mrs. Saeed.
I told you to let the kids be independent. What's wrong with you? Can't you hear what I'm saying?
"Your turn to retire."
I don't know what to say.
Here I am, waiting for you, and the khunafrah is right in front of me.
Today we're eating him.
Good bye, God bless.
Dad, I forgot to tell you.
My dear, my love, my dear father.
May God help you.
Yes, the one near the market.
Get out of here right now!
# Song Title: "You've Grown, My Daughter, You've Grown" You've grown, my daughter, you've grown, Like a flower in the garden, you've blossomed. Your beauty shines, a radiant light, A joy to behold, a true delight. Your eyes, like stars, sparkle with life, A promise of hope, a future so bright. Your smile, a warm embrace, Warms my heart, a loving grace. As you step into the world, with grace and poise, Your presence brings joy, a special glow. You've overcome challenges, with strength and might, A true warrior, a shining light. Your dreams, they inspire, a vision so clear, A path to follow, a journey so dear. With each step, you leave a mark, A legacy, a story to embark. So, my daughter, keep shining bright, Your future is vast, an endless sight. Believe in yourself, embrace your might, For you've grown, my daughter, you've grown, and that's right.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Mashallah 'alayka.
I've cleaned the house.
Ils, ils, ice.
I told you to stay at home.
Teach your children how to fend for themselves.
What can I do for you, my dear?
Their circumstances are difficult, I have to help them.
Enough, enough, relax.
I'll bring you a glass of water.
I'll bring you *khanfroush* to eat.
Poor guy, he's out of it.
I'm a taxi.
As a result, his face turned red.
The branch in the market is gone.
They want to see your ID.
After you get in your car
What are these papers for?
Phew, thank God!
Everyone relies on themselves.
I told you.
I want you to rest.
Hello, Jane.
A delicious lunch, don't miss it!
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I understand your request. Could you please clarify or provide more context for the text you want translated? It seems like there might be some missing information or an error in the original text.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure what you mean by "ادابج من وزاه لوزاره." It seems to be a phrase in another language, perhaps Arabic. Could you please provide the original text in Arabic script so I can attempt a more accurate translation?
Why do kids keep making transactions?
Treat them with respect when they are older, and treat them with care when they are young. You really spoil them.
The kids are holding important, decent jobs.
They're busy, what can we do?
Every day there's a meeting, either with the manager, or with the big boss, or even with the minister.
They have nice jobs, and they need people to work for them. Oh, my!
You wander, finish your tasks, run around with the Turks, another job bursts at you, leaving you exhausted, sitting there, wondering how much more.
May God reward you now.
Now, bye, take care.
Oh God, please forgive us, oh Bushahin.
They called me and said it's done.
If you send your dad tomorrow, he'll finish the paperwork for you.
Like this, I'll be very late.
Fear your Lord.
Tomorrow is impossible, especially tomorrow, I can't.
I have great affection for you.
You're bothering him and he's tired of you and your behavior towards him.
You don't even respect the gray hair on his head.
There's someone lying in the room for two days now.
I wander the streets under these suns.
May he give you the treatment.
Run and save her already.
The committee came in the morning and stayed until the end of the day.
Mom, I heard you.
My construction will be delayed like this.
Madam, tomorrow is your last day and the committee.
Your treatment is mandatory to be completed tomorrow.
Or else, come to me at night to complain about them.
Tomorrow, he has a committee meeting, he must attend.
What's up, dad?
His eyes were filled with tears.
I didn't lie to my dad at all.
The committee is the one that changed their mind.
They said it's the end of the week.
Okay, tell it to your dad.
Dad, don't go.
I'm going to heaven and I won't come back.
I'm sitting here showing off in this cafeteria with these worthless girls.
You're laughing at him.
Okay, fine.
I'm going to apologize to him.
I'm heading over there.
Thank you, my dear.
Khalood, my dear.
Thank him, you're wrong.
He turned out to be selfish.
What won't tire you is the day the committee doesn't come.
You are a blessing and a source of goodness.
From now on.
We handle our own transactions.
Tales in the house.
This is your head, I kiss it.
Hala hala hala ya Bok!
Good morning, may your day be blessed.
My dearest father
I am the world.
I really don't want you to be sad.
I don't get upset.
And you, just as I told you.
I need to finish this transaction.
I want to finish it myself.
They said to me, "Come quickly!"
Do you have a meeting?
Minister's happiness.
The happiest moment, my son.
I have a penchant for these giants.
Oh, my joy, when they said your son is with the Wael! Alas, this is him!
Trust in God, go to your shift, and make it shine.
# **English Translation:** # Bousaid, where are you?
"And may God protect you, my dear father."
The package is in front of me, dad.
You just come over, and I'll send the envelope with the driver.
My love, my dear.
It didn't happen.
He seems to have forgotten.
We start in an hour.
There is no God, long life to you.
My son has a meeting with the minister today. Oh, no!
Give me just the paperwork.
Hey, my state is work for the wise and home for work.
No one is here.
Hello.
Hello, please come in, my dear.
Ay, la la la, I didn't tell him anything, I didn't tell him anything at all.
I'm going to the desert this week.
He tells you, "There's no way out there in the farm."
Let the morning go.
He's taking his time over there, of course.
I'll add another verse to the poem.
They say she's a good cook, no need to ask.
With a spirit of him
May peace be with you.
I hope nothing's wrong.
I hope nothing's wrong, uncle.
May God guide you.
La la, ya bouk, I'm fine, I'm okay.
Your papers are scattered.
That's at the farm.
This is from my generosity.
**Deal with her.**
I'm thirsty, dad, I want some water.
# **English Translation:** # Bring me my water.
My dear children
No, no, just scratch it, scratch it, I don't want it.
Don't write like that.
I'll make them scramble.
My sister, be vigilant.
You're absolutely right.
La la la I told him.
Ay, by God, my dear sister.
Permit me, my sister.
The league and cup they call it.
He was talking about the verdict.
I have no idea what this kid is talking about, he's all over the place.
Hold him accountable. No more nonsense. No more nonsense.
People have returned to their homes.
They called him and asked him to speak on the radio and television.
"And that's even more than that."
Take him, hold him, my brothers, and throw him in jail.
Sisters, be truthful.
Oh, kind lady, these days no one helps anyone.
I'm in a mess of problems.
By God, if he dies now.
I won't let him talk, enough of his nonsense, as he says.
Praise be to God for his safe return.
Blessings have visited us.
Goodbye.
I'm late for work like this, Mom.
Listen up, dad.
I was up all night last night.
And I warn you.
Now, I just wanted to remind you, dad.
Alright, Mom.
Impossible, call again later.
No radio, no TV, not even Qtel is connected.
Your sister Aisha has been homeless for two days.
Munira, your fiancée, her tears flow four by four down her cheeks.
It's a sin, father, have mercy on us, for the love of your own parents.
Just as you said.
Enough of this nonsense.
I'm still feeling annoyed.
You're my uncle, Abu Amina.
I'll be there after they put you in jail.
He said, "That's it."
Take off your jackets.
I can't do anything with this text, as it is not written in a language I can understand.
The second time he'll grab you by the hand and take you to court. He let his daughter go.
Alright, Mom.
Repentance, I say later.
If you call the radio or TV station, you have no one to blame but yourself.
Cut let tube
Let me go now, please.
Between you and me, just between us.
I'm the manager, he told me.
We don't want it here.
This guy will mess things up with the administration tomorrow.
We've had enough of your nonsense.
Okay, now what will the manager say?
Ya, he has a million excuses, one after another.
Where do I go now?
I'm done. I'm breaking up.
I miss you.
Hello, yes.
Goodbye.
I told you.
Do you know, Saleh, why I told you that?
The public interest has forced us to reduce the number of correspondents in the ministry.
You're right.
I surrender to you, just one, enough of this nonsense.
Sweet of you.
Enough of this nonsense.
Yes, indeed.
You're still here.
We have work, please.
What a mess, dad!
Lean and bend to handle matters.
I'm sorry, I couldn't find a clear and coherent translation for the provided text. The original text seems to be in a language other than Arabic, and the characters used are not standard Arabic script. Could you please provide the correct text or clarify the language it's written in?
They're going to finish him off.
Munira was standing and listening as I told you.
Hey dad, I said.
I can hear them with my ears; I just came from the mills.
Go now, you're inside.
Let me talk to your father.
Prison shower, we said it was a mistake and kept quiet.
We'll keep quiet now after we fire them.
I'm here for you, we're family.
Do you know what I mean?
Seek refuge from Satan.
God willing, only good things will happen.
Remember God, may God guide you.
I don't want coffee; keep your coffee for yourself.
I know you.
Bored
You've got two weeks, kid.
By God, he won't take you by the hand and bring you to court to get a divorce.
Mom, even if I leave
What do you want with troubles?
Just bear with yourself.
Even if one told you
Be to yourself what you wish to hear.
This is not enough, enough of this nonsense.
Yeah, man, that's right.
I'm not being punished these days.
What's wrong with you? Cut the nonsense, man. We just want to hear it from you once, just once.
I'm ready, let's go.
Let you be the police.
Mama, no, you've got it all wrong.
My cousin has a problem, so we asked him to speak about it tomorrow on the radio.
He was a bit hesitant.
We felt like we approached him in a public place, so he hesitated.
I said, "It's right for my cousin to come over to my place and talk to him privately, it's better that way."
Did you guys feel like he wanted to say something?
I'm feeling indecisive, I don't know what I want.
They came from somewhere.
Shush shush shush shush shush shush shush.
I'm neither your mother nor do I know you, and I disown you until the Day of Judgment. Did you hear me or not?
Saleh Saad
There is no God, thank you. This is it, ugh. Thank God we're rid of it.
You have a sense of responsibility.
An example of a successful employee.
Unfortunately, though.
Despite my efforts,
Hello.
Why did you bother coming?
I just called the secretary to let you know not to come.
Shahin, what's wrong with you?
Did you not recognize her?
Oh my, is there anyone in Qatar who doesn't know Saleh? Enough with the nonsense.
You're good, enough with the nonsense.
Enough of this nonsense.
Hey, what's the job?
There are no jobs, you know the circumstances.
Well, real deal, they didn't hire you.
I'm crazy about working here.
I've left no stone unturned, Manira, I've been everywhere.
No one told me before I came that there was a job, but they took it, so it's gone.
Aisha got divorced yesterday, her husband left her.
Her responsibility has become this big.
It became such a big responsibility after one day.
By God, I don't know what to do, by God.
He's trying to get close to the minister.
I just don't think she's honest.
I think he believes I'm afraid to take his place.
Alright, you're killing me.
Who told you I'd let it go?
I just want this method to be kept away from me.
I'm thinking of a way to slaughter him.
Finish it all at once.
What is it?
I know him.
"That's not the one who speaks on the radio."
Baby, come to the room.
You're just a bite-sized piece of information.
You, Saleh, are a patriotic citizen.
You are a patriotic citizen.
Received.
I've left, I swear, enough is enough.
I consider your voice to be the voice of truth.
I had a little chat with BuFahad.
I truly believe you, Saleh.
He hasn't been heard for a long time. This is the one who says enough is enough.
I'd like to get to know him.
This is natural, Saleh.
I am a protester in the tent.
Forward, forward, forward.
Your kind is rare.
Your words are very beautiful.
And your talk on the radio is much better.
We've heard enough, enough of this nonsense!
# **Translation:** "Yes, come on, just one more for Boufahd. He's going to say it, he's going to say it. Sema, Sema, Sema, Sema."
Enough with the nonsense.
This is the original, your highness. This is it.
Please continue, don't stop.
It's a bit difficult.
Then he stood up, ignoring me.
I want it to continue because of people's problems and their issues.
Listen up, Saleh.
I'll give you just one problem.
You, O Saleh, are the voice of truth.
Get up, I need you for a moment.
Senior official here.
I'll do my best, but please note that the provided text seems to be missing some words or is incomplete. Here's the translation: I swear, I'll do as you say, and I swear by God.
Yes, indeed.
This is your chance.
Opportunity knocks but once.
No, no, it doesn't mean that.
What's wrong with you? Can't you understand?
Wait, please, my brother.
I'm into problems, disasters, and highs.
Your Excellency, the Minister
Ministry in its latest project requested eight thousand pipes.
# Pressure Vessel with a Capacity of 120 cm³ ## Technical Specifications - Volume: 120 cubic centimeters - Material: High-strength steel - Pressure Rating: 20 bar - Safety Features: Overpressure relief valve, pressure gauge - Dimensions: 20 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm - Weight: 5 kg This pressure vessel is designed for industrial applications, offering a compact and durable solution for storing and transporting compressed gases. With its robust construction and precise engineering, it ensures safe and efficient operation.
However, this employee
He agreed to the capacity pipes.
So he can benefit from the price difference.
Enough of this nonsense.
You're welcome, you're welcome, brother Saleh. Enough with the nonsense.
There is no God but Allah, may He protect you.
This call is a special order.
Inshallah, you'll name him yes.
Enough with the nonsense, enough with the nonsense.
Do you know?
Life is not worth it.
This is the last one, that's it.
Sultan Asdaq flew.
The minister was shocked by such haste.
They tell you he spoke the truth.
Now, the field is empty, Bofahed can play alone.
I handle all the tasks.
Your Highness
The minister is ready to serve.
Goodbye.
Enough of this nonsense.
Alright, this is the last one, alright? After this, no more.
Ooh, here you go, my dear. These are my application papers for the job. My apologies, just kidding around.
They got what they wanted.
Listen to my words.
Because I'm afraid.
I'll talk about him and expose his scandals and misdeeds.
You point out flaws and criticize.
They fear you.
Deceive me, my sister A'isha.
You're the kind one.
Tomorrow, your uncle Abu Amneera will come.
I need to work.
They're just talking nonsense, pointing out flaws and being critical.
Why do they bear grudges against our country?
Do we have flaws?
We don't have any connections.
I'm hearing the word "mediator" for the first time.
In our government offices, it's first come, first served.
We don't have bribery.
I don't know her.
Look at the employee.
Does a foreigner get more than a local? No, no, no, never.
We do everything with our own hands.
You're a boy, your mother is from here, and your father is from there; we've never had a master like that.
He gets angry at you while you're on the job.
We are the best people.
The best country.
Flawless
And thank you.
Shmukhrabt yesterday on the radio.
Mom, I want candy.
I told you there's no candy until after dinner.
Alright then, no candy.
Shalli tore the shirt.
Mom, I and Wadool were playing.
I know you're playing.
What the hell ripped my shirt?
May God be with you, O just one.
Come, come, see what your brother's son has done.
I told you we didn't need to buy it expensively, you said no, it doesn't matter, it will look good on our son.
Take a look at what he did.
I can't do anything about this anymore, it's canceled. This shirt is canceled, it's not worth selling.
He said he'd do whatever he wants with it, of course no one will stop him.
Mom, where's the candy?
See the gap intentionally created by the labor.
He returned with Walid.
Farhan is happy to wear it for the first time.
Parawij viya ana.
Where is Adoul?
In the garden.
Why is this happening?
I want to talk to you about something.
I don't understand.
Hang your head in shame.
Keep your eyes on him like you would a child.
The kids will leave him as he pleases.
Wreaks havoc
Come here, teach me manners.
Come, teach me.
I'll raise them, my dear.
Don't overdo it, and respect yourself.
Let him be with you.
You're fighting like kids.
Bay, stay away from me.
Mom, please don't interfere, you never do.
Tell him to raise his children properly. Listen, I can hear you both.
Is this a child?
Damn it, can't you tell the difference between a child and an adult?
I just found out.
The blame is on me, not you.
Let's go upstairs.
Hathil doesn't deserve even one.
They don't even reply to me.
It is preferable for one to
Calm hearts' time
Alright, alright, I'm coming, coming, coming. Bye, bye.
Your Highness, the minister has requested the documents, and I anticipate receiving them soon.
Alright, alright, I'll talk to the minister later. Mind your own business, I'll handle it.
# The Curse is Lifted # The Disaster is Over # The Catastrophe has Passed
His new dress, no, Aisha.
This is not a child's play.
You're the real deal.
La la la, Joe, your clothes are in tatters.
Jovi Jovi
There's no hope you'll wear it.
# **English Translation:** Jovi is wearing baggy pants, which means he's going out alone.
La la la, no, this is not something you cut with your hands, it's obvious.
I'll show you heaven with an electric saw.
But I can only say, may God take revenge on whoever did this.
I'm telling you.
Who wants candy? Come here.
I still don't know.
If you still don't know, come on, take a tour around the villa.
I love you not just because you know how to ride a bike.
I love you because there's something else about you.
You're telling the truth, aren't you?
Okay, you want candy.
I want two.
I'll give you four units.
I am the one who tore our clothes in the closet.
Hey, how's your dad and how are the pieces?
He has a huge pair of scissors to cut the car with.
Under the bed, there's all the sweetness.
You don't go that far.
No one but him caused this mess yesterday.
Why should we stay silent about it?
Most important.
We stick to our word.
I wash the clothes, Walid, my child.
Any computer.
What the hell is he talking about?
The destruction I witnessed with my own eyes is unimaginable for a child to do.
Why won't you believe me?
Go hang out with your crew.
Fine, give me just a moment.
This is your situation.
Every day, mom, you guys fight.
Where have you gone, oh days of yore?
Oh God, with forgiveness and well-being.
Hey, God guide you.
Aishyl estimates the scissors' size.
You're the one I'm looking for, my crew.
Take a look at that scar, my dear.
I'm going to bring a big pair of scissors.
Respect yourself, Sultan. Respect yourself, Aoush.
Dad, come here, please, for the love of your parents, find a solution for them. Come on, dad.
How do I start?
Each one of you.
You are fathers.
The child is born.
A child is born.
You are my brothers.
Listen to my words, reconcile, and extend your hands.
Okay, tell me what are you going to do now?
"What's the matter, bird? I didn't tear their clothes."
Their clothes were soaked in the mess he made for me. He lost my files, my information, my documents. He ruined everything.
I swear I won't let him go.
Bring me a talk, a guide, for the Arabic language museums, I swear I won't let him go.
Don't worry about him.
Beating, beating, beating, beating, until it gets tired and leaves.
My brother is not okay, I know him.
Everyone greeted each other.
I'm not sure if my father is sincere. His heart is full of hatred and resentment.
I am upset because I broke the computer.
Weh Fahd
Sultan Atta Atta Atta
Enough, my mother, fear God.
Give it to him. Be careful.
Take your cousins and go play outside.
Oh my God, oh my God, hopefully God will guide you.
May God bless you.
Real men, each one with his own unique style.
You've ruined it for the kids.
Inshallah, my dear mother.
# Their Brother, Abdurrahman
I can't do it the first time, Mom.
Do you know, oh my dear mother, the big one?
Does he know how to talk to people?
He communicates with them.
You guys don't be mad at me either.
You're supposed to be better than that.
Every unit has a role.
May God guide you, truly, may God guide you.
Even you, father, have become like them.
Help me, oh my mother, hit my son! How can God command us, yet you keep saying, "Go away, go away, go away!"
Oh my dear mother, yes.
My son, my poor son.
You've shamed us, you boys.
They were the kids who got deleted, the kids.
I just can't bring myself to believe it.
I see them with both my eyes.
Tell the kids they won't believe this.
He speaks from above.
Aho, you're a big shot now, aren't you? Just because you're from the upper class, you think you're better than everyone else.
I'm not confused, I'm wide awake.
You're welcome, you can go ahead.
You might be a bit tired, or your head is spinning.
Do you know who these people are?
Don't say it, they'll throw stones at you.
All of them.
Oh, my love.
I say, go and rest now, they've all signed the pledge, it's done, what else do you want?
In the name of God In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
What is this? Oh my, oh my.
"May God protect me from the enemy."
Mom, Mom!
It's all your fault.
You guys are the reason.
Greatness is for the humble Shame on you and your minds
Take me to the hospital, I'm fainting, I'm dying.
I've seen this couple before.
He keeps glancing at you, Hazi.
Aww, he wasn't registered in our business.
He's been absent from class for a week now.
It's quite clear he's dying to meet you.
Don't be so serious if you're not into it to that extent.
No, my dear sister.
I don't want him to say I'm throwing myself at him.
You've abandoned me, a man of wealth and status, and it has taken my breath away.
Let things go back to normal, it's better that way.
He's the one chasing you now, and he's the one who threw himself at you.
I guess I do like him back.
I just don't know, I feel like the right opportunity hasn't come yet.
I am not sure what you mean by "الا اميه بالاميه". Could you please clarify or provide more context? I'll be happy to assist you with the translation once I understand the intended meaning.
I'm looking at you from all sides, and my heart is aching.
Or do you expect, young man, that she will come and say, "Please, I want to get to know you"?
Bro, you should be the one to take the initiative.
You're absolutely right.
I'm just waiting for the right opportunity.
The right opportunity.
You're more than just enrolled in the same course with her.
The teacher said:
Say it, [name].
Hey, [name], come here, seriously, what was her name again?
We've been staring at each other for three months.
No one knows the other.
Bro, you're old school.
You have to go and tell her, please.
Could I get to know you?
I'm not that strong.
I'll wait for the right opportunity to come my way.
Hadeeh and well-mannered.
My God, I have no idea what you want exactly.
We finished filming the series yesterday.
Yes, indeed.
You've never forgotten us, and you've never fallen short of our expectations.
I'm free now.
We're buying the villa behind us for Walid.
I hope he stays with us, not going far away, once he gets married tomorrow, God willing.
What's the use now, then?
I'm running late.
You bring good news.
I haven't seen her for days, she's been avoiding me.
They purchased the villa through the Development Bank.
God bless them, inshallah, in it.
Hello, hello, dad. Good morning.
Let's go, my man, hit the road.
Thank you, my father. Thank you. May God reward you. May God reward you with goodness.
Hello, hello, Nora, welcome, welcome. The car started, I'm telling you. Come on, come with me, I'll drive you. Come, come, father.
Peace be upon you.
What's up?
Neighbors are chatting with each other, and here you are, butting in.
I say, get out of it, it's better for you.
Neighbors and they're together, what are you doing between them?
I'm stuck with a nice guy on my car and I can't get out.
Sure, here is the translation: Please, may I have the keys to your car?
I start the car.
I'll leave you in the Titanic mood you're in.
See you.
Goodbye.
Now you know a lot about me.
I only knew Walid.
Walid Rashid Abdullah
Surely many people, if you tell them your father's name, will think you're the actor's son.
Mashallah, same name.
My father is Rashid Abdullah, the actor.
Rashed Abdullah, the famous actor, your father.
Why didn't you have dinner with them? Someone had these grapes for dinner.
Hey, come here, tell me.
How did you know the famous actor Rashid Abdullah, Yarna?
Yes, of course.
Hey, my friend at the university knows them, and she's the one who told me.
He's the only one he likes, loves his acting, and follows no one but him.
He said we no longer live next to a famous person who is valued by society.
Oh, my heart, my joy!
Oh, how cute! He's so light-hearted, yes indeed!
His son turned out to be just like him, so he helped me out. May God reward him well.
He spoke the truth who said:
Did you hear about it?
I have to take a picture with this actor I love, you know why.
Mom, hurry up! Talk to Aboud, my cousin's son.
I read an interview with him in the newspaper.
They say they're filming a series about the pearl diving days.
I say, who's bringing you a ram to celebrate the new villa?
Prove that he is a good neighbor.
Hello Saleh, is there anything new?
We have so many names.
They told me, may God keep you safe, Abu Saad, that my name is on the list.
The compensation is determined based on the need and the employee's experience.
We don't know.
We might not move you.
Sure, here is the translation: Please excuse me, I can't do anything for you.
In the name of God, your enemy.
We said let's move and settle there, and then God will provide for us later on, we'll have daughters.
Fix your work.
He's back, Abu Ali.
Please, don't treat me like a stranger.
Anything you need.
I'm at your service.
The neighbor is for the neighbor, and I am your brother.
Now I've heard and seen.
Well, Mashallah, you know about furniture.
I'll come with you.
You don't have to worry, my sister.
Whenever you want to choose the furniture, let me know.
My love, Abuj is applying for a loan to buy furniture, and if they approve it, we'll buy all the furniture.
Here I am, repeating it again.

We are family today.
I can't study alone, it's too hard.
She just wanted to be independent.
I was definitely speaking it.
I mean, do you want me to lie to you and say I'm talking to my friend?
Oh my God, Ali!
I'm not for anything.
I love her and she loves me, we understand each other.
You're dreaming.
Let me propose to you my cousin's daughter.
Keep the matter with you.
Do as you please.
My man, I miss you.
Banjov
Good night.
Hello, how are you?
Bu Ali Khair
Mate, this car is damaged.
I get into trouble with you every other day.
May God keep the girl safe; she has university to attend.
This one is always ready to commit suicide.
Your daughter is our daughter.
What you need to do
There's no need to go overboard, my brother Rashid.
There is no God, long life to you.
The car is parked in the yard, and the driver is sitting idle, with nothing to do.
I see the Development Bank didn't hold back, they got you a house and a car.
This is not our car.
Rashed Abdullah's neighbor's car.
I see relationships have evolved.
We discuss topics of mutual interest that benefit both parties.
Oh, what an awesome evolution!
Oh, come on, let's go!
# Embarrassing Return
I'm sorry, but I don't understand the phrase "ما رظت." Could you please provide me with a clear and complete sentence or phrase in Arabic that I can translate for you?
Noura said, "I thought she was my daughter, and every day the driver would take her to university."
She should have told her that my dad's car will be in the shop for a week.
By God, no way.
She said, "No more, the driver will pick her up every morning."
I testify to God, oh Ali.
Good people.
La la la ya bouk.
There is no power or might except with Allah.
Oh no, what a mess! What am I supposed to do now?
What should I do, I have responsibilities and obligations.
My daughter, who will take her to university?
"Hey, Abu Ali, since your connection is Professor Rashid Abdullah,"
We can't say anything now, it's too late.
Bu Saad Bu Saad
Bu Saad, I'm sorry.
Bouali knows his worth to us.
Thank you, may God reward you with goodness. You didn't fall short, oh Abu Saad.
Everyone loves you, Mashallah.
She is so pretty, so pretty.
Come on, guys, let's go. Professor Rashid is busy, let him pass.
Excuse me, excuse me, Professor Rashid, we're interrupting you or something.
At your service, we're ready, we're ready.
Who's got your back, you've got a strong connection.
We're your buddies and brothers, if we need something or want anything, don't forget about us, come on!
Just tell me where you want it, and I'll bring it to you.
Why are you acting like this? Turn me around.
Will you propose to Manal for me?
Agree, mom, agree.
Manal told her mother about me.
What's wrong with you? I can't believe it.
Um Walid
Do you have a dress for the party?
I didn't understand.
May it be fate that Walid gets it, God willing, the apple of my eye.
She returned, poor thing, and talked to me.
You pick accessories.
What's up? Accessories, jewelry.
This is my mother.
Now, you're gonna ride a fancy car.
Masha'Allah, Masha'Allah.
Mashallah, I can't keep up with you.
Am Walīd, tara mā ṣirti wayāj.
He gave you everything, including the car.
With her is the driver.
If I go with you in this color, they won't believe that this bald and bearded man is the husband of this queen.
Oh my god, wow!
God willing, you'll leave in these clothes.
Oh no, no, no, no, no, I'm disappointed in you.
I'll undress, and then you won't recognize me.
They're saying, who is this old man coming in on us?
Coffee is the right of the long-lived.
# I didn't recognize you, my God. I thought this was definitely one of the cabaret guys, not Bouali. You're not Bouali.
How about it?
I'm walking, not far.
May God keep you safe, we're going to the house with two tails to propose to Ali.
Nase Akbari
I managed to get myself a car without the help of my guardian.
I'm sure I'll find it with you.
The last series I acted in.
In a scene that resembled a wedding, recall any wedding.
I was wearing that shiny black bisht.
And then, I want you to teach me how to wear the bisht.
May God protect your brother, he never wore a besht.
Ma sha Allah, amanour amanour.
"What if I just barge into the meeting room on them?"
That's not fair.
Hey, my brother Rashid.
Do you have any more buttons?
Good.
I always see her with me and Kholoud.
The story goes like this.
You are my beloved.
We are family now.
I do not want our daughter Nourah to go far away.
Nura Haq Walid
Tell me, my mother, I see her at the university and I can't find anyone better than her.
This is the blessed hour.
Inshallah, I'll tell her father, and God willing, may what is good happen.
Why did they reject me? What's the reason?
His father is an actor.
Soul, call your father.
Rush, Rashed wants to talk to you.
Where are you, my love?
Scream, I am free from oppression.
Do you say it because his father is an actor?
Do you have any shame left?
I am an actor.
I am honored to serve.
I perform on stage for two hours, and then my role is over.
My performance comes to an end.
You play roles.
I represent.
I present them with a message that benefits them.
However, you guys
I wear my acting clothes.
On stage.
However, you guys
You starred in it at the Maysaloun.
The rich sheikha.
Who's the actor among us?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be sad, Walid.
Hold your head high.
We are not honored.
I missed the view now as I was coming.
Listen to her screaming at him, don't turn around, don't turn around, he's so pitiful, it breaks your heart.
He walks his path.
Do you say it's like a horse?
It's Thursday, my dear.
Thursday
My mother woke up early.
Do you love him?
That's why it will go like this.
"So that he won't see the women and the women won't see him."
I saw how obedient his wife is.
Seda, don't look around.
We won't show up at the office tomorrow.
Thursday, please, please show them how he wears the jersey.
Thursday, show me your Steelers outfit.
She's not your wife, right? You call her "my lady's dress."
Come on, it's Thursday!
I am a hollow soul, an old man with white hair.
Poor guy, man.
How much longer are you going to stay like this?
If you could hear the talk that goes on behind your back.
Masha'Allah, they even say it's in front of me, maybe even more.
Why am I doing this?
I'm jealous of you.
I'm jealous of what?
I often sit in front of the TV.
This is it.
I do, and I swear to God.
La la, it's okay.
Hello, how are you, sister?
Couple now.
I'm right in front of you, talking to you, and I heard a man's voice.
By God, sometimes I tear my clothes on the road.
Respect yourself and divorce her.
It's hard to let go.
There's nothing. There's nothing. There's nothing. There's nothing. There's nothing.
Stay away from me, don't come any closer.
Hey, I recognize you!
My intention is good.
Are you talking to me?
No one messes with you except these kinds of people you hang out with.
I especially dislike her; she's the worst among all your friends. I can't stand her, God help me, this hefty, burly woman.
The branches that look like newly sprouted grass.
Shame on you, you have no shame.
I want to torment me in my grave.
Let me talk to her.
What do you have after that, tell me.
Do you get along with him/her?
I can't see anyone here.
# My Hero Academia: Ultra Impact ## Chapter 1: The Beginning of a New Journey **Salem:** What's wrong? What's going on?
Thursday, our friend is coming.
I'm watching the wall and talking to myself.
I say, the one with the limp is jumping, jumping on top.
Ordinary Thursday, this poor guy.
He's talking to her while looking straight into her eyes and holding her hand.
"May God protect me from his wife."
Do they say Thursday at your place?
Now he's busy, he's on an international call, very far away, the line keeps cutting out.
What's wrong with this message?
I say, may God help you, Thursday.
What's wrong with you, are you asleep?
I don't have any Nude, I don't know, it's not coming to me.
Regarding the meeting tomorrow,
With the women's delegation from the ministry.
Sure, here's the translation: "Could you explain that, please?"
May God guide you, Thursday.
These names are coming from the minister's office.
And then come.
You're why are you afraid of her?
If I had Salama to talk to, I wouldn't have been shy.
Tell the truth.
Why are you hiding and lurking behind the water tank?
Just like this.
K Kaa shafti aqra aq aqra akhar raqam fil l l indij
The last number(s)
The last number you called after you deleted the number of the woman you were talking to.
Tell me, what's her name, oh, ladies' man.
I cut, I cut, I cut.
I told her Salem's tales.
Salam rafijy f f f f val f al-‘amal.
I can't believe you don't believe me, brother.
And what the hell are you wearing?
I'm going to dive in.
I swear, my brother, she didn't let me wear anything; she told me to go out like this.
Call me.
Call my wife's father.
Hajj Morteza
Say it, my brother, bring the pen, I'll give you the number.
Administrators on some of you.
You men are all the same.
You're a real tough guy like him, but I'll show you.
If you interfere again, nothing will stop me from going to the minister's office.
This is a horse.
I threaten him, saying I will complain about him at the minister's office.
This girl is so bold!
She's intending to cut off my livelihood, you know.
I was the one at fault for listening to you and calling her.
Thursday, come back, O Thursday.
If she complains about me, I'll go to the minister's office.
Come with me over there and tell them the whole story; get me out of this mess, yes.
I have nothing to do with it.
You're such a coward.
My brothers, my sisters.
Good morning, everyone.
It is my honor to invite you to the meeting.
Where are the rest of them, then?
# Run! ## Get Out of Here!
It's Thursday, where is he?
Yay, long live your majesty!
Turn off the phone.
Let's just leave them in the office and lock it up.
The whole meeting lasted an hour.
This is my phone number.
It happened and it came to be.
My heart has been with you since that day, and it hasn't gone back to their house.
Where is he going?
He can't go.
I've been stuck in the same situation for days.
Jealous, jealous of him, she is jealous.
My love, this is not jealousy.
He sits here in the living room alone at night.
Let me chat with my mom.
Mother, mother, she is dead.
I brought you here to find a solution.
Madam A, I asked you to move to the section where there are women.
"Damn military rule!"
AKA Jovi, the signature is so big, read below.
Brother, if you don't mind, I've been transferred to the social welfare department.
Are you sure they transferred you to the care department?
Why so strange?
Thank you, may God keep you safe.
You're the sister. Oh, sorry, it's Thursday.
They called us from the minister's office and informed us.
I've arrived at your new department.
Who are your friends at the office?
Issa, Saleh, Jassim, and
Thursday, the minister decided to transfer you yesterday.
Today, I welcome you to your new department.
I explained to you, told you about my problem with my family.
You are a trans by the minister's decree.
I'll go to the minister.
He took his annual leave today.
He won't be back until after a month and a half.
Oh, what a mess!
I think so too.
The minister, be and you, the same speech.
I'll keep going until I find a place for you because this time I'll move you, as many people have told him about your problem with your wife.
I'll be honest with you.
The solution.
They say, if the woman calls me, don't talk about it.
I wonder how they can follow you; you have to beg them.
They put your toys in the car for you; I put them in a box for you.
How many?
I gave you a 10, assuming there are five of you in the office, so that's two each.
He's about to die, man. He's scared of his wife.
Imagine if we all had men's names.
I call myself Abdulghader.
He is, like, this way.
He's handsome and sweet, so you worry about him like this.
In the name of God, what's wrong with her?
Call me when you're done.
# English translation: Hey Abdulqadir, the one sitting next to Hassan over there, behind Khalil.

What's wrong with you?
Please.
Where is the welfare office?
There should be five female employees.
What is your name?
I am sweet.
I'm crazy, my wife drives me nuts.
I'm crazy.
You've now flown the project in front of us.
We joined them.
Okay, what did they say to you?
They said.
Let there be light for us, come here with it.
I can't.
I went to the kitchen and made a mess.
Come on, come on, come on, go make us some tea, come on.
Come on, come on, come on, you're useless.
Come on, come on, listen to the men, listen to them.
Oh my, have you forgotten that we are the children of the scorpion tribe?
Come on, come on, I'm coming, I don't need any thanks, come on, come on, come on.
All the bank officials said there is no objection to the project.
Call him, his phone is constantly busy.
Poor people from Messa'a are waiting for you.
I have no other trouble but this uncle and these brothers.
She went as a servant for a month, and now it's been three months.

We got all the amendments in our favor.
Sabi al-na
If you guys do the garden, I'll be so happy.
He'll go somewhere, at least a villa or two, maybe three.
They say the park is a breath of fresh air for the people who live in this complex. This is the bank.
Guys are discussing, they don't need women's opinion.
Keep your temper down.
You made tea, so show yourself, get lost.
Garden no
Just a minute.
You know I love football.
They don't know you play football at school, or they'd kill you.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure what you mean by "اشناويه عن نفسج." Could you please provide the correct Arabic text or clarify the meaning of this phrase? I'll be happy to assist you with the translation once I have a better understanding of the source text.
She said no to you.
I say, forget about it, it's better for you.
I won't show myself.
La la la la, I've got a grudge against you.
What can I say, the worries, the worries of this world.
Your right is upon me; you are our blessing.
Oh, Uncle Shahin, we're here.
Masha'Allah.
This is Thursday.
Length and width.
Fear of the dishdasha.
I looked for a wife and couldn't find one.
Pedigree
I want to tell you something.
# Marriage of Thursday is at my place
This is from the Human Resources Department.
Yes, may you live long.
Put it aside.
I have a few comments on the proposal.
May your life be long.
Do you have anything else?
Long live your age.
Take care of them, and if I get some time, God willing, I'll meet them.
What did you do with the female employees I sent over to you?
What's going on?
I'm leaving now, and then I'll call you, okay?
What's going on?
You're crazy.
We are your older sisters.
We've been suffering for a long time.
You know, ask Fatoum, what sport do you play at school?
I told them table tennis.
They were lucky, barely escaped being slaughtered.
The beating you got was just an appetizer.
You have no idea who we are.
What's our origin?
Do you know what scorpions mean?
This time, you messed up with me.
Big Scorpion
The needle.
Let's give her a slap in the face.
Enough is enough.
You be there for me, I'll need you later.
I won't let you say you're going into architectural engineering like me.
Unity, you are
Scorpions don't have daughters working in the streets with men.
Geometry, architecture, and strength.
Where do I take her among these scorpions?
Let me break at once.
No, no, Sultan, no.
Ready, my old scorpion.
# Episode 1: The Broken Promise Fatima's heart was heavy as she thought about the promise her mother had made and how it had been shattered. It was a promise that had brought her joy and hope, but now it lay in ruins. The words echoed in her mind, "I promise, my dear Fatima, that we will go on a grand adventure together. We'll explore new lands, discover hidden treasures, and create memories that will last a lifetime." But as time passed, her mother's health declined, and the promise seemed further away than ever. Fatima's eyes filled with tears as she recalled the day her mother's condition worsened, and the doctors delivered the devastating news. "I'm sorry, Fatima. Your mother's illness is progressing rapidly. We've done everything we can, but..." The sentence trailed off, leaving Fatima's world shattered. She clung to the memory of her mother's smile, the warmth of her embrace, and the sound of her laughter. It was those moments that kept her going, giving her the strength to face each day. Fatima knew that her mother's spirit lived on, and she vowed to honor her memory by living a life filled with courage and adventure. As she walked through the bustling streets, Fatima felt a sense of determination. She would not let her mother's promise fade into oblivion. No, she would embrace the spirit of adventure and create her own path, fulfilling the dream they had shared. And so, Fatima's journey began. A journey of self-discovery, courage, and the pursuit of a promise that had once brought her so much happiness.
Let your brother, Saqr, have his chance.
By God, it's a shame what they're doing.
My love, don't worry, at least you are enough.
Look at my face.
Okay, what do they want from you tomorrow morning?
What do you want now?
Descend, O Falcon.
Come on, move forward, move forward!
Where am I going?
Not a word.
We're going to Zain.
I told you to bring it and not say a word.
I write "education" instead.
Even if you want to stay, we don't mind.
What's up?
You have two choices.
To let you know that we are democrats.
Bear with me, you're putting pressure on me.
# Bachelor's Degree ## Specialization: - Medicine - Education
Come on, hurry up and go!
Bring us a copy of the request.
Come on, get going!
The biggest scorpion, oh father.
The oud scorpion alone is enough to cause trouble.
I'd be glad to, uncle, but when is the engagement, God willing?
Professor Amira
What you're asking for seems way too difficult.
I can't travel, Abu Khalid.
I have special circumstances.
The minister emphasized it.
It's very difficult.
Think straight, Amira.
Don't make a decision now, think about it, not tomorrow.
How do you expect me to work?
Because of this, we remain silent.
I have a suggestion.
Let one of them travel with you.
We don't let our daughters travel.
Turkish, stop this nonsense.
There's no shame nor embarrassment.
You're the one keeping me here at work till now.
You go tomorrow and apologize.
I do not understand.
Listen and be quiet.
Thursday, one of the sons of the Scorpions.
One of us and from us.
You're a real idiot and you don't even have a degree.
But scorpion.
What should I do now?
What can I do, Fatima?
I am broken and weak.
How much can I do?
There's nothing I can do.
What are you doing?
Thursday next week, God willing, the wedding.
We'll call you and tell you what time to come, depending on the sheikh's team that will perform the marriage ceremony.
Oh, how sweet is that smile.
Soul of the season, sew me clothes.
Get your clothes tailored, dad.
Killing me, this laughter.
Brother, I beg you.
I don't want to hear a single word.
Make us some tea, coffee, and cake.
I am coming now, Aisha. I am coming, the minister's friend.
I'm afraid it might be a rumor, Abu Khalid.
Amira is a candidate to hold one of the ministries in the new cabinet.
Amira deserves it.
Inshallah it's not a rumor.
You're working tomorrow.
We all cooperate to serve the nation.
Through the contribution of each one of us in our respective places, thank you.
I wish us all good luck.
Thank you, Minister.
"Thank you, the minister's efforts are highly appreciated."
Thank you.
How long will she live? Please, go ahead, please, go ahead.
Hello.
I used the soap just like you told me to.
This is the general manager of the women's national football team.

Captain Fatima is talented. Goodbye, my son.

Captain, the enemy is a bit far away, in China.
May God be with you.

This was studying education, but I went today and changed her papers.
Khaleeda studies architecture at university.
I'm the captain because there's no difference between a man and a woman.
By God, he only pours coffee.
Come here, where are you going?
I waited and waited.
You're a donkey, you're a donkey.
Oh come on, go on, go and see your mother, tell her they kicked me out.
Come on, come on, neither your father nor your mother's.
My word, what a state!
The pot you have is cold.
They don't know you exist all year long, but as soon as they hear you have work, they do.
Hey, how are you? How are the kids?
I long for her.
"I told her, God willing, this time you'll be with us in the series."
I'm certain and you're playing the lead role.
# **English Translation:** Hey Ali, look for Nov; no one can play her role but Shu'la.
My love, there's something called makeup that makes her look younger.
Mary has either twenty-six or twenty-seven episodes.
Let her benefit from it, dad.
He keeps giving us lectures with no beginning or end.
I'm afraid a bone will get stuck in our throat.
# Episode 1: The Big Secret The most important thing is that he must not find out the company producing the series is yours and Hamed's.
God willing, I haven't kept you waiting, my brothers.
He is Rashed and Ray after all.
The director is ready with the technicians. What's wrong with him?
Okay, folks, let's get started with the meeting due to time constraints.
Whoever wants to speak, express their opinion, please go ahead.
Do you want to say something, Janko Hamed?
Honestly, I don't think there's anything better than this series.
Come you, on the day I saw that maid had committed suicide.
Do you know what, the most touching scene for me was...
The maid commits suicide.
Her soul was caught in the bank machine, the machine spun, spun, spun, spun, and the blood gushed, gushed, gushed, dripping from her neck.
She got angry and started shouting at her son, it was quite a scene.
He keeps shooting at it, shooting at it, shooting at it, until he reaches the yard of their house.
Peak of action.
I'm running from the police, they're searching for me.
"Honestly, the series is incredibly amazing."
You guys will stand up on the table and act out the whole series.
This is an assault on artistic conscience.
Rape of the community's values.
TV series based on bizarre events.
Unbelievable.
*72 Hours: True Crime*
What's all this commotion about?
You're known for not wanting anyone to stand out.
Hey, hey, brother Hamid, let's be democratic.
We will decide on the matter by majority.
Oh brother Nasser, don't hide behind the majority and democracy in the field of critical evaluation of any artistic work; there is no democracy and majority.
You got yourself involved, given your government job and its implications.
Goodbye.
I tell you, I heard the bell ring.
I came across an Indian guy holding a bag.
He asks me, "Are you Mama Hessa?" I say, "Yes."
I opened the bag.
There was a ring, I think its value is around seventy to eighty thousand bou.
I'm afraid the Indian guy might have brought us the wrong stuff.
No, dad, not like that, by mistake.
This is Samira.
Hamed's wife, the manager who works for us at the company.
This is God, I send you this as a gift from her.
Aij laj ashfeej?
The ring is very luxurious.
I've never dreamed of having a ring like this.
# مناسبة خاصة God bless you, Hasna, my dear.
This is my father, this series, I call it the series of goodness.
Ali and Hamed are both colleagues, but since they are employees here, they cannot submit the series under their names, so they submitted it under someone else's name.
What else do you want other than this ring?
I'll tell you, but it must stay between you and me.
What are you talking about? I'm not crazy; I'm just telling someone.
The cunning couple
The one they call the wizard.
What's the big deal? It's only five percent, not a biggie.
My love, they're sweet if they approve four million for them.
My husband makes a nice 200,000 riyals.
I say the role of the university girl, we give to Nada.
I'm with him, I love him and I ride a bike with him.
# Our New Series: Conscience Rape
I was offered a role in a TV series.
Fine, I want to know one thing.
Always like this, our Gulf series, just like we say, this year's fashion is rape.
My love, tell me what my role will be.
You are my darling, your role is 100% guaranteed.
Fine, no need to be embarrassed.
I'm coming, yai yai, now.
My love, I've prepared all this delicious breakfast for you, are you really going to leave me and go?
Hadi 'Umar, the director's secretary.
May God protect us.
He never asked me at this hour.
He said that this series they're going to make is weak and trivial.
It's a shame to lose money on him.
Fine, and then I mean, what happened?
May God protect me, what will I say to them? I'm afraid Rashed, that fool, might have said something bad about the series.
You don't have to be afraid.
Leave this matter to me.
Sick man
Social drama series
This is what I saw a few days ago on TV.
Long live your majesty.
The series currently airing is called "The Rape of an Unpicked Rose."
The budget you're asking for is way too big.
He needs a large budget.
Then don't forget, may God protect you, that the institution producing this work is a local one.
May God protect you, I'm looking for her hands.
Rest assured, your highness.
I read the artistic page.
We hear these days about the start of filming the series Rape of Conscience.
A massive budget has been allocated for it.
While it is said that the series is not up to par.
The other says the series is a school for teaching deviance.
There is a high chance they will stop filming.
Hello.
Peace be upon you. Hello, hello, Abdulhamid.
Hello, hello, my dear, welcome, welcome, please make yourself comfortable.
Good morning.
Good morning, hello.
I am journalist Elie Mounir, and I have an appointment with Professor Hamed. If you don't mind.
I'm going, but take a rest for a bit because he has a meeting.
Mercury makes us exploit the design and create a cosmic space.
We will contact all the correspondents around the world to get in touch with us.
You're back to work now.
Mercury Company for Artistic Production
# The Crown A captivating series that delves into the lives of the British royal family, offering an insightful exploration of their struggles and triumphs. Each episode is meticulously crafted, presenting a compelling narrative that has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest productions in the history of television.
Do you believe it, who wrote this stuff?
If you have no shame, do as you wish.
Shy is the eye.
"Is it possible that we have journalists like that?"
A journalist should have principles.
Are you coming here?
What are they doing, recording their stances?
I met the minister's assistant yesterday, Sha'oula; you know what he said to me?
I tell you, our series is getting intense, with strange events unfolding.
Tomorrow, the first episode, and I'll watch it with people.
Mom, what do you suggest?
Oh my god, where's my patience? This is just the first episode.
I've never seen anyone talking to themselves except in Gulf TV series.
Then I saw my mother saying, "I'd rather slaughter my children than leave them with you."
My children, art is a matter of taste, not exceptional cases that you bring up and generalize about society and people.
Mom, this might be okay in fine arts, but in drama, it's completely different.
Oh no, don't hurt my head.
They obviously glutted on the Turks.
No way, dad, don't judge me now. At least watch the first five episodes.
The show is trash.
It's a sin to let our children see these things.
Hey, bro, not to that extent.
There are so many worse series out there that get aired.
"This job is not suitable, brother Salim."
By God, it was your mistake.
His hand reached every house.
Go get the people who understand the dimensions and the hidden intricacies of the lines.
Offer it to them.
We're not us anymore.
They are happening.
The minister passed by with his guests.
I went to greet him.
We're the ones who agreed to the series.
"What's the big deal? Who wouldn't like the happiness of the minister?"
Let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleague is the one who posted the insult.
I only download messages that praise the series.
No, no, don't worry, never.
I'll see what's written tomorrow, and I'll post messages from my side, thanking and praising the series. I'll make sure to mention that these readers sent them first.
Insha'Allah.
You can't be happy unless you're content.
For this year.
We have an agreement with him.
The best series in the history of Gulf drama.
They all agree with the minister's envoys.
I'm walking with you, agreed with the journalists.
# Headings, Headings Only
I wish for the conscience to be raped again.
Thank you, Minister of Information, for this series.
Oh, if only they'd bring it back once more.
I was the first one they called from the Minister's office.
You guys, we've released the remaining payments for your salaries.
They can't be blamed for calling you the wizard.
We've barely seen anything yet.
To be honest, we've invested our money and made a profit, and the profit was excellent.
And then, the series is a failure.
The author himself, I speak to him, he tells me he regrets it.
I'm coming now, suggesting a second part of the series to you.
The minister, let's talk man to man.
He got caught up in the story of journalism and the fake success we created.
He said he's not comfortable with the show, deep down.
It's absolutely impossible that he'd agree to a second part for us.
If the minister himself requests a second part.
I can't help but
I must repeat my thanks.
For all employees
In this series.
Congratulations on your victory.
They deserve it.
The truth is that Labor's victory in these prestigious festivals is remarkable.
He is the greatest evidence.
I have no idea why you're saying that.
I'm not a pushover.
# Golden Award, Guaranteed 100% Literacy
Ashkan was telling you.
Readers lie to us, the press lies to us.
They're saying there's a second part. Why doesn't he say so?
As long as you have these Arab TV festivals, you do artistic whitewashing in the Gulf.
# **Laundry Art**
I've heard about money laundering.
Maybe fun.
Illicit funds
The same thing, series.
What are we going to do with 1 and 2?
What are we gonna do?
We've signed a contract with them; they have to abide by it.
Write to them.
Our products are exported abroad, including roti in various types, small and large bread, triangular, and mixed.
We are the ones who signed the contract with them.
Two million dollars
What did you do with the Australian baker?
This is the inventor of roti.
They told you what product he will make.
By God, they told me it's roti, but I don't know what's in it or how it's made.
Please do God give me my bread on credit.
You call it a buckle.
Instead of taking this roti, which you call "sammoun,"
This is the inventor's thought, it simplifies [things].
Roti jeans.
This is the secret.
You eat roti with subza.
Dude, they're doing some really weird stuff.
This set of teeth has a unique design and treatment process, ensuring that as soon as you put them in your mouth, they will melt.
Strawberry, still strawberry, still yogurt, still coffee.
I know how much I've invested in this project.
3 million dollars with patent rights.
Come here, Sameh.
Yes, Abu Nasser.
At your service, Your Honor.
We took her to the river today, Your Highness.
What you say, Samih.
Take your son Nasser yesterday to play Mage Cor with the team he formed.
I agree with him.
The team is a mess, all because of the security guards and drivers.
And then we're considered lacking because we only have one goalkeeper; if he gets injured, we're in trouble.
I should have a fan base by now.
You, the day you took those seventeen employees, as your mother said.
I told you something.
Important people in the company.
Those who form the heart of the company.
The baker's dough is the source of hospitals.
Therefore, he was completely obsessed with the boy.
He told him it's shameful, it's not right, you're from a well-known family, it's not okay to run after a truck and make the world laugh at us.
He does whatever he wants with them, plays with them as he pleases.
No, it shouldn't take the key people who form the heart of the company.
What can I do, mom? My team has a match, and I'm short four players.
We don't want excuses.
What's done is done, now.
Hamdi didn't come to work today, sir.
Get on board. I got on with him.
He told me to wear it.
They made me speak, and they stopped me from speaking.
The match seemed.
I didn't feel anything at all.
They tell me the ball is rolling towards me, but I don't remember.
Do you mean you used to be a goalkeeper?
Just for Nasser's sake.
There is no power or might except with Allah.
May God bless us with this football and all this nonsense.
From today on, Nasser.
There is no such thing as a ball.
Cancel this team you've formed.
All the hobbits returned to the bakeries.
What do you think, then?
Dad, the topic.
I don't want to hear anything from you.
I beg you, Abu Nasser.
Let's hear what the boy has to say, please, I beg you.
I'd do it just for you, Abu Ahmed.
I see, what do you have to say?
Tomorrow we have our last match in the tournament we're playing in.
Don't break his heart, Abu Nasser, please. I'm begging you, please.
Come on, guys!
Congratulations, congratulations!
Good, good, good, happy Eid to you all.
Dear Professor Nasser, I need to talk to you.
May God bless you. My team delivered today.
Mr. Nasser is required.
You promised us a party.
I can make a call and book a hall for you at the hotel.
And all of a sudden, I'll bring the journalists and newspapers over there.
No, Rashid, I'll do it at our place in the majlis.
Because my dad, when he sees the joy, the players, and the victory, he might allow the team to continue.
They won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup.
May God answer your prayer.
LaLa saw pictures with the players and had a press interview with them.
Wako jannah sami, the sports page editor, will conduct an interview with him.
Here is the translation: What a picture!
Don't go far from me.
Oh my God, please make the icon image look decent.
You're telling me you're not happy.
You are attached to your baker sons' victory, I mean the players', with this great achievement.
Fighting spirit.
Effort and energy.
Loyalty to bakeries.
# Al-Makhabeze Team's Formation No offense, but we've been watching Al-Makhabeze team playing in a 4-4-2 formation throughout the tournament.
Loyalty to the bakeries and the coach's plan.
"Thank you, Uncle Abu Nasser."
May God keep you safe.
Here is the guard.
The one who sings about the league and the cup will come to make an interview with you.
No, this tail is not for the council.
They are sending their representative to meet with you for an interview.
They brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup.
We encourage the youth, you know.
Inshallah, I will witness that you will see it in the future.
Yes, goodbye.
She, Mashallah, your phone never stops ringing, and your photos are all over the newspapers. May this ball bring you blessings.
You know he was talking to me.
He lowered the price of the engines for us. He said, "Your wish is my command, Abu Nasser."
I've become famous now, and the newspapers always put my pictures, writing below: "Patron of Sports, First in International Bakeries."
I am far from the ball.
What the heck are you talking about?
I've been like this since I was a kid in middle school.
The kid next to me was playing football.
Do you say stay away from football?
As long as the one in front of me is playing football, I am close to the ball.
I'm almost a sportsman, I'm athletic.
We're not the International Bakeries anymore, we've become the International Stadiums.
Yesterday I heard him say he wants to open a gym.
Sure, and today we meet with the sports guys at the international bakery, Abu Nasser.
To develop football.
Of course, tell us before the match, we want to know your predictions. Before you reach the stage.
The match is tough today.
The team that dominates the midfield will have the upper hand today.
Insha'Allah, we are currently contacting professional player agents to develop the International Bakery team.
His name is Saud. Listen to me, please. Be serious and take the seriousness seriously.
Listen to me, dad, the deal that went by, the players' shipment that came to us.
We didn't gain anything.
I sent you the prices.
We've set the prices at which we sell to the world.
How do you mean, the Gulf is not like the rest of the world?
Of course not.
# Task Description Translate the provided Persian text into English. # Translation This is not your job.
When the Gulf buyer arrives, just let me know.
Keep your socks open.
There are two defenders, one midfielder, and one defensive midfielder.
Take a look, my dear, I'm telling you about those four players.
Three of them are the head.
200,000
I took all the dollars at once, Jack.
Six hundred thousand, I'll give them to you in a briefcase, five hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Sweet, now this is for the empty-headed ones, hey? Now, we're talking about the Brazilian.
This player of the season, he's worth a million and two hundred thousand dollars.
They put this price, but then they send me a fax showing it, where is it? Here it is, just a moment, look at it, look, it's a fax from a club in the UAE.
You are the owner of the challenge, and the challenge is yours.
Received.
Wow, what a handsome man!
How what?
knee knee
Knee is good, the knee.
We won't be fooled if there's a cruciate ligament or something like that.
Hello, my father.
What is the adductor muscle?
# BBQ, go for it! You're the best!
Honestly, well done, Nasser. Great players, the Brazilian and the Argentine. Congratulations, congratulations!
God bless you.
I say, put these cartons in the warehouse, come on, the warehouse.
Māshāllah, you have another business.
No, just players.
I see them lowering the cartons.
Sprouts, yes, sprouts, I'll get them from where, from the jungles of Africa.
Yeah, why not?
My hero has one cartoon.
This human is like us.
He tells you he didn't hear it.
They say these are sprouts.
Now since we're here
Why don't you give us this sprout as an advertisement with them?
I'll say, my father, Abu Nasser, if you take care of him, raise him, and nurture him, he'll be of benefit to you.
Then the national team goes, and then he runs onto the field.
How much, how much, how much, how much.
Take it slow, take it slow on him, it's still tender, it's still tender.
Put it in the annex, bye.
Whatever you need, I have all the players.
If the coach understood this, he would be yours.
We're winning two nil, dominating the match.
Dad, this is my coach in Spain.
I'm not pleased.
The successful coach
The referee manages the game during the match.
North, for example, this is a line. Its opposite is the Al Wakrah line.
Frankly, I won't let your coach do as he pleases.
Dad, the coach hasn't been with the team for even two months.
We need to find a solution with him.
If he understood football, he would have done the flanks instead of attacking through the middle the whole game.
I'm relying on my offside trap.
Oh my god, please don't hurt my head!
He should have withdrawn Kakonumalalawi's allowance.
We are waiting for our guests to arrive and greet them with open arms.
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want him to play.
Shululu habubu taba lava, khala eyouli.
Any line.
Follow the plan.
Who are you?
It's not necessary for there to be a relationship between the manager and the team coach.
Star of the match today, the team's star, scores a super hat-trick. Wow, Jikolamandou!
How do you mean we don't understand football?
Listen up, Sultan.
Let him go home.
Don't send him in the bakery's car, let him take a taxi.
Enough, leave me alone.
Come on, stay on the line with me.
That's really good, what my dad did.
The coach made us sit like this.
What's next?
The team was destroyed.
Go say hello to our team.
Mom, Mom!
You're not okay, you know. He told you to come, and then said, "You're divorced." Tell the truth about what happened between you.
I knew from the first day I saw him, I told your mother, I didn't like this guy.
I don't think he's cut out for responsibility.
Let's skip the unnecessary talk and focus on the present.
May his soul rest in peace. Ask his father about the story. Why did your daughter get divorced?
"I don't know what to tell you, brother Rashid."
Why did he divorce her, then?
Lala, it's not okay, Abu Abdullah. We need to know why the girl got divorced. It's our right to know.
Please, you don't interfere, it's none of your business.
How could I not intervene when the man is sitting right there in the diwaniyah, coming to find out why his daughter got divorced?
She who doesn't know how to appreciate her husband and respect his feelings.
Barcelona, who is she?
You can't blame me, I don't speak Spanish.
Barcelona, she's not just one.
This is Guardiola's team.
I'll go to the guy who's waiting for me in the diwaniyah now.
If you go, I'll go too. Fine, stay here. Get out of it, you can't raise your daughters properly.
Keep the door shut, don't shake your head like that.
Aye, she couldn't bear to leave Barcelona's team.
Messi, the wizard of the ball, never plays a match without scoring a hat-trick.
Maradona, as he is, said that Messi will turn out better than me.
Your daughter, who has no shame, dares to insult me. See what happens now.
Your daughter is neither a Barcelona fan nor one of us.
Why specifically this talk of yours?
Listen to me, may God guide you.
To be you is my intention, my child.
He should go apologize to her and make it up to her.
You stink.
And then, thank God, we have plenty of good things.
Our home is our happiness, where we raise our children.
Why, come on now.
I'll find you a Barcelona fan to marry.
Mom, I'm not upset.
Do you understand, mother? Let it go, forget about her, she's gone to hell.
Hack jay hack ya yamma.
Do you even realize, my dear, that they are the real losers?
You are the one and only I desire.
Hack, oh mother!
It's a sin, you broke my heart.
Poor thing, she hasn't been painted in two days.
Alas, their marriage lasted only a month.
What's wrong with you guys? Do you want to get me involved with him?
Mom, I don't want to get into trouble with him.
You and who told you that load of rubbish that doesn't make any sense?
Don't worry about her.
Do you have any idea if this one will turn out to be a boy?
What do you want?
Blessed with provision.
You're telling me about the building I wanted to buy and turn into a furnished apartment hotel.
I'm in Mansoura.
His right, meaning tomorrow when his son takes our daughter, I'll ask him for the building.
If you can
Talk to her brother.
Listen carefully.
I wish my father was a millionaire.
Do you know what it means to be a millionaire?
Opportunity knocks but once.
You know they have a palace in Spain just to summer in every year, out of sheer extravagance.
Okay, so the Barcelona story, how does that work?
The girls' family might have started this rumor to prove their daughter's innocence.
Let's assume the story is true, and the man truly loves Barcelona and is loyal to Catalonia.
His wife should respect that.
We don't make mistakes with the team.
"That's if we assume the story is true."
May God preserve his father, we call him Abu Burjayn because he has two towers on the corniche.
They are intertwined like a strange rope, wrapped around each other.
People who see them from afar think they are one tower.
Welcome to you, good fortune has come to you.
Ahlan wa sahlan biman yatawalla.
May God keep you safe. Go on, give me your hand. Eat something, may God keep you safe.
Thank you, darling.
My dear, please let me know, my son Abdullah is eagerly awaiting your response.
No, oh mother of Abdullah, don't worry, my dear.
I searched the entire GCC, and I couldn't find anyone better than you.
Oh my God, tell them to give us their estimates for the construction of the building.
I've finished, Your Highness. Please command me, may your years be long.
The family is calling you.
Get the wedding list ready, prepare the check, and I'll sign it.
In the name of God, as God wills. Excuse me, sir/madam.
"After the response, Abdullah divorced her."
May my children prosper, and may wealth be abundant.
May God bless you, my auntie.
You put it on for warmth.
I have no idea where mom booked us.
Mom, I'm saying, where did you book us?
My mom says she booked us a trip to Malaysia.
What's wrong with Malaysia? Let's go!
Goodbye.
What's wrong with you? Who comes back from their honeymoon crying?
What's wrong, my dear? Tell me.
Tell me what's going on, mom.
She's so full of herself, Mom.
Why does she think she's so great?
She's arrogant, let her be.
Mom, good job sending her back to her parents' house.
You broke my heart.
Hi mom.
Okay, what's wrong with that?
What happened to it?
May God keep you safe. Don't forget to bring us some olive oil from Spain.
Spain, then where should we go?
Okay then
My mom says she booked us for the Maldives.
AI, it's okay, mom, the Maldives is nice too.
Congratulations, may you have a good time, God willing.
Now I said you're coming back happy from the trip.
What annoys me, mom, why does he take the kids?
Come here and pick up the bag.
What's going on between them?
What's wrong, my dear?
Shut up, you and whoever dares to teach me about my son's face.
What's wrong, my dear? What's bothering you?
When I see the scales, I get depressed.
No one will ever dare to upset you, my dear mother.
Let her go, just divorce her, divorce her. Don't worry about her, your father's money is abundant, and there are plenty of other girls.
Shut up, you and whoever's with you, my boy. I know him well. What does he want and why is he causing trouble?
Go on, mom, call her and divorce her.
May God be pleased with her.
Weh weh, say it three times.
You are divorced, right now, right now, don't you dare do it again, twice more.
Divorced. Divorced.
Oh my, he's so irritable.
Enough, my dear, go, my love, go and rest, take the burden off your mind. Girls are like feathers, they are carried on a breath of wind, as they say. Go, my dear.
Oh, problem.
Just because he saw us at the disco.
Ring him, ring him, let me talk to him.
He's yelling at me, please let me go, divorce me! He said, "You are divorced, divorced."
Why do you let him get away with such shameless behavior? He's truly disrespectful.
Now, when I go to the club alone, what will happen to me?
And sometimes, when needed, I shake it, and nothing happens.
There's nothing wrong with that. What do you mean, it's the end of the world?
I'm Orij, and I won't go to his house now, wash his sails, and then he won't know if you're a girl or not.
I, I, oh Abu Abdullah, my daughter is getting divorced.
I'm getting my daughter divorced.
A feather sprouted on her head.
Do you sell and buy them from Toys "R" Us stores?
He's burning up like Yufaj now because of your daughter and my anger.
We all did nothing, poor things.
Mama peeled the apple for you, let her go.
It's fine with me, go ahead and shoot them as you wish.
She is married to a real man.
This is a mess, let it go to hell.
Drink from the cup that you made God's creatures drink from.
What your heart doesn't desire
Do not wish for others what you do not wish for yourself.
Do you know where this complex used to belong?
In a strategic location.
Oh, leave it to God.
I won't buy it for such a cheap price.
I am standing.
I need to get Bu Saqr's approval.
Yeah, I went to his office, but I couldn't find him.
I went to him the week before, they told me he was traveling.
I need to get paid today or tomorrow at the latest. My situation is on hold; the problem is that I need Abu Saqr's approval.
Go to the council.
No, no, no, no, this is official business.
May God protect him, the office is not the house.
He eats afterward.
Back is Bo Saqr, what will satiate him?
Listen, everyone has their own key.
Hey, tell me, Abu Fahd.
You don't know me.
I don't know him. I only saw him on TV, and you didn't tell me you met him during the pilgrimage.
I don't know you well enough.
May God cut off your idle talk.
May God guide you, you couldn't wait, you started the engine and went, at least ask why this invitation.
Is this an appropriate time for this, may God guide you?
The month has thirty days, and he cooks dinner fifty times.
I suggest, Your Highness, that they put you in the Guinness Book of World Records.
The most in the world who makes dinner.
Don't I know who this guy is that's with you?
Hello, what a pleasant surprise! God bless this hour.
It is an honor for us, Your Highness.
Hey, son of a farmer.
Do you say that Abu Saqr cooks dinner every day?
This is what we see.
Enough, Abu Falah, tonight's dinner is a special occasion.
Today, God bless you, your son, Falcon.
Mashallah, he deserves it, your highness, congratulations.
Absher, ya walad al-halal, on his mention, welcome, my father.
Hello.
What's up?
On this occasion, my son, Falcon, will go to the agency tomorrow and choose the car he wants.
I've been waiting for approval for a year and a half.
# Current Halt
I just arrived there.
Good luck.
May God guide you, oh Abu Saad.
Things don't happen like that.
I told him, enough is enough.
Emer inspects and chooses the car he likes.
We buy him three.
I'll take you there.
I'm all by myself, taking myself there.
You didn't tell me you met him last year during the pilgrimage.
Today, Shahin's little son was born.
Ah, his evening game.
This is your chance.
Pass by him and wish him well.
He deserves safety, Your Highness.
My falcon, oh father of the hawk.
May God keep you safe. You are all safe.
Praise be to God for the safe return of our son, the long-lived Shahin.
May God keep you safe, and
Are you there, brother?
Long live your life.
Didn't you recognize me?
By God, I'd lie for you.
I was with you during the Umrah, Your Highness, last year.
I even remember buying a red rosary.
I am Allah, may He protect you.
I was at the hospital.
I see one of our children.
I would be honored to meet you.
I'm still hesitant, should I go into business or have I made up my mind?
I wanted to be with him, my brother.
Why, my dear Falcon, trade is a good thing.
You never set up an office and see.
Bo Soqar
Long live, don't turn me down, just say yes.
What's up?
Hadia Sagher is with me.
Full circle.
If trade favors you and comes your way, you'll tell it you don't need it.
I'm like you today, everything is available to me. Since you got your license, alhamdulillah, the world has opened up for you. A free car and the best office on the corniche.
Yesterday, Abu Abdulaziz said to your father that if Saqr wants to enter the business, he will bring him in as a partner with a fifty percent share.
Mom, how can I balance trade and university?
Mom, don't force me into something I don't like.
You're doing great, my man. Agencies, offices, and cars are all free for you.
Opportunity, my son, in these times, one can start a business without any capital.
You are your father's capital, his love from the people.
Stay smart and invest in it.
Believe me, son, this is the opportunity of a lifetime.
Get the lunch ready quickly!
Mashallah, he has finally reached the rent and pepper.
Leave nothing, leave nothing, I'm afraid he'll get the samosa franchise tomorrow.
I see your business potential.
This is what you were begging for; do you know what he said today?
Mom, tell me, I want to expand further in my investments.
He wants to dip his toes in the Caribbean Sea and invest in those islands.
He is beyond the reach of envious eyes.
# Business Success "Boss Sultan told me yesterday that your son has just entered the business world."
He has twenty agencies, seven restaurants, and is a shareholder in two banks.
"I gave him a hard time, a tough nut who doesn't give up easily."
It seems, God knows best, that they haven't opened it yet.
Oh, it's him from the northern region of our office, what's wrong?
I really want it.
May God protect you, may He bless you. Congratulations, Abbas.
In the name of God
May God bless you.
He who regrets, gains nothing.
What the hell? A whole year of hard work and struggle to set up the supermarket.
What's going on? It seems he comes by every day.
He's such a jerk, this secretary; his name is Samir.
Say to him, this is Saqr, son of Abu Saqr. He wants to partner with you instead of taking the shop from you.
I'm with you, partner.
There is no might or power except by Allah.
I guess you started chatting with him again.
Who asked you who the brother is?
I told him to buzz off.
Why do you tell him you have an Iranian baker?
When we were walking by this shop, didn't you see the small sign with the name on it?
Fereej Bakery
No, I want a different name.
Peace be upon you.
How's the work with you guys?
# Project Update: "Good, Your Highness. God willing, we'll finish the workers' housing plan for Al-Mustaqbal Company tomorrow or the day after."
# Madame, Monsieur, Elisa # Monsieur Sar became my husband. Do you know Monsieur Sar, Elisa? He is the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?
Let her take one of the company cars.
Thank you so much, you're very kind.
This cooking is also a science and requires study.
Today, this guy comes up to me and says he works in business, has a few million, and wants to invest them.
However, he lacks any knowledge, understanding, or formal education in economics, let alone business.
One like this.
He thinks he'll succeed, but I think he's wasting his time and he'll lose.
I heard you, Abu Nasser.
I heard those two nightingales talking.
That's some talk.
This is what you have, my son, Falcon, Mashallah.
"Look at him, what a talented guy, Mashallah."
Find it today.
Long live the king, we are not talking about your son, Falcon.
We're talking about the base.
Your son is a falcon, Mashallah, and may Allah protect him. He is exceptional.
He says, talk about the base.
We raised a falcon, my son built himself.
He gave him a car as a gift once.
He sold it, invested the money, and gave me some advice, which he himself followed.
Alhamdulillah, have you seen them?
We're talking about ordinary people.
He became one of them, and that's exactly what they did to him. Abu Nasser took him and put his hand on the road.
Mā shā Allāh ʿalayhi ṣaqr ʿindah mawāhib tajāriyyah. He has commercial talents, what a guy!
Mighty economic tendencies.
We need to ask who his father is.
It's a shame, I'm truly amazed, my God.
Masha'Allah.
Gulf Wealth Magazine in the Economic Poll
Please, go ahead.
Hello, hello, Salim.
I hope nothing's wrong.
My God, I don't know what to tell you, Salim.
Yes, I told you so.
I heard the whole story, it's true.
They say the company sent a fax to your father.
They said to him, "That's it."
Our home endured.
Just as you see.
He heard the news and couldn't believe it.
He fell in the office and the fax in his hand.
He favored him over others.
He taught me archery, and when I became strong, I was shot by him.
What did the doctor say now?
Pray for him, Salim.
I am shocked.
Who am I in this world?
A man gives to the poor with his right hand, so that his left hand does not know.
This association, of course, delivers its donations to all Muslims across Asia and Africa.
Of course, I'd like you to explain to us, Your Highness, about your goals and future steps, God willing.
بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Our goal at the Saqr Charity Association is to achieve solidarity within this nation.
In addition to sixty blankets for our brothers affected by the earthquakes in Pakistan.
We are also finally supporting seven poor families.
A monthly salary of one hundred and thirty-two riyals only.
We're not late for you, guys.
I'll be there soon, right after this.
My love.
This is Khalid and his wife inviting us over to the hotel tonight.
Yes, by God, any place, any place, you and I will be happy there.
My life, may God keep you safe, oh Lord.
Oh, my heart's desire.
It's a sin, this is my livelihood.
This is a bakery.
Take your money and may it be of use to you.
Five riyals for beans, three riyals for bread.
Two linen ones.
Bāj-e panj-e bājleh-ye zeyn-e zeyn.
Sweet six six chickpeas.
Come on, you lazybones!
The captain arrived and brought breakfast.
He wants men.
Please, your highness.
What now?
I insist on getting a clear and enthusiastic "yes" from you; I want to hear it echoing in my ears.
Hello, Nora.
Al-Anoud is upset with you.
Why do I care about your anger?
God willing, all will be well.
Why are you sad?
Nora's story is simple and straightforward.
She'll get mad if you say things like that, A'anoud.
Why do the Lebanese have such a sweet tongue?
Don't overcomplicate things and engage in lengthy discussions with him.
I'm jealous of you, too.
You're the most beautiful Nawara, and you're wearing the most beautiful dress.
Let's call her Nawara, and then he says, "Nawara."
Free home, only a few left.
I paid twenty thousand, and he paid twenty thousand riyals.
Congratulations, may God bless you.
God be with you.
Hello, Your Highness, Mrs. Saleh.
Hey Fadi, looks like you're busy, I don't want to keep you.
My eyes, at your service.
Hello, hello!
The message arrived yesterday.
Got here, you bore.
I found the joke amusing.
Sure, here is the translation: "Okay, did you bring the design with you?"
I didn't have time to make them; show me your designs, and I'll choose from them.
Honestly, your taste is the best.
They make me work out of envy.
The day I realized my project went perfectly and started bringing in profits.
Do you tell her there's one who will do a project like mine?
# Design and Tailoring Studio
Women's clothing.
This is Bu Nasser, who has nothing to do with trade.
Your money is available.
# His cousin's son
I'm feeling like this these days.
"It's good, it's good, my cousin's son."
Do you believe it, I was sleeping, they woke me up saying your cousin is asking for you.
May it be for good, God willing. Go ahead, my dear.
God willing, it's good.
Oh, if only.
Do you have any plans to start a new project, like, for example?
Let it be, man. Do you want a partner or something?
I heard they say you intend to, I said I might drop by.
Hello and welcome!
I need more money.
Alhamdulillah, the work is excellent.
What can I do, oh father Saleh?
We're late, let's extend it for a week, the last one.
Yes, indeed.
May God be with us. Goodbye, God willing.
He remains.
Are you sure?
She has the details, and you have no idea about the biggest problem.
What else?
It's the rent for the shop next to yours.
You jealous, you envious.
Before I realized that the market is open to everyone.
I need to get to know you.
Your heart has to be open to your cousin.
I'm here, I'm asking you.
She disguises herself, attracts me, and laughs at me. She acts as if she's doing it to me.
I wanted to do my work as a team.
You're taking the adhesive spot in my place, it's ruined for me.
By God, but they didn't say come here, sit in my mouth near the wisdom tooth, you bitch.
This is envy, this is hatred, by God, by God, I'm struggling with it, it's hatred, it's destroying me.
Are you guys locals?
"No problem, my friend."
Hit him hard, man, I'll give you a good beating, you know. Oh, you with the big mouth, you.
I reached out my hand, just as you reached out yours, and I held on to my bite.
Oh come on, guys!
Oh, my fellow people, send blessings upon the Prophet.
I didn't do anything, I swear to God.
He advised me to hire a designer from the Philippines.
No one can fool you.
Why, why, why just a Lebanese?
Chatting and joking around with him, having a good laugh, and just being super comfortable with each other.
I see Abu Saleh has brought a Lebanese person.
He kept telling me and trying to convince me.
He bewitched me with his words.
He convinced me and made me pay twelve thousand riyals.
I'm going to the auction market in two days, and I'll find its twin brother there for nine hundred riyals, I swear to God.
I don't understand your request. Could you please clarify what you would like me to translate?
Bring me a Lebanese designer.
Could I meet with the professor? Yesterday you told me it was difficult, and today it's still difficult.
I swear, today is also very difficult.
I feel like Abu Saleh has been acting differently these past few days.
What's up?
I don't know what's going on.
Abu Saleh is very mentally exhausted after his cousin opened a shop and hired a Lebanese designer like himself.
I've been struggling with the store's sales for two weeks now.
Why is it that in Qatar, no Qatari can open a business without another Qatari coming and copying the same business idea and opening a similar shop right next door? Can I go in and talk to him?
La la la la ma'a al-mussamim Fadi hala wa 'um bifikru bi-hal.
How could this happen now?
We're sitting in heaven, eating candy.
If we continue like this, I don't think we'll even cover the rent for the shop.
A place far away from them, that's what it means.
Clear the stage for them.
Okay, thank you. How much is the discount?
What do you mean? God willing, you won't give away evening gowns for free with every wedding dress.
What's up, mate?
What's up? What's going on? I'm heading to the store near you today; they're offering a promotion: for every wedding dress, you get two evening gowns for free, and there's an additional 25% discount!
Come on, let's go! Let's go!
# Wedding Dress Dilemma No way! I've been waiting for two weeks, and they're going to wear the same dress again? Make one wedding dress, and get two for free with a 25% discount!
They are fighting us.
I'm thinking the same way because if we leave them, they'll ruin our home tomorrow.
No problem.
What's up, mate?
This is a challenge, and quite a big one.
It's a family challenge.
Well done, you're doing the right thing to that ungrateful person. He doesn't want anyone else to have a chance.
You'll get the news in a couple of days, or maybe three, if you don't close the shop once and for all.
Well done!
Stay sweet, stay sweet. I'm coming, I'm coming to you now. I'm coming, let's go. Bye.
What's going on?
Saad says the store is unbearable, you can't sit there, there's a foul smell. He says he doesn't know where it's coming from.
The smell has nothing to do with the AC, no.
Her scent lingers in the store, at least six days or more.
100%
Hooray at night!
Power cut at the store.
This is fair.
Now, you will sign an undertaking, or we will file a lawsuit and open a case.
I'll do something for you.
# The End of Existence
Hey, Uncle Bunasser, something weird is going on; no one's coming into the shop.
Uncle Abu Nasser is drunk, drunk; there's a customer coming to me, I'll talk to you later. It's strange.
He's lying in his bed, unconscious.
I was just in a bad mood, my brother. I was afraid to tell him that the bank called and wanted the installments.
Debts piled up on him because of his unlucky cousin.
What happened this time?
If you accidentally enter the shop and see designer Saad, scream at him and run away from him.
I am sleeping, and he is staring at the ceiling with his eyes wide open.
I have no idea what happened to me.
Saad found the shop.
He bewitched me, I don't know what he did to me.
When you see women, you invent [something] out of fear.
I have no idea what it is.
He lost me, he lost me.
Add me, brother, please.
I'm afraid they'll lock me up.
I have no evidence against him so I can't go and complain about him.
I have no idea what he did, I have no idea what he did.
Let him have it.
He who submits to you, tell him what kind of magic did you do to him that you turned the designer into a beast and women are afraid when they see him.
Rumors spread about him.
Hey, whatever happens, tell them the photography crew needs him urgently.
Oh my dear, may God protect you, tell him they need you urgently, urgently.
I'm sorry, I'm having trouble understanding the text you provided. It seems to be in a language other than English. Could you please clarify the language of the original text so I can provide an accurate translation?
My dear Ahmed, my love, calm down, don't get so upset. You have a sensitive heart, this is not good for you, my boy.
I called him, my ears are ringing, but it's no use, these extras are driving me crazy, driving me crazy.
You're not doing anything, everything is on my shoulders.
You old man, I'll put the hot desert sand on you.
# Episode 25 Scene 16 Let's go, Ahmed! We need to finish this.
And so what? Should I stop filming because of some extras?
This production is awful.
Well, I don't know why Professor Abdullah is bothering me. Why is he doing this to me?
My love, no one can disturb you.
What's up, Abdullah?
Late extras, caught in a bind.
Oh Ahmed, I don't want anyone but you, my love.
# Mission: Convincing the Masses Hey, give me one, a real charmer, Who can persuade folks he's a millionaire, A billionaire, no less, it's quite the feat, Not just anyone can pull off this treat.
Sir, please enter the image room and your request will be ready within half an hour.
Not just anyone, Ala'a, not just anyone. I'm still trying to explain it to him. I tell him,
I'll manage it myself, two scenes after this one.
You must take responsibility, and as the production manager, you must take responsibility.
They are just hanging out.
They'll do anything, man. The director is pissed, and the situation is in God's hands. They're just going to have to wing it.
I need a guy with specific attributes, catch him, this is urgent.
Are you serious?
I didn't hear what the director said.
I have one, may God help you with him, hopefully he will be useful.
SS Saud Akhnar
I am the Saud who knows about cans, not the one from Aknar.
This is the day when he was small, they called him As'ud Ak'nar, and when he grew up, they called him Qwaty.
Why cans?
I'll tell you why he's so pitiful; he roams the streets, collects empty cans, and sells them by the kilogram.
My brother, sing and be proud, don't be ashamed.
His shape has to match this one, look at this one, the one I know is good like this, and I'll be right back, it has no length or width.
It definitely works.
Inshallah, as soon as I tell you, your makeup will be perfect, his light-hearted humor will be a great addition.
I'm ready, so what are you waiting for? Let's talk.
I don't have the number.
I'll just take Amir with me and go to him.
Where is Saud's house?
What's he saying?
Shut up, shut up!
Saud Qwāṭī
In our neighborhood, there's a guy named Saud Al-Qawati.
Yes, I'm sure he's in the neighborhood, but I forgot which house.
This is a house where a man named Saud lives, only with his mother.
Yes, absolutely.
That's it, not Saudi cans.
This is Saud's laptop.
He's definitely the one, as he evolves with time, just like a laptop resembles a jackass.
He is tall, sturdy, and a bit wheatish.
They canceled the faggots and started to suppress the laptops of the damned. Come on, come on, come on, oh my!
I'm going to the vegetable market to buy it for you. Where's the other one?
By God, dad, I don't know.
These are the ones she always wears.
I have another one, mom. Where is the other scarf?
The right of the people.
This is what I've been looking for, where has it been?
Fox and Bovas.
Dad, iron them a bit before they come out all wrinkled.
I've been feeling a bit down lately.
Mom, God save you from last night, I feel so sorry for you, I want to take you to the emergency room, I want to take you to the emergency room, but you keep saying no.
Oh my god, they told me they'd give me [something].
Alhamdulillah, this is it, dad. Look at the work instead of your idle sitting.
Oh come on, mom, goodbye.
I get angry and react impulsively, acting foolishly and getting carried away.
Stay still for a bit, move slowly, and keep the camera with you. Move, but keep your eyes on the ground.
Yes, Jafar, yes.
Laptop, who is this?
Ay Aboud Al-Riyal is a great actor Abdullah Al-Lama'.
This is for you, I'm Fadi Abboud's son. How are you?
Hello, my servant.
Calm down, man, you're here, respect yourself a little in front of people.
The kid from our neighborhood.
Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, oh no, oh no.
I love acting, I hope they give me a role where I can shine.
By God, my brother, this is not like you.
I'm so tired, man, I swear, last night I couldn't sleep at all, bro.
Asthma, God heal.
May God heal her.
I'm falling in love.
Oh teacher, oh teacher!
He has his mother's asthma medication.
I am a doctor, not a director.
May evil befall you; listen to what he's saying; you have no idea what you're talking about.
What's her name?
Shame on you. What do you think?
I heard what they say about you.
Do you say he's light? Make him a bit heavier. Heavier.
Give me, give me, give me, give me half a million for fixing my car's flat tire.
Give him three million, and he'll bring me dinner.
Tony, I'm asking you why you're talking like that.
Because I'm heavy, as per some people's requests.
# **English Translation:** Hey, oblivious teacher, our neighborhood's output is actors on a high level.
Currently, excellent, they've got the right person for the role.
Sweet, and I'll help you too. I'm a viewer, I don't have anything, do I?
Hey, your house is beautiful.
By God, it's springtime.
He took the professor and brought him to the makeup room, did his makeup, and Salman, God willing, will bring you the clothes and get them ready for you.
Walk, walk, walk. It's really nice.
AI AI
Listen, bro, leave the car with us until we finish shooting; I'll call you when we're done, and you can come and pick it up.
Don't worry, I'll just get a ride.
You're welcome, my brother. I'll make sure it reaches you. I'll let them know. It will reach you soon. Thank you.
Come on, let's call our buddy, the extra. Go on, call him! Come on!
Hey guys, Nado is using a laptop in the makeup room.
Let him clean his teeth, man.
What is written in front of me.
Oh God, let me speak.
I'm done, I can't take it anymore.
I never thought you'd do such a thing.
We're not keeping quiet about what?
We are not silent about our rights.
Wait, be patient.
I know who I'm talking to, Mr. Abdulaziz.
Why the hell did you divorce her, man?
Just divorce her, just divorce her.
We don't take the daughter of a thief.
No, it's not necessary. What do you think?
He will clean up, but later. The important thing is that you get ready and go into the changing room to change your clothes. We are all set for the photoshoot.
# Dental Gold اظروسي غالي مال الاسنان
Hey, guys, this scene is difficult to shoot.
Why?
We don't want any more tea, man. We're bored, my stomach is bloated from all the tea. What is this? We've been waiting for an hour. How much longer do we have to wait?
Dad, I haven't seen anything yet, it's normal.
May God grant you well-being.
Swift, Mashallah.
May God protect you, may you live a long life, farewell, and may God keep you safe.
Hello, everyone.
They say Bouabdellaziz sends his regards.
God willing, may your life be long, God willing.
Sweeties.
Assyriak wishes you peace, loves the scent of your presence.
The first time someone loves me unconditionally.
How do they let them walk all over them?
Problematic issues
# Translation: His nose is like a broken ice cream stick. Ouch, your lips are sweet, sweet.
By God, you're the one who made me laugh.
No problem.
I can be a great actor.
I hope nothing's wrong. What's wrong with your voice?
Dad, dad, I'm tired, wait for me.
Come quickly.
Hello, my dear sheikh, hello.
Look around here, or look on your own.
Listen to me,
Yes, let's go.
I see the respects are excessive.
What's happening, dad?
Peace be upon you. What's up, your highness?
Khali, khali, khali, khali.
Don't worry, God willing, you'll be fine, Doctor Hassan. Come, come.
Yes, Dr. Hani, what's up?
Let him rest in the office, Your Highness.
We haven't talked in a while.
Everyone, God willing, will recover safely.
Welcome, welcome, Your Majesty, welcome.
Shut up or I'll punch you in the face.
I am Abu Abdulaziz.
Call me, say uncle.
How are you, uncle?
By God, what a beautiful face!
Yes, Your Highness.
Please, professor, have a seat and relax.
May God bless you all.
My dear chef.
Go with peace, Professor Rashid.
By God, if he doesn't do anything for you, let me know and I'll show you.
My friend, can I get a doctor quickly?
Doctor, my mother is sick and...
Wait for your turn, it's your turn, your turn.
Listen to me,
Could I have a companion?
Dad, quickly, I'm feeling unwell.
Oh, you take your mother to the hospital so often, every week, yet I've never seen any of them, and they're so nice, they agree to the smallest thing.
I'm not like the girls from here.
Leave the local girls alone.
Alright then, find yourself a nurse.
I'm in a bad mood.
Man, you never give me any respect.
Get close to her, smile at her, give her the eye, and give her your number, with good intentions.
There's nothing.
Respect yourself.
I'll be damned if I talk to security so I can speak to you.
LaLa, no, I don't want anything.
Leak is not necessary.
We want it.
La la, thank you.
Could you take it and go?
He who speaks to you is Fawz Al-Marzooq.
Will you marry him? I mean, will you marry him?
I want the bisht, I want the thobes, and I want the car too, I'll rent it from you.
May Allah reward you with goodness.
La la la, wait a moment.
Oh my God.
What the hell is this? A brave man, the coward.
Hello and welcome! God bless those who have come to us. Hello!
I saw her yesterday with my own eyes.
I wish you had come.
I tell you, they were impressed by what I did for them. It was a very elegant and unique party.
One regular, the other diet.
You've got no excuse now.
What is this?
Mom, I'm meeting the guys at work tomorrow.
Inshallah, you'll take this to them.
Why is he sick?
Noura, come here.
What is this?
Budi does all the crazy stuff for his boys, for the lulz.
Everyone talks about us because of your attitude.
Give me the money, and tomorrow I'll go buy you something nice.
I'll meet them now.
I have to take it tomorrow.
No problem, they're open now. Go get ready so we can go get something to brighten our faces in front of people.
What's wrong with you guys, come on!
The price is reasonable and the quality is very good.
Above average, not the highest quality.
There's chocolate for the chef, but sorry, I thought maybe you wanted the suitable price.
Tonight's game is expensive, why do we have to go to the most expensive one?
It's impossible, check out this artistic touch.
Heidi is the name of the royal chocolate.
The same chocolate that the Spanish royal family always orders.
Give me this.
Congratulations, and by the way, it also comes with a warranty certificate.
Welcome, welcome, rejoice!
Come on, my brother, give us some of that chocolate, my brother.
I wonder what the occasion is, wolf.
No, Saleh Abdulqadir, the one in the accounting department.
Congratulations, he deserves it. Come here, give me one. Come on.
Let's grab some coffee quickly.
Aunt, I went to their wedding.
My love, I went to their wedding, it was a total disaster, it was so annoying. Can you believe it, my sister...
I listened to your aunt's words.
I want to throw you a wedding like no other.
We're almost there, we only have a month and a half left.
I'm organizing everything.
Enough already, he's leaving me be.
You're not living in the community; you don't see people putting their wealth and possessions on display during their weddings.
I saw you myself.
When I bought you something decent, I saw how they praised you and your taste.
They said it's wonderful and nice.
That's right, but how much did we pay?
The money we paid for the coffee will buy four sheep for the wedding.
If you surrender, don't involve your mother. She knows how to do everything. Your job is to give her the money and that's it.
They basically agree with whatever we choose.
You've got no taste at all, man!
What do you think about the helicopter?
Discrimination costs more money.
Why, why, the one that passed was beautiful.
What do you think about this?
First time in Qatar's history, someone is thinking of having a wedding carriage shaped like a computer mouse.
Sure, just a sec.
Look, don't talk about everything except the wedding stage and preparations. This is the place where the women will sit and do nothing but talk. Just be quiet.
The real is waiting for us.
We want this luxurious canopy.
Strange corner
Guess the model of 2011.
We've got the mouse.
Take it easy, man, it's for your own good.
# Mission: Choose whether you want to add $20,000 to the price of Noah's Ark or $125,000 to the price of the Ferrari.
Ready, we're here.
You're not the first one to get married.
I think you're kidding if you think you're getting married in the Comoros. That's the country's power cord.
We've barely started yet.
If you want a corner, then where will the bride sit in the canopy?
Iron, paint, and a bit of wood finishing.
People are happy.
They're exploiting us, lying to us, these are scammers, originally.
You mean, what does that mean now?
I'm upset and angry.
I've changed my mind, I don't want to get married anymore.
I speak to the bride's mother and tell her that Saleh has difficult circumstances.
He doesn't want to get married, he can't afford the wedding expenses. It's okay, I'll talk to her. I'm serious, I'll talk to her.
We received a bouquet of flowers from the Netherlands today.
I'll put them on the tables at the wedding.
Absolutely, for the first time in Doha.
The Middle East and beyond.
Put it on the bill.
It means how much more.
I am seventy-two; that's it.
Be careful, Samir. I don't want to see this mess at the wedding of weddings.
Do you know what people say?
Consider them booked.
You make more money than me.
If you open a door, you can't close it.
May God help you, Saleh.
Enough, man! God guide you, you should've tried to keep things under control a bit.
I'm planning to go and find the right woman from any Arab country, thank God.
They tell you the wedding party won't cost you more than a thousand, two thousand dollars, and I'll jump.
May God bless you, my love.
God willing, his wedding is next month.
You just tell me how many cards and I'll take care of the rest.
They may not have served their purpose, but the important thing is that people know they are invited, where, and at what time.
This is all that matters to you, you don't care what people say.
They judge the wedding by the invitations.
I'll know what people are saying when they see these cards tomorrow.
May they choke on their wedding, considering these are their invitations; they didn't see the invitations of so-and-so and so-and-so.
We didn't say that, we're ordering it online.
Her jacket is made of panda fur, and it has two huge buttons.
You can't be blamed, but I don't care about you.
I don't become a doctor for the sake of women's cards, I ask for them, I mean I ask for them.
By God, I feel so sorry for you, my brother.
Poor guy, they must be pressuring him hard.
You're real, no one should refuse to borrow from you.
What are you talking about? He even sold his car.
He looked like he was twenty years old, this morning I saw him walking and talking to himself.
Don't blame him, my brother, he's so unfortunate. I don't know when we'll develop.
Close the door, please.
Forgive me, my brother.
You never tried to convince them to have a wedding within your means.
What do you mean, like, for my level?
Why am I living all alone?
The problem is that our society is sick with appearances, boasting, and arrogance.
You are obliged to be sick with the same illness.
If you want to live there.
I once saw the mother of the bride's rights.
I wanted nothing but my clothes.
Leave it to God.
Come, tell me.
How did you get married?
I don't want to marry a crazy person.
And then, my brother, even if I decide to get married.
I'm considering taking a foreign girl, even an Arab one.
I swear, your country tells me.
We were planning to get a DJ for the songs.
Mrs. Umm Nasser brought the money for her son's wedding, that singer.
This singer is famous, but I can't remember his name.
What's wrong with your nose?
Paradise is not pleasing you with what I'm doing.
Akfaiyah sold his car, and every day one of his friends gives him a ride.
I entered the room quietly, and found him talking to himself.
I notice your words have changed now.
My brother Saleh is so tired, mother, please.
I don't care about you or him.
I'm no less than anyone else.
Don't make us a joke.
She who marries you, oh my dear mother, my brother spent all he had and didn't leave anyone without borrowing from them.
If you keep quiet, you'll be the one to benefit.
My mother has new demands for the wedding, and my brother told her he would cancel the wedding; he no longer wants to get married.
Now, where am I?
Inside the Isoon, there are first aid supplies.
He says, "Thank goodness, they'll arrange a room for her at the hospital."
"The scandalous couple."
Chill out, my sister.
Doctor said you shouldn't talk and gave you an injection so you don't have to stay overnight.
Where can I relax, and he'll let us be a joke for anyone and everyone?
He says, "Bring us Abdullah Arooshid," and he replies, "I don't have any money."
Therefore, your mother.
I was afraid for her.
Soul, she has a soul, kiss her on the head.
"And tell her I'll do what you want."
Beeb laj Abdullah Al-Rowaished.
Boyusuf is kind, I don't think he will let me down.
It's a shame you couldn't find anyone but Bouyoussef.
What's wrong with her, okay?
You're welcome, Saleh.
I'll leave the minister alone because he's an old man, and on top of that, he's well-behaved and trustworthy.
I think if you went and said to him what you told me, there's a good chance his heart would stop.
I understand.
You want to ask Boyusuf for money, of course from the ministry's funds, because of the crappy crisis you're going through.
God knows when you'll return them to him.
Hey, if the auditing team doesn't show up, ask him about the money.
Sure, let's go to hell, of course.
No one knows how he'll act later.
By God, how is the real estate agent doing in his office while you're bearing the responsibility if anything happens?
In my old age, I embezzle.
# Our Uncle, They Call It Embezzlement
In the first drawer.
In a white can with a blue stripe, there is a circle that looks like an image of a dove. Daddy, bring it, bring it!
Inshallah, Uncle Bouyoussef, I would, but my circumstances are difficult.
I'll be back.
Call me Boyusuf.
# My Final Chapter You are my last breath of life.
You're fucking killing me, Thursday.
Saleh Saleh
Hassan, listen carefully, I swear if it was anyone else, they would have been in big trouble by now. Don't you dare do anything, or something might happen to you, Khalid.
Saleh Saleh
All the methods I've tried are useless, Uncle Boyoussef; I'm drowning, I can't take it anymore.
I can't back out of the wedding now.
Those two, I know them all, they are bald.
What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you?
La la, how the horror, how the second horror.
*in the drawer* *in the drawer*
My uncle Boyoussef, the stairs are full of grains, which one of them?
# Gothic Real, with the image of a startled king.
We booked two rooms, but we still need to book makeup and hair.
We'll be there by tomorrow morning.
Yabna Abdullah Al-Rowaished and his band.
Do you see, my love?
I'm not telling her.
The blockbuster of the season.
We are the first people in the world to use it.
Mom, Mom!
Good bye, God bless.
There is no god but God.
Mom, don't forget tomorrow, when you enter the hall, read the Mu'awwidhatayn.
The women here have an evil eye.
I told you she's amazing.
Sweetest groom, Mashallah, my eyes are cool upon you.
Mom, mom, the police are knocking on the door!
I was wrong to obey you, my God.
It's forbidden to marry me today.
Ah, the scrutiny.
Oh my God, let's go! He's going to prison.
Buiusuf Buiusuf Buiusuf
It's not too late.
It's just so unfair, man. If this happens, it's a shame.
The company offered a contract for three million, two million of which is just the value of the materials.
He wrote a memo to the minister.
We said there was corruption, but it didn't reach this extreme level of corruption.
You're like you're not living in this world.
Hey man, what did the minister say about Osman?
Our manager, why didn't he object? They say he had [the opportunity].
I have no idea about him, I really don't know.
Where is your sense of decency?
Right is now wrong, and wrong is now right.
Oh Saad, are you sure the minister fired him? Guys, what's going on in the world?
# فنشه وبس # Fensa and Only Fensa
What next?
The minister's sister's king.
The girl is in a relationship with the minister.
Oh my, how the world has changed!
What's wrong with you guys, can't you recognize this?
This is the new employee appointed by the minister in place of poor Osman.
Go, go, go!
I don't understand, oppose the minister? Saleh, what did you want me to do?
You are crazy.
Listen to me, dad.
We have children, we need to live.
I want to live.
What happened?
A poor man is standing by the elevator.
In the end, integrity and honesty prevail, my brother Saleh.
May it be that we can do something for you, my brother.
Alhamdulillah, alhamdulillah for everything.
What's wrong, Saleh?
I am seeing some strange things in this world, my grandfather.
I can't believe my eyes.
My command.
I want you to go to the supermarket and get some salad ingredients on your way back from work.
I'm trying, goodbye.
Who brought my sister home?
I'm here to help, but I need you to provide me with the text you want translated. It seems like there might be some missing content in your message. Please send me the complete text, and I'll translate it accurately for you.
This is my colleague, she's with me at university. What's wrong with that? It's normal for her to drop me off.
Wee wee wee, can't believe it, what's wrong with you, you're acting like a child.
What do you say, you guys?
What do you want to hear, shall we say?
Your thinking is outdated.
Right and wrong, there's still something new and old.
Right is right, and wrong is wrong.
The world has evolved, we are living in the era of technology.
The era of global variables that harmonize the world and no one can keep up with.
"We've seen it all."
Don't blame me, Amnera, it's involuntary to get upset and angry.
I see so much in my day.
Tell her I'm sorry.
The world ain't right anymore.
Fine, don't stress yourself and come have lunch.
Let me go to bed and rest.
Papa, I'm upset with you.
Papa, no crying.
I'm not mad, get up, wash your face, and eat your lunch.
Oh my love.
I'm certainly eager to meet you all on my first day of work.
It is an honor for us, Your Highness.
Absolutely, absolutely.
Of course, I know you don't need anyone to remind you of the work ethics.
It's very important at the same time.
We regain some values and principles that were lost.
For the greater good.
Your Highness, it should be.
We need to all of us.
The looters must be stopped, Your Highness.
Are you thieves?
Thank you, thank you all.
And what I want to say is...
Be warned from the very first day of my attendance.
There is one employee among you.
I am honest, loyal, and dedicated, and all that other bullshit.
Just a suspicion.
I am an honest employee.
In order to be able to take the necessary legal measures in our ministry.
"No, my lord."
Praise be to God, we are all thieves.
"As you wish, your highness. My colleagues are in front of them and behind them. I say,"
Where is Khaled?
Yes, Your Highness.
Khaled, they praised you a lot, a lot. Mashallah upon you.
God willing, long life to you.
By God, long life to you, you know how to choose.
May God guide you, please.
Why do you let the devil deceive you?
Praise be to God that it came with integrity.
Mom, why is my dad in prison?
Be quiet, my mother.
La la, I repent.
Mom, why is my dad in prison?
You're giving me a headache.
Amin became honest.
You shouldn't talk about your dad like that.
This is a suit.
Your entire body is covered.
Shijou no Sekai
I hope you find a job, someone will hire you like this.
She covers her body and charms with dignity.
I can't breathe, this tight dress is suffocating me.
I want to be with you.
She even brought her a body and pants that reveal half her belly from above the waist.
There's no use, she doesn't listen, she doesn't want to follow the right path.
Here you go, I'm telling you.
You've got no one to blame but yourself.
I propose to your daughter Sarah for our son Rashid.
One of us, Shaydor, should give his daughter these days only to a decent man.
Rashed, I'm happy to tell you...
You're a real charmer.
The hero descended from his throne.
Twenty-four hours drunk.
Drunk and horny all day long, man.
The rampage, don't even ask about it.
"Now that's what I call good parenting, Abu Rashid!"
I'll give you good news: he's also a hypocrite.
How's the horn?
Authentic, my son, and drugs, how are they?
The written is finished. Here, take five riyals if you find his black eye, make a competition out of it.
Take me to Abu Sara, we didn't come here to propose to her.
Do you know his rants and nonsense?
A woman of integrity.
Congratulations, my son, congratulations. This is the way of life, congratulations.
I am drunk.
I can't walk.
Oh my God, dad!
Oh well, bye bye.
Let's go, come on, call your dad so he can come and pick you up.
Call him, why?
Take me with you.
Where is he?
Is that Jawf who's sitting there, waving his gutra, with a beautiful blonde girl?
Do you believe it, your father is walking straight towards her and giving it to her.
Hello my dear daughter Mona.
Majid was not called Abdulaziz.
What justice?
My daughter, you're killing me.
We know that since the establishment of the State of Palestine with its capital in Jenin in 2090, after the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement with the State of Israel, ...
Israel continues to perpetrate terrorism, pressure, and siege on Gaza.
The latest is what the Israelis and their Arab friends are claiming against the Palestinians.
They are smuggling plastic knives through the tunnels.
Especially article two, paragraph A, which states that the Palestinian people should trim their nails every day.
We are now taking you to the crucial meeting.
Sir, you are cheap.
When Israel agreed to the establishment of the Israeli state.
Man, what are you talking about? You're ruining our reputation. Behave yourself and shut up, you too.
Please.
Excuse me, sir Tiger. Excuse me, sir President.
Allow me to speak.
I have fully committed to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
What the hell is this Israeli delegate saying?
# Mission Statement We are committed to providing a wide range of solid materials, from stone to plastic, to meet your needs.
Even our homes, man.
What do you call it, you Gulf people?
In Palestine, everything is made of wood.
American companies, according to the agreement, will manufacture wooden cars for us.
Our house doors are all made of thermally modified wood, man.
We do not want speeches.
Don't change the subject.
Sir, Mr. President
This point is important. Please vote on this matter as nail grooming is a breach of the agreement.
# **English Translation:** # Agreeing, raise your hand.
I just had a weird dream.
In order to control the students.
I'm tired of telling him.
This is the fourth school I'll be attending tomorrow.
I asserted my strong personality as a teacher from the very beginning.
The boys are chasing him, tearing his clothes, and he remains silent.
Come in without your keffiyeh.
He said to me, the manager.
Rashid is a good guy, we don't want to fire him.
The kids are playing with chalk.
He took off his headdress in the open space in front of everyone.
They said, "This teacher is a nervous wreck; he'll ruin it for all of us."
I tell them the story of the writer.
Mary has returned.
What's the deal with this "catgeb" thing? This is new, no one told me about it.
Cut off her head and place it on the chair, fully intact.
I don't understand.
He has no idea about the whole story.
The kids laugh at him every dry day in the schoolyard.
Please stop.
Call me tomorrow, your boss is coming to work.
We'll give him a chance, no worries.
I'm waiting to tell you.
The era of kindness and weakness has ended.
Oh, my cousin Abdullah!
I'll see a different Rashid.
What do I need to remind you of the important educational quote?
I am a graduate of education, and so are you.
We all remember the saying.
The teacher's son, first class.
You will see Professor Rashid the powerful.
He who makes a mistake
Alas, poor thing!
The first time I spoke, you told me to shut up. What do you want to hear?
I'm sorry, but the text you provided is not in a language that I can recognize. Could you please confirm the language of the original text so I can provide an accurate translation?
Who among you is the one mocking and saying, "Be quiet, will you?"
You told me to shut up.
I am me.
You're the one who's next to me.
Go, O Spirit of Truth, O Director.
He said, "Professor Rashid expelled me."
I don't want to see your face here, you hear me?
What do you suggest with my nervousness?
We should be like this not only on the first day, but all year round.
Alas, poor thing!
Whoever hears his voice.
While I'm explaining, or speaking.
Do you know what that means?
Nervous, do you know what nervous is?
He's easily agitated.
Did you hear me? Did I quit or not?
I heard him afterward.
Get out of the class.
Soul of the Rightful Director
Oh, come on, take your stuff and leave.
Take your stuff.
Come on, let's go!
I'm sure they're looking for me now.
I haven't seen him, sir.
Try the strawberry ice cream float with milk; it's really sweet.
My love, Abdurrahman.
You are prone to error, just like any human being.
# **English Translation:** # Joke, Dad.
All that matters is that the subject doesn't reach dad.
I want my dad's cocoa in my bag.
I'm ready, and your jump is bad, and your landing is bad too. And where is your suitcase?
f aṣ-ṣaf.
Sure, here is the translation: Mm, of course, with pleasure.
You're saying he's happy with you.
You can't tell the difference between a rich kid and a regular one.
The louse, how does it look? The louse is green and red.
Come here, where are you going?
In the bathroom.
I'm still in the bathroom.
Knock on his door quickly and tell him the first lesson started half an hour ago. Come on, quickly!
I'm one juice and one bag of chips before all of them.
I took their hearts, all of them, because my friend Abdulrahman needs them. This is really good for health.
Okay, now go to Saud and get the PlayStation memory card from him.
If so, what can we learn from this story?
Man is
He must possess noble virtues and high morals.
This is the money for the PlayStation, and he told me he'd return the whole PlayStation at once.
Inshallah, if you need anything else, my friend. My friend Abdul Rahman is also here.
Now, no.
We learn from the story.
Of course, you know I'm leaving this week because I got accepted into graduate studies.
I said, "I must hand in the event file before I travel."
How do I take you to Abdulrahman this afternoon? He told me he doesn't know where he wants to go, but he didn't specify the time.
Madam, her father traveled and didn't say anything. Thank God, I got rid of him.
Suppose I took him this afternoon, and he got upset and didn't tell his father. No, no, forget about it. No, no, no.
Hello, my friend, Abdul Rahman.
May God help you.
What can we do, it's an order.
Sweet, sweet, just like this.
We're having a new science lesson, kids.
Peace be upon you.
Thank you, thank you.
Daddy, water.
I'll do anything for you, anything.
Teacher, teacher, how can you ask the teacher for water?
A teacher is walking to get water for a student. You are his janitor. No, no, this matter will not go unnoticed. I will write it in the report.
You're being sarcastic, and you're also making fun.
Don't raise your voice or shout at me, I hear you well.
How much is this going to cost?
There are only a few planets in this system.
Four cars five.
Excellent, this is excellent, sweet, excellent.
What are you doing?
He's going to build a parking lot in front of our houses and at our expense.
Don't remind me of the days of Bu Nasser.
Bunaṣṣer, that's it.
He studies sheep.
Zayn broke the table.
Dude, chill out.
Why you, specifically?
You've got a nerve!
Adjust your tone with me.
I or you?
Dad, we didn't say anything.
What is this?
Listen, if things are going well, it's much better for you.
We're not threatened, dad.
There's no need, and I want to make it easy for you.
What the hell are you talking about?
Instead of saying that, you know...
You seem to want it.
You want this, how you doin', alright then.
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Haha, like this, good.
It's not up to him, it won't happen.

We're here at Uncle Bunayef's to think, not to shout.
Who's Rashid acting all high and mighty in the neighborhood?
You made me talk.
Alright, everyone, silence! Let's hear what Uncle Bunayef has to say.
Now this worthless piece of trash is playing with your nerves.

If I gave him a slap, I'd stick him to the umbrella he made.

You know he has a jewelry store.
Ajova is wearing those rings and necklaces.
May Allah be with us.
Just keep walking, otherwise you'll be stuck in the heat.
Rashid, the naive one, with nothing to his name, became like this.
He was appointed as the Deputy Director General of the Global Educational Center.
He tells you, he teaches you. You're a teacher, and so is he. But look, where has he reached, and where have you ended up?
No problem.
"No problem, Abdullah."
I'll teach you what the secret is.
The professor has arrived. The professor has arrived.
Sir, I didn't do anything.
# This is the best possible translation: Sir, do you know who this boy is?
My love, I know this is a boy.
I'm telling you, man, we don't get many chances like this.
I'm looking for a job. You made me laugh, you really made me laugh.
I'm sorry, I can't translate this text as it appears to be incomplete. Please provide the full text you would like translated.

Bye, my love. May God be with you.
Your brother will become a minister, can you believe it, dad?
Alright, mom, we'll work, we'll work hard.
Dad, if your job doesn't say anything, it's fine.
That's it, he gave it to you.
It's just something normal, you know.
Regularly, automatically, we don't need words.
My dear, please make my dream come true.
My dream before yours.
Reserve me a room in the Beach Tower.
Come on, what are you waiting for?
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Let's do it, Abu Saleh!
I think your friend looks upset.
By God, he doesn't look like a brother, man.
You got this, boss!
Do you believe he jumped, grabbed the phone, and gave it to Abu Saleh?
Check out these moves, and for sure, Bu Sultan is a hundred million percent holding a grudge against him.
He never had a good relationship with Abu Saleh.
Loaa, Sultan wouldn't do that unless he was up to something.
"Really? Is it that bad?"
He opened the car door for him.
He'll end up working as a car door opener for the minister.
Dad, don't hurt my feelings. Don't hurt my feelings.
I heard some talk in the cafes, and it seems things are changing in the country.
I just can't believe what I'm hearing.
My heart is pounding, my heart is pounding.
I'm afraid the story, oh mother, will end up in the women's gossip, and Latifa of the dishes, oh mother, will expose me among the women.
# Say something, Bossultan, speak up! I'm shocked, really.
Please excuse me, I know what I'm doing.
No one has the right to interfere.
Amira, I am working at a slow pace.
I let him in, and this is the start of the plan in my head.
I should be the minister, not him.
Let me work; I have a plan.
Let them take it away.
Any plan.
He has to trust me first.
His eyes are those of a minister, for he was appointed two months before you.
I'm responsible for his expenses and his upkeep.
Magic can be undone.
What is that?
What's next?
Every activity is prohibited for photographers; I'll take a picture until it's published in the newspaper.
He stinks until he floats to the surface.
Absolutely, of course.
Wait, let me work on it and I'll show you.
On the contrary, Your Highness.
Of course, Minister.
Then come and tell me.
I thanked him for the lamb; it's really good meat.
# Real is at the door, get up for him.
# Don't be a curse, people want to help you, but you keep diminishing yourself.
Minister, please, come in, come in.
La la la, I don't want to be photographed, no, the minister is just taking a picture, just a picture, the minister is taking a picture.
I'll hit him second, give it to him.
I really like your plan, my brother.
I want you to take him there.
Picture, picture, picture.
Any minister is necessary.
Okay, I'll tell you in a moment.
Go to the second-to-last page.
I can't find a suitable translation for "جوفي" in this context. The rest of the text translates to: Look at his picture, so big with the groom.
Say there is no god but God.
Every day has one or two photos.
As you suggested, he's a social activist. Bye, bye. Take care.
They all love you, but I don't know what's wrong with you.
Melas in every wall.
Hathaleen are full of hatred and envy, they only throw stones at a fruitful tree.

I'm still at home today. Is anything wrong?
I'm feeling really bad today, I have a terrible headache, my body aches, and my colon is acting up.
I'm exhausted, man, I've been searching for a month now.
Let me relax today.
Hello, hi Aunt Sultana.
I say
Oh my god, I just want him to reach me.
I see you're trying it on.
Have you seen what fame does to Violet?
I'm glad you finally came around.
Frankly, it shows.
This minister of yours seems to be a free rider. Apparently, the story has caught his interest.
I'll send it to my brother Saad.
No, by God, I didn't follow any news today, nor did I read the newspapers. I have no idea.
Okay, see you later.
He who wishes for the ant's demise, gives it wings.

Ava, it means there's absolutely nothing, no activity at all, not even a party, a birthday celebration, or a wedding.
I don't know, but you can check the hotel behind us.
I'm at a hotel behind you, hey!
I'll leave you in the car and go into the hotel to ask.
Go, go, go, take your time, go, ask.
May everyone agree, God willing.
Let's put this minister to rest and relax.
He couldn't find any party, wedding, or excuse to crash.
# 10,000 Hotels and He Couldn't Find a Place, His Luck is Cursed Just Like His Face
Shut up already.
I couldn't find anything for his birthday.
You might catch the second half.
Every number has a hundred faces.
I can't sleep, I can't even close my eyes, brother.
# Translation: Hey man, he's breaking the rules by saying that the first thing you should do is take a picture and then create the account.
My kids are having a contest over a picture of your minister.
One guy asks the other, "Hey, how many photos of the minister did they put in the newspaper today?"
The winner gets a prize.
# This is not what it seems, you come for coffee and listen to the comments, every day about his pictures in the newspaper, he never stops talking.
God is nearing his downfall.
The butterfly, as they say, will eventually fade away. It came close to the light.
People greet you and say hello to him.
I've become one of the most famous celebrities in the country.
"No problem, who is she?"
You ruined my prestige.
May God keep you safe, and her too.
Do you say we all got married except Amna, the poor one among us who didn't get married?
This is fate.
It's written for me to be married.
I've completely forgotten about the whole marriage thing.
"May God hold accountable whoever is to blame."
I can't see these slackers over there.
They're crazy.
I see you playing with your hair.
This is a boy or a girl?
After my father died, I mean, I'll kill him.
"Which pair is bigger?"
It's a sin to keep me attached to the maid.
Oh, go on, make yourself useful.
I wanted to talk to my mom, but she's not just employing one helper, she's got two of them.
We've told you, Amiah, a hundred times, it's none of your business. Khaloud is my son, not yours.
You've got nothing else to talk about except for Khulood and the maids, it's always the maids and Khulood.
Mom, it's not good like this, Khadija is with the maid twenty-four hours a day and wants no one else.
Oh God, get out and let me rest, I want to sleep, how am I supposed to do this?
My brother Khalid, you've become like my son.
Wait a bit, I'll tell my dad about you if I don't.
I'm just saying, what's wrong with Khadija?
Sa'ud says that Khulud puts on makeup and acts like a 6-year-old girl. What's going on? What's happening?
Bel, bel, bel, alayka ya Saud.
He puts makeup on his face, Khalid, but it's childish makeup. He saw the makeup box and played with it.
I saw that huge Antifa, yet it wasn't visible.
Kind, sweet, and gentle.
I am Baha'i Saudi.
I haven't seen you in ages.
Hey Saad, that time I asked you, when you grow up, what will you become? You didn't answer me then. Now, tell me, when you grow up, what will you become?
You, my immortal beloved, my dear, Saad will become an officer. What will you become?
We're going to London this year, just like last year.
AI AI, the trembling word in Bahrain.
# **Song Title: His Words Bring Back Memories** His words, let them bring back Sawsan, her cheetahs, and Khaloud.
Hello, Smoura.
"I seek forgiveness from Allah, the Most Great."
Today my dad told me to choose.
I'll build you a house by the sea, or the one near us.
I told him I don't want to choose.
I live with you, my love, anywhere.
You're welcome, my love.
I taught myself how to catch fish.
Oh my god, Amal, I wish I could close my eyes, open them, and they tell me Amal has graduated from university.
If it's a perfume, it's not for men.
I don't know, but its smell is very strange.
What's wrong with me?
Your tone of voice has become feminine.
You forgot you're a real one.
God willing, I'll speak with people outside like this.
I can't believe it, Khalid.
Please get out of my room.
Oh, what a pity, Khulud.
You've fallen from my grace.
Oh come on, don't hurt my feelings, I swear I'll tell my mom.
This is my son, and I know him very well.
Oh, Khulood, my dear, my precious, I wish all the children had your brightness and emotions.
I hope you don't see a gentle and calm man and say he's too soft for my daughters.
Shame on you, shame! How dare you say such things about your brother?
Enough, enough, you've blown it out of proportion, it's a small matter.
He's not worth it, just put a little bit of nice-smelling perfume on him. What's the difference between men's and women's perfumes anyway?
Don't you dare tell him about this.
I have
I'll show you, but be quiet so that Muhammad doesn't sense anything.
Oh, where do these girls hang out?
By God, it's a sin to do that to her, she's a beautiful girl.
Don't look at him, don't look at him.
I'm afraid he'll sense something that belongs to him.
Treat yourselves to some rest.
I know you're watching the widespread Bluetooth video these days.
I'm waiting for Saad, but let him come.
How are you, Saad?
May God keep you.
I'm telling you, we're waiting for you. We haven't even started playing cards yet.
Why not?
Do you want something to drink?
He's lying there in your apartment; it's been two days now.
I've got a Bluetooth story.
My brothers, I am determined to play the oud.
I'm afraid of him.
Don't try to kill me, please. Don't try to kill me.
Take refuge from Satan, my dear mother, for my sake.
I've booked it already.
I'm done, I don't know where to hide my face from people.
What do I say to your father?
Tell him anything.
Oh, these kids, oh, I can't stand them, oh, these kids.
This is the end, my mother.
Khulud Asghar's immortality.
Surely, this is the result.
It's forbidden for you, just get up and go outside.
The truth always hurts.
The jar broke.
I could never live in Doha.
I don't have anything to do with it.
I've been holding my phone for a while.
Blame me, O Amal.
You, my daughter, spend your entire day in front of the computer.
I'm a real vertical, facing people all day long.
It's difficult, Amal.
I can't live my entire life with my head bowed down.
My dad has been feeling like something is going on in the house and there's a change.
My dad is always absent and unaware of what's going on at home.
My father, I blame him sometimes, and sometimes I don't.
I can't blame myself, Amal, when I remember his struggles and dedication to his work so that we could live with dignity among people.
I blame him.
Why did he leave his responsibilities of the house and children to the mother?
We don't want to dig into the past right now.
Do you know my dad or not?
I'm determined.
Send him the Bluetooth.
I won't give it to him.
I don't want to see my father's shock with my own eyes.
It hurts a lot.
No matter what, Amal.
Does he know the way to our place?
I perform better than what is known through others.
It's a shame our house has deteriorated to this extent.
# The Explosion of Eternity In it, a dirty bomb exploded, named Eternity.
Customs and traditions.
They teach them with absolute audacity.
They are plugging their ears to it.
They do not listen to her.
There is only one voice.
He is the voice of filth and perversion.
Waiduson, the embodiment of all goodness.
What's on your mind?
Suddenly, I decided to travel for studies.
"All we can say is, may God be with you, my son."
May God make your path easy.
They returned the gift to those who came back from the trip, not to those who are still traveling.
Your words are correct.
This is the base.
Beyond every rule
Hope of my nation, come with me quickly.
Mom, I'm thirsty.
I can't hear a thing.

Bus'eed, what's wrong?
Dad, what's wrong, Dad?
Dad
Don't be sad.
You are a great woman.
Any young man who wishes for a wife.
I never divorced you because of any fault of yours.
I divorce you.
I am impossible.
I accept to be the guardian of my children.
One weirdo like your brother.
Hello Saleh.
I see it every day here.
The first is not very clear.
We are hiding underground.
That one is the first one underground.
By God, your words are powerful; are you capable of backing them up?
You have one thousand and twenty and God, there's a lot of money here.
Qul māshā'Allāh
Come on, let's go! Come on!
You've been going on for seven months now, enough is enough, you're driving me crazy. Come on, take me home already.
# Embarrassing and Scandalous
You're dealing with this scumbag.
It's been seven months already.
My ears with yours, my ears.
Let's get rid of him and be done with it.
Let him go and bring another one.
He doesn't understand what this word means, he doesn't realize the loss of money and time.
Training driving trips and let's get rid of it.
You're the first one to come to my house on the very first day, it's been six months since I've been here.
Fine, I'll say something new to you.
This is petrol in Ahwaz, 100 Iranian rials per liter, 500 rials for half a liter. Everything is so expensive, dad.
Okay, you're a genius, listen up! I'm telling you
You're a first-timer, I see. How much do you want to spend? It's your money.
Seven hundred gives.
You're very new, only six months, not like this eight hundred.
I need money.
This driver is outdated, don't use old words, you're new.
This is seven hundred and eighty.
Rose
He says he'll bring one hundred riyals only.
Three hundred, no use.
I am very good at talking.
La la shashi badin mashkil fi waajid waqt ana fi yashrid.

"God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs."
I sat and took a look inside him.
No one is here.
Even the phone I bought for him has a package.
Have you done it?
Sweet after.
They didn't hold back, they took his passport and kept it.
Are you okay, my friend? You look tired.
Tomatoes are everywhere.
Here's the problem. Here's the problem.
They flee after all this.
Yes, we are drowning and we are suffocating.
I told you to send him away.
I don't think I'll let him go.
He rises wherever he is.
It's a mystery, it's a mystery.
I'd rather pay for his ticket and send him away than have him stay in the village and collect money.
My liver is aching, I wish I could just catch him.
Comrade, there's no one buying right now.
At the start of the match, you all looked very nervous. I noticed that.
We're just afraid of one thing: that our team won't score any goals.
We want more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were terrified, afraid of the opposing team.
I'm not scared of the opposing team; I'm terrified of our own team. I fear we won't score; I tell you, we might concede more than three.
This is our team's level; I know it. I'm talking about our team's level.
I have a great deal of trust in you.
The opposing team has nothing.
Cute foxes, guys. Say now you've scored the first goal.
Where are you going, you?
Row house.
In a car.
Come with me, I'll take you with me, I'll get there with you.
Ah, my dear friend.
We're unbeatable, you'll never defeat our team.
Your Highness, the matches have just started, the league has just begun.
Did you not hear what he said?
They say there are many problems.
Come on, Mahmoud, bring it over here.
Hello, my friend, come here, let's go.
Shut up, man.
Please, sir.
What the hell has he done to himself?
Oh, the Indian guy.
Yes, man, he's a football player.
There's no saying this is my team's fox words.
Slowly, step by step.
Oh God, oh Sajid, oh God, Sajid, quickly, quickly, the match is about to start, quickly, bring a bottle of water with you, the foxes are playing today, quickly!
Dear viewers, we have with us one of the most famous fans of the Foxes team, known as "Foxman."
They all say you won because they were missing some players.
This is bullshit. This is bullshit. There's no good.
What's up with this? This team is lacking something. It's a team of twelve people.
I'm almost two years old, but there's no use. It's still the same.
This is a devil fox.
This is our best fan.
Alright, on the occasion of this win, Fox, a final word I'd like to address to the Foxes.
I'm here to help, but I need you to provide me with the text you want translated. It seems like you might have forgotten to include it in your request. Please send me the text, and I'll translate it accurately and professionally.
Why do foxes cry out like this?
This is heaven up above.
This is the fair referee.
Take a look, brother.
He received it with great enthusiasm like this.
Welcome, handsome.
Where's the Indian boy who's kicking the ball?
I don't see any bail for me yet.
# This is the translation: Oh man, he's a big problem, he doesn't stay here anymore.
I saw him a few days ago, I didn't recognize him. He was sitting at a coffee shop, something like Starbucks, it's called Star Bucks.
I remember that guy used to sit with us during the break; he didn't even have a cup of tea.
The man gave the boy twenty riyals as a tip.
Why did they do it like that?
He's meeting with the club's top officials, they're taking care of him, they won't let him down.
I say, Fox.
Mother's name
My mother says, "Do it in your free time, do it in your leisure."
You're out of your mind, supporting a crappy and pathetic club like this one.
This is this is the money fox team my heart is Mali.
When will my heart stop beating?
Good inside, good outside.
You, Your Highness, have never heard the poem written about the ruling.
The day our match was against them.
Please, please, O Thaalib, speak, speak, this is a poem, speak, speak.
My mother, oh God, in a secret world of mystery I am.
This is my money, and I have a lot of it.
I don't sleep at all at night.
We are the Foxes' fans association, you know.
I can't tell you the winner's name so I can have an exclusive scoop.
We have a press conference, and God willing, we will announce the winner's name there.
Say what his beauty.
The famous Foxhole, this fan who was honored today by the management of the Foxes club in a very kind gesture and a beautiful initiative.
Oh God.
Thaloub, a thousand congratulations on this beautiful recognition and a wonderful gift indeed!
Snow is saying, is this a pen or a brush?
God is the only one who can help.
This is a gesture.

We need to call the police.
Stay put.

I tell you he
You're late.
I have no idea when the matches are, man.
Okay, now how are we going to catch him?
There's nothing else to do but wait for the Foxes team to play their next match.
I saw him, I saw him.
Zayn, let's catch up.
Dude, you're late.
Aku aku aku aku
Dive into the truth, the truth is behind you, dive into it.
The issue is we're not sure if it's him or not.
I tell you, it's him, dad, it's him.
I say, it's wise to go to the two of them and ask. Tell the driver, "This one you have here, where did it come from? How did it come to you? When did it arrive?"
Dad, you have to make this trip into two.
Let's go and tell him; I'm sure it's him.
May Allah preserve you, and may He bless you with generosity.

What have you done, Walid?
As I was walking, the suitcase wheel broke.
Come on, let's go, man, hurry up!
Go to your room, go.
God help us.
May God protect us.
Come on, you should understand your father's words by now.
Before my dad finds out.
Shattered into a million pieces.
Okay, mom, let's go buy one like it right now.
I'll be right back before dad gets home.
"And whoever gives you up, my dear mother."
Do you know your dad? When he gets angry, he turns into a madman.
Stay in your room and don't come out.
We didn't do anything.
I accidentally knocked over the vase in his bag, it fell and broke.
Mom, I'm scared for him.
I have no idea where he went.
La la la la, his father is not okay.
It's a sin what you're doing to the child, oh my!
# The Amazigh Heart The Amazigh heart is generous, welcoming, and full of love for these children.
I'm saying, Mom.
Do you think the boy has gone missing?
Alright, I'll give you a call then.
May God protect us.
Aunt, I know where Walid went.
Come here, I'll give you something. Where are you going?
Come on, come on!
Here is the translation: I'm here.
If anyone hands me over to my granny, I don't want to go home.
Fear me, you have.
I didn't see the vase.
My God, I have no idea.
Like that, your father, God guide him, has scared you.
Come here, my dear mother.
Don't be afraid, you're safe as long as I'm here in the house. It's alright, dad.
I have the solution.
"We didn't say anything, Abu Walid."
# My Request, Abu Walid Student, your request, Abu Walid.
I'll forgive him this time, just for you.
I don't see him at home.
Where is he? Get lost!
Where is he? Where?
Alright, my boy Walid, don't be afraid, your father hasn't done anything to you.
Sure, Dad.
Hey, dad, hey.
I'll leave it here; I'm afraid one of the kids might touch it and break it.
I asked him, and he said he wants one like the one I got him, the one that Walid broke.
# Exactly, he wanted to go, but when he went, he couldn't find anything except this one, the last one in the shop. What bad luck! Oh no! Where are the kids?
They study in the room.
Oh God, protect her.
I'm done, just let me finish these tasks.
Oh, how wonderful!
Okay, let's go study.
Dad, just this one game and then we'll get going.
Dad, I beg you, don't tell my uncle.
Dad, don't tell your brother, dad, this is the last time, I swear, dad.
I'm calling him.
You, of all people, would make a mistake about your friend at the coffee shop.
If I knew your brother, I would tell him about you.
No more connection, this phone is hidden away, as long as they're tracking.
Mom, why don't you take him to the doctor?
May God guide you, my dear.
# My heart is beating fast and I'm scared because it's beating so hard.
Poor boy.
Sure, here is the translation: "Be you."
Mom, where's Amoula? I don't see her with you today.
Wooden tea with her.
This sister of mine never gets tired of playing.
Oh my god, mom, I didn't tell you about Amna's story with her son Nayef.
He was born when I was still an infant; may God protect him.
And the same height.
Yesterday you said you didn't know what to do with her son.
I want to take him to the hospital, but his husband is Yusuf.
I heard about the incident yesterday.
I can't hear you. Please speak louder.
He says, "How come you didn't tell me?"
This person has a psychological condition.
The boy is forced to cry.
He takes his son and ties him to the middle of the yard.
Then he said to him, do it again and pee in your bed.
You're barking up the wrong tree.
Are you okay, Um Amina?
I tell her, "Eat, eat."
Enjoy your meal.
Do I ever have bad luck.
Mom, Mom!
Fine, your father didn't feel for you.
I'll kill you if you don't stop.
Oh my, go to the bathroom and wash up before your dad gets up and causes you trouble.
I don't care about anything.
It's a sin, poor things.
They are shouting, screaming.
I'm afraid something might happen to my children.
I have to take them to their uncle's, he'll teach them some manners.
I'm nervous.
They all fell, yet they all succeeded.
Why would you take them to their uncle's place?
I scored forty-eight out of fifty.
Why don't they bring fifty from fifty?
Warn them all.
I fully support his point of view.
Keep your emotions aside.
I have to teach my brothers some manners.
Alright, bye-bye.
Last time, last time.
Fifty out of fifty.
He's wasting our time. I assure you, this is our son.
Why not get a perfect score of fifty?
Jab, jab, jab, I've been warning you, but you don't listen.
You don't listen.
Shameful.
Give him a lesson, let's teach him a lesson.
Oh, just let me be, uncle.
"This is the second time you're reversing, but you're not doing it properly. Come on, reverse properly!"

Be careful, you go to public places with your family.

Strange that you're crying.

At the school gate, he waited for the bus. The bus arrived, and the kids got off, but he wasn't with them.

I greet you live and welcome you to a new episode of the program Without Limits.
Oil constitutes over thirty-five percent of the total different energy sources.
While the rest goes to natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.
Oil is considered the primary source of energy in the world.
The Gulf Cooperation Council countries and Iran alone possess six hundred and sixty-eight billion barrels.
Iran follows with twelve percent, then Iraq with ten percent, and Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates with nine percent.
Venezuela comes in at seven percent for each.
Russia, five percent.
The Gulf states and Iran make up two-thirds of the world's reserves.
# Bitcoin Price Surges to Unprecedented Levels, Crossing $109 for the First Time in Its History
In this episode, we aim to unravel the complexities of oil.
The problems faced by the exporting countries.
Despite the enormous rise in its prices
As well as the problems faced by citizens and residents in these countries.
# Inflation and unprecedented rise ## Consequences
The text you provided is already in English.
Today, the market is the key factor.
She is not a producing country.
The factor that determines the price is market power.
OPEC is no more.
Of course, supply and demand play a part, naturally.
But other factors
Other factors are political tensions.
In the world.
Real estate markets
Al-Bulus and other markets.
Head towards the Al F market prices for speculation.
In the Kamatijis, oil is one of them, for example.
Tomorrow, a thousand dollars will arrive, God willing.
Oil in 2004 jumped from $40 to $440.
And today we see that even the oil prices
You fluctuate from one day to another.
Oil prices dropped below ninety dollars.
Revenue increased in the second quarter.
# Spring Maintenance Period: A Critical Time for Global Refineries The onset of spring marks a crucial phase for the majority of the world's refineries, as they enter their annual maintenance period.
"It is always better for me in the second quarter."
The seasonal demand for oil is decreasing.
In winter, it drops below ninety.
This is a strong indication that speculation has power and control over the market now.
We used to go to the traditional market a lot in the past.
The market was influenced by supply and demand.
LLL offer seasonal demand.
Today we see that there is economic growth.
General Fallon, the commander of the Central Command in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned today or yesterday.
His resignation caused an immense reaction due to its connection to the so-called impending American war.
Political or geopolitical implications.
The oil market is impacted, whether negatively or positively, in a very rapid manner.
The impact will surely come, and it will have its effects.
Even speculators also react to political speculation.
They say that some people claim that an American war on Iran is imminent.
Here's what the market will be optimistic about.
Question now in the Excellency's pursuit, the deputy is now in pursuit of the White House.
This brought the region back to a tense atmosphere.
This is the ermine.
But perhaps Fallon saw this scenario.
Oil market reacts with a rapid reflection.
Today, we prove with numbers that there is no shortage.
Let me give you an example over the past seven weeks.
The oil inventory in the United States has increased above the five-year average.
I guess today, not me, I mean, I say.
We won't even need it for the upcoming war because today I'm telling you that the world has a bitter stockpile.
Even today's global consumption, show me any country in the world, there's a long line or queues in front of gas stations.
This is something else.
What are the risks associated with this matter?
What number do you think it could be? I don't know, maybe it's...
# Translation: It might be $200, it could be $300, or maybe even less.
He may arrive if these tensions have reached the Torah and lead to real tensions.
As I said, the Gulf countries make up sixty percent of [the region].
In a country, I mean, far away even from the oil-producing countries.
See the impact comes inversely on the oil market.
You can get up to three hundred dollars.
They moved from stocks and other assets to the oil market today; you're looking at over $2 trillion or $3 trillion.
Today we see Brent.
He trades over a hundred barrels a day. That's what it means.
This tension in the region and anticipation...
April, as was said before, is to be the month to wage this war.
By God, God knows best, my generation didn't mean it.
In the area because the the now.
This year is an election year.
The current US administration has only a few months left.
George H. W. Bush declared war on Somalia and sent thirty thousand troops in his final days in the White House.
We see and do not anticipate events.
I don't expect this scenario to unfold.
This scenario is very costly.
You won't pay anything; it's you, the Iranians, and the consumer countries who will foot the bill.
America Today
You now rely on African oil and have many alternatives.
Look, there's no point, let's talk straight.
You stated in your intro that sixty percent
# Oil Reserves #
We now import twenty-two.
I am their oil from the West from the West of Africa.
I am from West Africa, and no matter what they import from any region in the world
Oil production
This is a challenging number, proven reserves, and reserves.
# Deepwater Production: Tapping into the Vast Depths The concept of deepwater production, often referred to as the "Deepwater Act" or "Deep Sea Production," involves extracting resources from the vast and challenging depths of the ocean. This endeavor presents unique opportunities and complexities, pushing the boundaries of offshore exploration and development.
The navy, therefore, will remain a tough number in the Gulf.
Caspian Sea oil.
I consider them dreams because they are not reality and truth.
They're destroying it.
That's important, you know.
Today, Qatar is the world's largest energy exporter.
This is a difficult one to decipher, but here is a possible translation: "That's why these countries are a tough number."
There are the needs of countries for energy.
There is indeed a concept known as secure supply chain security.
Despite internal opposition in the United States, even at the level of General Fallon,
But there are still concerns.
I hope Bush gets impeached.
You noticed that political risks did not come from the Gulf countries.
I don't come here for generosity, because we don't have anyone who deals with generosity.
There's no dealing with you, you're too generous.
I'm not in the article now.
We are not part of the big charity.
O O kindly B
Be kind to Westerners, not to anyone else.
Against America specifically.
Where is the market?
Where is the economic return for us, we will go to it.
We won't.
Like oil and gas.
You place it for generosity and
I have the proof.
I have the proof.
No more than sixty to seventy dollars.
Price hikes are not a solution.
The persistent dollar decline you insist on.
You, first and foremost, as Gulf [countries] and OPEC [members].
Export in dollars, and you refuse.
Change of currency despite the currency collapse.
Despite the odds being against you, the return is not in your favor.
No, I'm not seventy yet.
Just the experts' word, not mine.
Okay, the dollar dropped thirty-five percent and oil rose higher than this decrease.
If we take the base year as 2004
We'll see if oil prices range between thirty-five and thirty-six dollars.
He's obviously like that, you know.
Oil prices have risen.
The increase is only slight, the deputy's efforts are appreciated.
If we take them
We consider it, you know, now.
Even at these prices.
If we take it as a comparison to 2004,
"Wow, the dollar has dropped by more than 10%."
LL the exciting
The dollar's decline interacts.
As the dollar declines, oil prices rise.
This is also something the market has started to give it its feeling.
My interests are now lower than ever.
Now the situation has changed. Maybe it was at the beginning of the decline two years ago, people were saying this, but the situation has changed now and there is...
The dollar began to lose its value against major currencies such as the euro, yen, franc, and sterling.
Why do you insist on pegging your currency to the dollar?
The currency is weakening and has no backing.
This is it, this is it, a historical era.
Petroleum and its derivatives are priced in dollars, including European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
The text states that America was in the mid-1970s.
The United States abandoned the gold standard for its currency.
This is not this is not correct.
What's up, what's the right thing to do?
OPEC organization includes
Four Gulf states.
Qatar, Kuwait, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia.
Today's OPEC share in the global market
Forty percent.
Today, if we consider that the world consumes eighty-five million barrels
Vague deals with the dollar in pricing its oil.
If priced in another currency, all S.
You cannot you K.
All oil-producing countries must agree.
I am an adult.
The ones who hold sixty-six percent of the global reserves are the big players.
I'll take it as an export.
Venezuela, Libya, and Iran are among them.
Cameroon, Angola, and Qatar are the countries organized under the OPEC.
Today's shares in the market do not exceed forty percent.
Produces and exports from countries outside OPEC
You can't tell who's the one with forty percent.
You can't do it by yourself.
In countries tried but
An attempt is not my true right.
You are being rejected because of the ties with America.
I'm on my way from Dora to another job.
All oil-exporting countries
How much does a twenty-liter barrel cost?
They are the loss when it is not issued.
His currency's value has risen sharply.
He sells his oil in dollars.
The recipient is receiving the money in dollars, and he is converting it to his local currency.
I don't have a dollar connection.
Sure, but he is.
You're right, your problem is that you sell in dollars, but your currency is not pegged to the dollar, so you don't have an issue.
I have an important question now.
# What is anxiety and what impact does it have when your currency is pegged to the dollar during its decline?
I've been married for many years.
In the 1970s, especially, when the dollar was a very strong currency and a powerful one at that.
The disengagement, this is not easy.
The paint is easy.
No, not here, no.
Divorce comes with costs.
There are interests for these countries, not against them.
I am profit and loss.
Dojens announced in yesterday's publication that there are four countries, including Qatar.
However, there is also a report from the Gulf Finance House stating that there are four Gulf countries, as Oman has withdrawn from the unified Gulf currency.
I read the statement in Dungeonz, and I don't think it's a real statement.
He is the governor of the Qatar Central Bank, turned out to be a fake.
He said yes and that he would conduct a study, but also that all Gulf countries should...
You need to study profit and loss in a meticulous manner, as I mentioned, without emotions.
Let's leave it for further study and wait until they come.
I'll bring you some economists who will tell you that in another study.
This study reflects
The Lubal House is incredibly simple and tidy, and they issued a report on March 8th.
Apple in just 4 days.
Global House, the solution is simple and requires political will.
The political decision boils down to two things.
There is no third option; the first need.
Kuwait announced its intention in 2010 to issue its own currency or to study the possibility of issuing a unified Gulf currency.
The second point is the issuance of a decision to decouple from the dollar.
Firstly, regarding the single currency,
I, in my personal opinion,
We aim to see the unified Gulf currency.
# The Currency # The Currency When This Currency Will Be Strong
You will be, you will be.
Perhaps one of the strongest currencies in the world, as they say.
We and what lies beyond our reserves and the revenues behind it, massive.
Therefore, this is what His Excellency the Prime Minister emphasized when he said:
"This is why the Gulf states are together, as no single state can act alone."
A stronger economic foundation.
We see the euro today, an economic union.
You must not forget that the central bank plays a very big role.
In the evaluation.

Out of all this news
Tense situation.
# 2008, as observers say Global House stated that inflation will continue.
For a long time in the Gulf countries, but the solution is in the hands of the governments.
Some countries have increased salaries by seventy percent, like the UAE.
To halt the inflation process that
When will you increase the salaries of the poor people in Qatar?
Listen to your answer after a short break.
# Today's Episode Topic: Oil Reserves and Daily Production of the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
She has a reserve of two hundred and sixty-four billion.
Two out of ten barrels.
We receive nine and two out of ten every day.
One hundred and fifty-one million, one hundred and fifty-two million, and one hundred and fifty-three million, two hundred and seventy-seven thousand, and two and seven tenths million.

In Asia and other countries
The GDP of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries was $717 in 2006.
# Gross Output Forecast The gross output for 2007 is expected to be $79,997,000,000.
In 2008, 9999999991.
The inflation that devours the salaries of employees and workers who live in this area.
The increase will be from two to three and eight tenths by 2008.
Kuwait signed 89.8% in 2008 of the UAE.
Saudi Arabia will become ten, while it was six and a half, it will reach six.
Eight out of ten.
Salaries are being devoured.
What are the amounts and percentages by which you will increase the salaries of these poor employees?
If we want to address the problem.
# Real Treatment ## Introduction Welcome to the world of real treatment, where healing and recovery are at the forefront of our mission. We believe in the power of holistic approaches and evidence-based practices to bring about transformative change.
Salaries always salary increases always
It is not the solution.
I am not against raising salaries.
It's true, this is not correct.
We're always there.
I have faith, of course.
# Inflation Issue The issue of continuous increases and the lack of control over inflation will result in inflation devouring all these increases.
To tackle inflation, a supreme committee comprising all experts and specialists is a futile endeavor.
And now this committee is putting
Since the global wage increase
The golden economic rule says, of course,
It will have no end.
No matter
Salaries have risen, no matter how much they increase.
Inflation will rise.
You must treat and you must.
Here is the translation: A scientific study conducted by Bayt.com, a specialized recruitment institution, in partnership with YouGov Siraj, a British research firm.
A survey was conducted among fifteen thousand employees working in the Gulf countries across twenty key sectors.
Especially experts and those with long-term employment are not satisfied with their jobs.
Inflation has become a devouring monster.
Last but not least, especially the experienced ones.
They are considering moving from these countries where inflation is eating them up.
You are now going to lose.
This is the simple idea, and this is you putting the simple idea into practice.
The inflation rate is the increase in salaries.
Parallelism in the subject is present.
Being and
We are keen, and the state and government are extremely keen.
We must address this issue with a genuine solution.
Always, temporary fixes don't solve the problem, they only make it worse.
The more you add to it.
We hope to have some more time for this committee to act.
All the applications.
Here is the translation: Here is the eagle, and the deputy is seeking it.
Boredom will always be.
They tried it, too, but the state raised the 40% increases.
There is a very important point here regarding the topic of increases.
You only increase the salaries of Qataris as if non-Qataris were working for Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
You consider the Qataris but not the expatriates.
He has a high percentage in it.
Hey Ahmed, you're living in Qatar, not in Germany.
You speak about this subject and suffer.
Salaries are much higher in the public sector.
On the contrary, we saw.
# Public Sector
In contrast, the public sector has become
The best elements and competencies have become
I also read the report, and we know that QF is in the oil sector.
Labor force.
We are like experts when we speak.
Engineers and workers who come from outside Qatar.
We also interact with the global market.
For all these things, what is the percentage increase in salaries?
Hope is with Allah, the Most High, but I say...
The government has a plan.
I say controlling inflation is more important.
# Temporary treatment
I will see, and I am sure.
There will be
Positive results
You will be within fifteen percent.
The sweet one says he told you five twenty-two billion of oil and five forty-three billion of gas.
No comment, we are the client, not a female client.
Operation and of course we do.
The talk about economic growth must also reflect on people.
Qatar's economic growth today is, of course, reflected in its status as having the highest economic growth rate in the world.
And vice versa.
The massive belts in the country are also a part.
Without these massive belts and grand projects,
In the country, it also had a part of the inflation.
He also played a part in the inflation.
This also led to an increase in liquidity in the market.
First, regarding the dollar's link to oil.
I pledged the oil for protection from
In the United States of America, stability in governance is a significant factor.
Thank you.
Saad al-Ghamdi from Saudi Arabia, your question, Saad.
Hello, may peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you.
Truth is the ring, success is the outcome, and a good title.
I wish to address the fact that the region is now under the shadow of America's current policy.
America's policy in its current war involves cultural aggression against Islam, in addition to a global economic war.
Today China is a powerful country.
The American deficit with Japan also reached sixty-one billion dollars.
Japan had also invested in 2000.
Against America, it's nine.
# Investment Opportunities The potential for investment is vast, with over $1 billion already invested, and current investments with the European Union exceeding $27 billion.
In its pursuit of American politics and making the dollar an inevitable currency for the entire world
Brother, I say that buying now is a good idea.
The Gulf region will become
I don't know where.
Thank you, Saad.
Mohamed Al-Waseef from Egypt.
Hello, deputy, it's your time.
The deputy's pursuit reminds me of the rulers in the Arab region of the Middle East.
When there is
When there are bottlenecks or demands for price adjustments.
Adjusting salaries Adjusting salaries in return in relation to prices as Your Excellency has kindly mentioned
He takes, meaning in Qatar we consider you to be a benchmark.
I am determined not to preach about the increase. This is not an Arabic style.
We consider Qatar to be our Abu Adrika.
# He has the right to say what he wants. Do you have a question? Do you have a question? Of course, he has the right; he is responsible for this policy.
Question first.
The deputy must take into account the black sheep.

With the downtrodden, as Your Excellency has kindly pointed out, for they are the people who deserve to be cared for.
The Arab rulers who don't care about the poor.
Hello, how are you?
Peace be upon you.
I'd like to say hello to you two and hello to Al-Aqil.
I want a raise in my salary as well.
Salaries are excellent and good. That's good.
May God bless you. As for the topic, we are the ones who need to take action and give it meaning.
With the underprivileged, always, God willing, there won't be any underprivileged in Qatar, and we are certain.
Qatar's ruler states that the money goes to the ruling family and the ruler.
That's the important question now.
Let's reply to the brothers.
He cannot rule.
What's happening to this wealth?
Now there are entirely new cities, almost like Lusail Pearl and other places, meaning even Qatar is starting to expand.
He's not the issue, the issue is the issue itself.
Compatible urban planning scheme
In short, we have two minutes left. Where should we head to?
Qatar now is there Post-oil and gas Qatar
There is, of course, a clear policy of the state.
I am.
Wealth that is depleting.
The wealth is ever-increasing.
"That's why today's trend is in Qatar."
# Capital of the Middle East in Education
Today we see ourselves as the cultural city, the educational city.
This educational city hosts the best universities in the world.
Establish medical cities, media cities, and financial cities.
Today, oil and gas are
No, of course not, we don't imitate anyone.
Other satellite channels and
It's not just Al Jazeera, you know. You'll create a hundred Al Jazeeras and still can't handle one.
"That's what it means, my brother. These are our countries in the Gulf now."
In the boom of the seventies, everyone now remembers the boom of the seventies.
Today, today, we see in Qatar a growth.
This also calls for a special episode about post-oil Qatar.
Our vision for oil, its future, and its wealth in the region, especially in Qatar. Finally, I extend my greetings to you, the program team.
This is Ahmed Mansoor greeting you without limits. Peace be upon you, and may God's mercy and blessings be with you.
Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh
I greet you live this week from the Qatari capital, Doha.
Welcome to a new episode of the program Without Limits.
In the meantime, Qatar hosts the largest US military base outside the United States, Al Udeid Air Base.
Against the US enemies in the region.
Like Iran and Syria.
Her doors are open to leaders.
# Hamas Leaders Enjoy Strong Ties with the Qatari Leadership
Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani was the only Arab leader.
He who visited the southern suburb of Beirut, destroyed by Israel during its war on Lebanon in the summer of 2006.
We continue to provide unlimited support for the reconstruction of what Israel has destroyed in Lebanon.
In the time when Qatar reconciled, in the time when Qatar reconciled.
# Saudi Arabia and its older sister, a bond forged in time Approximately two years ago, a special connection was established between Saudi Arabia and its older sister, a bond that has strengthened over time.
At the same time, skirmishes with the regime in Egypt.
# Lebanon File: Success Where Others Failed
In Doha, I brought together the Lebanese leaders who signed an agreement that led them safely.
To the recent elections
As for the stubborn files,
She cared about being the driving force behind these files, not Qatar.
Smallest Arab country
In today's episode
We strive to comprehend the fundamentals and principles that shape Qatar's foreign policy.
Who benefits?
Qatar, small in geography and population, plays these significant roles.
What qualifications enable her?
In a direct dialogue with the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar,
For our viewers who wish to participate, they can call the program's phone numbers that will be displayed consecutively on the screen.
The visit made by the Emir of Qatar.
Roar of guns, Al Jazeera's desire to improve relations with Saudi Arabia.
I was part of the past attempt of a Saudi coup against the Emir of Qatar, in collaboration with members of the Al Marri tribe.
In its edition released on June 20th last month.
What is the nature of the secret deal?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Many of the from the are the things that
I believe it's accurate.
Flour is that I, in more than one interview here in this program, I always say
We consider it the backbone.
Gulf Cooperation Council
There was a misunderstanding.
Then,
Difference of opinions.
Sweet issue of the borders, right? And this was a huge obstacle.
Historical Saudi-Qatari relations are distinctive.
These relationships, if we observe them.
There is a bond between the two families and the two countries.
She was marred by some misunderstandings.
Not by us, nor by them.
There's no need for conditions between brothers.
The relations are now in a state that I can confirm is excellent.
In the interest of the Cooperation Council.
But how was the situation with Al Jazeera channel resolved with Saudi Arabia? It was the obstacle or the reason that led to [the crisis] in 2012.
There's an important point.
I repeat to you, if you go back and watch all the programs, I always said [something].
I am, as well as the big sister, saying that we rely on [untranslatable] in the Cooperation Council.
Saudi Arabia is an important state in the region.
We attach great importance to our relations with her.
There was a media war, and it was clear to both sides.
These countries found themselves
Failed when the brothers agreed.
The Qatari Saudi Private House
They rather found that the most important ones got into a dispute.
They have no say in it; it's none of their business.
I don't think it was a strategy by anyone who got involved in this dispute.
But Sheikh, allow me, allow me, here in this context, to put the matters or points above the letters.
Many observers believe that Al Jazeera has changed a lot in the last two years.
In the time when the situations that were criticized on Al Jazeera's screen
I was previously aware of the situation within Saudi Arabia.
Whether it's the arrested people, the opponents, or others, the list is still there.
Al Jazeera has stopped covering these issues.
Until Al Jazeera's coverage turns to Hajj.
Praise be to the system and all that the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is doing at a time of disagreement.
I can't see first, you can ask the island administration about this subject, don't ask me because I don't know.
The two countries gathered.
Stability in the region.
This strategy persisted and strengthened, first stabilizing the region.
The region refers to the Gulf region.
Gulf Region
There are many issues plaguing the Gulf region.
Also, the call of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Kuwait.
It had an impact on all the listeners and the entire Arab world.
He spoke from his heart about resolving the Arab differences, overcoming them, and burying them.
It's not just a matter of opinions.
No, it's about politics and politics are points of view.
He is considered a genius in the Arab world.
A kind of war.
While the developed world
You're talking about the same interest.
You've been left with a few years.
The situation now, the situation now.
Look first.
There is a complete discrepancy between this topic and that topic.
A small state's idea is to strike the big ones and make them feel weak in front of it.
Any dispute or any misunderstanding.
He had his reasons.
The reasons have come to an end.
The conflict ended with the wisdom of the two leaders.
Are there any guarantees for the future relationship?
There are guarantees for both parties.
On the basis of love, brotherhood, and mutual interest that unites the two countries.
The words of the leaders are more than just a document.
Qatar and Saudi Arabia's efforts to enhance this relationship.
We hope to see this Qatari-Saudi relationship evolve and develop further.
For the better, and there should be vast fields.
This relationship is similar to the model we have with other Arab countries, particularly other Gulf states.
Qatar is an important country.
Fine, Saudi Arabia is an important country.
Egypt, in relation to Qatar, is a what kind of state even though it was noticed at the same time you made peace with Saudi Arabia.
Hezbollah and three organizations.
Al Jazeera Channel
He is on the regime in Egypt, the largest Arab country.
First, let me start with the following:
The Egyptian people
We respect the Egyptian nation.
Our interests
There are many Arab issues and the sacrifices of the Egyptian people.
This is a matter.
We don't think this is an issue that we want to use as an entry point for understanding or misunderstanding with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
In this, in this, you say we respect Egypt and the Egyptian people.
We believe he is a good person.
We have two points of contention with Egypt.
I am.
We've prepared for the coup in Gaza, I don't think.
We don't enter.
In matters concerning other countries.
Do not believe in interference in the affairs of any state unless there is room for reform.
There was no involvement of ours in the coup that Hamas carried out against the authority in Gaza.
Of course, we didn't know about this any differently than the rest did from the media.
Yes, we have relations with Hamas, and we have relations with all parties.
What caused Egypt to differ or create a dispute between you and them on this matter?
This one is for me.
Conspiracy of Hezbollah.
Conspiracy of Hezbollah and also
I'm talking about my country.
This matter came as a huge surprise to us.
If it shakes in favor of Qatar.
The pyramids of Egypt.
Connect, says the Pyramids.
To undermine Egypt and its standing.
Could I reply?
Let's get back to the conspiracy they talked about.
The days will reveal this matter.
Beginning, I am not from the Gaza conference.
I hereby disown her, I absolve the Egyptian people from her, I absolve President Hosni Mubarak from her.
Let's rewind to the MENA conference.
After the Madrid Conference, Mina recalls the one held in Doha.
The conference was held here as per agreement.
They said we don't want to hold the conference.
Hey, we know you're coordinating with Israel.
I am from Qatar, and this is it.
What we want to understand is what.
We sat down and started talking, and our words were always kind.
It has two sides.
What are they?
In a dispute.
The political orientation.
We'll be at the Gaza conference, what happened?
His Highness the Prince spoke with all the presidents, including his brother, His Excellency President Hosni Mubarak.
We received a message from a foreign state.
The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has a perspective on this issue, which is that it complicates matters.
They kill people and we just watch.
If you wish to meet in Doha, we can hold it anywhere at the Arab League.
It is a shame that on the sidelines of the Kuwait Conference, I am discussing an issue.
I am being oppressed by Israel and the Western world, standing by and watching.
When we came, we said, "Okay, now it's happening, and there's nothing we can do. We, the Arabs, can't stop it. No major power has been able to stop this fight."
# Announcement from Egypt: Call for a Ceasefire in Gaza Egypt announces a call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, to be implemented within the next hour.
We too.
We should not underestimate the Arab street. Our disagreement with the Muslim Brotherhood is on one point only.
This is in accordance with international standards.
Our hospitals don't have enough doctors; they're standing at the borders.
You stood at the border.
There is a place that no one dares to enter.
My brothers were very sensitive about this issue.
# Allergy Cause The reason for the allergy is that Gaza is adjacent to Egypt and is considered a national asset.
When we speak about any humanitarian issue, anywhere in the world, we are talking about a humanitarian issue.
We respect Egypt's sovereignty.
We have taken a stand, but this does not undermine the Egyptian position.
We have high hopes for Egypt.
It is the largest Arab country.
We believe you can amplify our voices and those of others in the Arab world.
For all other parties
The rescue operation even after the leap.
The Europeans tried to save it.
# What happened in Gaza from the conference
Whether it's a donors' conference or not, I consider it a rescue for the government.
We were not invited to the conference; we were invited to coordinate among the GCC countries.
We gathered at the Cooperation Council.
These amounts will not be disbursed to any party.
You will spend it.
# Victims in Gaza # Пострадавшим в Газе
Directly and that was it.
No entry from any side.
I am proud of Egypt, and all the people of Qatar are proud of Egypt because Egypt...
Victory for Egypt in political matters is important to us.
You're getting ahead of yourselves.
Give me just two minutes, just two minutes.
One of the ministers boasted proudly about what had been achieved.
Whoever bids against Egypt, we will cut off their tongue and break their arm.
By God, I believe this official has disrespected his own country.
No, they didn't fail, and they couldn't do anything but talk about themselves. If we're being honest.
The Saudis helped them in this, and I told this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia. The Saudis intervened because the king has wisdom in this matter.
The state of affairs in the Arab world.
We agree.
The king decides that this is the interest.
We accept King Abdullah's decision because we respect him and trust him.
If one of them says it's an insult to those who stopped them.
They were like students in a school.
I think so.
The edge is sharp.
Aho must assert his strength.
We are sorry, we are sorry about this matter.
If they think a small country has no right, then its rights have been taken away.
You're sticking your noses where they don't belong in Darfur.
Arab decision at the Arab League.
African and a UN resolution.
I believe the main problem is
Conspiracy, Hezbollah, Qatar joined.
Conspiracy, I don't know what Qatar is up to.
If it spreads, it's possible that after the swine flu, if it starts in a certain place, it could be because of Qatar, as it might be the one spreading the pandemic.
Qatar is a peaceful country, aware of its size and capabilities.
However, Qatar has a point of view.
Qatar has a distinct political policy.
If Qatar can resolve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor.
Los Angeles is an Arab-free zone.
Any Arab dispute weakens our position in the face of our main issues, which are Palestine and the other issues we face.
The Arab world has become a recipient.
Our analyses have become just like theirs.
Western Analytics
While Shana, we know, we understand what happened in Pakistan.
I swear, I really want someone to greet me and roll out the red carpet for me in Washington.
Does anyone blame Qatar?
Has Qatar disrespected any Arab country?
I tried to contribute financially.
These contributions are provocative.
I'm not sure if I can get you angry by saying hello.
This is another issue, which means you have a problem or a deficiency.
This is your issue, not mine.
I've got an internal issue, but I can handle it.
I always tell him.
"Especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah."
I am in Kuwait, and I know this man to be honest.
A man's words are his true intentions.
In his heart, no, no, no, this, no, this is what I always say.
I always say this.
I always tell him, during our biggest disputes with Saudi Arabia, I used to say these words.
Go back to all the documents you have on the island, but...
The issue is different.
I said no unilaterally, we'll stop here.
We tried as much as we could.
I don't want to get into this topic.
They see their affairs, they see their mistakes, and then they see them again.
We need to acknowledge our mistakes; it doesn't mean everything we have is right.
This is His Excellency the Sheikh.
There are internal problems in Egypt.
They want to get out of it.
Qatar denies any involvement in any form of conspiracy against Egypt externally. It will not sever ties with Turkey or any other countries.
By God, we have a superpower.
We are, by God's grace, seventy million; if we can rise to eighty.
They also have an issue that needs to be addressed.
You played a role in the Shalit case, despite knowing that this file was important to the Egyptian government.
I sought with the French.
We received a communication from a friendly nation.
In this matter, we see it, we say, my brothers, this is how the Egyptians do it. They said...
We want to see this matter in a request.
I was told by Israel and another state that we should show the other party this matter.
When we saw this matter, we told them, "Brother, if the same conditions that you are discussing with the brothers in Egypt are applied here..."
This is what we have declared, meaning, there is one responsible person who says, in other words, he is making a mockery of the entire Arab League.
By God, this means, means poor thing.
How did they pull that one on us?
President Mahmoud Abbas remains.
We supported this.
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The issue is on your end.
I believe this is a healthy phenomenon.
I am not the owner of the island as accused.
The island must enter the media competition, just like in the West, where there are many media outlets.
There are many media outlets that, during teenage years, tend to insult each other.
They eventually reach a stage of maturity.
Yes yes and no.
First, our situation with Saudi Arabia is different.
Even if we concede to Saudi Arabia, we accept this in Qatar.
Important relations
Egypt is an important country, but there is a certain privacy in Saudi-Egyptian relations.
Egypt also has a special relationship with any Arab country. Egypt is the largest and most significant state.
This is true. This is true, but with Saudi Arabia there's a history and a relationship that's different.
He is a personal dispute between the officials here and there.
We respect the Excellency of the Egyptian President.
I hope it's just a disagreement in policies and viewpoints.
I told you about the problem when the attack on Gaza happened.
The second problem is that they are sensitive to something we haven't yet identified, anything Qatar does or so.
Why don't you try to set up a meeting with the Egyptian president now, between us?
Saudi Arabia has intervened in this matter.
As the newspapers reported, they first said it was a secret meeting, and then we found him on the following day.
I had a meeting with Omar Suleiman.
# Saudi Arabia ## Location Saudi Arabia is located in the Middle East, occupying most of the Arabian Peninsula. It is bordered by Jordan and Iraq to the north, Kuwait to the northeast, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman to the east, and Yemen to the south. The country also has a coastline along the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. ## Geography The geography of Saudi Arabia is diverse, featuring vast deserts, rugged mountains, and fertile oases. The country is dominated by the Arabian Desert, which covers a significant portion of its territory. The desert landscape is characterized by sand dunes, rocky plateaus, and dry riverbeds known as wadis. ## Climate Saudi Arabia experiences a hot and dry climate, with high temperatures and low rainfall. The country has distinct seasons, with extremely hot summers and mild winters. The coastal regions along the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf experience slightly cooler temperatures due to the moderating influence of the sea. ## Culture Saudi Arabia is known for its rich cultural heritage and Islamic traditions. The country follows a conservative interpretation of Islam, and its culture is deeply rooted in religious values and customs. Saudi society is largely tribal, with strong family ties and a sense of community. Traditional customs and hospitality are highly valued, and social interactions are often guided by respect and courtesy. ## Economy The economy of Saudi Arabia is largely dependent on its vast oil reserves. The country is one of the world's leading oil producers and exporters, with oil and gas industries playing a dominant role in its economic growth. Saudi Arabia has made significant investments in diversifying its economy, focusing on sectors such as tourism, renewable energy, and technology. The country aims to reduce its reliance on oil and create a more sustainable and resilient economy. ## Tourism Saudi Arabia offers a unique blend of cultural and historical attractions. The country is home to ancient archaeological sites, including the UNESCO World Heritage site of Al-Hijr (Madain Saleh), which features well-preserved tombs and rock-cut monuments. Mecca and Medina, the two holiest cities in Islam, attract millions of Muslim pilgrims each year for the Hajj and Umrah journeys. Saudi Arabia also boasts modern cities with vibrant cultural scenes, such as Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam.
No return.
I can't tell you that we agreed on everything.
Let's say, just so no one interprets it wrong, that no, you are not comparing yourselves.
But dignity is dignity, for the young and the old.
The minister said that if Egypt receives the appropriate satisfaction, satisfaction.
# The Phenomenon Among Children There is a peculiar phenomenon that has been observed among children, one that is both intriguing and somewhat concerning. It involves a unique form of expression and communication that has captured the attention of many. This phenomenon, often referred to as "الترظيه بين اطفال," is a fascinating aspect of child development and social interaction.
I don't understand what I'm supposed to translate here. Could you please clarify the text you want me to translate?
Do you have a vision for solving the problems with Egypt, or are you leaving the Egyptian people to await divine intervention?
This is it, please, I don't want to talk about divine intervention and such because God knows who lives and who dies.
Here I am, inviting.
He wants to be stylish.
Our pride in Egypt.
One must follow a certain path.
Either you stand with me or you stand against me.
Why does any Arab citizen suffer?
In the Arab world, we grieve for it, and this is the policy of His Highness the Amir.
Nations derive their strength from sources of power.
The United States has sources of power, China has sources of power, France has sources of power, a small armed state is Qatar.
I put my trust in God.
What's obvious is that there's nothing in it.
That's all a mess, you guys are just messing around.
We're a small country, close to my heart and always on my mind.
I'll repeat it a hundred times.
No one can accuse us of being overly sensitive.
No one will take it from us.
You are now a mere irritation to Israel.
I'm going to Israel.
Our vision for resolving the issue with Egypt.
What's the problem, they weren't the first either.
And every day they file a complaint against America. If I tell you about the major countries you're talking about,
They deal with us out of self-interest, and we deal with them out of self-interest.
All complaints and all
For the sake of destroying the relationship.
I believe it diminishes any major power that engages in such actions.
We also diminish our Arab pride when we run to complain about each other.
Everything comes and everything we know.
Our vision is to be based on the Arab interest.
We're with them in everything.
Are there any upcoming steps to mend the relations?
I know there are close relations between the president and His Highness the Prince.
If anyone has moved anything.
He who opposes the rapprochement between the two countries will find himself at a loss, as in the end, he will be the one to lose.
No, maybe tomorrow, maybe after ten years. I swear, I don't know. We, from our side, always attend any conference we're invited to.
Anyone who invites us to a conference, we will attend, and if we have an opinion, we will express it at the conference.
We can we
Egypt is our elder sister in any matter, but we have our own perspective and we discuss it.
This is all that is required. When the time is right, we are, of course, delighted with this topic.
The cancellation was due to this political shakeup.
We, as mentioned, respect the Egyptian people.
Of course, cancellation of a contract and addition of a contract. You're asking about the number of cancellations, but ask how many Egyptians came to Qatar at the same time.
We have a close relationship with the Egyptian people, they are dear to our hearts here in Qatar, as I mentioned to you regarding the state's policy.
On the fourth of June last year, you tickled the emotions of the Arab peoples by closing the Israeli office. On the fourth of June, Aruts Sheva published it.
Why do you say we've been tickling them? If we wanted to, we could have shut them down twelve years ago.
When Shannon was carrying the burden, before everyone reconciled with Israel and before secret meetings were held between some Arab states and Israel.
And then, and then, and then, after all, after all the Arabs reconciled.
Whether under the table or above it, with Israel or talking to her in any capacity.
If we wanted to tickle emotions, we tickled them at the previous Islamic conference.
The United Nations, Nasser's supporter, held a banquet at the residence of the Israeli ambassador, Bilakji.
Yes, he was a guest among many others present at the banquet, but I don't know what occasion the ambassador held it for.
We sit next to Israel in the United Nations, so no one can deny this issue.
We found a glimmer of hope in alleviating the suffering of our brothers in Palestine.
The management has changed, and unfortunately, the Egyptian issue was a small concern for me.
I didn't raise him, you did.
# My question is about the United States and the new administration, and its impact on your relationship as Qataris with the United States, considering the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
There is a difference of opinion.
Road tackles many issues in the region.
We'll help them to the utmost if they're all serious.
We expect a special relationship or a solution to the problems that existed between us and the Bush administration.
Many of these issues have been resolved.
Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar was in Paris yesterday and discussed the ongoing events in Iran.
Iran has a distinct relationship with you, even though its relations with the United States are poor.
See, first, we need to put it in the context of internal affairs because we must respect every country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon Post-Election
Before the elections, Saad Hariri stated in this program that the Doha Agreement would come to an end with the conduct of the elections.
Is this what you see too or do you think the agreement is still valid or will you need a new agreement?
The Doha agreement was a step towards peaceful elections.
It's been a year and a half since the US election, and a little over a year since the Doha elections.
We were following them day by day and moment by moment until they reached the elections according to the Doha Agreement.
We recently intervened in one of the electoral districts to correct some misunderstandings that occurred.
You still have a say in sorting things out in Lebanon.
We're always close to Lebanon. You know Qataris love Lebanon and they go there. Who do you mean?
I was the first country that I visited after a Western country, Lebanon.
Question: Quick answer about what's happening in Yemen.
You interfered in the Houthi issue, and there are accusations that you supported the Houthis.
You will at least involve you in their situation, which is now in a critical state, as the state is in great danger, and the danger is from the south.
# Why did you stop here? Why did you choose to stop here? Why did you decide to stop in Qatar?
We faced numerous challenges on this matter, but this was our vision and the stance of His Royal Highness, the Prince, on this issue.
Subject: The Houthis
The stability of it positively affects us, and its instability negatively affects us.
Our impartial intervention between the two parties.
We signed the agreement.
But I understand that if this is to be exploited for other reasons
I'll be with them over there, and we always stood by them in every matter.
There is no truth to it.
I think we don't need to.
I sell it.
I say this and I'm not sorry. I know there will be a lot of Arab fans against me.
As I thank you, our dear viewers, hoping that you have enjoyed following us, we hope that we have clarified some aspects of Qatar's foreign policy.
In conclusion, the program team sends their regards. This is Ahmed Mansour greeting you without limits.
Peace be upon you and the mercy and blessings of God.
Dear respected viewers, peace be upon you. Welcome to this exclusive interview.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, State of Qatar.
Of course, why would I call it an exclusive and exceptional interview?
Qatar, and this man in particular, was the primary sponsor.
Sir, a simple and straightforward question.
I believe it happened because there was an Arab consensus at the beginning.
We tried that when we went to the United Nations.
Arab consensus was important, and the Lebanese terrorism from both sides was important.
On reaching the results.
It is crucial to avoid external interference.
Many opinions or suggestions from the outside.
Lebanese, Arabic, international, if you want to say it.
But he went through phases.
There's nothing if there's nothing if it doesn't mean these stages existed.
Does it mean complications in Lebanon?
For a while, the truth.
When you all came together and directly intervened in the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file.
Have we discovered that the Lebanese issue is a major complication?
Lebanese, Arabic, regional, international, in dire need of code-breaking.
She is a simple, tiny knot, but it was magnified by external interference.
# Lebanon: A Beacon of Journalism, Culture, and Tourism Lebanon, a beacon of journalism, a beacon of culture, a beacon of tourism, a beacon for many things.
Lebanese must not allow.
It affects security and peace in Lebanon.
# Problem Number One
External repercussions on Lebanon.
You decided suddenly, like after twenty-four hours, to take everyone on one plane.
Directly from the plane to meet the Emir of Qatar.
They couldn't even expect it, meaning they couldn't relax for a single moment, except for what you graciously bestow upon them.
They won't rest until they overthink it.
They make many connections; that was the secret.
Let's suggest moving them to Doha because we need a change of scenery.
He will gather them in manifold difficulties.
In many circumstances
We brought them out to these circumstances, given that you are here to find a solution.
We must move them out of this atmosphere if we want to succeed.
And quickly.
# The Power of Expression May God guide us to the essence of eloquence, the eloquence of Venice or the eloquence of Beirut.
We agreed that most of them would go to Doha.
Both parties have decided to go to Doha.
Some people think, for example, that Qatar is leaning towards one side against another.
I'm from Beirut, but...
We mean that His Highness's policy is that if we are mediators
In this process.
Sheikh State, to be frank.
Did you consult seriously?
# Involving the two main parties At least with the two main parties concerned, what is happening here in Lebanon, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Syria.
# Saudi Arabia's Brothers, Specifically I spoke with Prince Saud.
He expressed his support for the idea.
We benefited from Prince Saud by...
Everyone wanted a solution.
His justifications are weak.
If he goes, I'll go crazy.
His justifications are weak.
He should have been removed because there is ongoing tension in Palestine.
There is the Iranian nuclear issue.
The Arab League must have a mechanism to resolve issues.
The African Union is better than us in resolving issues.
He tries to gather the parties together.
The conference works to resolve the long-standing Arab issue, which their universities have failed to address for years.
Let the Arabs unite or gather the factions if there is any, and let them intervene to aid the oppressed.
You must study.
If we want the Arab League to be awakened, not the university of the Arab world, come on.
He has the car and the tool for execution.
One of the officials here was President Nabih Berri.
Requires Sin Sin
Lebanese have shown they can agree.
By God, let me tell you, we
The first is Qatar.
Never led to any outcome.
For the Arab interest.
He is a power for the Arabs.
We tested it in various scenarios.
We went to the UN in Doha for the Doha Agreement.
The agenda is to resolve the issue, not another agenda.
There's no doubt that
The most important role they have in the Arab world as a whole, especially.
In a situation.
We pause by agreement.
Come, help us!
This is a serious topic. This is a serious topic, but
Why have we reached a point where everyone is playing in our arena?
In our courtyard.
It is crucial that the interests of our nations and people are upheld.
Now we need an Arab summit after this agreement to see what we will do between the Palestinian brothers.
What are we going to do in Somalia?
What are we going to do about Somalia? We are not a member of the Arab League.
Why aren't we trying to get Sudan and Iraq to join the Arab League?
We are a part of the Arab world, and a small part of the Arab world.
We hope this is what you suggest, an idea.
Can Qatar have good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia?
I believe that first, if we are asked to do something, we should do our best.
But I am sure that His Majesty King Abdullah
King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Bashar's brother
Saudi Arabia and Syria have historically been in agreement.
This may be a transient stage.
We'll find it after that, God willing.
Yet, I insist on asking, may I inquire if you could play a role in this matter?
Even if not publicly, you now have a certain level of trust.
We strive for any rapprochement between the Arab nations.
This is the policy of His Highness from the very beginning, but this topic means...
Can what happened in Lebanon indicate that the region is heading towards serious settlements?
What happened in Lebanon is a local Lebanese affair; the situation in the region remains unchanged.
I am not very attached to this situation.
I wish for the opposite. I wish this wasn't the case.
A new beginning, a new state, a wish for the Arab world.
We can create.
He will happen somewhere else.
In other words, Sheikh State, do you fear that the escalation that was taking place a while ago will resume?
At least until the end of President George Bush's term.
There is no doubt that my concerns are still there, whether it's about Palestine or the current situation in Gaza.
I mean, I just want to ask.
We don't want anything else.
He instructs us to pay attention to this humanitarian aspect in Palestine.
We can deliver medicine to them.
Food and nourishment.
Electricity for the patient in the hospital.
If the power goes out, it dies.
I wish.
We, as the League of Arab States, agree on an amount for this topic of medicine and food, we shall call it medicine and food.
Dude, we don't want the Red Crescent to reach him.
Let the Red Cross deliver it.
Apologies, but the Arab side is committed to this Israeli blockade.
I don't want to go into the details of this matter. I'm just saying that, as Arabs, we must deliver aid and medicine, even if we disagree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia exerted effort and made a pledge at the Holy Kaaba.
"For in this dispute, only the other party will benefit."
I will not deal with this party because we will deliver a solution for you. This is incorrect.
And I
So far, there are no signs of a solution in sight.
Do you fear an American-Iranian confrontation in the coming period, or do you welcome it?
This is possible, of course, we are.
At least talk about the State of Qatar.
Iran is an important neighbor for us.
We may not agree on all of their policies, or they may not agree with all of Qatar's policies.
They basically tell us, "We don't want you to have relations with Israel or any contact with them."
Perhaps there are those who consider you to be inevitably a party through the existing American rules there.
This issue, we know how to handle it.
There were those who said that after the visit of the Emir of Qatar to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
He met, consulted, or spoke with the Saudi family.
# Negotiations in Istanbul between Syria and Israel
I can say it was just a coincidence.
The second subject: The Kingdom was keen to find a solution, and I was in contact with Prince Saud.
What has happened in the past few hours?
Tactic change, change of tactics in negotiations.
Are you from them or from us?
We, as officials, are responsible for this.
I locked the door and we were all alone in the room.
In the end, we found ourselves, and then His Highness the Prince's intervention was crucial.
From it, the invention marched on.
The end, without mentioning it now.
We knew our size, position, and role, and the message was clear.
He wanted to play the role of Menon without provoking any other side.
Whether it's on an Arab, regional, or international level.
However,
He became responsible.
Whether you like it or not.
Some jealousy is some of us, we want to avoid jealousy because we are a state.
These are the states.
You can work or
I believe this is the bacon combo the the comfortable combination
Perhaps one last or penultimate question: your relationship with Washington now, is it distant, extended, or distinguished?
We have a good relationship with Washington, let me put it this way.
There are different perspectives on various issues.
But this is our right, and if they speak of democracy, this is democracy.
How is she good, i.e. how do you translate it on the ground as good, your relationship with
If you're talking about the economy, it's excellent; if you're talking about education, it's excellent too.
If you're talking about health, if you're talking about politics, I can tell you it's doing well.
In your opinion, and quite clearly, what is the next step?
In my opinion, we should leave the topic of confronting Israel.
If we want to stop playing the game in the Arab arena, we will.
We reconcile the Palestinians.
We agree on an opinion so that we can become a respected force.
I believe we have it here.
Let's be proactive.
Thank you, our dear viewers, for your kind attention. Until we meet again, God willing. With my appreciation.
Welcome, our viewers, to this conversation with the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani.
In this dialogue.
We strive to foresee the Arab political reality and Arab efforts.
Happiness, Sheikh, you are most welcome.
To discuss what is happening in Gaza.
I hope that through this dialogue we can achieve something.
Let's shed light on some of your questions.
Entry of the Israelis into Gaza in a ground operation.
Our goal was to have an Arab stance.
Her dealings with friendly nations.
Sisterly countries.
How to attempt to find a clear, strong Arab stance that the Arab countries
Then we find areas for reconciliation.
We acknowledge that more than one Arab country has violated.
Arbitrarily.
No one was held accountable.
We are held accountable for everything, whether intentional or not.
We are the specialists.
We are the only ones in the world who are always targeted.
We always discipline with style.
I think maybe.
We won't be able to the extent that...
Let's meet at the leader's level.
Stop the disciplinary action, we're the kids.
We intended to create a rift in the Arab world.
There were five other verbal approvals.
Approved by a two-thirds majority.
The goal of the meeting is unclear.
We hope that we are right and that our perspective is wrong, because the goal
Solve the problem now, not just talk about it.
This is the blood of Palestinians that makes it all possible.
What we requested from the ministerial committee does not cancel Qatar's request.
"Which was also confirmed by His Highness."
In his speech, he stated that we are not insistent on having it in Qatar. We are not insistent that it be held in Qatar; the summit can take place wherever.
An Arab stance that earns us respect from others.
Yes, as for the ministerial [level].
We want to tell them that the UN Security Council resolution has been issued.
Israel
She was not concerned with the decision, and she continued and still continues to kill and bomb Gaza.
We need to ask the Arabs what we should do.
What are we going to do?
Will Israel ever end?
Does the remainder of the Security Council resolution apply?
There might be a backlash since Israel hasn't stopped.
Fire at our brothers is not forced.
# Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION considering that the deadline has passed
I've been feeling this way for a few days.
We will discuss the ministerial meeting.
You support this proposition in the end.
We support an Arab summit, of course, and this is our idea, and also the idea of several Arab countries, including Syria and Yemen, who have requested the summit.
There is already an Arab rift present.
She lit up all the Afrozens and went to the camp of moderation.
# The Camp of Immoderation
Excess is what they mean by it.
The West has sorted us out.
Moderate Arabs, those called moderates, and non-moderate Arabs.
We find that there is a moderate nation and an immoderate nation.
# What is moderation and immoderation? Is moderation walking in Israel's plans?
Bring the case to an end in a humiliating manner.
We just need to keep the issue alive.
This is an important question.
# الموضوع يعني هل الدول # The topic is: Are countries?
Israel's plans are being executed, and they aim to resolve matters through unconventional means.
I'm not saying it's all part of Israel's plan, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say
If we name the camp Moderation.
What is moderation in the Western perspective?
Do we agree to slaughter a specific group of Palestinians?
Of course, there were elections.
I'm not among the supporters or non-supporters of Hamas, but I'm speaking about reality.
The reality is that there is
Idea
Some of those called the Radical Movement.
We need to ask ourselves what this radical movement is demanding.
She's asking for her rights, which are rightfully hers.
Are we sorting them out?
We also create other blocks.
We are against it.
Internal Arabic Intellectual
This started to happen.
We don't want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, Your Honor, briefly.
I am unable to translate the text as it is incomplete. Please provide the full text you would like translated.
I cannot say ban, as there are references and everyone knows what the topic is about.
Subject: Prohibition
But, like I said, we could have been.
Let's take a vote and get the two-thirds majority.
But it wasn't just about that goal because it's not just a matter of challenge, it's an urgent need that we believe in.
I don't think it's an urgent matter.
Okay, we went to the Security Council.
She is in the UN Security Council resolution.
Israel said, "We will continue and then consider the matter."
I just want to focus on it again.
We might be failing to enforce the decision on the weaker party.
What will it be different from the first meeting?
# Subject of Disputes Usually, disputes arise due to differing opinions and viewpoints.
As important as it is.
Are we ready to have a clear Arab stance?
I am a human translator and I aim for precision and quality. Here is the translation: I am a humanitarian aid worker.
We clearly support our brothers.
We also address the Palestinian-Israeli side and say to them
We should probably discuss this, but I don't think everyone is ready.
Why not freeze the Arab initiative?
We are committed to the forty-eight-hour ceasefire, and we have adhered to it. The Israelis, however, have not.
# Meeting Dynamics It's natural for disputes to arise during meetings, but in all honesty, those disputes...
You express attitudes that reflect the inner thoughts of certain individuals, essentially.
One of the arguments she knew about was
There are those who describe Hamas as a gang.
Not even a minority.
This is a situation that occurred, and we responded to it in a letter from one of the ministers.
I believe this means what the West says.
These are radical movements, a bunch of them, and one of them says they are like this.
We don't want to be men for others.
So it always means and I don't mean anyone in particular.
Any foreigner they find.
A western country or western countries are found.
Among the Arabs
Yes, of course, Your Excellency, Sheikh, now.
Invitation to the Second Ministerial Meeting
By God, his schedule should only have one thing.
Where are you, Arabs, from what is happening, and what is the position of the three-hundred-something nation?
One million Israel Soft.
The decision number 1860 was issued thereafter.
The decision that was issued.
Israel has not implemented it Israel will apply it after the mission is complete
There is no doubt that the Arab delegation exerted effort.
He deserves credit for this decision.
We're calling for Chapter Seven because Israel is above the law, meaning Israel
"And if they are asked, they also say, 'We understand.'"
It's not the Arabs' fault that they are who they are.
If so, Israel is not questioned.
She is above international law.
This is a reality.
Why did you go to the Security Council, and why did you link the convening of an Arab summit to what will be issued by the Security Council?
At the summit, the Security Council will strive for us.
He needs to make a tough decision.
# الى قرار # Towards a Decision
A responsible official may lose his position.
We, the West, are afraid.
We hope that after they decide, for example,
I don't want to stray from the topic.
Those who carried out this attack should rebuild Iraq entirely at their own expense because they are the ones who destroyed it.
Let's not ask the Iraqi government, nor the people who died.
There are no refunds.
Exactly the same thing happened in Sudan when they started talking about Bashir's trial.
# Sheikh's Happiness
# Sheikh Saeed ## Biography Sheikh Saeed is a renowned religious scholar and community leader, known for his profound knowledge of Islamic teachings and his dedication to promoting peace and understanding. He has dedicated his life to serving his community and spreading the message of compassion and tolerance.
A major Arab diplomatic victory at the UN Security Council.
He said there were difficulties in the Security Council because initially they were talking about a presidential statement.
The consequences.
Israel did not comply with it.
I'll commit in two days, in a week, after you finish the task.
They didn't comply with the decision.
Sorry, people are supposed to comply.
Israel accepts after the mission is complete.
You have an alternative to this decision now.
We've done all that we could.
We unfortunately lost some brothers due to their own initiative.
Gaza siege, they participated in it.
I am a friend of the West, and I don't mind having a relationship with the West. I am not...
Against the West, not against America.
However, these people understand the language of interests.
Your friends, your strength.
I'd be happy to hear your perspective.
In the end, only one percent of our viewpoint is considered, and we say we have won.
What is victory?
What does it include?
I cannot state any reservations at this moment as the decision is not final.
The council is master of itself.
You participated in the formulations.
Sha, sharakana f al-sayaghāt ilā hadhin mā. Naʿam, sharakanā. We participated in the formulations to some extent. Yes, we took part.
You never invited the Arab ministers to the meeting with the US Secretary of State.
I'm sure our brothers who went there will be enough for us.
I pointed out certain Arab parties for a specific interest.
Sheikh Saeed, in this field.
For two years now.
Take a look, I don't want to talk about accusations.
I can claim that we have seen everything.
Are they people?
The Israeli rejection is an international rejection, and we also contributed to this rejection.
And from here, the dispute began and the siege commenced.
Israel killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the truce last month.
They prefer to starve rather than let us exhaust them because we don't want them to be in power.
Those are the parties of Sheikh Sa'adah.
Clearly states that the Palestinian-Palestinian dispute
Means if there was
Who created the Palestinian divide? Was there a Palestinian-Palestinian divide?
You're right, my friend, one hundred percent.
I'm not saying Hamas is 100% right.
I do not claim that, nor do I say that.
The mediator usually remains impartial to all parties.
We Arabs should maintain an equal distance from everyone.
We don't want it to exist, so we must end it by any means necessary.
Right and left, march in training troops.
Lay siege to them, withhold their funds and salaries.
We're going to create a positive model in the West Bank.
The people of Gaza see how people are living.
Life is good, good, good.
In contrast, the opposite is true in Gaza.
You are invited to the second Arab ministerial meeting, but this time it is a ministerial meeting.
The discussion about her is still ongoing between Hamas, with Turkish mediation, and [untranslatable].
This meeting you've invited me to seems like an attempt to sidestep [the issue].
Let's wrap it up if we launch another initiative.
We don't have any initiatives.
In this matter.
Egypt is an important Arab country.
We are required to support any Egyptian effort that leads to an understanding.
But it's important
We don't come.
I hate him as if he had defeated me.
There is no path to harmony.
Balanced Egyptian Initiative
Between international requirements, Arabic requirements, and humanitarian needs.
The requirements for Egypt's role, which is an important one, are...
This is a leading Arab state that we respect and appreciate.
This is what is required, in your opinion, for Egypt.
The current proposals do not meet those requirements, Your Excellency.
I have a vision for the initiative.
What is announced, we hear about it from here and there, information about it.
I can't comment on something I don't know about.
With all due respect to the Palestinian government or presidency, it should be present, and we all recognize the Palestinian presidency.
But there are also people.
Awaiting on the sidelines, we must consider their perspective.
In order for this mediation to succeed
By the way, it's important to consider his perspective.
The Hamas position was clear that our opinion was not taken into account in this decision, which means how can it be issued?
Decision in which Arabs participate in its formulation without contacting or taking the opinion of the main concerned party on the matter.
We only deal with the Palestinian state, of course.
We deal with the authorities, let's say as a single entity, a one-sided party.
However, there is now a rift between one side located here and another side located elsewhere.
We should not neglect our dealings with the people in the West Bank, including the Palestinian Authority, just because we are engaging with those in Gaza.
We deal with the Palestinians as a people and as one government.
If they ask for anyone from Gaza to be with them, let it be me.
Now we're coordinating together.
What was announced was announced about her.
Firstly, the decision is not to say no to it; he welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiatives.
Some considered it a mechanism.
This is an interpretation, but what I understood from reading the decision is that he welcomed the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative succeeds in its mission.
Cease the fighting.
I don't doubt our brothers in Egypt.
Israel has not accepted the UN Security Council's resolution.
You consider this decision to be null and void since Israel has not accepted it.
Even if you accept it later, things on the ground may have changed.
Yes, Your Excellency, we are discussing the Egyptian efforts, the Egyptian efforts.
They also share efforts with Turkey at the same time and
# Arab Paralysis
An Arab dispute that cannot be resolved will only lead to occupation.
It was supposed to be occupied by Arab parties.
I welcome Turkey's position.
The stance must be appreciated on an Arab and Islamic level.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
This is the natural role.
People have to follow me.
There is no Arab consensus on how to address the situation.
One says, "Let them finish the mission."
It is imperative that there be a clear and unequivocal Arab stance condemning this aggression, its persistence, and the delays in addressing it.
I am in an Arab position facing an interview.
Israel is capable of doing so in the village. I'm not talking about an Arab-Israeli war, and we are among those who always advocate for peace.
We're a country, so you want to live safely.
I'm not asking for an Arab war; I'm asking for a stance.
Clear Arabic
In the context of discussing initiatives and proposals, of course you're following what's going on.
The proposals and conditions set by Hamas.
Do you think
As a supervisor, I am now witnessing the field reality.
The politician who emerged from the military operation now allows Hamas to impose its terms.
It is necessary to be right.
We agree with this point. We do not agree with you on this point.
The second thing.
They are not here now, they are negotiating. I don't know anything about this negotiation, as I told you.
The second thing.
Okay, in such situations, what is expected of Arabs?
This is the Arab reality.
We witnessed the impact of initiating those operations.
There is no doubt that the position of the Arab street is far, far ahead of [something]
We, as governments,
Of course, I'm sorry that some describe this blessed popular gift in such a manner.
They keep telling me this topic.
Let our nations' voices be heard.
The presidents now.
They want to.
They should at least see what.
# Demanding, of course, there's a high ceiling and there's a modest ceiling.
Stop normalization, stop diplomatic relations with Israel.
Qatr bān
The Israeli representative office in Doha is closed.
Qatar, which takes this stance.
The Arab side should be radical and take radical stances.
We agree collectively on whatever the Arabs agree on.
Let's start if there's an Arab agreement.
The treaty is one thing, and the relations are another.
We're ready.
We align with our Arab brothers.
Let there be a decision with clear and credible Arab resolve.
They also deal with others, not just countries with established relations.
Even countries that have no relations.
It's very important.
We won't be anyone's pawns.
Qatar should be a role model in this field.
We're ready to be a part of this, if this is the only model.
We also want it.
Qatar commits to a portion of its Arab obligation as a model.
A drop.
No one should go and sell the property.
Our problem is the lack of trust between Arab countries.
I don't want to say, unfortunately, I don't want to say brokers.
It is therefore very important.
A formal invitation anywhere, for we must rise above this.
Some summoned the ambassador, some lodged protests, and some, like Switzerland, expelled the ambassador.
This is part of the disagreement.
Some of them summoned the ambassador, and those who summoned are the five permanent member states. All of this is just a show for our people.
We talked about the modest ceiling of public demand.
There are those who call for opening new fronts, and there are those who demand Syria to open its front with Israel.
Look, I told you, we advocate for peace, not for conflict with Israel.
We do not seek conflict with Israel.
To fight a battle with Israel.
How are we going to agree?
This is also a problem.
Let's speak to each other, overcome our differences, and move forward.
I was fascinated by what Sa'ada Sheikh said.
Conditions that states do not sell to each other.
What do you mean?
Does that mean now?
The street won't spare us.
# Sheikh's Happiness
Is what is happening today the completion of a project that began in 2006 with the Lebanon War?
Do you think there is a difference?
I don't think there's a difference in our goals.
Lebanon had a land that was liberated.
The remaining parts should presumably be deposited with the United Nations.
Or something like that.
Lebanon means we have dealt with the Lebanese issue on a large scale.
Israel, of course, needs surrounding states to be weak.
You're the boss, and you hold all the cards.
Foreign-backed states, of course.
She wants to remain the sole power in the region.
And now they want it.
# Example of a Translation Change this example in Gaza.
In Lebanon, you speak to how many sects?
How many directions.
While Lebanon is bleeding, Palestine speaks of unity.
I keep emphasizing to you that the Palestinians' problem is that they listen too much to the Arabs and foreigners.
# Two Sides And from here, the gap emerged, and each side believes they can control the other.
I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by "برايك ك ك ك مراقب ومتابع". Could you please clarify or provide more context for the text you would like translated?
As planned, it ends with a broken bone.
We, as Arabs, do we accept this, as this example might repeat for those who are stubborn?
He expresses his opinion.
Let's hope for the best, for Israelis and others alike, in the future.
We gave an example.
# The Highest in Obedience and Assistance to Break the Bone
I stand with my cousin against a stranger, and I stand with my brother against my cousin.
We should assume now that there is no dispute with Hamas, and I do not say that Hamas or any other party is immune to mistakes or authority.
They all have flaws.
Now we must ensure that this matter is not overlooked.
Bow down, one side.
# Failure is Not an Option Here, failure is not just a failure of the group.
# Happiness Sheikh Qatar usually means taking the initiative to propose for a while now.
We took initiatives to resolve it in Lebanon.
It happened in Darfur. We will talk about this topic, even briefly, in a little while.
We are
We don't want to be a burden on our brothers because there's sensitivity sometimes.
I am a state that undertakes all these initiatives; we have no objection as long as the issue is resolved.
We're not aiming to put Qatar on the top headline right now.
"That was not among the objectives of His Highness the Prince."
These were his goals; how do we stop this bleeding?
Let's put an end to this bullying.
What happened surpasses imagination.
We're in Qatar.
Do we know something they don't? I don't think so.
The most important thing is that we have the intention.
Honesty is the key to reaching a respectable solution.
# The Initiatives Talking about initiatives is useful to know where the initiative stands regarding Darfur and the Justice and Equality Movement's resolution.
The Sudanese government in Khartoum.
The solution to the Darfur issue should be specific and address the root causes, as the Darfur problem initially stemmed from...
Arabs helped.
We have reached the international level with our issue.
We want to get revenge on the system, and now we want to resolve the issue but we don't know how to solve it.
We always strive, as mentioned at the beginning, to implement the decisions. We are the best at implementing decisions.
Dimensions of the issue, removing it from competition. Is there also competition in the Darfur issue?
I don't want to get involved in this matter.
Before we conclude this conversation, Your Excellency, there is an economic summit.
Will this summit be held? Will you attend this summit?
No, we will ban the summit.
We hope it would be held in a different atmosphere than the typical Arab one, but it is programmed.
It would be a shame.
Okay, if the Arab leaders had attended this summit.
When Palestinian blood was shed in Gaza, and now they are celebrating for financial and economic reasons.
Let's help to fuel [the fire].
No one seems to be afraid of this street.
I know about the circumstances, of course, we all wish for safety and nothing less.
We will be safe.
But no one takes anyone with them in their small pocket.
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, I thank you very much.
Dear viewers, wherever you are, peace be upon you.
What is the point of this celebration and how sincere are the statements of the High Commissioner for Human Rights?
# People with Disabilities: The Most Neglected Group in the World
What about the Arab region and its interest in this issue?
These questions and more we put forward to our guest for today's episode.
Special Rapporteur on Disability, former United Nations
She holds a Bachelor's degree in Arts, Social Work, and Sociology from Qatar University.
Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policies from Helwan University, Egypt.
I have held numerous positions in the field of disability.
She is a founding member and the general coordinator of the National Committee for People with Disabilities.
# 1998 AD
Deputy Chairman of the National Committee for Disabled Persons since 1999
2003
I contributed to the establishment of the Al Shafalah Center for Persons with Disabilities.
People with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest has overseen the launch of numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
Activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world.
I contributed by delivering lectures, participating in meetings, conferences, and forums.
Ahlan bek, sitt Hissa, ma'ana fee hadihi al-halkah.
# Persons with Disabilities
In the beginning, we used the term "disabled" perhaps in the eighties and before.
Educational more when
Lies within who is offered that education.
In 1993, an important document emerged at the United Nations.
On mentioning this term, before we delve into the details.
# The Remaining Regions Despite the fact that there are regions that are not considered or classified as developing, they are classified as poor.
Latin America, and especially Latin America, is a region where this trend is stronger than in any other region.
Statistics have proven otherwise.
The trend towards a rights-based approach is present in the Arab world; you can find it in many countries.
It is possible that the resources are available and the political will exists.
Okay, let me share some statistics with you, you probably already know them.
Eighty percent of them are from poor countries.
UNESCO states that nearly ninety percent of disabled children in poor countries do not attend school.
Lady Hessa, how do you comment on these statistics?
She is very realistic.
I first saw it in Darfur, Gaza, and in areas that experience such events, which are wars and conflicts.
In that place, you won't be able to tell the difference between a disabled person and a non-disabled person, as the numbers are vast.
Children's illiteracy rate among females is approximately three and fifty or two and fifty.
In other countries, too.
There are many obstacles that prevent these children from reaching schools, even if they have no disabilities.
The city originally has no infrastructure, not even for this child if that school existed.
He can access it.
For the children and for the other residents, it is...
This kind of projects and agendas are wonderful, but we don't hear about them often in reality.
Except when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated a few days ago, what is the purpose of this celebration?
How is the situation in the world?
Better off than those who are not disabled in the first place.
Some organizations arrived and established many projects.
He applies a very important health strategy.
By implementing this strategy
There is an overlap between humanitarian affairs and working with specific marginalized groups, such as persons with disabilities.
I am now aware of a better world in the Arab world.
At the point of awareness, we pause to receive signals and continue our dialogue.
Thank you.
I have two questions I'd like to ask, given my previous role as a UN rapporteur.
The second point: What is it?
United Nations laws that call for, for example, combating systems that hinder the child's development, like the Syrian intelligence system.
Is there a law that allows me to file a lawsuit against the system, as many people in Syria have done?
Yes, Suleiman, your idea is clear. Suleiman Krou, tell us about Syria. Thank you very much. With us is Nayef Al-Sa'eed from Kuwait. Please, Nayef.
Hello, may peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you.
Peace be upon you.
Good evening.
Good evening, please go ahead.
I am, please, I have an intellectual disability.
Listen, the Arabs say, the wise understand with a hint.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Glory be to Him Who has caused me to speak and caused all things to speak.
I've been sitting here for over thirty years, maybe not speaking more than a word or two a day.
Praise be to God, God has given me speech.
He's talking big, and then I was like...
They are attacking me, saying I exploit the Quran and that I am a hypocrite, targeting people and so on.
They are slandering me and targeting me, while they are destined for the lowest depths of the fire.
I've only gotten defamation.
We do not distort the truth.
He who lives in a glass house shouldn't throw stones.
Mental disabilities, of course.
She falls within this definition. The question of Mr. Suleiman regarding...
# United Nations Programs and Their Reactions to Disability Causes What are the reactions of United Nations programs to disability causes, such as political goals or other factors?
Reach out to different organizations and agencies.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure what you mean by "عفوا لاي درجه." Could you please clarify or provide the full context of the sentence? I'll be happy to translate it accurately once I have a better understanding.
There are women employees and disability issues on her agenda, in other words.
UNESCO International Labour Organization UNICEF The fact that these organizations originally put disability on the agenda
He is one of the programs that strive to not overlook children with disabilities.
Opportunities and schools
From various environmental and other aspects.
UNICEF as well
However, there are shortcomings that we must acknowledge; there are shortcomings in the situation at the United Nations as well.
## What are the most prominent weaknesses and shortcomings you mentioned?
Regarding the United Nations,
The issue of routine and bureaucracy.
I was physically present in my country, the State of Qatar.
But there was a routine and bureaucracy that hindered.
I work particularly well sometimes despite the constraints or limitations.
Struggling and fighting, people with disabilities battle for recognition.
Until I reached a point that was somehow satisfactory, I didn't place it in a separate subject as the global movement for disability wanted.
However, it occupied a rather suitable part.
Unfortunately, there is no coordination among them.
This is one of her most significant shortcomings.
A survey conducted by the Special Rapporteur was applied to countries.
Within the staff or within the employees of those programs.
Unfortunately, we only received three responses out of forty-eight organizations and agencies; we only got three responses.
Don't put.
# Permanent, Stable, and Continuous Disability: A Human Rights Issue The issue of disability, which has persisted for many long years, is primarily a human rights matter.
In the recent period, yes, praise be to God, for the last two or three years.
The issue of disability is at least addressed through events such as seminars and others.
Hello, how are you?
Madam, why are there no binding laws and resolutions for the Arab countries, and who is responsible for enforcing these international laws?
Regarding Arab countries and allocating salaries, for example, allocating a salary for people with disabilities.
Is there money allocated by the United Nations?
Do these funds go to the governments or to offices specifically for the United Nations? Do these aids actually reach the disabled?
Note finally, if there are no binding decisions for the Arab states.
Thank you very much, Ahmad Al-Halabi, speaking to us from Greece.
Ibrahim Abdullah is with us from Saudi Arabia. Go ahead, Ibrahim.
Hello.
Peace be upon you.
Adopt this proposal.
Write directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
You are converting to this fund.
He is a manufacturing plant producer.
Allocate just one percent of the annual net profit.
I return to our guest to answer the callers' questions.
He says that the doctors advised him to undergo surgery, but
This operation is too expensive, and he cannot afford it. So, where should he turn?
He is from Algeria.
I believe it is important to meet Naji's needs.
# Rights of Persons with Disabilities: A Fundamental Principle Just like any other rights, the rights of persons with disabilities are essential and must be upheld.
All these rights are due and must be obtained by this citizen.
To join the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this is a binding and legal convention.
Saturation of rights and needs of individuals within its national scope.
He is not even at the level of non-governmental organizations.
Obligatory for all states, with supervision to ensure the implementation of these laws.
At the very least, at the official level, there must be awareness.
We must at least work on these charters in this way.
Even if there is no significant commitment.
There was a response to the reports regarding the monitoring you were conducting, and was there any interest?
Don't forget that the normative rules are ethically binding, a fact, not legally.
Be committed and endorse it.
We understand that these issues will be resolved, discussed, or brought up within a societal context that is plagued by numerous problems and challenges.
Naji Zakarni, director of the National Center for the Deaf, is an expert in sign language at Al Jazeera.
At the outset, Mr. Ali extends his sincere gratitude to Al Jazeera Channel.
The one who kindly aired this special episode just now.
Now Ali is speaking and saying he is very proud.
She was a servant to all with special needs at the place she was in and still is.
We support her and stand by her side, always and forever.
I also say that there are many people with special needs.
There are some who are unaware of this agreement as there were no training sessions.
Regarding them, especially if they are in schools, hospitals, or in public and private institutions.
It is essential that this agreement be published.
It's as if there's a law dedicated to individuals with special needs across all countries of the world.
This is even more important and I insist that the states take action.
Adopting and signing this convention.
# Our Role Model Qatar and some other countries have also signed this document with the aim of serving people with special needs and benefiting us as well.
I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to you, my colleague Naji. You spoke on behalf of Ali.
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to both of you.
Your opinion might make a decision.
Special Rapporteur on Disability of the United Nations, perhaps we could start with the proposal made by one of the callers, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
# Establishing a Support Fund
It is a voluntary fund that accepts contributions from any state.
This fund is supposed to be spent on the activities that the special rapporteur carries out in the course of his duties.
Even the Arab countries have not made donations, except for one state, which is Syria.
Therefore, fulfilling those commitments is a problem within the United Nations.
The box that
Unfortunately, there is a lack of commitment from the member states and a lack of interest.
Many people unfortunately say it boldly: we don't care about the current situation.
It's a fact, the matter of obligations.
Human rights
Man in its broadest sense.
The marginalized, especially women.
However, that is why those covenants exist.
If these countries fulfill their obligations, it is a good idea that the brother has initiated.
It is essential that there is not only an independent fund, but also that the organizations already present in the region are considered.
I have my balances.
March for projects for people with disabilities in Gaza.
Assistance for people with disabilities.
It's always a matter of interference, political factors interfere.
His state or government has supported him greatly.
The number unfortunately shrank.
Small amounts.
The father is disabled.
Of course, his citizenship was revoked.
The girl withdrew, she has a daughter who is her age.
I sometimes do.
Problems in teaching.
We travel or go out, we get caught in a state of confusion.
Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh
Peace be upon you.
We can.
# Reclaiming Their Identities, With Knowledge
I wish that Arab countries would allocate a portion of their budget
Thank you very much, Bahjat. Bahjat's joy from Kuwait.
Aisha Mohammed from Qatar, please proceed.
Hello.
Peace be upon you.
Good evening to you and good evening to Sheikha Bint Khalifa.
I just want to convey a message of gratitude and appreciation to her.
In the past years
We, the residents of [untranslatable], wish you all the best.
In Her Highness Sheikha Hessa's continuous support for them.
Banner bearer, honorable sir from Tunisia, welcome.
There is another level, which is genetic.
I believe that genetic-level care reduces the percentage of disabled people.
There is a tradition in our Arab customs where a man often marries his cousin, the daughter of his paternal uncle, and the daughter of his maternal aunt, and so on.
This means at this level, which is the level of disability. Thank you.
Comment and respond to what has been said in viewers' calls.
The truth is, as I mentioned, on a national level.
I am aware of the availability of guidance and support programs.
Within the health services, there are located...
Those that are also under the Hamad Medical umbrella.
Within the psychological clinic and also in education, there are LLL programs under the Supreme Education Council.
Special Education Department I honestly don't know if it still exists.
However, it is certain that it is within the healthcare services. Yes, there is support and there are medical services.
We provide rehabilitation services for these cases.
Prevention is better than cure, and he pointed out the genetic factor of consanguineous marriages. Are there any campaigns?
For example, to raise awareness.
In this field.
Certainly, this is a very important and critical point.
I and others have touched upon this matter in many words and numerous posts.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns that are not just directed.
The World Health Organization implemented it.
UNICEF as well.
Now, in many Arab countries, including Qatar,
Tunisia, undoubtedly.
There are now binding decisions for early screening.
And which has been implemented in many countries.
This is all on the preventive side.
Do these campaigns receive a response?
Positivity, especially when it clashes with traditions and customs.
Of course, that's the difficulty, it clashes with the societal culture.
I will be in the decision to be in strategies to be in the will that confronts it and obliges.
The issue of early screening, for example, is a very important matter before marriage.
Do you have any statistics regarding people with disabilities?
Specially for the disabled in the Arab region.
Draw a conclusion based on the Arab region, in the sense that.
f especially
With the recent events in the region,
In conflict zones and hotspots, wars, conflicts, and other such issues are relative to the context.
Every death corresponds to three disabled persons.
Events in Lebanon, in Darfur, and in many other regions.
Never, no way, it's not enough. First of all, it's a matter of me.
# Human Rights Principles
There must be a place for the disabled and their programs and plans.
Within the agendas that already exist in the ministries, institutions, and governmental and non-governmental organizations,
In circumstances such as war or unrest,
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, only to your words.
In the world, and stranger still, the International Monitoring Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities stated that the population statistics
Does it mean that people with disabilities are not included in the general population statistics?
He is not always vocal.
For instance, in the State of Qatar, when the census was conducted, I believe it was more than five years ago.
But honestly
In collaboration with the device with the Council for Planning and with the
The Council prepared it as a reality and not as a contribution from us as an office of the Special Rapporteur.
# Classification of Disabilities: A Comprehensive Guide The classification of disabilities is a critical aspect of understanding and addressing the diverse needs of individuals with disabilities. It involves categorizing and organizing various types of impairments, limitations, and restrictions that individuals may experience. By establishing a comprehensive classification system, we can better recognize and support the unique challenges faced by people with disabilities, ensuring they receive the necessary accommodations and services.
# Requirements that are assumed to be available
Quality of those AHK scripts, all these important details that will surely lead you to a result.
Is there a disabled person or not?
Absolutely, but at least.
Statistics are somewhat on the rise in this regard.
Hello.
Madam, I thank you for this program and I extend my gratitude to Sheikha Hessa.
I am grateful and thankful to God that I am a Qatari and receive this attention from my country.
My daughter is now a student in independent schools and receives a good education, praise be to God.
I would like to thank Ms. Hissa.
We are driven by the role and the role that makes us not fear and not worry about our children.
To God be praise, gratitude, and immense gratitude for her and for those who support this category.
# Thank you, Fatima Al-Dosari Thank you, thank you very much, Fatima Al-Dosari. We're speaking with Fatima from Qatar. Let's stay in Qatar with Latifa.
Hello.
Peace be upon you.
Dear Ms. Ikhtai, the reality, the desired, and what we await is for a solution to be found to the problem of our stateless children.
Where is the sheikha for our Qatari children?
I hope she answers this question.
Hello, how are you?
I testify to the service provided by the State of Qatar, especially for the hearing impaired.
We had an early detection program for hearing loss.
The Higher Council for Persons with Disabilities
"For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability."
Even MGOs or other civil society associations.
The reality and the expected is that if I compare over five years.
Five years ago and now, what is provided for the disabled.
Thank you very much, Karim Nasim, for joining us from Jordan. I'll now turn back to our guest.
Sure, of course.
The community as a whole, its individuals, and especially families with children.
Children with disabilities have great ambitions and high expectations.
Whether it's at the planning level or the implementation level.
However, regarding one of the points you mentioned, which is very important.
Children without documents or other forms of identification, whether in Qatar or elsewhere, face challenges.
International Convention as many international documents
Commitment to translate it into plans and strategies.
Provide those services automatically.
From the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, gender, or nationality,
# My Journey as a Special Rapporteur on Disability at the United Nations I am pleased to share my experience as a Special Rapporteur on Disability at the United Nations, a role I held for six years.
I was wishing.
Perhaps time didn't allow it, perhaps the financial aid wasn't sufficient.
There are many achievements that have been accomplished, and I am proud of them.
Through my participation, through existing organizations, and through the N governmental institutions in many countries.
In the Arab region, specifically, I emphasize.
There should be more research and larger studies.
We embarked on a global survey, which has yielded more than one report.
Raising awareness is an ongoing process that requires continuous and extensive effort.
Coordination among Arab states.
Among the same persons, persons with disabilities and their organizations, for they are the ones.
They have a duty that must be fulfilled.
Let them struggle for it.
Many thanks.
Thank you.
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode, I would like to thank everyone who shared their opinions and comments with us.
Tomorrow, God willing, we meet with a new guest.
Stay with us through your calls and messages in a new episode of Live with. Goodbye.
Good morning, roses.
I am very happy to have you with us.
At first, before we start asking various questions and chit-chatting this morning.
"Thank you, Shaimaa. Maybe I congratulated you."
The Middle East deserves this global achievement.
Qatar has put us on the world map.
Thank you, Qatar.
Sure, please come in, Ali.
Good morning, dear viewers.
Congratulations on the hosting, and to the entire Qatari population.
God willing, just as Sheikh Mohammed said.
Before it was a dream, and now, God willing, it has become a reality, and the work starts today or from the moment of the announcement.
I was expecting Qatar to host the World Cup in 2022.
Despite having strong competitors like the US, Japan, and Australia, I was not worried in this field, specifically in this topic.
No, look, I'll be honest with you, I'm 70% sure I won't take the Qatar.
Our file is too big.
We have global plans and are competing on a global scale.
We were up for the competition, man.
Why should we be afraid?
Alhamdulillah, Qatar's bid was indeed strong and deserved it.
It is true that the 2022 World Cup file and hosting in Qatar
What's up with that, man?
They will surely be overjoyed, immensely happy, in this field. God willing.
I wanted to talk about this before, but I thought it would be nice to share it on air.
In the moment of announcement.
Where were you? How did you receive the news? How shocking was it? Come on, tell us, tell us. You, speak to us and to the viewers.
On the radio
The whole world is with us.
I draw the line at this announcement.
How did you see the global media?
See, on the level of sports channels as a whole, no one insisted, especially the Arab countries. Alhamdulillah, everyone gave their support.
Just the announcement itself is Qatar's victory; it has the right to host.
All Arab countries, and it is not strange for them, have made this generous gesture by announcing that they are ready to offer Qatar whatever it needs.
Media personnel can be human resources, possibly as volunteers in the future.
# شيماء ## Even at the level of external media
I celebrated my birthday badly.
Join them within the group that included those who were photographed by the French News Agency.
We also have meetings.
No one insisted at all, Qatar became now, let me tell you, I remember daily.
Hundreds of times a day, from the smallest spot on Earth to the largest.
I'm expecting everyone will know Qatar, for those who don't know Qatar on the globe, it's now on the internet.
The owner of the 2022 World Cup.
Any football player dreams of representing his country and being part of the national team.
Of course, any player in the Qatari league would wish to represent the national team.
"So, that's a positive thing, to kill oneself even in matches."
He will give it his all, even if he doesn't make it to the national team and ends up in the squad.
He has to give his all, whether in training or in matches, because he's wearing the national team's badge on his chest.
I swear, the officials did not fall short; they paid attention to the players, especially the young ones. They teach them professionalism from a young age.
Food sleep
Tell me about your experience, as you've played in multiple age groups. How was your journey, and where do you think the most important stage was for you?
By God, it was of course.
I was included in the national team stages, from the seedlings to the first team.
You know, camps with clubs, with the club, with the national team.
At every stage, there's a unique character.
Yes, Lana, Mashallah, it means you were so mobile.
We are now used to you, Lana, the sports channel.
I always see you like this, so sporty. We love to get some information from you and know the sports news through Lana. So, what's up with sports with you?
I'm sorry, but I'm not quite sure what you mean by "منوعات" and "نجوم" in this context. Could you provide me with a bit more information or context so I can provide an accurate translation?
Ali and others like him in their sports field.
# بالعكس نشاط الرياضة # Sports Activity Reversed
What's up, we were the capital of sports.
Qatar, and now we are the capital of sports and global football.
Instead of being in the variety show, you should host socio-economic and cultural programs.
We have various sports fields, volleyball, basketball, and different championships.
Sport after that.
Sweet excellent
I wished for honesty.
I wish I were ten years old now, not twenty-five.
The young players got a chance, a big chance.
They hold it, like they say, in their hands.
Sweet on what, God willing. The word I want to address to the players is
I will, God willing, it will be the young newcomers who will have a bright future, God willing, in the coming days, God willing.
Sure, I told them this is an opportunity and they have to take advantage of it.
This is a golden opportunity, they say.
They must exploit it to a greater extent.
We have some new stuff. What's up with you? What's the latest news? What's new now with the programs you're going to present? I know we've kept you a bit busy after the vacation.
Tell me about your new endeavors, God willing.
I am in constant contact with the event. God willing, we will be there to watch the Asian Cup in one month. I will start then.
We just won the Gulf Cup two days ago. By the way, let's congratulate the Kuwaiti national team.
News bulletin is also available, so we're keeping up with Al-Hadas.
I am definitely the main anchor, by the way, on Qatar TV, so my first appearance to viewers was through the Qatari screen.
I will not ever forget this kindness.
Wow, Mashallah, they are delivering the media message across various channels.
If they are private channels, sports channels, or any other type of channels.
Thank you, Qatar TV.
We certainly wish you all the best and success, God willing, and we are still working on this matter.
First of all, I'd like to thank the management of Al-Wakrah Club.
Crowds of Al-Wakrah Club fans are
My childhood in Al-Wakrah.
Sheik was with us yesterday. Sheik Nasser was with us.
I'm from the club.
I am still a son of Al-Wakrah and a native of Al-Wakrah.
Just like I told you before, this program is professional.
Every individual on the land of Qatar has rights.
The young people, we know that they love sports and addiction just like you.
How can we make a sport enter the realm of sociology?
Media awareness plays a crucial role in promoting sports across various aspects of life.
Do you have any programs for youth addiction? However, currently, sports have started to enter schools, and sports awareness has become a part of the school curriculum.
On special occasions, they celebrate any sports event with festivities.
We have the Qatari street, so we'll see the signs on the roads. This is also considered sports awareness.
The female element is specialized for a place in the stands or anywhere else.
Hey, it's also about raising awareness for women or let's say promoting women's participation in the sports field.
We now have a national team for women players.
I'm imagining that, thank God, sports are starting to expand.
I also expect that the time period
To undertake many projects and raise awareness on a large scale about the topic of sports. I think this is a sufficient period of time.
If you study properly and work properly, you will succeed.
Hey, enough, and in the same breath, we need to utilize it properly, just like she did.
Later on, there's a point I wanted to take advantage of regarding how the younger generations can be exploited by the national team.
We have all the necessary resources, skills, and equipment.
Also, in our job, it's important that, thanks to God, in Qatar, this is well-known among Gulf and Arab communities that they love sports a lot.
How can I attract this audience to follow sports news and games in Qatar on a regular basis?
All attendees are required to be present at the same time.
Most Qataris love sports, they love football, but the problem is attendance.
If you visit forums, you'll find that there's a lot of interest, especially in the forums of some clubs or clubs where the majority of fans are.
There is a great interest in football in the league.
As a player, as a Qatari citizen, what is the solution you feel could attract you to stay away, to be an athlete away, to be a player?
What's the way your friends can watch the matches?
He relies on the individual themselves, not as a general thought or idea.
Some of them like to watch it on TV, or they gather in groups.
Japan, for instance, has developed a large-scale plan to attract a wider audience to attend.
When I attend the matches, I collect points, I don't know what it means, they are looking for solutions now, so hopefully.
I am sorry, but I am unable to understand your request. Could you please provide the text you would like translated?
The most important thing for every player is to be present, God willing, in Qatar, especially for the 2022 tournament. What do you think we might need?
The support is not only material, what else do you think is really important and needed?
Provide the means that can be made available to the generation to truly deserve the name of the Qatari team and participate in the grandest World Cup.
The time when he told me now, it started to end, I kept asking myself when, subhanallah, the time ended so quickly with the lovely ones.
# Impossible is nothing We dared the impossible and achieved the dream we once thought was impossible. But, Alhamdulillah, we are living it now in reality.
Just like Sheikh Mohammed said, these are the moments of celebration, but now it's time to get down to business.
Insha'Allah, 2022 will be an eventful year befitting the name of Qatar.
I congratulate every person on the land of Qatar and tell them honestly, Qatar has now become a landmark of the world.
By hosting 2022.
Thank you to the elegant journalist Lana Al-Adi, we wish you all the best, God willing, and we will always follow you to benefit from sports.
Thank you so much, the joy is definitely in the eyes of the Emiratis.
Young Qatari talents
We're sitting here, singing a new genre of songs that has emerged during this period.
But in a rap style, on a music platform, with a fast rhythm.
I also like rap, God willing.
Let's join us, our dear viewers, as we embark on this journey together. Good morning!
We try to take a quick glance at it.
In short, rap can be defined as fast-paced musical poetry.
He performs it with hesitation, not with rapid rhythmic singing of the lyrics.
Composed of a large number of rhymes, it addresses a variety of themes and issues.
Sometimes it can be personal.
Emotional political meeting
# Controversial Topics They are often controversial.
Liberated to a great extent.
Rapper and our guest doesn't sing the lyrics of the song.
He repeats it.
His voice is but a secondary factor.
In rap music, the voice is generally not important.
# Rapper, not singer And that's why he's not called a singer but a rapper or an MC.
The rabbi is concerned about the following racism in the songs.
For example, the flow is the flow of threads, concurrency, for example, or casting.
May they have followers, may they have their audience, may they have their admirers.
They have a unique rap style.
I expect they will give you a better and broader idea than I can personally.
Good morning, hello.
I swear, first of all, it was a period where we loved to do something new.
We stand out for our uniqueness.
Why can't we rap, you know?
Then rap is an art form that exists in every country in the world.
Why isn't it available in Tar?
We're like, let's invent something new.
Let's give him a hint, a message from it.
In it, we discuss the negatives and positives that occur in our society.
We send a message first, second, it's like a shroud, you know.
This art is one of the various arts, and by the way, perhaps this information is useful to the viewer: it has addressed many social and psychological issues among youth on a large scale.
I expect everything to change with time, and I expect it to change with the changing times.
And God, he was a bit too weak to handle the change.
We started singing around 2005, the change was weakest in the beginning.
We call ourselves the new beginning, 2010.
In the suburbs, it's more popular and common.
She loves to try and sing and perform in a rap style during this period. I've noticed this.
Yes, definitely a large proportion of people still.
We also need to talk about his work; he founded several bands.
# Beautiful Band Let's talk about this beautiful band and their amazing performances. They've had so many concerts, it's impressive!
# How was it founded and how did the idea come about that one can actually make a difference? How many of you are there in this group?
And God, initially, we mean before the band was formed
Rap arrived in Doha, meaning it started in 2005.
Every one of them loved the idea of rapping, they sang rap and uploaded it on the website.
I bring down Salman, so-and-so is brought down, and then there's competition.
We met some people.
We're now competing with each other.
Then, after a while, after all these years, we reached 2010.
In 2010, there was a group system, so this is a separate group, meaning three or four people together.
Let's just do it, we've already discussed it. Why not unite and make us all one group called Rappers' Crew?
Oh, he's lazy, like rubber.
We agreed on this, so it's final. We said we're all united as one, standing together as a team.
We were basically acting, pretending to be this thing, and conveying this very idea.
Approximately twenty-five people.
Twenty-five wow! Mashallah, that's a large group.
# Stage Performance Alright, does anyone play the guitar or... or... everyone sing rap songs.
He coordinates and he composes the melody.
You can say something personal.
# 25 is arranged in the set as excellent. How are the five and twenty arranged?
Everyone has to rely on their own abilities.
Every member of the band can write a complete song.
He can't manage without seeking help from anyone else.
Sleman might be more competent than me, for instance.
He hears it, he says no, adjust these words, change something.
Maybe each one can edit the other's work.
I need some help.
In order for there to be an official body that adopts these initiatives, or even a company that takes them on board.
There are distributors available.
The work should look like this, with a high-end style, and it should be something official, representing your brand.
We honestly wish for support, you know, we wish for some backing, for them to tell us, "We've got a company that's building, telling us, 'Come on, we're going to release, we're going to produce an album for you.'
We don't have any problem at all.
Some things are a bit difficult.
Why not consider this as your first initiative?
Even when one gets to know the first CD
This way you can attract partners later. What do you think?
In 2007, I made a CD.
I distributed it among the young men, God willing.
How was the turnout?
Oh God.
Text, text, 2007, maybe a little, the art of rap is not really popular in the Gulf.
I'm not that strong right now.
We were sitting and chatting, not going out on the street, you know, like you might hear about a large group of young people, for example, between Valencia and Chiasto.
Let's talk about it.
They told us they're organizing a party for us.
They covered all the costs and took care of all the procedures; it was well-coordinated and organized. Honestly, we didn't expect it to be this good.
We were blown away, honestly. It was amazing work.
It was just a bit of pressure, there were no ads, nothing, it was just the party.
There was nothing in the ads, nothing before the party two days prior.
We said, like, no one's gonna come, so we threw a party two days before the no one's gonna come announcement.
We're in, before the party even starts.
This means a point in our favor.
We're saying that our voices reach the families, not the youth.
We expect that this idea is only relevant to the youth.
We discovered at this stage that there is, there is more than one group listening to us.
There was a particular song that had a huge interaction with the audience and the band.
"Otherwise, most of the songs had great audience engagement."
I'm almost done with most of the songs, but since there were so many songs and we were a large group, it took some time.
The group, almost the entire group.
What are the words to treat different issues?
We're talking about the situation we're in, but this situation came about so fast.
I'll do my best, at least, even if it's a lot.
Even if they spoke before, it wasn't me.
# Random Camel Facts It seems that you have to get out the LLLL the LLLL the random camels.
If it means, it means; the rhyme will come out.
We think about it, write this, no, let's write this word instead, it's better.
Okay, we have a song like this. Let's check it out.
I'm one of the songs you've made.
We follow it and we also see the opinion of the public on this matter.
"Hopefully, they will also enjoy words like these."
Thank you for loving the introduction because it includes the name of my show.
# صباح الدوحة Good morning, this is KD and DJ Mister Bobo, live on the Doha Morning Show.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This KG Mr. Bobo with his kite one is hot to prey.
Don't forget, the show airs at 9:30 in the morning, so every one of you will be sitting in front of the TV.
We have with us in the numbers Hassan Naama. With us in the presentation is Shima Al-Hamadi.
We have Nasser Al-Maliki with us as the director. The guests of the episode are Rappers Qatar.
# Recipe: Traditional Arabic Dish This recipe is truly a gem, thanks to the Al family. You guys are the best! May you be blessed with good health.
I have to applaud you, guys, upstairs in the control room.
Last night, it was recorded.
Who wrote the lyrics among you?
Each one writes their own words.
I came to write some words for Yusuf.
He not only writes these words, but he has a love for singing, a love for emotion.
I expect you have to write about the World Cup 2022 and the Asian Cup. I think you can participate in both, right?
We're definitely gonna drop a song about this, for sure.
Be casual, not too formal or high-end.
I expect there should be Qatari songs, songs about the homeland and love for the homeland.
Through the art of rap, yes, the art of rap.
Yes, I expect that today everyone is waiting for it.
We are watching live on air right now.
The cup has arrived, of course, and adorned the streets of Doha.
If, our viewers, just like we saw Doha getting ready to welcome the Asian Cup.
We have completed all the necessary arrangements to be ready for reception.
The cup and Muntari are expected to definitely draw a larger crowd than we've seen.
I expect the corniche to be quite long from start to finish.
Certainly, they are all here to welcome this important sporting event.
In upcoming events, we will be covering them in the coming days, God willing.
We're getting a group together to organize a party for you.
So far, things are a bit complicated.
Procedures, and this is not definite.
I tried to say, for example, I saw Youssef and I saw so-and-so.
I saw several people I wanted, I have a topic for a song, and I saw the three of them.
I'm not sure about the song's rights.
We can sing it, if there's a chance.
I'm sitting at home.
Then send it to Yusuf via email on the internet.
Do you have, Yusuf, this part of the song?
They also travel abroad for work.
We entered this field and gained millions of fans.
We're not trying to copy, but you know, you hear the better ones.
He's a strong competitor, with a unique and powerful style.
Nothing stops me from taking their ideas and imitating them in certain things.
So, basically, I'll flip it, take the idea, twist it, and apply it to my song in a different way.
They formed a special team for them and now they have more than one CD in the group.
Abdullah Aldail is a remarkable individual with a captivating story.
He has experience and is able to detect groundwater.
They possess the ability to detect underground water sources.
One of the residents of the city of Merat.
There are many experienced people.
To locate water sources prior to drilling wells.
He might need to or he might dig many wells and there is no water.
Assisting with copper rods or pomegranate branches
The indicators that lead to the discovery of water sources.
What tools does he use?
The discoverer of groundwater.
This is old.
However, they are now replaced with copper rods.
We now place the two rods parallel to each other.
We walk now, a gentle pace, a light step.
We stop to watch when we pass by a water stream.
The bars will open.
Now now, we're passing like this now, we're passing by a stream.
Opened like this now.
When we exceed, the fun begins.
This is now in the middle of the stream.
I am halfway there.
We can now determine the width of the watercourse or the underground river with this method.
Of course, the process is repeated multiple times in various locations until we identify the strongest site.
Affirms Abu Ibrahim.
We have reached an advanced stage in this profession.
His discoveries were extremely precise.
In the area of Marrat, outside Marrat in Shaqra, in Ahd Rimal, and in Athithya.
More than one hundred and fifty wells have been discovered.
The error rate was five percent, not exceeding five percent.
You need training, experience, and a gift from God Almighty.
Outperforming modern devices and laboratories.
In a remarkably short time
`Abdulrahman Al-Murshed`
# صباح الدوحة # Doha Morning Show
Madinah Murabba is located in the northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
We followed up on this report and we promise you, God willing, more reports from other Arab and international countries.
Inshallah, I am from the Gulf region.
We have reached with you, our viewers, various headlines and titles, but they all have their significance.
# The Great and First Title A
If I expect there is a large group of Gulf youth in the Gulf itself.
There are certain people you look up to.
However, it doesn't mean that you should imitate them, but rather feel the need to keep up with their work from the very beginning.
They are the rappers of the Gulf, generally speaking, there is a connection between them.
f means not a competitor in competitions, it means I released a song.
I'm talking about the subject.
That means it's a competition, just as you say, purposeful.
There's a connection between us, you know, but it's with a specific person.
In Saudi Arabia, Qusai is like that, masha'Allah, he's creating an atmosphere.
He became bigger, got his own CD, and gained a following.
He now has several companies that could adopt him.
You wish to reach this stage, nay, perhaps surpass it even further, God willing.
Insha'Allah, we wish you all the best, God willing, through this team.
Certainly, we are present and ready to welcome this important sports trophy, the Asian Cup. Let's take a look at the footage available from the corniche.
In addition to a group of young Qataris,
She moves, but from the West with a Gulf style.
# Music for Every Mood Emotional songs, rap music, and a unique band of twenty-five individuals.
It is essential to keep up with your news first and foremost.
I assume you must have an email, a specific website on the internet, or a forum.
How can one reach you?
God, some time ago we had our own website.
There were some minor issues with the hosting company.
He would sometimes scream and sometimes I don't know what.
F means we faced some issues with it, and in the end, we just closed it down.
We're done, there's no other way, the site is closed, it's closed.
Okay, so what's the alternative for now until they solve this problem because as a team
I'm in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, or even Morocco or Egypt.
One has to communicate with you, find out about your news, and listen to the songs you produce from time to time.
What is the alternative now?
The alternative currently relies on private pages, for example.
What exactly is it called?
He's not here, George. What are you doing in Google?
Bassem Rap Qatar or Qatar Rappers
Do you make video clips by yourself?
We worked on the program yesterday.
We uploaded more than one video to YouTube.
Song and I film.
Song and the same shape in video form but I film behind each other.
I expect that we should see more progress and development from you.
You'll need a place that can accommodate everyone, and each person should have their own device at home.
The nut, the computer, the piano, and the guitar.
I really hope we get some support.
A company, for instance.
We produce CDs for you.
We'll create a special place for you.
I am one of us.
In the end, it remains our personal business.
We don't want it to be a personal job.
By God, my words do not differ from Yusuf's.
Video clip, we definitely need a video clip.
The album is out.
The power of spreading B's video clip, I think, is very important.
The message gets across better.
If there's support, everything else comes with it.
Your sweet voices reach every corner.
One of the different arts that address problems and tackle issues is considered.
Thank you to Yusuf Al-Na'imi and Salman Al-Abdallah for joining us.
Let's see it and we wish them all the best, of course, in the name of our program Good Luck for Youth.
These projects were indeed a success.
The project is also almost ready, but it needs some technical development.
Expiration date Price
You reach the cashier, you have the total, you have all the details, and you're ready.
"Recognizing products instead of holding each part and checking the ingredients and their effects."
He was walking in the trolleybus.
I assume you want to translate the following text: > ايكون امركب نفسه فالواحد يقدر يختيار الماده اللي هو يبغيها بدقة Here is the best possible translation: > It would be great if one could choose the material they want with precision.
Of course, most of the projects were a reflection of the child's sense of a problem.
He also has diverse activities and goals.
The center now means a collection of programs I design and events that revolve around a central idea.
We have ten objectives set by Her Highness Sheikha Moza when establishing the center.
Maybe, maybe not.
He goes straight down, moves underground, and takes the subway from his house.
# Main Idea It's just about the clothes.
Show me all the stores in Qatar that have a black T-shirt.
I also have the house key and the car key; I press a button.
If I fart, I'll lose it, it'll take me to the key guy.
Yes, let's go back to the projects that you will be carrying out, God willing, through the cultural center.
Early childhood education is flimsy.
Develop his skills and nurture the talented.
We navigate between a set of skills for children, be it media-related or research-based.
If the LL personal skills in speaking to the audience are convincing the audience.
We design a special program for all these diverse skills to serve them.
We started with the pioneers of the future, and we've achieved great success. Now, we've reached the final projects and the end of our journey.
We have also reached a large number of young child speakers.
Creativity and innovation.
You also have such young broadcasters.
He returned to television, and it's essential that they offer children's programs.
We're sitting here, we're counting for the TV.
Through their television, Qatar TV.
Let's finish them off right now, meaning we'll be done with them by the age of eighteen.
Welcome them wherever they are. Yes.
This also means the national television.
We need to attract, acquire, and discover these talents and develop them.
I am a declarative to a research-oriented.
# Heading ## Subheading ### Sub-subheading #### Sub-sub-subheading To specific issues regarding F's thinking.
To read about diverse fields.
You collaborate so much that you take each other's ideas.
A promising preacher program with the Ministry of Awqaf in every field.
Our exhibition is also exposed to the generations.
The Scientific Club played a significant role in developing projects and also provided technical support for these initiatives.
The largest role is also for the Supreme Council of Education and their support for schools and their partnership.
Professor Abdullah, your transition to Katara, this grand edifice.
The place also offers a great collection of wonderful events and activities.
Is it considered a push forward for the center forward to the same center position?
You take the structure of such a building separately.
Far from this grand edifice.
Gave us an interface to interact with the public more easily, basically.
Pioneering and good projects.
In many cases, receiving guests and introducing them to the nature of the cultural programs offered to children.
We have been working on our main project for the past three years.
The national project for the development of reading among children.
Under the patronage of Sheikha Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
She adopted this project and provided it with immense support.
This is a major project, which is about developing children's reading and writing skills, and enhancing their storytelling abilities.
# The Diverse Cultural Aspects Associated with Reading in Particular
There are, of course, many programs.
We recently moved.
We are now starting to rearrange some activities.
Katar is designed and developed to cater to the nature of its visitors.
We definitely wish you all the best, God willing, through this center.
The text contains ideas that are extremely important.
Of course, first of all, we'd like to thank you for this generous hospitality.
# What Matters Most is Honesty The more we interact with children, the more we realize that our children are just like them.
Children of today are not like the children of yesterday; their childhood is different from ours.
They need us to give more attention, focus, and time.
Give him enough listening to his interest and his imagination.
I connect with him intellectually.
They work, their way of dealing with their children is like a hotel, providing them with accommodation.
She is a bank that provides him with money.
He lacks someone to listen to these ideas, to listen to this imagination.
We've already moved, they transferred us now during the past few days at the exhibition, they moved us to twenty, thirty.
Through this exhibition.
We wish good luck, God willing, to the projects that won awards.
Thank you for joining us, Professor Abdullah Al-Jumaily, Director of the Cultural Center for Childhood. We wish you all the best, God willing.
These projects will actually come to fruition and exist in reality, not just remain a dream forever.
Welcome, dear viewers. On Monday evening, two days ago, the Childhood Cultural Center concluded its activities at the Diplomatic Club.
National Exhibition Events for the Dreams of Generations Under the Motto: Dreams of Generations, Facts of the Nation of Tomorrow
The event organized to celebrate the country's National Day, with the participation of over seventy children from Qatar.
Our viewers witnessed a variety of events and competitions.
Innovative projects for children.
# Interview Introduction In general, we are pleased to host on your behalf, our viewers, Professor Abdullah Al-Jumaily, the director of the Cultural Center for Childhood. Welcome and good morning.
Good morning, welcome, my dear sister.
# Introduction First of all, I would like to thank you for allocating time for our center.
It's truly a pleasure to talk about this unique exhibition.
We are also delighted to have your presence through the program so that we can cover, as much as possible, all the events that took place during this exhibition.
This national exhibition of the dreams of generations.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Of course, this is the exhibition.
Contribution of the Cultural Center for Childhood.
National Day celebrations
He had a very natural approach, and his touch was incredibly important to every child.
Empowering children with a purpose.
I live with a dream.
And with the project
This project or dream.
In children's dreams, horizons are vast.
Her scope is wide, we've defined it within a twenty to thirty-centimeter frame.
# Qatar National Vision 2030 And other key areas of the vision.
We started training the children in four stages.
# Creative Thinking Techniques and Tools to Broaden a Child's Thinking Horizons ## Brainstorming Mechanisms and a Set of Tools for Expanding a Child's Thought Process
What do you mean by this sentence exactly?
Facts are the homeland of tomorrow.
In other words, what our children dream of today.
This project grows with this project.
The children start living from this day onwards, which is the true interpretation of this vision.
I have a big dream.
If it's an environmental field or, for example, in the field of health and human development, and other such fields.
The one that serves the homeland.
I expect that when we know there are children in a certain place
She is at a certain exhibition.
Was all this here all along?
The exhibition had guests of honor for the opening.
Guests of honor are the elders so that children can learn from them as role models.
Yesterday's Arab fall, two or three weeks ago.
He was also among the winners of various awards in the Arab world.
There was a schedule for presenting their projects.
Yes, and the pictures are definitely proof of what you're saying, Professor Abdullah.
This is a collection of photos that were present at the exhibition and various events.
This is also the owner of the last project, the owner of the forest.
The innovative or creative.
This is one of the children's innovations, Mashallah. It's a very beautiful idea that we can adapt for the viewers.
Let's talk about it a little. What exactly is this topic about the colorful ball?
Almost four or five projects came up that talked about this topic, one of which was the colored ball.
He also calls it the smart stadium.
If this ball goes out of bounds, it's out of play.
Her color changes.
We're back, so I expect to see more of this in future matches, God willing.
Well, what's next after these dreams, then?
It also pertains to his needs, which are relevant to his interests.
I expect that, especially when there are officials, they will take into account these small projects from small minds.
However, we don't know if these projects might actually serve us. Well, the president of the football association is here in Qatar.
My opinion, her opinion, thinking about the idea of the colorful ball.
Do you like the idea?
He was very excited and of course paid for the visit. He inspected the projects that were allocated for the ball.
Halt the road These projects are adopted at that very moment
# Grand Exhibition at the Moment These projects are being developed and will be presented at the exhibition.
The audience also voted for a large group of projects presented by our children.
# Our dear friends, What projects can we talk about? There were several highlights and we received a lot of votes.
Of course, we have an evaluation method, there is an evaluation committee that has a primary evaluation method.
These projects are the ones that won the awards; the first, second, and third projects.
He came from the forest and won the first prize.
He had very precise details for the project, and the project was ready to begin.
I need many administrative aspects, of course, besides the administrative side.
I delved into many very minute details, and the visitors' brochure was also distributed, as if it were ready for her project.
These are definitely the pictures we are seeing.
This is a collection. Yes, this is also a collection. Many projects I have participated in.
They might feel like that, you know, they have this sense that they're watching movies or cartoons.
She actually got married, some of her dreams might come true, institutions have adopted them.
For example, we give project names. What are these projects?
This appendage, how can it be utilized at home? How is it managed, collected, and recycled?
47 students died.
Qatar University celebrated the graduation of two hundred and forty-seven students from the thirty-third batch yesterday.
His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al-Attiyah, Minister of State for International Cooperation.
A large number of parents and faculty members.
The university celebrates today the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen students.
Of course, we thank our colleague Salman Al-Mujaddid, and we will continue in the same artistic atmosphere. Today, we will have a dear guest with us.
I belong to the serial classifications of artist Abdulhamid Al-Sharshani.
He confirmed his presence through numerous works, including the series "Hearts for Rent."
They struggled to establish themselves in the art scene.
Especially in the art world, there is no room for flattery.
This implies
Ahlan wa sahlan feej, and a good morning to you all. I'd like to greet the viewers.
The program is actually more fun with this guest, to be honest.
I'll show you a small glimpse of your work, and we'll start the conversation with you.
You're laughing at me.
Bring the fake bisht and fetch the original one.
Soul, bring it.
The Pashtun is present.
What's wrong with the dishdasha? Return it. How do I return it?
Hell, I fucked him up, ground him up in her belly, fuck his father.
I am a member of a committee consisting of five members.
The Supreme Committee of the Conference
I am not agreeing to that.
I don't have any objections.
If this is a quick clip, a simple paragraph from the series Tasaneef, we'll be watching the second part.
Do you mind telling us about your participation this year in Part II?
# Episode Overview: A Variety of Topics "Let's talk a bit about your roles in the series 'Tasaneef'. Each episode has a unique theme."
What is your contribution that you want to tell us about?
Sure, after what.
It has been ages since those days.
Merat is also famous for its mountain.
The beloved, oft-sung by poets through the ages.
When history is a witness and remains in the memory of cities.
Her past is a testament to her rich heritage.
The city is located one hundred and seventy kilometers north of the capital, Riyadh.
His lineage was attributed to Imru' al-Qays of the Tamim tribe.
Bath is renowned for its historical landmarks, the sweetness of its water, and the pleasantness of its air.
# The Mountain's Fame and the Captivated Poets Singers sang of her, poets were captivated by her, and her fame was intertwined with that of her renowned mountain, Kumit.
It is said, Ghadeer is like a comet.
Of course, the city of Marrat is an ancient striking city.
Preceded the advent of Islam.
There were ancient artifacts of unknown origin, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
We are currently in this state of grace.
Khaled Ibn Al-Waleed, may God be pleased with him, the noble companion, ordered to dig this well when passing by during the Ridda Wars.
I have remained until this day.
"If you can guarantee me a full stomach, I'll guarantee you a long life."
If you see a crowd, you see many times.
Of course, among the other monuments is Ghadir-e-Kimite.
He is the one who has quenched thirst for many years.
The amount that was sufficient for the city for an entire year.
From the beginning of the rain until the next rainy season.
Also, this artifact is ongoing and its creation date is unknown.
There is also the bride and there is
Jabal Kamit is one of the landmarks of the city of Marrat.
This mountain has inspired many proverbs, poems, and songs.
People come to him from all corners of the kingdom.
One of her most notable works is Al-Waleedi Well.
He descended upon Murād during the days of the Ridda Wars, heading towards al-Yamāmah.
He camped there and ordered his men to dig this well.
The water of which is still being sought for drinking and for performing ablutions to this day.
Khālid passed through Marāt, as mentioned by Yāqūt al-Ḥamawī in his Muʿjam al-Buldān.
It is an old mud house that has been restored to its original state.
The building features various sections that showcase the architectural character of the region and its renowned heritage and artifacts.
He, of whom the poet said: "When we reached the water of Majannah."
Ghadir Kamit, not Ghadir al-Anajil
Professor Ayman, there is also, God willing, a great collaboration between the family, the guardian, and the child's mother with this center, and also with the child.
I expect there are different ways he can stay up to date with you.
# Managing the Training Process in General
From the moment the trainee, student, or child arrives, it's ever-lasting.
This file will contain your complete personal information.
Even his grades, every month, are foggy, monthly fog, you know.
We live in a miserable apartment in the Agol neighborhood.
Every four lectures, there will be a surprise quiz.
A parent can access [the system] using a username and password.
We give it to him so he can access it.
Yes, he can see the extent of his progress, from the beginning of his enrollment to this center until today.
Yes, we have several different models, we'll follow them up.
We have a little girl.
With Professor Ibrahim, it will definitely be an honor to meet him shortly.
We'll be seeing various different models; I wish we had more space.
We brought a sample for the little girl.
We will conduct multiple tests live on air.
We ask her questions about math and different questions.
We'll take a short break and we'll be back with you. Then we'll see this smart child. Stay with us.
The audience is smarter now, artists.
Any action taken by the first two or three people who saw the work was just a remote control test.
He won't tire himself out; he has twenty thousand other series to watch.
Absolutely twenty thousand series, these are correct.
# Series of the year means some people are like that, they should focus on one task at a time.
He can see the other projects.
I'm sorry, but I'm unable to translate the provided text into English as it appears to be incomplete or contain characters that are not part of the Arabic script. Please provide the full and correct text you would like translated, and I'll be happy to assist you.
I only watch TV during Ramadan.
Of course, we welcome your presence among us as our honored and dear guest, Abdulaziz Al-Sharshani.
Do you want to say anything to your audience, to your fans? Of course, those who love you. I am definitely one of your fans.
I direct a word to you.
I wish you all the best every year.
We don't go out much, we don't go out too often, we don't represent too much, of course, I mentioned the reasons.
The best is yet to come.
Inshallah, we wish you success in your endeavors this year.
God willing, we will have another meeting to discuss these plays.
Everything is interconnected.
Fashion shows are gaining popularity and are eagerly awaited by fans of new designs.
Welcome, our dear viewers, to Sabah Al-Doha. We are with you live.
Today, we are definitely talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of students, both male and female, who have enrolled in this center.
This center offers a wide range of diverse sciences.
They definitely focus on developing diverse abilities.
They will also activate their minds one hundred percent, God willing.
Professor Naseem, of course, and Professor Ayman Khoujaly, who is the executive director of the Skills Development Center.
Hello and good morning.
May God bless you.
We have with us the beautiful Amnia. Good morning, Amnia.
Good morning.
How old are you, my love?
Seven Qara'id seven.
Māshā'allāh, we wish you all the best.
What services do you offer for our children?
We clarified with Professor Ayman and Professor Nesma, and it was specifically designed as a program to benefit our children.
# Mental Math Program for the Mind
By using fingerlings and by using Abacus.
To achieve some specific goals, we tried to make a simple part of it clear.
I felt it, Professor Ibrahim, I felt it. There is a noticeable difference when a student first enters, especially during the first two days.
And then, after he completes a few months with you, maybe three or four months,
He would have studied in public, private, or even independent schools.
Initially, the program is scientifically moving in certain ways.
After completing the first level of the program
He who demonstrates where the child's lost abilities are or needs development to reach them.
He has reached a certain limit, or what developments have occurred with the child?
We are moving forward with a scientific approach and a scientific program.
Some methods or mechanisms are applied in a conventional manner.
No, scientifically, systematically.
Before the start of the program and after taking this course or the levels he went through.
Professor Ibrahim is now with us, as you can see, our viewers. Amna, one of the students who joined this center, is here.
We wanted this to happen live today to show you, our viewers, the importance of this matter.
I can return the bisht, I don't mind.
If this is a quick clip, a simple paragraph from the series Tasaneef, which we'll be watching the second part of.
However, since we've seen this clip from the first season of the series "Tasaneef".
# Episode Overview: A Variety of Topics "Let's talk a bit about your roles in the series 'Tasaneef'. Each episode has a unique theme."
This year, focus on him, he's the one who's gone.
Ghafel Fazel
She kept urging while sitting and offering chances.
# 10 Chapters, Classified by Topic #
Of course, there's a ringmaster in it, there's an old man with a ring, there's a baker with a ring.
This means diverse languages.
Professor Ghanim Al-Sulaiti from Qatar.
We have artists from Qatar.
Wide range of artists don't follow me now of course we have artists from Bahrain, such as Zahra Arafat and Ibtesam Abdullah.
We have it.
Faisal Rashid and Muhammad Adel
Sure, Tara.
If it weren't for Tara, the young ones wouldn't have acted.
# **Translation:** Few projects have we done in Qatar this year; you have only two projects.
Qatar TV also produces dramatic works. We can say that too.
Al-Ghaṭar TV is a one-stop shop.
Qatar TV didn't fall short, of course, but they only produce one show a year, and all the actors in Qatar want to work.
That was the reason.
I heard about you that you're in one series and all the artists in Qatar want to work on it.
Even if one experiences a traumatic event, they should say, "Alhamdulillah."
Praise be to God in all circumstances.
Okay, so let's go back to the beginning of your journey.
I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to him, of course.
Consult him about various things.
Of course, the artist Abdulaziz Jasem from *Hukm Al Bashar* to *Yawm Akhar* to *Ba'd Al Shatat* to *Na'am Wa Laa*.
In his plays, we started working with him as a theater and TV production. When Abdulaziz Jasim produced his first executive producer, we worked with him as a theater and TV crew.
He is the one who raised us, he is the one who taught us, and he is the one who made us.
Of course, after Yuva, Professor Ghanem didn't hold back with us in Fayez Al-Tosh 2000.
The truth has given us opportunities as youth.
They have thirty to thirty-two jobs a year.
We have two projects a year, so thank you, thank you, Tara.
A murderous feeling, of course, the same thing from Tara Art Production.
Creator of the series: Professor Munir Al-Z
We're back, our dear viewers, and today we're talking about reflexology.
Massage by the palm of the hand
This treatment has actually been practiced since ancient times.
We brought a guest with us.
Procedure for testing:
# **Abdominal Pain and Bloating**
You feel a sensation in your hand, sometimes like sand, like fragmented veins within your hand.
Let go of your hand.
Of course, my friend, he's a bit tense.
I feel a bit stressed out.
Left side
Of course, my dear viewers, I'm now examining the left side of his body.
So they are in the loop.
# Health Issues Any health problem, now we know about the headaches and the dizziness he experiences.
Heh, there's pain here.
Pain means problem.
What exactly is this problem here?
The text you provided is already in English. It seems you might have wanted to translate from Arabic. If so, the translation is: The ear cavities.
Are you having sinus surgery or a problem with your sinuses?
I had surgery, but it was a while ago.
What's up, bro?
He gains weight without eating.
Good left shoulder.
This is nerve-wracking when you tell him to be careful.
Ten years ago, I walked barefoot on the beach.
# **English Translation:** Well, we know that when one walks by the sea, they expect to feel refreshed.
Uneven terrain is not just the sea.
Negative energies can be harmful.
He might also be amazed that you discovered these things through massage.
Absolutely, children are the most important people.
Children, glory be to God, listen to your mother.
Tired him out with milk and food that he uses.
She met her child, and he put her in a wheelchair. The child is automatic.
**Thank you.**
A slight pressure, glory be to God.
You'll notice the child is happy after a few seconds. First, he feels a little pain here, but then he relaxes.
Then, suddenly, Subhanallah, you see the gases rise.
What discoveries have you made, Professor Abdulaziz?
I have less problems now, just joints, bones, headaches, thyroid issues, and obesity.
Second, regarding menstrual pain, period pain, or pain during menstruation in general,
Focus on a rock or a stone, or just press here and give commands, glory be to God, for lower back pain and menstrual problems.
In a matter of seconds, God willing, it will disappear.
Pregnant woman
She has an easy delivery.
However, it's either here or there, of course, or God knows.
If, if you let her know that, by Allah, there's a chance you could give birth in the seventh month or in the ninth.
I walk on sand.
You can walk on sand, no problem, but not on rocks.
Eat seven fresh dates. Fresh dates are better.
If a date palm is ripe, it's enough, God willing.
As He, the Almighty, has said, I seek refuge in God from the outcast Satan, and this is my discovery from the Quran, of course.
God couldn't make this fresh date come to her, could he?
"Oh God, all praise is for You, and I seek refuge in God from the word 'I'."
She throws rocks, she throws small balls.
The bed of birth is flimsy, I forgot, for example, she came to the bed of birth and grabbed the iron bar.
In private hospitals, you'll often see a Southeast Asian woman.
Now, hopefully, this is actually a common practice in East Asia.
My phone is with you, no need to worry.
Mobile only
# Collaborating with Each Other Working together means that each one of us should offer advice to every being who is listening right now.
Be mindful of giving charity, and be mindful of caring for others. You were created to worship God, and then...
To serve people, that's the first thing. Secondly, I am not a religious leader or a sheikh, I am an ordinary human being.
Hello Professor Abdulaziz, I appreciate this wonderful opportunity to meet you. Thank you, of course, to our guest who is with us today.
May you be blessed with a thousand good health. Amen, and good luck, God willing.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of the Department of Public Health at the Supreme Council of Health, will provide us with a detailed account.
Good morning, Sheikh.
Let's dive right in and take a look at these events.
The truth is a healthy steps program towards Qatar.
He is a program that is one of the parts of the national strategy to address obesity.
Four out of the top ten most obese countries in the world are from the Gulf region.
We have initiated a strategy at the Supreme Council of Health, of course in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and other entities, to combat obesity.
Fearful of their further spread, soon, very soon.
# Healthy Steps Towards a Better Qatar One of the programs to combat obesity is Healthy Steps Towards Qatar.
They make this competition international.
Of course, the program is six weeks long.
Every week is different from the next.
To raise awareness among seventh and eighth-grade students about the importance of health at this age.
They become self-aware at an early age.
In the first week, as you recall, it was about your favorite fruit.
Week two: walking.
You have to walk, of course, the more you walk, the more points you get.
# Qatar's Map of Progress It's a map of Qatar where, as one accumulates points, their school takes steps forward, and their class advances as well.
There is a healthy competition among the students.
In the third week, he drinks carbonated water, not plain water.
I get used to drinking my own water; there's no need for so many fizzy drinks. Every time you get thirsty, you take a fizzy drink. I don't drink water.
# Week 4 Your favorite sport
Some don't like the games they have at school.
We're looking for a sports game he'd enjoy.
Let's force him to exercise.
The boy is eating a healthy meal.
His family knows they need to pay attention to their son and make sure he eats a healthy meal.
Al Jazira Academy is a co-educational school for boys and girls to attend.
Of course, this is a successful sample, God willing, we will expand the experiment in the coming years.
Of course, the students are happy; I don't know how they feel, saying our activity is more.
Solna, we played more games and enjoyed ourselves more with our colleagues.
Girls say their skin has improved, acne has reduced.
Absolutely right, it becomes conscious.
Parents know their children.
We and our colleagues from the second grade ask, "How are you?" and learn from them and their colleagues and brothers.
Alhamdulillah, the news is spreading that there are many schools eager to participate next year, and they are already expressing their interest now.
Insha'Allah.
Of course, the main sponsor was Qtel in supporting this.
We had an Aspire Zone that organized sports competitions and raised awareness among students.
Oh oh oh, on the dining table means.
Alhamdulillah, it has many aspects, I mean, like, I mentioned some, and there are probably others that I missed.
Alhamdulillah, everyone contributed a part of their own.
Some of the brothers used to hold competitions on Saturdays.
There was a variety of it.
We tried to create several types and include as many people as possible.
He is the generation of the future, you know.
Let's spread this experience as widely as possible in Qatar.
You're staying for the first time, so there are a few things you need to adjust.
"Now, after its spread, praise be to God, it is prevalent and the results are satisfactory."
Insha'Allah, we are publishing it because there are people now demanding and saying, "Why weren't we included?"
You eat healthy food, you'll get there. You don't have a problem.
He who starts early in life will achieve what he desires by the time he is twenty or twenty-five years old.
You mentioned a collection of titles every week, with each week having a title.
If we return, we'll try to make our segment today about the conclusion of the events.
We also had the opportunity to bring our guests close to the people, as in our program, we had more than one guest.
We keep repeating and coming back every week, what were the key pieces of information that we wanted to convey to the students?
Insha'Allah my sister, first of all, for example, in the first week, the favorite fruit.
Of course, each fruit serving has its own benefits.
What is the benefit of fruits rich in vitamin C?
He himself starts to realize what fruits he actually likes; not all fruits are his enemies, you know.
He can be allergic to one or two types, but why not the rest?
Week two: walking. People think it's just for lazy kids. Why walk?
I'll walk when I grow up.
You walk the opposite way because it calms the mind and the brain.
Walking provides mental relaxation and clarity, improving one's state of mind.
You were taking them to the students to walk.
They are all required to walk, whether it's at school or at home.
They score their points through page schools.
He doesn't mean every day, it's not daily.
This event had a march, the girls' school marched.
We want them to be like that, to be creative, to have innovative ideas.
# Competitive spirit and teachers coming up with new ideas. We don't want to give them ideas, they won't stick to them.
Every individual had their own unique skills and expertise in this particular aspect.
Of course, during the third week, drink water. Naturally, we try to drink water all the time so we don't get thirsty and crave fizzy drinks.
Of course, your favorite sport in the fourth week.
We can try to find out what his favorite sport is and support him in that.
He is passionate about sports.
They love sports so much that they play them without even realizing it.
Since we previously discussed that we would talk about the Qatari Association for Neuropathy Patients.
Let me welcome our guest for today, who has brought light to our studio.
Welcome!
Welcome to this program, it's great to have you here.
This disease, perhaps many of us have never heard of it.
Straight away, as the Egyptians say, I'll dive right into the topic.
Is it a chronic disease?
The nervous system in the human body is affected.
The interval affects those aged 20 to 40.
This disease also has no known cure as of yet, and the cause remains unknown.
# Active Lifestyle, Youth Affected It affects the active segment of society, which is usually the youth.
Treatments used for cancer patients, may you be spared from it and all other illnesses.
This disease is an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord nerves.
The central nervous system is the central nervous system in the human body.
The body prefers that there is a body nearby touching the body.
The neuron is a
You cover the electric wire here.
White blood cells, the first line of defense, kill or dissolve the insulating layer.
The failure to transmit the neural signal, or its weakening or disruption.
# Warning: Explicit Content *This content may be disturbing to some readers.* *Proceed with caution.* It leads to paralysis. May it never happen to you.
So far, despite the advancements in medicine and the progress in medical science, Professor Abdulaziz, we still haven't found a cure for this disease.
Okay, besides the solution, we want to get to know each other. How does that work, exactly?
You also need to be proactive about this matter.
The direct cause, the nature of life, the nature of food, circulations of life.
What exactly is the direct cause that can lead a person to develop this disease?
Everything that exists currently is just theories.
Even by marriage.
They try to solve the health problems that humans encounter.
Yes, yes.
All these topics might be somewhat controversial within the community.
We still don't know its causes.
Good, the age group that can be affected by this disease, of course, is multiple sclerosis.
I am male/female.
Of course, the disease starts to calm down with the person after reaching forty years of age.
We haven't found a cure for this disease yet.
Does this mean there is evidence of a large number of people, whether in the Gulf, the Arab world, or even specifically in Qatar?
In Saudi Arabia, statistics show they have twenty-five thousand infected.
And Qatar, too, means business.
I personally know of three to four very recent, well-diagnosed cases in the past week alone.
We currently have one hundred and twenty-five injured; this is what is recorded in the files.
There are many people who, when diagnosed with this disease, seek treatments from other countries, for example...
Okay, Professor Abdulaziz, does that mean there are some effects that, for example, a person who is afflicted with this disease might experience?
Are there any signs that indicate to the people around me or to me personally that I am suffering from multiple sclerosis?
This virus seemed to be an example of eradicating
Let's be honest, it's not a virus.
The nerves are the controllers of the entire body.
Let's head over there and give a specific reason for that particular place; it's the nature of the food and the nature of the atmosphere.
