# The Genealogy of Jesus Christ From Abraham to David there were fourteen generations; and from David until the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ, fourteen generations. The genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Here is the translation: This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: When Mary was betrothed to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit. Luke
Joseph, her fiancé, was a pious man who didn't want to disgrace her, so he decided to secretly break up with her.
In a dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
"She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins." Luke
All this happened so that the word of the Lord spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled:
"The estate will bear fruit, a son will be born, and he shall be named Immanuel," which means "God is with us."
When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took Mary as his wife.
And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb. Luke 2:21
Chapter two: the star scientists came to see Jesus.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in the land of Judea, in the days of King Herod. And behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem,
Kessoulou: "Where is the King of the Jews who was born? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him."
King Herod was troubled when he heard this, as were all the people of Jerusalem.
The leaders, heads of state, religious leaders, and all the scholars of the law gathered, and they asked, "Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews?"
And they answered him: "Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:
And you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times.
And Herod sent them to the chief priests and scribes, inquiring of them where the Christ was to be born.
After sending them to Bethlehem, he said to them, "Go and search carefully for the child. And when you find him, come and tell me so that I, too, may go and worship him."
And when they heard the king's words, they departed. And behold, the star which they had seen in the East appeared again, and it went before them until it came and stood over the place where the child was.
They saw the star and were very happy.
As they entered the house, they saw the child with Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. They opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
When they had been warned by God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed for their own country by another way. Now after they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise and take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him." So Joseph arose and took the young Child and His mother while it was still night, and departed for Egypt. And he was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called My Son."
Arise, take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and remain there until I bring you word; for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.
Joseph got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt.
And when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life. And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: and he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene. Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.
When Herod saw that he had been deceived by the wise men, he became exceedingly angry, and sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men.
Thus shall the word of the Lord be accomplished, which he spake concerning Jeremiah, saying:
"From Ramah is heard wailing, Loud lamentation, the voice of grief, Rachel weeping for her children And she will not be comforted, Because they are no more." Jesus' family returned from Egypt.
When Herod was about to die, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream while he was in Egypt,
He said to him, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and return to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking to kill the child are dead."
And Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and returned to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he went away to the districts of Galilee.
He went to a city called Nazareth and lived there, so that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled: "He shall be called a Nazarene." Mark 1:24; Luke 2:39; John 1:45
Chapter three John the Baptist prepares the way for Jesus
John the Baptist came to the wilderness of Judea, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.
This is the man spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said: "A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.'
John's clothing was made of camel's hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. He survived on a diet of locusts and wild honey.
People used to come to him from Jerusalem, all the region of Judea, and from all the localities around the Jordan River.
They were baptized in the Jordan River by his hand, confessing their sins.
"When John saw that many Pharisees and Sadducees were coming to be baptized, he said to them, 'You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?'"
Eva, I accept your repentance through your good deeds.
And don't you start saying to yourselves: "We are the children of Abraham." I tell you, God is able to raise children for Abraham from these stones. John
Now the axe is placed at the root of the tree, and every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. When
I will baptize you with water for repentance, but the one who is coming after me is more powerful than I. I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
"He is storing the wheat and will study it, and he will gather the wheat into his barns, but the straw, he will burn it with a fire that will never go out." John baptized Jesus.
And Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
John said to him, "I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?"
Jesus answered him, "Let it be so now, for it is proper for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed him.
Jesus, unawares, came up from the water, and the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.
"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Matthew 12:18; 17:5; Mark 1:11; Luke 9:35.
Chapter 4: Satan Tempts Jesus
And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness, where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. Luke 4:1-2
He fasted for forty days and forty nights, and then hunger came upon him.
# Temptation in the Wilderness And the devil came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread."
# Jesus Replies: "It is written in the book of God: 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'"
And then, Satan took him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
He said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, and on their hands they will lift you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'
"It is also written in the scriptures: 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
# The Temptation of Christ And after Satan had taken him to an extremely high mountain, he showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said to her, "I will give you all this if you bow down to me and worship me."
Jesus replied to him, "Away with you, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.'"
# The Gospel of Jesus Christ After that, Satan left him, and angels came to minister to him. Jesus preached in Galilee.
When Jesus heard that John the Baptist had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee. Matthew
# Matthew 4:13-14 And leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali, so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:
Thus says the prophet Isaiah:
# The Land of Zebulun and Naphtali "O land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, on the road by the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations, the people who sit in darkness have seen a great light, on those dwelling in a land of deep darkness a light has arisen."
The people who dwell in darkness have seen a great light, and for those who live in the land of the shadow of death, a light has dawned.
"From that time on Jesus began to preach, and to say, 'Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Matthew 3:2 Jesus chose the first disciples."
Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee when he saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
They left their window and followed him at that hour.
And then, as he went on, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John, in a boat with their father, mending their nets. And he called them.
They left the boat and their fathers and followed Jesus. Jesus was teaching and healing.
# The Gospel of Matthew And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people. Matthew
# The Healing of the Sick in Syria And he departed, and began to publish it in the Decapolis. And they begged him not to leave them, but he said, "I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also, for I was sent for this purpose." And he was preaching in the synagogues of the Jews. Now a man was there whose hand was withered. And they *asked* him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"—so that they might accuse him. He said to them, "Which one of you who has a sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out? Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath." Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And the man stretched it out, and it was restored, healthy like the other.
Many crowds followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and across the Jordan River.
Chapter Five The Sermon on the Mount
When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on the mountain. And after he sat down, his disciples came to him.
He began to teach them and said:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who weep, for God will comfort them.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
Those who show mercy, God will have mercy upon them.
Those with pure hearts are fortunate, for they shall see God.
Blessed are those who help others find happiness, for they shall be called children of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 1 Peter 3:14
"Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. 1 Peter 4:14"
Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for thus they persecuted the prophets who were before you. Acts 7:52, The Book of the Earth and the Light of the World.
You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34-35
We are the light of the world, a city on a mountain cannot be hidden. John
There is no one who lights a lamp and puts it under a bowl or a bed, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. Mark
Let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.
I came not to take away the law of Moses or the books of the prophets; I came not to abolish them, but to fulfill them.
# The Word of God We tell you the truth: heaven and earth may disappear, but not a single word or dot of the law will disappear until everything is accomplished. Luke
He who does not follow any of these small commandments and teaches people to do the same, will be the least in the kingdom of heaven. And he who follows them and teaches them to others, will be great in the kingdom of heaven.
I obey you: unless your obedience is greater than that of the scholars of the law and the Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
# The First Commandment You have certainly heard the first commandment: Do not kill; whoever kills must be brought to justice.
But I say to you, every one who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment; and whoever shall say to his brother, 'Raca,' shall be in danger of the council; and whoever shall say, 'You fool,' shall be in danger of hell fire.
If not, you brought your gift and placed it on the altar, and you started thinking that you were right about your brother.
Leave your gift in front of the altar and go to make peace with your brother first, then come back and give your gift.
Make amends with the one you're quarreling with, none of you will be left on the path to the courthouse, before he takes you to the judge, and the judge puts you in the hands of the police, and the police take you to jail.
I tell you the truth: you won't get out of here until you pay the last real you owe. Corruption.
Don't you know the saying: "Don't spoil it."
But I tell you this: whoever looks at a woman to desire her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If not, your right eye will be the cause of your downfall, remove it and cast it upon yourself, because it is better to lose a part of yourself than to risk losing your entire self and be cast into Hell. When?
"If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell." Matthew 18:8; Mark 9:43 Divorce.
He said again: "Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce." When?
But I tell you, anyone who divorces his wife for any reason except sexual immorality and marries another woman commits adultery. And if a woman divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery." Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11-12; Luke 16:18; 1 Corinthians 7:10-11.
# **English Translation:** "And you've heard it again from your ancestors: 'If you swear you won't get married, but keep your oath to the Lord.'
I say to you: Never swear, not by heaven, for it is the throne of God, Jacob.
I am not a place where your feet are, nor in Jerusalem, the city of the great king.
And don't swear by your head either, because you can't change a single hair on it, neither black nor white.
However, if your words are yes, say: yes. And if they are no, say: no. The extra talk beyond this is from the devil." Revenge
# Eye for an Eye Have you heard the saying: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth?
# Arabic ولكن أنا كنݣول ليكم: ما تردوش الشر بخوه، ولكن اللي صرفقك على حنكك ليمن، ضور ليه لاخر حتى هو. # English But I tell you: do not repay evil with evil. On the contrary, if someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to him as well.
If someone wants to take you to court to get your *jalaba*, let them have your *tchamire* too.
If you don't, one thing will force you to take a thousand steps with him, then go with him two thousand.
Give anyone who asks you for something, and don't refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you. They want you to be their enemy.
You've heard the saying: Love those close to you and hate your enemies.
But I tell you: Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.
# Be Children of Your Father in Heaven For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
If you only love those who love you, what's your reward? Don't even those who pay taxes do this?
# Translation: "Otherwise, you'll be left alone with your brothers. How can you be better than others? Aren't even those who worship idols doing the same thing?"
"Be perfect, just as your heavenly Father is perfect."
Chapter Six Charity
Be careful not to do good deeds in front of others to be seen by them. Otherwise, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
If you want to give charity, don't boast about it in public like those hypocrites who do it in front of the mosques and in the alleys just to be praised by people. I'm telling you the truth: they have already received their reward from people.
But unless you give some charity, your left hand doesn't know what your right hand is doing.
Keep your charity a secret; it is your father in heaven, who sees what is done in secret, that will reward you. Prayer.
## Matthew 6:5-6 "And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
As long as you pray, enter your home, lock the door, and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.
When you pray, don't start repeating empty words like those who worship idols, thinking that the more they talk, the more God will answer them.
"Don't be like them, because the one in the heavens knows what you need even before you ask for it."
Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Bread is our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
We sought refuge so as not to fall into temptation, and we were saved from the devil.
If you forgive those who sin against you, your heavenly Father will forgive you.
"But if you do not forgive people their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses."
Keep quiet, don't look like hypocrites who contort their faces to show people they are fasting. I'm telling you the truth: they have already received their reward from people.
However, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
"It's not for people that you need to show you're fasting, but for your Lord who is in secret, and your Lord who hides nothing from Him, He will reward you." Treasures in heaven.
# **The Parable of the Treasure on Earth** Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But you have gathered treasures for yourselves in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
"For wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be." - Noor Al-Huda
The eye is the lantern of the self. If your eye is clear, your entire being will be illuminated.
But if your eye is ugly, your whole being will be dark. And if the light within you is darkness, how difficult is this darkness! Oh God, and money.
# Life's Choices Not even one can be a slave to two masters, for one will hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. And so, you cannot serve both God and money. Do not bear this burden.
Here is the translation: So, I say to you: do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink, or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes?
Look at the birds of the sky; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?
Who among you, if they were to take away their worries, could add even just an hour to their life?
Why do you burden yourselves with worries about clothing? Look closely at the roses in the field, see how they grow; they suffer no torment, nor do they spin.
However, I must tell you the truth: even Solomon in all his glory was never adorned like one of these.
O you people of little faith! If God has adorned the spring that we see today, and tomorrow it is thrown into the fire, yet He transforms it thus, how will He not transform you for the better?
Don't let these things weigh you down and cause you to worry: What will we eat? What will we drink? What will we wear?
The way that even those who don't know God, they all ask for these things, and yet your Father who is in heaven knows that you need all these things.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
Don't carry your worries to the next day, leave tomorrow's worries for tomorrow. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Chapter Seven Don't judge anyone.
Don't judge anyone, lest you be judged.
Where the rulers rule, by it they will be ruled; and by the words you speak, you will be spoken to. Mark
Why do you see the straw in your brother's eye, but ignore the log in your own eye?
You're gonna tell your brother what? Let me remove the straw from your eye, while you've got a log in yours?
That hypocrite, he should have removed the log from his own eye first, then he would see clearly how to remove the speck of straw from his brother's eye.
Do not give the sacred thing to the dogs, lest they maul you and tear you apart. And do not throw your pearls to the pigs, lest they trample them under their feet. Seek, knock, and ask.
They asked and they received. They tried and they found. They knocked on the door and it opened for them.
The way that is sought will be given, the heart that yearns will find its desire, and the door that is knocked on will be opened.
Who among you would give their child a stone if they asked for bread?
Would a whale give him a snake if he asked for it?
# Why doesn't God give good things to those who ask for them? If you, being imperfect, know how to give good things to your children, how is it that the Father in heaven does not give good things to those who ask him?
Treat others just as you want them to treat you. This is the essence of the teachings of the scriptures and the prophets." Luke 6:31 The Narrow Gate
Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is easy, that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it.
How narrow is the gate and how difficult is the road that leads to life, and few find it." The tree is known by its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
My path is known to them, they recognize it. Can you harvest grapes from thorns, or figs from a thistle?
As every good tree bears good fruit, so every bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. When?
"By their fruit you will recognize them." Matthew 12:33 We must do the will of God.
He who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will not enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
I sacrifice this day for you; many will say to me: Oh sir, oh sir! Was it not in your name that we prophesied? And in your name that we went mad? And in your name that we performed many miracles?
# Repentance At that hour, I will say to them: "I never knew you! Depart from me, you evildoers!" The example of two houses.
The one who listens to my words and acts upon them is like a wise man who built his house upon a rock.
# The House Built on Rock Not since the winter fell and the streams overflowed, and a mighty wind blew and battered that house, has it faltered, for its foundation was laid upon the rock.
He who hears my words and does not act upon them is like a foolish man who builds his house on sand.
"And when winter fell and the ponds overflowed, a strong wind came and hit that house, it collapsed and its dust was mighty."
When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.
He taught them as if he had authority, not like their religious scholars.
Chapter Eight Jesus, the Healer of the Praiseworthy Man
When Jesus came down from the mountain, he was followed by large crowds of people.
# The Miracle of the Mullet And a mullet swam up to him, bowed down, and said, "My master, if you wish, you can make me pure."
He stretched out his hand to Jesus and touched him, saying, "I want to be made clean." And immediately the leprosy left him and he became clean.
Jesus said to him, "See that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof to them." And the leper was cleansed.
When Jesus arrived at Capernaum, the centurion approached him, pleading with him.
He said to him, "My good sir, my servant at home is bedridden, paralyzed, and suffering greatly."
He said to him, "I will go and make him well."
The commander replied to the military leader: "I do not deserve, my lord, for you to step under my roof, but just say one word and my servant will be healed."
Even I have someone who rules over me, and I have soldiers whom I rule over. I say to this one, "Go!" and he goes, and to another, "Come!" and he comes, and to my slave, "Do this!" and he does it.
I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with faith as strong as this.
Many people will come from the east and the west and take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. Luke
Those who should have been in the kingdom, will be left out in the dark, and then where will the crying and gnashing of teeth be." When?
And Jesus said to the centurion, "Go your way; and as you have believed, so let it be done for you." And his servant was healed in that very hour. Jesus healed the mother-in-law of Peter and many others.
When Jesus entered Peter's house, he found Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus took her hand and she was immediately healed. She got up and worshiped him.
When he arrived in the evening, many people possessed by madness were brought to him, and he drove out the madness with a word, and healed all the sick.
# And so was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: “He himself bore our sicknesses, and carried our pains.” What then must those be like who follow Jesus?
When Jesus saw the crowd gathering around him, he instructed his disciples to move to the other side of the lake.
He approached one of the religious scholars and said to him, "My master, I will follow you wherever you go."
"The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
"Another of his disciples said to him, 'Sir, let me first go and bury my father.' "
Jesus answered him, "Let the dead bury their own dead; but you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God." Jesus calmed a fever
And when Jesus had embarked, his disciples followed him.
A strong wind blew on the sea, so strong that it tossed the boat, and Jesus was asleep.
Come near him, his disciples woke him up and said to him: "Save us, Lord, we are perishing!"
He said to them, "Why are you afraid, you men of little faith?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it was completely calm.
Men were amazed and said, "Who is this? Even the wind and the sea obey him!" Then Jesus drove out a demon from two men who came from the region of Gadara.
When Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gadarenes, he encountered two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.
They saw him and started shouting and saying: "What do you want from us, son of God? Did you come here to torment us before our time?"
A large stray donkey was roaming in a field near there.
They wanted to send Jesus out of the city and said to him: "If you do not leave us, we will send you into the herd of swine."
They went, entered it, and the whole piece rolled down and fell from the edge of the mountain into the sea and sank.
They fled and went to the city, spreading news of all that had happened, and of the fate of the men possessed by madness.
All the people of the city went out to meet Jesus. But when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
Chapter Nine Jesus heals a paralytic
Jesus got into the boat and crossed the lake again. Then he returned to his hometown.
They brought to him a paralyzed man lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, my child; your sins are forgiven."
Some of the religious scholars thought to themselves, "This man is uttering words of disbelief!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said, "Why are you thinking such bad things in your hearts?"
Forgiven are your sins, or should I say: Get up and go?
"But I tell you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." He said to the paralytic, "Get up, take your mat and go home."
The man stood up and walked to his home.
When the crowds saw what Jesus had done, they were afraid. They praised the God who had given such authority to men. Jesus often did these things at a distance.
As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him.
And when Jesus had called His twelve disciples to Him, He gave them power over all demons, and to cure diseases. And He sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. And He said to them, "Take nothing for your journey, neither staffs, nor bag, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece. And whatever house you enter, stay there, and depart from there. And whoever will not receive you, when you go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them."
# The Pharisees' Question When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
## Translation: When Jesus heard this, he replied, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
I want you all to understand the meaning of these words: "I seek mercy, not sacrifice, for I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners." The question is about fasting.
# The Translation And then John's disciples came to Jesus and asked him, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
They came to Jesus and said to him, "Is it right for the wedding guests to fast while the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast."
Even one doesn't patch old clothes with a piece of new cloth, for the patch will shrink and the tear will get bigger.
Even one does not put new wine into old leather bottles, because if it is done, they will tear and the wine will be spilled and the bottles will be ruined. But we put new wine into new leather bottles, so that neither the wine is lost nor the bottles ruined." The president's daughter and the woman who touched Jesus' clothes.
When he was telling them this, one of the chiefs came to him and bowed down to him, saying, "My daughter has just died, but come and put your hand on her and she will live."
And Jesus went on his way, followed by him and his disciples.
The woman was sick for twelve years, and she suffered a lot with bleeding. She came up behind Jesus and touched the fringe of his garment.
I thought to myself: "If I just pack his things, I'll get better."
He turned and saw her and said, "Daughter, your faith has healed you." And at that very moment the woman was healed.
When Jesus arrived at the official's house and saw the musicians wailing on the flute and the crowd making a commotion,
He told them, "Get out of here! The girl is not dead, she's just sleeping!" and they laughed at him.
When Jesus had put them all out, he took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
Farewell to the news in that whole newspaper. Jesus healed two blind men.
As Jesus passed by, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
As he entered the house, the blind men came to him. And he asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to heal you?" They replied, "Yes, Lord!"
At that moment, Jesus looked at them and said, "According to your faith, so shall it be done unto you."
They were showing them to everyone, and Jesus warned them, saying, "Beware! Don't tell anyone about this!"
They left and started spreading the news all over that neighborhood. Zizon was visible.
They went out and came back blind, until they brought him a man named Zizoun, possessed by madness.
And when Jesus came out of the tomb, the dove spoke. The crowds of people were amazed and said, "We have never seen anything like this in Israel!"
The Pharisees said, "This fellow drives out demons by Beelzebub, the prince of demons!" Matthew 10:25; 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15 The testing of Jesus.
Jesus was going throughout all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every disease and illness. Matthew
And when he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Mark
The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Luke
"So, they asked the owner of the harvest to send his harvesters to their harvest."
Chapter 10 Jesus sends his disciples to ignore.
Jesus called to his twelve disciples and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
These are the names of the twelve apostles: the first is Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus,
Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Jesus.
Jesus sent them out and instructed them, saying, "Do not go to the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans."
Go to the smitten sheep of Israel's people.
The way you go, tell people that the time of the kingdom of heaven is near.
Heal the sick, revive the dead, cleanse the lepers, and exorcise demons. You took it for free, so give it away for free.
Take nothing for your journey, neither gold, nor silver, nor copper.
No package, no two sets of clothes, no shoes, no cane, because the worker deserves his wages. 1 Corinthians 9:14; 1 Timothy 5:18
# **Translation:** Go to the city or the village you entered, ask for someone who deserves to host you, and stay with them until you leave on your own accord.
If you enter someone's house, greet its owner.
If they deserve your greetings, they would fill the house. Your greetings reach them. If they don't deserve them, your greetings come back to you.

Flee to another city whenever they persecute you. I am telling you the truth: before the Son of Man comes, you will not finish going through all the towns of Israel."
The way of the student is not better than that of his teacher, nor is the servant better than his master. Luke
The disciples are like their teacher, and the servants like their master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebul, how much more those of his household! Matthew 9:34; 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15
Fear not them, for all that is hidden will be revealed, and all that is concealed will be made known. Mark

He who welcomed you welcomed me, and he who welcomed me welcomed the one who sent me. Luke
He who welcomes a prophet, knowing him to be a prophet, will receive a reward akin to that of the prophet. And he who welcomes a righteous person, knowing him to be righteous, will receive a reward akin to that of the righteous.
"Anyone who gives even a glass of cold water to one of these little ones because he is my disciple, I tell you the truth, he will surely not lose his reward."
John the Baptist sends his disciples to Jesus.
When Jesus had finished giving these instructions to his twelve disciples, he left that place to teach and preach in their towns.
When John, who was in prison, heard about the deeds of Christ, he sent his disciples to ask him.
He said to him, "Are you the one who's coming, or should we wait for someone else?"
Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you hear and see:"
The blind now see, the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
"Lucky is the one who doesn't know you."
What did you go out to see in the wilderness? A reed swayed by the wind?
What do you want to see? Is there a man wearing a fine suit? Because those who wear fine suits, they live in the palaces of kings!
Tell me, what did you see? Is it a prophet? I'll tell you, yes, he's a prophet and more than a prophet.
Here is the translation: This is what God said in His book: "Behold, I will send My messenger before you, who will prepare the way for you."
# The Translation I tell you, among those born of women, no one has arisen greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
# The Kingdom of Heaven And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force. Luke
All the prophets and the law of Moses prophesied until the time when John the Baptist came.
If you are willing to accept it, then John the Baptist is Elijah who is to come. Matthew
Hey, those with two ears, listen up!
What kind of generation is this? They're like some kids in the market, shouting at each other and arguing.
We puffed up the lira for you, but you didn't dance; we wept for you, but you didn't cry!
John the Baptist was living in the desert, eating no food and drinking no water, and people said, "He must be possessed by a demon."
"And the son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'This one eats, drinks, and associates only with tax collectors and sinners!' But the wisdom of God is shown to be right by its results." Woe to the blogger who does not repent!
At that hour, Jesus began to rebuke the cities where most of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent.
Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were performed in your midst had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. #11:21 Put on sackcloth and sit in ashes: A sign of their repentance.
However, I tell you: the consequence of those who took pictures in Sour and Sidon will be lighter than your consequence on Judgment Day.
# Wrath of God Woe to you, Capernaum! If the miracles performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day. But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the judgment day than for you.
"And so I say to you, the punishment of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment will be lighter than yours." Matthew 10:15; Luke 10:12. Come to me and find rest.
"Truly, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, I praise you for hiding these things from the wise and revealing them to infants."
Oh Lord, so be it.
The Father has given all things into the hand of the Son. No one knows who the Son is but the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. John 3:35; John 1:18; 10:15
Come to me, all of you who are tired and carrying the heavy burden, and I will give you rest.
# **English Translation:** Cast my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
"My burden is light and my load is easy to bear."
Chapter 2: Jesus Teaches on the Sabbath
On the Sabbath, Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look, your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath!"
They replied: "Didn't you read what Daoud's soup did when he was hungry, him and those with him?"
He entered the house of God and ate the bread that was offered to Him, which he and those with him, except for the religious men alone, were not supposed to eat.
Did you not read in the Torah that the priests, while serving in God's house on the Sabbath, transgressed the Sabbath, and yet they were not to be blamed?
But I tell you: there is one here who is greater than God's house.
If you understood the meaning of the verse that says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice," then do not judge those who are blameless.
"For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath." Jesus was healing on the Sabbath.
He walked from there to their place of worship.
The man had a paralyzed hand. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" They questioned him so that they might accuse him.
"And He answered them, 'If one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?'"
A human's worth is far greater than that of a sheep! That's why doing good deeds is allowed on Saturdays.
Jesus said to the man with the paralyzed hand, "Stretch out your hand!" And he stretched it out, and it was restored, healthy as the other.
The Pharisees went out and began to plot how they could kill Jesus, the chosen one of God.
As soon as Jesus heard the news, he left that place and a great crowd followed him, and he cured them all.
They instructed them not to tell anyone about it.
Before the words spoken by the prophet Isaiah come to pass:
Here is my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul delights greatly. I will put my spirit upon him, and he will declare justice to the nations.
I won't argue or shout, no one will hear my voice in the alleys.
A broken reed will not pierce, a smoldering wick will not be extinguished, until truth prevails.
"In his name, the peoples will place their hopes." Jesus and Beelzebul.
Jesus healed a man who was blind, mute, and possessed by a demon. And so, he was able to speak and see.
The people were amazed and said, "Could this be David's son?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This fellow does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons." Matthew 9:34; 10:25
And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand."
If the devil casts out the devil, the devil will be divided and turn against himself. And if he is divided and turns against himself, how can his kingdom remain stable?
If I were Beelzebul, I'd be driving you all crazy. So, who is this person whose children you are raising? It's your children who will rule over you because of this.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
How could someone enter someone else's house, take their belongings without tying them up first, and then steal their home?
He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters. Mark 9:40
That's why I tell you: every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
He who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him. Luke 12:10 The tree and its fruit.
Plant a good tree and its yield will be good, but plant a bad tree and its yield will be bad. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
O Treekat El-Lafa'i! How can you say something good when you are not good yourself? What comes from the heart is spoken by the mouth. When?
A good person brings out good things from the good treasure within their heart, and a bad person brings out bad things from the bad treasure within their heart.
We tell you: every idle word that people utter, they will be held accountable for it on the Day of Judgment.
"That's why they'll judge you based on your words, either as innocent or guilty." The scholars of the law and the Pharisees wanted to see some sign.
"And at once some scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, 'Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.' But he answered and said to them..."
He said to them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. But I tell you, it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you."
"Because Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights."
The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.
The jinn leaves a person and wanders in places where there is no water, seeking rest but finding none.
He said: "I wish to return to my home, the one I left, and when I do, I find it empty, cleaned, and ready."
Kimchi and his seven other crazy friends are worse than him. Once they enter, they settle down, and the state of that person becomes worse than it was before. "This is what will happen to this generation that does evil." Jesus' brothers and mother.
When he was talking to those people, his mother and brothers came and stood outside, wanting to speak with him.
He is told by one of the attendees: "Your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak with you." # 12.47 This verse is missing from many of the old manuscripts.
Jesus answered him, saying, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
They are my friends and brothers.
Those who do what Murad wants, up in the sky, are my brother, my sister, and my mother.
Chapter 18: The Farmer's Tale
I sacrifice the day for you, my intention. Jesus left the house and sat by the sea.
And a great multitude of people gathered to Him, so that He got into a boat and sat in it; and the whole multitude stood on the shore. Luke 5:1-3
He returned to them with many things in his bag and said, "There was a man who went out to sow."
When he was sowing, some seeds fell on the path, and the birds came and ate them.
They fell into a dry field with little soil, and they sprouted quickly because the soil wasn't saturated.
When the sun rose, it scorched them, and since they had no walls, they withered.
And some seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.
And some of the seeds fell on good soil, and they produced a crop, some yielding a hundred, some sixty, and some thirty.
"If anyone has two ears, let them listen!" The purpose of the foundation.
Come near to him, his disciples said to him: "Why do you speak to the people in parables?"
He answers them and says: "To you it is given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given to understand them."
He who has, will be given more and will be blessed abundantly. And he who has not, even what he possesses will be taken away from him. When?
I was talking to them in their language, because when they see, they don't see; when they hear, they don't hear, and they don't understand.
Thus says Isaiah, so that you may be given the proof of his prophecy: Though you hear what he has said, you will not understand, and though you see what he has shown, you will not perceive.
When this people's hearts are hardened, their ears are deaf, and their eyes are closed, so they don't see with their own eyes, don't hear with their ears, and their hearts don't understand, and they return to me for healing.
But blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear. Luke
"We tell you the truth: many prophets and righteous people wished to see what you see and hear what you hear, but they never did." The meaning of this parable is that of the sower.
"Okay, listen up, all of you. Understand the meaning of the example of the farmer:"
He who hears the word of the kingdom of God and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart; this is what was sown along the path.
He who sows in the rocky ground, it is he who hears the word of God and accepts it immediately with joy.
However, the word of God did not firmly take root in his heart, and his faith remained only for a short while. When problems and trials arose, he quickly turned away from his faith.
He who is planted among thorns, he is the one who hears the word of God, but the worries of the world and the love of money choke the word of God in him, and it bears no fruit.
"But the one firmly rooted in good soil is the one who hears the word, considers it, and produces a crop that yields thirty, sixty, or a hundred times what was sown." The parable of the weeds among the wheat.
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
When people were asleep, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away.
When the crop sprouted and formed heads, then the darnel weed appeared with it.
They bring the servants of the master of the house and say to him: "Sir, isn't it the good seed that you sowed in your field? Then where does this darnel come from?"
He replied to them: "This is an enemy who did all this." His servants said to him: "Do you want us to go and remove him?"
Answer them and say: No! So that the wheat doesn't get mixed with the chaff.
Let the wheat grow with the weeds until it's time for harvest. Then, I'll tell the harvesters to collect the weeds first and bundle them up to be burned, while the wheat is gathered and brought to my storage house. The mustard seed and yeast are good examples.
The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field.
"Even though she is the youngest in love, when she grows up, she becomes a tree taller than all the other plants, even the birds of the sky come to nest in her branches."
The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about three cups of flour until all of the dough rose.
This is all that Jesus said to the crowds while walking, and without parables he would not say anything to them.
"For the words of the prophet to come true: 'With the wind, we speak and reveal all that was hidden since the day the world was created.' The example of the wild oats."
At that time, Jesus left the crowds and went home. And his disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the tares in the field!"
He answered and said, "The son of man sows the good seed."
The world is but a field, the good wheat are the children of God's kingdom, and the weeds are the children of the devil.
The enemy who sows the tares is Satan, and the harvest is the end of time, and the reapers are the angels.
As the darnel gathers and burns with vigor, so it shall happen in the end of days:
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers.
They throw them into the fire of well-being, for there is a time for crying and gnashing of teeth.
But those who obey God will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. So, let those with ears listen! The parable of the treasure, the jewel, and the net.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls.
"When he found a very precious gem, he sold everything he owned and bought it."
The kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered fish of every kind.
When the sun rose, the fishermen took their catch to the seashore, sat down, and began sorting. They put the good ones in baskets and threw away those that were useless.
In the end of times, the angels will come and separate the sinners from those who are God-fearing.
"They will throw the sinners into the depths of hell, and then where will the crying and gnashing of teeth be?" The new and old treasure.
Jesus asked his disciples, "Do you understand all these things?" They replied, "Yes!"
"He said to them, 'Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a head of a household, who brings out of his treasure things new and old.' Nazareth did not accept Jesus."
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he left the area.
# Jesus Returns to His Hometown And he went back to his town, Nazareth, teaching people in the houses of prayer, so much so that they were amazed and began to ask, "Where did he get this wisdom and these miracles?"
Is this not the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
"So, not even one of his siblings lives in our town? So, where did all this come from?"
They did not accept it, but Jesus told them, "A prophet is not without honour except in his own country, and among his own kin." John 4:44.
They didn't perform many miracles in that place because they had no faith.
Chapter Fourteen: The Death of John the Baptist
I am sorry, but I am unable to translate the provided text as it appears to be incomplete or missing some crucial information. Please provide the full text or clarify the missing parts so that I can assist you accurately.
"He was saying to his servants, 'This is John the Baptist, who has risen from the dead, that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.'"
Herod, because of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother, had John arrested and bound in prison. (Luke)
# The Story of John and His Forbidden Love John's heart was set on her, but his friend's words echoed in his mind: "It is not lawful for you to marry her."
He wanted to kill him, but he feared the people because they believed he was a prophet.
At Herod's birthday banquet, Herodias' daughter danced and pleased Herod.
He swore to give her what she asked for.
Herodias was furious with her and said to Herod, "Give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter!"
The king was sad, but he kept his promise to the boar and the people who witnessed it, ordering that she be given what she desired.
He sent the one who cut off John's head to prison.
They brought him a platter and gave it to the girl, then took it to Maha.
John's disciples came, took his remains, buried them, and then went to tell Jesus. Jesus was feeding five thousand people.
When Jesus heard these things, he departed from there in a boat to a lonely place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
When he stepped off the boat, he saw a large group of people, and he had mercy on them and healed their sick.
When evening came, his disciples approached him and said, "It's getting late and this place is remote. Send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food."
They said to him, "But we have only five loaves and two fish." He said, "Bring them here to me."
They said to him: "We only have five loaves of bread and two fishes here."
He said to them, "Show them to me here!"
He commanded the groups of people to sit down at the table. He took those five loaves of bread and two fish, lifted his eyes to heaven, and gave thanks to God. Then he broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, and the disciples gave it to the crowds of people.
They all ate until they were full, and then they collected thirteen bags filled with the leftover bread.
They were those who ate up about five thousand, excluding women and children. Jesus was walking on the water.
I command Jesus to have his disciples get into the boat right now and go ahead of him to the other side, so that he can send the crowds away.
And when he sent them away, he went up to the mountain by himself to pray. And he remained alone there until the evening came.
The students' boat was overwhelmed by the waves in the middle of the sea, because the wind was against it.
And early in the morning, Jesus came to his disciples, walking on the water.
When the students saw him walking on water, they were terrified and said, "It's a ghost, a jinn!" and they ran away in fear.
"It was about four in the morning when Jesus called out to them, 'Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid!'"
Peter said to him, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water."
"He said to him, 'Come!' So Peter got down out of the boat and walked on the water and came toward Jesus."
However, when he saw the strong wind and felt like he was drowning, he started screaming and said, "Save me, my lord!"
Immediately Jesus stretched out His hand, caught him, and said to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
When they boarded the boat, the wind calmed down.
Those in the boat worshiped him and said, "Truly you are God's Son." And when Jesus had come to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two possessed with demons, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way.
Jesus and his disciples crossed over to the other side of the lake, and they arrived in the region of the Gerasenes.
They recognized him as the healer of that land, spread his news among all the villagers, and brought all their sick to him.
They asked him to touch them, even just with his cloak. And everyone who was touched by him was healed.
Chapter fifteen: Discussions according to the elders' tradition.
And then, some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, asking him:
# Why don't your students follow the elders' habit of washing their hands before eating?
"But he answered them and said, 'Why do you strive to keep the commandment of God, that you may follow your own tradition?'"
Heed Allah when He says: Take care of your father and mother, and whoever curses his father or mother must be killed.
However, you say, "What I told my father or my mother is a gift to Allah, and I will not help you with it."
He no longer has the duty to take care of his father. That's how you've abandoned God's word to follow your own traditions.
O you hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you and said:
These people praise me only with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
They worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men." The things that enslave people
Call upon the group of people and say to them: "Listen and understand:"
What goes into the mouth does not define a person, but what comes out of it does.
"The disciples came to him and asked, 'Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard what you said?'"
# **English Translation:** And answer them, saying: "All the trees that were not planted by those in the heavens will be uprooted."
Leave them be! Those two are like the blind leading the blind; and if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.' Luke
Peter said to him, "Explain to us the meaning of this parable."
He replies: "Don't you still understand anything at all?"
Do you not know that everything that goes into a person's mouth ends up in their stomach and is then eliminated?
What proceeds from the mouth comes from the heart, and this reveals the true character of a person. When?
# Bad ideas come from the heart: like the dead, the corruption of the married and the unmarried, theft, false testimony, and cursing.
"It's these things that defile a person, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person." The faith of the Canaanite woman.
Jesus left Tyre, and went by way of Sidon towards the Sea of Galilee.
# The Caananite Woman's Plea A Canaanite woman came to him from that region and cried out, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is suffering badly from a demon."
He didn't answer her, not even a word. His disciples came to him and asked him, saying, "Send her away, because she is following us and making a lot of noise!"
Jesus answered them, saying, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
But Jatt, the woman, fell at his feet and said, "Help me, my lord!"
He answered, "It's not right to take the bread meant for the children and throw it to the dogs."
The woman said to him: "Yes, my lord! But even the dogs eat from the crumbs that fall from their master's table."
Jesus answered her, "Woman, your faith is great! What you desire will be done for you." And her daughter was healed instantly. Many people were healed.
And Jesus went about the sea of Galilee, and climbed up into a mountain, and sat down there.
Many groups of people came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, those possessed by demons, and many others. They laid them down at his feet, and he healed them.
And the crowds were amazed, seeing the mute speaking, the crippled healed, the lame walking, the blind seeing, and they glorified the God of Israel. Jesus fed four thousand people.
Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "Stay with this group of people, because it has already been three days and they have been with me, and they have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
They say to him, the disciples: "Where shall we get bread in the desert to fill such a multitude?"
Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They answered, "Seven, and a few small fish."
Jesus ordered the crowd of people to sit down.
And God took those seven loaves and fish, and He gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to His disciples, and His disciples gave them to the crowds.
They all ate until they were full, and they shook seven baskets full of leftovers, which were left over from the loaves of bread.
People ate four thousand of them, excluding the women and children.
When Jesus had sent the crowds away, he got into the boat and came to the region of Magadan.
Chapter 16: The Signs of Time
# Matthew Some Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus to test him. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
When the sun sets, you say, "The weather will be clear, because the sky is red."
In the early morning, they say: "Today, it will rain, because the sky is red and cloudy." You can predict the weather, but you can't interpret the signs of time!
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And leaving them, he went away. Matthew 12:39; Luke 11:29 The leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
When the students reached the other side of the sea, they forgot to take the bread with them.
Jesus said to them, "Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees." Luke
They were saying among themselves, "When he says these things to us, why didn't he bring bread with him?"
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them, "Why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread? Do you still not understand or remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?"
Do you still not understand? Have you not realized the value of five loaves of bread that fed five thousand people, and how many baskets were collected from the leftover crumbs? When?
Did you not understand how seven loaves of bread were enough for four thousand people? And how many baskets did you collect? When?
"How could you not understand that I was not referring to bread with my words to you? Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!"
At that time, the disciples finally understood that he was telling them to beware of the teaching of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, not to be careful of bread dough. Peter testified that Jesus is the Messiah.
# Mark 8:27 When Jesus and his disciples had come to the villages around Caesarea Philippi, he asked them, "Who do people say that I am?"
They were answering Jesus, saying, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets." Matthew
What do you think I am?
Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." John
Jesus said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
I am saying to you: You are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church, and the power of death will not conquer it.
"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
Jesus instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus predicted his death and resurrection.
From that hour, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, scribes, and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed, and on the third day be raised.
Peter pulled him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far be it from you, Lord! This must never happen to you!"
He turned around and said to Peter, "Get away from me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me because you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men."
He said to his disciples, "Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me."
# Life's Irony For those who wish to save their lives, they will lose them, But those who have lost their lives for my sake, will find them. When?
What good is a person if they gain the whole world but lose their life? And what can a person give in exchange for their life?
He shall come, the son of man, with his angels, in the glory of his Father, and then he shall reward each one according to his works. When?
"I tell you the truth: there are those here in this audience who will not die until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
Chapter seventeen: Jesus is seen in his glory.
And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
He was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.
Behold, Moses and Elijah appear with Jesus, talking to him.
"Peter said to Jesus, 'Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, let us make three shelters here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.'"
At that time, as he was speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; listen to him!" 2 Peter 1:17-18
Upon hearing this, the students fell to their faces and were very afraid.
Jesus went up to them, touched them, and said, "Get up, do not be afraid!"
They shook their heads and saw no one but Jesus alone.
As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus ordered them, saying, "Tell no one about the vision until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead."
"And they asked him, 'But why do the scholars of religious law say that first the prophet Elijah must come?'"
"Well, answer them and say: 'Indeed, Elijah Giji is the first and he will fix everything.'
But I tell you, the prophet Elijah came, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wished. So also the Son of Man will suffer at their hands." When?
At that hour, the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus was healing a possessed boy.
Jesus and his disciples arrived among the crowd, and a man approached him and bowed down before him.
"My son, have mercy on me, my master, because he has the wind in him and suffers greatly. He often falls into a fever and into the water."
He ate it for his students, and they couldn't cure him.
Jesus answered, "Oh faithless generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to me!"
Jesus got up, rebuked the impure spirit, and the boy was cured at once.
# The Disciples Approach Jesus The disciples came to Jesus and spoke to him privately. They asked, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"
They said to him: "Because of your little faith!" But I tell you the truth: if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.
"This kind [of demon] does not come out except by prayer and fasting." #17:21. This verse does not exist in many of the old manuscripts. Matthew 21:21; Mark 11:23; 1 Corinthians 13:2. Jesus again prophesies about his death and resurrection.
The disciples were gathered in the region of Galilee, and Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him, and on the third day he will be sent back." The disciples were very sad. Jesus pays the temple tax.
When Jesus and his disciples returned to Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and asked, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"And he answered them, 'Yes, from those who receive it.' When he came into the house, Jesus spoke first, asking him, 'What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes, from their sons or from strangers?'"
Peter answered him, "I am a foreigner." Jesus said, "Then their sons are exempt from the tax."
Go to the sea and cast your line; when you catch the first fish, open its mouth, and you will find a small fortune inside. Take it and use it to pay for yourself and me.
