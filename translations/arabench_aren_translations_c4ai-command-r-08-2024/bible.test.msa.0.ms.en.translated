Who is the greatest?
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Then Jesus called a little child to him, and set him in the midst of them.
"Verily, I say unto you, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."
Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
"Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me." Warning: stumbling blocks.
It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones who believe to sin.
Woe to the world from these stumbling blocks that must come, but woe to those who cause them!
# Mark 9:43-45 If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off! It is better to enter into life maimed than, having two hands, to go to hell, into the unquenchable fire. And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off! It is better for you to enter life lame than, having two feet, to be thrown into hell.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away! It is better for you to enter life with one eye, than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. » The Lost Sheep
Jesus said, "Beware of despising any of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven."
For the Son of Man came to save the lost.
If anyone has a hundred sheep and loses one of them, does he not leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the one that is lost until he finds it?
I tell you the truth, there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.
Thus your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish. Make peace with your brother.
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
If he does not listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he does not listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. #Two or three witnesses. See Deuteronomy 19:15.
If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. If he refuses to listen to the church, then treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
"Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
I tell you the truth, whatever two of you agree on earth to pray for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
# Matthew 18:20 For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them." # Forgiveness is Limitless
"Then Peter came to Jesus and asked him, 'Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?'"
Jesus said to him, "Not seven times, but seventy-seven times!" 22:18 #Seventy ... times.
"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants."
When he began to settle his accounts, a man was brought to him who owed him a huge amount. #A huge amount. 24:18 Literally: "ten thousand talents or a talent, which is equivalent to about 300,000 kilograms of the coins used at that time."
As he had nothing to cover the debt, Mr. decided to sell the debtor, his wife, children, and all his possessions, and use the proceeds to pay off the debt.
The servant then knelt before the king and pleaded with him, saying, "Give me some time, and I will pay you back in full."
The master took pity on him, canceled the debt entirely, and let him go.
As he was going, he found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a little. So he seized him by the throat and said, "Pay what you owe me!"
The servant knelt before him, pleading, "Give me time, and I shall pay all I owe."
He refused to do so, but instead took him and threw him into prison until he should pay back everything he owed.
When the other slaves saw what had happened, they were deeply saddened, and they went to tell their master everything that had taken place.
"His master summoned him and said to him, 'Wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.'
Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?
# The Master's Wrath His master was furious and handed him over to the jailers until he should pay back everything he owed.
"So will My Heavenly Father treat you, unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart."
Union in marriage.
And when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan.
A great multitude followed him, and he healed them there.
"And some Pharisees came to Jesus, trying to test him. They said, 'Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?'"
Jesus replied, "Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator made them male and female?" 4:19 Genesis 1:27, 5:2.
"Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." #leaves ... one flesh. 5:19 from Genesis 2:24.
And they shall be no longer two, but one. So, what God has joined together, let no one separate.
They said to him, "Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce, a certificate of divorce? See Deuteronomy 24:1. And so she is put away?"
Jesus answered them, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning."
"Therefore I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery."
"Then his disciples said, 'If this is the situation between husband and wife, it is better not to marry!'"
Jesus said to them, "Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it is given by God."
There are men who cannot marry because they were born without the capacity to marry. There are men who cannot marry because people have taken away their ability to do so. And there are men who have chosen not to marry for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this teaching, let them accept it." Jesus welcomes the children.
Then they brought little children to him, that he should put his hands on them and pray: but the disciples rebuked them.
"Then Jesus said, 'Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.' "
Jesus then placed his hands on them, and left that place. The hindrance of wealth.
"A man came to Jesus and asked him, 'Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?'"
"Jesus answered him, 'Why do you ask me about what is good? There is none good but God alone. But if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.'"
The man said, "What commandments?" Jesus replied, "You shall not kill, commit adultery, or steal."
# Do not bear false witness, honor your father and your mother. 19:19 # You shall not murder ... and your mother. 20:12-16, Deuteronomy 5:16-20. # Love your neighbor 19:19 # As you love yourself. 19:19 # Love your neighbor as yourself. 19:18
The young man said to him, "I have kept all these commandments since my youth. What do I still lack?"
Jesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he had great possessions.
"Then Jesus said to his disciples, 'Truly I tell you, it is hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven.'"
"Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished and asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
"Then Peter said to him, 'We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?'"
Jesus said to them, "Truly, I tell you, in the new age, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
"And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake, will receive a hundredfold, and will inherit eternal life with God forever."
Many are the first who will become the last, and many are the last who will become the first.
As the vineyard workers
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
I agree with the workers to pay them one dinar for each day, then I sent them to work in my vineyard.
He went out around nine o'clock and saw some men standing idle in the marketplace.
"He said to them, 'You too, go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you a fair wage.'"
They went to work in the vineyard. "He went out again around noon, and at three in the afternoon; he hired still other workers.
Around five o'clock, he went out again and found others standing in the market area. He asked them, "Why are you standing here all day doing nothing?"
"They said to him, 'No one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard.'"
"And when the day was over, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last and ending with the first.'"
They came, those hired at the fifth hour, and each received a denarius.
They came first, those who had been hired, thinking they would receive more, but each of them also received a denarius.
They took her, and began to grumble against the owner of the vineyard.
They say, "Those who were hired last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat!"
"The owner of the vineyard said to one of them, 'Friend, I am not treating you unfairly. Didn't you agree to work for one denarius?'"
Take your wages and go. For I wish to give the man I hired for the day's work, the same wages I gave you.
Do I not have the right to do as I wish with what is mine? Or are you jealous that I am at peace with others?
"So the first will be last, and the last will be first." Jesus prophesied his death and resurrection.
And as they were going along the road, he entered a certain village, where a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home.
"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death
# Mark 10:33-35 "They will mock him, spit on him, flog him and kill him, but after three days he will rise again." The greatest among you will be your servant.
Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing.
Jesus said to her, "What do you wish?" She replied, "Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup #cup. 22:20 the cup of suffering and pain that I am about to drink?" They answered him, "We are able."
"You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit at my right or at my left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father."
When the remaining ten heard this request, they were extremely angry with the two brothers.
Jesus then called them to himself and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in authority over them are called benefactors.
# But among you it shall not be so The one who wants to be great among you must be your servant.
Whoever wishes to be first among you, let him be your servant.
"The Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." Jesus Heals Two Blind Men.
And as they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
The people rebuked them and ordered them to be quiet, but they shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on us!"
Jesus stopped and called them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
"They said, 'Master, open our eyes.'"
Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes; immediately they received their sight and followed him.
Long live the king!
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. There you will find a donkey tied by her, untie her and bring her to me."
If anyone says anything to you, tell them: 'The Lord needs them, and he will bring them back soon.'
This happened so that what the prophet said would come true:
Say to the beloved city Zion: #Beloved Zion. 5:21 Literally, "Daughter Zion." 'Behold, your king is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.'
The two disciples went and did as Jesus had told them.
They brought the young donkey and its mother, and they placed their garments upon them. Then Jesus sat upon the garments.
Most people spread their cloaks on the road. But others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
The crowds that went before him and those that followed were shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!" Blessed is the Son of David! "Long live the king! Long live the king!
As Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred. And the people were asking, "Who is this?"
# Mark 6:15 The crowds following him began to say, "This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee." Jesus in the temple.
Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' #house_of_prayer... prayer. 13:21 From the Book of Isaiah 56:7. But you have made it a 'den of robbers!' #den_of_robbers. 13:21 From the Book of Jeremiah 7:11."
Some blind and lame people came to him in the temple courts, and he healed them.
The chief priests and scribes saw the wonders he was doing, and they saw the children shouting in the temple courts, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" They became indignant and said to him, "Do you hear what these children are saying?"
Jesus replied, "Yes, and have you not read that out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies, thou hast perfected praise?"
Jesus then left them and went out of the city to Bethania, and spent the night there. The power of faith.
And as he went out in the morning towards the city, he was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the roadside, so he came to it, but found nothing on it except leaves. And he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" Immediately the fig tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and asked, "How did the fig tree wither like this?"
"Truly I tell you," he replied, "if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done.
"Whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith." — Questioning the Authority of Jesus
Jesus went to the temple courts and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus replied to them, "I will also ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from God or from man?" So they began to argue with each other, saying, "If we say, 'From God,' he will ask us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
"If we say she is a human, we fear the people, for they all consider John a prophet."
Therefore they answered Jesus, and said, "We cannot tell." And Jesus said unto them, "Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things." Like the two sons
Jesus said, "What do you think of this story? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in my vineyard.'
The son replied, "I don't want to go." Yet, he changed his mind and went.
"Then the father went to his other son and asked him the same thing. He answered, 'Yes, sir, I will go.' But he did not go."
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John the Baptist came to show you the way of righteousness, but you did not believe him. Yet the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him, and even when you saw that, you did not repent and believe him. It is like the children of the householder.
"Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenants and went to another country."
When it was time to harvest the grapes, he sent his servants to the farmers to collect his share of the grapes.
But the peasants seized his slaves, beat one of them, killed another, and stoned another.
The owner sent more slaves than he had sent the first time. The peasants treated them the same way.
Finally, he sent his son, saying to himself, "They will respect my son."
"But when the peasants saw that this was the owner's son, they consulted among themselves and said, 'This is the heir, let us kill him so that we can seize his inheritance.'"
They seized him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
"So what do you think the owner of the vineyard will do to those tenants when he returns?"
"They said to him, 'He will destroy them horribly because they are evil, and then give the vineyard to other farmers who will give him the fruit in its season.'"
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read this scripture: 'The stone which the builders rejected, has become the cornerstone.' This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes."
"Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruit of the kingdom."
"And whoever falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him!"
When the chief priests and Pharisees heard Jesus' parables, they realized he was speaking about them.
They tried to arrest him, but they were afraid of the people who regarded Jesus as a prophet.
As grand as a wedding feast.
Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who gave a wedding feast for his son.
The king sent his servants to invite the guests to the wedding feast, but they did not want to come.
"So the king sent out his servants to invite those who had been originally invited to the wedding feast, saying, 'Come, for everything is now ready.' "
But the invited guests paid no attention and went off, one to his field, another to his business.
The rest seized the king's slaves and beat them and killed them.
Then the king was furious and sent his army, who killed those murderers and burned down their city.
"Then the king said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.'
Go therefore into the main streets, and invite everyone you find to the wedding feast.
They went out into the streets and collected all they found, bad or good, until the banquet hall was full of guests.
When the king entered to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing a wedding garment.
The king said to him, "Friend, how did you come in here without wedding clothes?" But he remained silent.
The king said to his servants, "Bind his feet and hands, and throw him outside into the darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"For many are called, but few are chosen." The Pharisees try to entrap Jesus.
The Pharisees went away and plotted together how they might entrap Jesus in speech.
They sent their disciples to him along with some of Herod's followers, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are genuine and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by people's opinions, because you pay no attention to who they are.
"So tell us your opinion, is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
"Jesus knew their evil intentions and said to them, 'Hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?'"
Show me the currency you use." They brought him a dinar.
"He said to them, 'Whose is this image and inscription on the dinar?'"
"They said to him, 'They are Caesar's.' And he said to them, 'Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.'"
When they heard his answer, they were amazed, and left him and went on their way. The Sadducees try to trap Jesus.
On that day, some Pharisees came to him, those who say there is no resurrection, and they asked him:
"Oh teacher, Moses said, #Moses said. 24:22 See Deuteronomy 25: 5, 6. If a man dies without leaving children, his brother must marry the widow and father a child who will carry his brother's name."
There were seven brothers among us, and the first one got married and died. Since he had no children, his brother married his widow.
It happened to the brother, and the second, and the third, and even the seventh.
And after they all died, the woman died too.
# Who will she be for, out of the seven, on the Day of Resurrection? For they all married her.
Jesus answered them, "How mistaken you are! For you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God."
Understand that in the eternal life after the resurrection of the dead, people neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
As for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God has revealed?
I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' #I... am Jacob. 32:22 from the Book of Exodus 3:6. For He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.'
The people were utterly amazed when they heard this. The greatest commandment.
When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
An expert in religious law questioned him, trying to entrap him:
"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?"
Jesus said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind." # Love the Lord ... your mind. 37:22 from Deuteronomy 6:5.
Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.
The second commandment is like the first: "Love your neighbor #your_neighbor. 39:22 Referring to the Gospel of Luke 10: 25-37, we understand that the neighbor refers to every human in need of help. As you love yourself." #Love_your_neighbor ... yourself. 39:22 From the Book of Leviticus 19: 18.
"All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments." The Lord of David, Christ.
While the Pharisees were gathered around him, Jesus asked them:
"What do you think about Christ? Whose Son is he?" So the Pharisees answered him, "The son of David."
He said to them, "How then can David call him 'Lord' when he says in the book of Psalms..."
"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.'"
"If David calls him Lord, how is he his son?"
No one could answer him, and no one dared to ask him any more questions after that.
Jesus criticizes the religious leaders.
Jesus then spoke to the crowds and to his disciples:
He said: "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat."
Keep and do whatever they tell you, but do not follow their example. For they preach, but do not practice what they preach.
They burden people with heavy loads that are hard to bear, yet they themselves are not willing to make any effort to follow them.
All their good deeds are done for show, to be noticed by people. They make their phylacteries prominent and lengthen the tassels of their garments. #TheirPhylacteries. 5:23 Some of the Jews would write specific passages from the Holy Scriptures and place them in small leather pouches, which they would then bind with cloth straps to their heads or left arms, thus displaying their piety.
They love to sit in the best seats at the feasts, and in the front seats in the assemblies.
They love to be greeted by people with special salutations in the markets, and to be called: "Teacher."
"But you are not to be called 'Teacher,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers."
# **English Translation:** "And do not let anyone on earth call you 'Father,' for you have one Father, and he is in heaven."
Do not let people call you 'Master,' because you have only one Master, the Christ.
The greatest among you must be a servant to you all.
Whoever exalts themselves, God will humble them, and whoever humbles themselves, God will exalt them.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.

"You say, 'If someone swears by the altar, they are not bound by their oath; but if they swear by the gift on the altar, they are bound by their oath!' "
Oh ye blind! Which is greater, the offering on the altar, or the altar that makes the offering sacred?
If anyone swears by the altar, he is swearing by it and by everything on it.
If anyone swears by the temple, he is bound to keep his oath, both by the temple and by the one who dwells in it.
If anyone swears by heaven, he is swearing by God's throne and by Him who is seated on it.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.
O ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.

Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.
Thus you also outwardly appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous,
You say, "If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not have shared in the blood of the prophets."
You hereby confirm that you are the descendants of those who killed the prophets.
Complete what your ancestors have begun.
"O generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?"
Therefore, I tell you that I will send you prophets and wise men and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town.
Therefore, you shall be held accountable for the blood of every innocent person slain on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. #Abel ... Zechariah. 35:23 The first and last to be slain according to the time and text of the Old Testament scriptures. (See Genesis 4:8 and 2 Chronicles 24:20)
I tell you the truth, the punishment for all these crimes will fall upon this generation. Jesus warns the people of Jerusalem.
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you! How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing.
Lo, your house will be left empty and desolate!
"For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' #Blessed ... the Lord. 39:23 from Psalm 118: 26."
Jesus prophesies the destruction of the temple.
Jesus left the temple courts and was walking away when his disciples came to him to call his attention to the temple buildings.
Jesus said to them, "Do you see all these buildings? Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
And as Jesus sat upon the Mount of Olives, his disciples came unto him privately, and said, "Tell us, when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?"
Jesus said to them, "Be on your guard against false prophets."
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ," and they will deceive many.
You will hear of wars and revolutions, but do not be afraid. For these things must take place, but the end is not yet.

They will deliver you to tribulation, and will kill you. And you will be hated by all nations because of my name.
At that time, many will abandon their faith, and they will betray one another to the authorities; they will hate each other.
False prophets will arise and lead many astray.
And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
But he who remains faithful until the end, he shall be saved.
The gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
"When you see 'the vile desolator' #theviledesolator. 15:24 See Daniel 9:27, 12:11, and Matthew 11:31. Who was spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place - let the reader understand."

Thus also when you see all these things, you know that it is near, at the doors. 33:24. Compare with the Gospel of Luke 21:31.
I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words will never pass away. Only the Father knows.
But no one knows when that day and that hour will be, neither the angels of heaven nor the Son, but only the Father.
"As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be in the days of the Son of Man."
In the days before the flood, people were eating, drinking, marrying, and giving their daughters in marriage until the day Noah entered the ark.
They did not know what would happen, until the flood came and took them. So will it be also in the coming of the Son of Man.
At that time, two men will be working in the field, one will be taken and the other left behind.
Two women will be grinding grain at the mill; one will be taken and the other left.
# Mark 13:33 # Be watchful, for you do not know when the time will come.
Make sure that if the homeowner knew at what hour of the night the thief intends to come, he would wake up and not let him rob his house.
Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. The faithful and wise servant.
"Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord setteth over his household, to give them their portion of food in due season?"
Well done to that servant who, when his master comes, finds him doing his duty.
I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
The wicked servant thought to himself, "My master is delaying his coming."
He starts beating his fellow servants and joins the drunkards in eating and drinking.
The master of that servant will come on a day when he is not expecting him, and at an hour he does not know.
He punishes him and places him with the hypocrites, where people weep and gnash their teeth.
Like the ten girls.
"Then the kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom."
Five of them are stupid, and five are smart.
The foolish ones took their lamps, but they did not take extra oil with them.
The clever ones took extra oil in their pitchers along with the lamps.
The groom was late, so the girls all dozed off and fell asleep.
But at midnight there was a cry, "Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him."
Then the virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
The foolish ones said to the wise: "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
"And the wise virgins replied, 'We cannot, for it is not enough for us and you. Go instead to the dealers and buy oil for yourselves.'"
While they were on their way to buy oil, the bridegroom arrived. The wise ones were ready; they entered the wedding feast with him. And the door was shut.
"Finally, the rest of the girls came and said, 'Oh, sir, sir, open the door for us.'"
"But he said, 'Truly I tell you, I do not know you.'"
Therefore, be vigilant, for you do not know the day or the hour when the Son of Man will come. Like the three servants
"The kingdom of heaven is also like a man who was about to travel. He called his servants and entrusted his possessions to them."
He gave five bags of money to one of them, #five bags. 15:25 Literally "talents or centners", and a talent is equivalent to about 27 to 36 kilograms of gold, silver or copper. He gave two bags to the second one, and one bag to the third. He gave each according to his ability. Then he travelled immediately afterwards.
The one who received the five bags began to invest them immediately in business, and gained another five bags.
He worked like the first one, and earned two more bags.
As for the one who took one bag, he went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money in it.
So after a long time the master of those slaves returned and proceeded to settle accounts with them.
The one who received the five bags came forward, gained five more bags, and said, "Master, you gave me five bags, and here are five more bags that I have earned."
"His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful in a very little; I will give you a great authority. Enter into the joy of your master.'"
"Then the one who had received the two bags came and said, 'Master, you gave me two bags of money, and here is another two bags that I have gained.'"
"His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful in a very little; I will give you a great authority. Enter into the joy of your master.'"
"Then came the one who had received one bag and said, 'Master, I know you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow."
"I was afraid of you, so I went and buried your bag in the ground. Here, take your money."
"His master replied, 'You wicked and lazy servant! You knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed."
Why didn't you deposit my money in the bank, so that when I returned, I could take it with interest?
Take the bag from him and give it to the owner of the ten bags.
Because whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance, but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.
That worthless slave, throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers.
"And when the Son of Man comes in his glory with all his angels, he will sit on his glorious throne."
Then all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will place the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left.
"Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.'"
I was hungry and you gave me food. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you welcomed me in.
I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you cared for me. I was in prison and you came to see me.
"The righteous reply: 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You a drink?'"
"And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you?"
We visited you when we heard you were sick or imprisoned.
The king said, "Verily, I tell you, whatever you did for one of my brothers, the least of these, you did it for me."
"Then the King will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels.'"
I was hungry and you gave me no food. I was thirsty and you gave me no drink.
I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, I was sick and imprisoned and you did not visit me.
"The wicked reply, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to your needs?'"
The king said, "Verily, I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of these little ones, you did not do for me."
"And so the wicked will go to eternal punishment, but the righteous will go to eternal life."
The Jewish leaders were plotting to kill Jesus.
After Jesus finished speaking, He said to His disciples:
You know that Easter is in two days, and the Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of his enemies to be crucified.
The chief priests and elders of the people had gathered in the palace of the high priest Caiaphas.
They plotted to arrest Jesus by trickery and kill him.
They were saying, "It ought not to be done during the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
While Jesus was in the town of Bethany, in the house of Simon the Leper,
A woman came to him, bringing an expensive perfume in a marble flask, and she poured it on his head as he was eating.
When his disciples saw this, they were indignant. "Why this waste?" they asked.
It could have been sold for a large sum of money to be given to the poor.
"Jesus knew what they were discussing, and he said to them, 'Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful deed for me.'
The poor will always be with you, #the_poor ... always. 11:26 See Deuteronomy 15:11. As for me, I will not always be with you.
I poured perfume on my body to prepare it for burial.
"Truly, I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her." Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus.
Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
And he said unto them, "What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you?" And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.
Judas began to seek an opportunity to betray Jesus to them. At the Passover table.
On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
Jesus said, "Go to so-and-so in the village and tell him, 'The teacher says: My appointed time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'"
The disciples did as Jesus had told them, and prepared the Passover meal.
As evening came, Jesus reclined at the table with his twelve disciples.
"And as they were eating, he said to them, 'Truly, I tell you, one of you will betray me.'"
They were saddened and began to ask him, one by one: "Is it I, Lord?"
"The one who dips his hand with me in the dish, he is the one who will betray me."
# Mark 14:21 The Son of Man goes as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had never been born!"
Judas, who was about to betray him, asked, "Is it me, Teacher?" Jesus answered, "You have said so." The Last Supper.
And as they were eating, he took bread, and when he had blessed it, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “Take; this is my body.”
They took a cup of wine, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, "Drink from this, all of you."
# The Blood of the Covenant For this is my blood, the blood of the covenant, shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.
"I tell you, I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of my Father."
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus foretold Peter's denial.
Jesus then said to them, "You will all fall away because of me this night; for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'"
"But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
Peter replied, "Even if everyone else loses faith in you, I could never lose mine."
Jesus said to him, "Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
Peter said to him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!" All the disciples spoke in the same way. Jesus prayed alone.
Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
And he took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be grieved and severely troubled.
He then said to them, "My sorrow is deep and profound, it is almost killing me! Stay here and keep watch with me."
Jesus withdrew from them a little and knelt down and prayed, "Father, if it is your will, take this cup away from me; yet not my will, but yours be done." #thecup. 39:26. The cup of suffering and pain. Repeated in verse 42.
He came to his disciples and found them asleep, and he said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
Stay awake and pray so that you may not fall into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
"Father, if it is not possible for this cup to pass me by, but I must drink it, may your will be done."
He returned a second time and found them asleep, for slumber had weighed down their eyes.
He left them and went away a third time to pray, saying the same words as before.
"Then he returned to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to them, 'Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Enough! The hour has come; look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.'"
Arise, let us go. Behold, the man who betrayed me is at hand." They seized Jesus.
As he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived; and with him was a large crowd with swords and clubs, sent out by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
"The traitor had given them a sign and said, 'Whomever I greet is the wanted man; seize him.'"
Come close to Jesus now and say to him, "Greetings, teacher!" and kiss him.
Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you came for." Then they came up and seized Jesus and took him.
Then one of those who were with Jesus put his hand to his sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
"Jesus said to him, 'Put your sword back in its place, for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.'"
Do you not realize that I could call on my Father, and he would at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?
But, if you do, how will the books that declared these things would happen this way be proven true?
At that moment, Jesus said to the crowd, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as you would a criminal? I was with you day after day in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour—when darkness reigns."
"But this happened so that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples deserted him and fled! Jesus stood before the Jewish leaders.
Then they took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
Peter followed at a distance and went into the courtyard of the high priest's house. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.
They were seeking false testimony against Jesus so that they might put him to death.
They didn't find anything, even though many false witnesses came forward and told lies about him. Finally, two men stepped forward,
"And they said, 'This man is the one. #This man. 61:26, Jesus, for his enemies avoided speaking his name! He said, 'I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'""
"Then the high priest stood up and said, 'Will you not answer? What is it that these men are testifying against you?'"
Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Jesus said to him, 'I am, and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.'"
"Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, 'He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we still need witnesses? You have all heard his blasphemy against God!'"
"By what law do you judge him?" they replied, "He deserves to die."
Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists and slapped him.
They said to him, "Prophesy to us, Christ. Who hit you?" Peter denied Jesus.
Meanwhile, Peter was sitting in the courtyard outside. Then the servant-girl of the high priest came up, and noticed him, and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean."
Peter denied it in front of everyone and said, "I don't understand what you're saying!"
He then went out to the gate of the courtyard, and another servant girl said to those standing there, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Peter denied it again, swore, and said, "I do not know this man."
And soon, those who were standing there came to him and said, "You are one of them, for your accent betrays you as a Galilean."
Then he began to curse, #curse. 74:26 He swears to himself with a curse that he is not lying! He swears and says, "I do not know this man." And immediately the rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.
Jesus before Governor Pilate
On the following morning, the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered together to plot Jesus' death.
Bind him and lead him away and hand him over to the governor Pilate. Judas kills himself.
Judas, who had betrayed Jesus, saw that they were determined to put him to death, and he changed his mind. So he took the thirty pieces of silver back to the chief priests and the elders,
He said to them, "I have sinned by delivering an innocent man to be killed." They replied, "What is that to us? See to it yourself."
Judas threw the pieces of silver into the temple and left; he went and hanged himself.
"So the chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, 'It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money.' "
They decided to buy the Fakhari field to serve as a cemetery for strangers.
To this day, the field is known as the "Field of Blood."
They gave the thirty pieces of silver, the price at which they valued him, as the Lord commanded me.
"So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the Lord, to the potter." #They paid ... the Lord. 10:27 See Zechariah 11:12-13, Jeremiah 32:6-9. Jesus before Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said, "You have said so."
When the chief priests and elders complained about him, he said nothing.
"Then Pilate asked him, 'Do you not hear the many charges they bring against you?'"
But Jesus gave no answer to Pilate concerning any of the charges against him. And Pilate was amazed at his silence. Pilate failed to release Jesus.
At Easter, it was customary for the governor to release to the people a prisoner of their choice.
There was a notorious prisoner, a notorious eater, whose name was Barabbas. #Barabbas. 16:27 Or "Jesus Barabbas" as in some Greek versions.
"When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. 'I am innocent of this man's blood,' he said. 'It is your responsibility!' All the people answered, 'Let his blood be on us and on our children!'"
Pilate knew that they had handed Jesus over out of envy.
While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, "Don't do anything against this innocent man, for I have suffered greatly today in a dream because of him."
The chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd to ask for the release of Barabbas and to have Jesus killed.
"So the governor asked, 'Which of the two do you wish me to release to you?' They answered, 'Barabbas.'"
Pilate asked them, "Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said, "Let Him be crucified!"
Pilate said to them, "Why? What is his crime?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify him!"
"When Pilate saw that his efforts were in vain, and that the crowd was becoming unruly, he took some water and washed his hands before the people, saying, 'I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves.'"
"And all the people said, 'Let his blood be on us and on our children.'"
Then Pilate released Barabbas to them. He ordered Jesus to be flogged and handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
Then the governor's soldiers led Jesus to the governor's headquarters, and the whole cohort gathered around him.
They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him. #They clothed him ... with color. 27:28 Or purple, to mock him, for this is the color of the kings' robes.
They put a crown of thorns on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And they bowed down before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They then spat on him, took the reed from his hand, and began to hit him on the head.
When they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him. Jesus on the cross.
When they went out, they came upon a man from the town of Cyrene named Simon, and they compelled him to carry the cross.
And when they came to a place called 'Golgotha,' that is, 'the place of the skull,'
Give Jesus wine mixed with myrrh to drink. But when he tasted it, he refused to drink.
When they had crucified Jesus, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They sat there, guarding him.
"They placed a sign over his head, which read: 'This is Jesus, the King of the Jews,' as the charge against him."
Jesus was crucified with two criminals, one on his right and the other on his left.
They cursed at him, shaking their heads.
"They were saying, 'You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross if you are the Son of God!'"
And the chief priests, scribes, and elders mocked him, saying:
"He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the king of the Israelites! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him!"
Place his trust in God, let God save him now if he truly wants him. Didn't he say, "I am the Son of God"?
And those who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way. The death of Jesus.
And from noon until three in the afternoon, darkness came over all the earth.
At about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which is translated, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" 27:46 from Psalm 22:1.
When some of the bystanders heard it, they said, "He is calling for Elijah." 27:47 #CallingElijah.
Then one of the bystanders quickly grabbed a sponge, soaked it in vinegar, put it on a stick, and held it up to his mouth so he could drink.
The rest were saying, "Let's wait and see if Elijah will come to save him!"
Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
The temple veil was torn in two, #TempleVeil. 51:27 The veil that separated the "Holy of Holies" from the rest of the Jewish temple. And the Holy of Holies represented the divine presence. from top to bottom, the earth shook, and the rocks split.
And the graves were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;
After Jesus had risen, those bodies came out of their graves, entered the holy city, and appeared to many.
The Roman officer, #RomanOfficer. 54:27 literally "centurion." And the guards who were watching over Jesus' body, when they saw the earthquake and the other events, were greatly terrified and said, "Truly, this man was the Son of God!"
There were also some women watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee and were ministering to him.
Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons were there. #Zebedee's sons. 56:27 James and John. Jesus was buried.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus, arrived in Jerusalem.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that the body be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
He placed him in his new tomb, which he had carved out of the rock, then rolled a massive stone across the entrance and left.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. Guarding Jesus' tomb.
On the following day, after Friday had ended, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered with Pilate.
They said to him, "Sir, we remember that this deceiver said, 'I will rise again after three days.'"
"So he gave orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day, in case his disciples came and stole him away and told the people, 'He has been raised from the dead.' That will be worse than the first deception."
"So Pilate said to them, 'Take a guard of soldiers and go, make sure of everything as you know how.'"
They went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting the guard.
Resurrection of Jesus
And when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary the other came to the tomb early, at the first day of the week.
At that moment, a powerful earthquake occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, went to the tomb, rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it.
He shone like lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow.
The guards were so afraid of him that they became like the dead.
"The angel said to the two women, 'Do not be afraid; I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.'"
He is not here; for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.
# Mark 16:7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him!' Now I have told you."
Then the two women left the tomb quickly; their fear was mingled with great joy, and they ran to tell the disciples.
Suddenly Jesus met them and said, "Greetings." So they came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; they will see me there." The false report.
As the two women were on their way, some guards went into the city and reported everything that had happened to the chief priests.
The chief priests met with the elders and plotted together. Then they gave the soldiers a large sum of money,
They said to them, "Spread the word among the people that Jesus' disciples came at night and stole his body while you were asleep."
"If this news reaches the governor, we will convince him and keep you safe."
The soldiers took the money and did as they were told. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus spoke to his disciples.
The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
And when they saw him, they bowed down to him, although some of them had doubts.
Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. Remember that I will be with you always, even to the end of the age."
John the Baptist
As for Jesus the Messiah, son of God, this is the beginning of the good news about him.
"For it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah, 'Behold, I send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.'"
"A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.' "
John the Baptist came, baptizing in the wilderness, and demanding of people that they be baptized as a sign of their repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
# The Baptism of Jesus And all the people of the land of Judea and the city of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan River after confessing their sins.
His clothes were made of camel's hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
He proclaimed and said, "After me comes a man who is greater than I. I am not worthy to bend down and untie the strap of his sandal."
I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." The Baptism of Jesus
In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
At that moment, as he emerged from the water, he saw the heavens open, and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in the form of a dove.
# The Temptation of Jesus And a voice came from heaven, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
Jesus led the spirit into the wilderness alone.
# The Temptation of Jesus And he was there for forty days, being tempted by the devil. He was with the wild beasts, and the angels ministered to him. Jesus chose some of his disciples.
After John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
"The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel."
As Simon and his brother Andrew were casting their nets into the lake, he saw them walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
They dropped their nets immediately and followed him.
Then he walked a little further and saw James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John in their boat, mending their nets.
Jesus called them, and immediately they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired men, and followed him. Jesus casts out an evil spirit.
They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.
They were astonished at his teaching, for he spoke with authority.
There was a man in the synagogue who had an unclean spirit. The spirit cried out,
# Mark 1:24 What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!
Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent and come out of him!"
The unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions, cried out with a loud voice, and came out of him.
# The Translation And all the people were amazed, and said, one to another, "What is this? a new teaching! for with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him."
Jesus healed many, and news about him spread throughout the whole region of Galilee.
They then left the compound, went with Jacob and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
He approached her, took her hand, and made her sit down. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.
In the evening, as the sun set, they brought to him many who were possessed with demons.
All the city's inhabitants gathered at the door of the house.
Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. But Jesus did not permit the demons to speak because they knew who he was. Prepare to proclaim the gospel.
In the early morning, before sunrise, Jesus went out, as was his custom, and made his way to a solitary place to pray.
Simon and those with him went out to look for him.
When they found him, they said to him, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus replied, "Let us go to the nearby villages so that I can preach there too; for this is why I came."
# Mark 1:38-39 And he went about all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues, and casting out devils. And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.
A leprous man came to Jesus, knelt down, and begged him, saying, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus was moved with compassion, and stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, "I will; be thou clean."
The leprosy left the man, and he became clean.
Jesus sternly warned him and sent him away.
He said to him, "See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
The man went out and began to proclaim in the land the whole story of how Jesus had done this for him. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a paralytic.
And after several days, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and the news of his return spread.
A great multitude gathered, so that they stepped on each other, and yet not even near the door could they find room. And Jesus was preaching the word of God.
They brought to him a paralytic, carried by four men.
They could not get near Jesus because of the crowd, so they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on.
"When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, 'Son, your sins are forgiven.'"
Some of the scribes were sitting there, thinking to themselves:
"Why is this man speaking in such a manner? He is insulting God with his words! For who, other than God alone, can forgive sins?"
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?
Which is easier to say: "Your sins are forgiven" or "Get up, take your mat and walk"?
"But I tell you, rise, take up your mat, and go to your house."
I say to you, take up your bed and go to your house!
He got up, took his mat, and immediately walked out in full view of everyone. They were all amazed and praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!" Levi (Matthew) followed Jesus.
Jesus returned to the lake, and he taught the crowds that followed him there.
As he walked along, Levi was sitting at the tax booth and he said to him, "Follow me!" And he got up and followed him.
While Jesus was dining at Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples. For there were many there when Jesus called Levi, so they followed Jesus.
When the Pharisees and the teachers of the law saw him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
# Mark 2:17 When Jesus heard this, he said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick; I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners." # Question about Fasting
And John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting: and they come and say to Jesus, "Why do John's disciples and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast.
No one tears a piece from a new cloth to patch an old garment, for the new will shrink and tear away from the old, and the tear will be worse.
No one pours new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the new wine will burst the skins, spilling the wine and ruining the skins. Rather, new wine must be poured into new wineskins. Jesus, Lord of the Sabbath
On a certain Sabbath, as Jesus was walking through the grain fields, his disciples began to pick the heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands.
"The Pharisees said to Jesus, 'Look, your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath!'"
"Have you never read in the scriptures how David, when he was in need, entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is not lawful for any to eat except the priests alone, and how he also gave it to those who were with him?"
"He entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the priest, and ate the bread offered to God, which it is lawful for no one to eat but the priests, and gave some to those who were with him." #26:2 See 1 Samuel 21: 1-6.
Jesus then said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
"So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."
Jesus heals on the Sabbath.
Jesus went back to the synagogue, and there was a man with a paralyzed hand.
Some people watched him closely, to see if he would heal him, to find a reason to accuse him.
"He said to the man with the paralyzed hand, 'Rise and come forward!'"
He then said to them, "Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save life or to kill?" But they were silent.
Jesus looked around at them with anger and was deeply saddened by their hard hearts. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand," and he stretched it out, and it was restored to normal.
The Pharisees went out and began to conspire with the followers of Herod to find a way to kill Jesus. Many were following Jesus.
Jesus went with his disciples to the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd followed him from Galilee and Judea.
# And from Jerusalem, and from Edom, and from the region beyond the Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude came to him, having heard all that he was doing.
Jesus asked his disciples to prepare a boat for him so that the crowds would not crush him.
And as many as touched him were made whole.
The unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
She is sternly warned not to reveal who he is. The selection of the twelve.
Then Jesus went up on the mountain, and those he wanted, he called to him; and they went to him.
Jesus chose twelve men and called them apostles, to be with him and to send them to different places,
They shall have power to cast out devils.
They: Simon, whom Peter called.
Jacob, son of Zebedee, and his brother John, whom Jesus called "Boanerges"—that is, "Sons of Thunder."
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, #Zealot. 18:3 From an Aramaic word meaning "zealous." Belonging to a Jewish political party that resisted Roman rule, called the Zealots.
Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. The power of Jesus is from God, and Jesus returned home.
People once again gathered around him and his disciples, so that they could not even find time to eat.
When Jesus' family heard about his coming, they came to take him with them, for people were saying he was mad!
The teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons."
Jesus called them to him and began to speak to them in parables. He said, "How can Satan drive out Satan?"
If a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot stand.
If a house is divided against itself, it cannot stand.
