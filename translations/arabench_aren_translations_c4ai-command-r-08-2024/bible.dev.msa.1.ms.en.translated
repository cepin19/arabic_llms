The birth of Jesus Christ happened like this: When his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.
Joseph was a righteous man, so he did not want to expose her; he wanted to dismiss her quietly.
# The Annunciation to Joseph But while he was pondering these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."
This was all to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through the prophet:
Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel; which means, God with us.
When Joseph awoke, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took his wife.
She did not recognize him until she gave birth to her firstborn son. And she called his name Jesus.
The Adoration of the Magi
When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
"Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was perturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
The priests and scribes were gathered, and he asked them, "Where is the Messiah to be born?"
They said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:"
Bethlehem Ephrathah, you are small among the clans of Judah; yet from you will come forth for Me, One to be ruler in Israel, whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.
Then Herod summoned the Magi secretly and ascertained from them the time the star had appeared.
Go and search diligently for the child; and when you have found him, bring me word, so that I too may come and pay him homage.
When they heard the king, they departed. And behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was.
When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
They came to the house and saw the child with Mary his mother. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Then, having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they withdrew to their own country by another road. Escape to Egypt
Arise, take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.
He rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed for Egypt.
There was until the death of Herod, to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son."
Then when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he became very angry. So he sent and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its environs, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men.
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping. Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are no more. Return to Nazareth.
When Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,
"He said, 'Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead.'"
He rose, took the child and his mother, and came to the land of Israel.
And when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee.
He went and lived in a town called Nazareth, so that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled: "He shall be called a Nazarene."

In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has drawn near.
"This is the one who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah: 'A voice of one calling in the wilderness, "Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him."' "
John had his clothes made of camel's hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. His diet consisted of locusts and wild honey.
Then those from Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan, went out to him.
They were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
When many Pharisees and Sadducees came to be baptized by him, he said to them, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Repent, and produce fruit that befits repentance.
# Matthew 3:9 Do not presume to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father'; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
Now the axe is laid to the root of the trees; therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He who has the shovel in his hand will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with fire that is not quenched." The Baptism of Jesus Christ
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
John stopped him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me!"
Jesus answered and said to him, "Permit it now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed him.
When Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus faces the temptation.
And Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
After fasting for forty days and forty nights, he finally grew hungry.
"Then the tempter came to him and said, 'If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.'"
He answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"
Then Satan took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
He said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you, and on their hands they will bear you up, lest perhaps you strike your foot against a stone.'"
Jesus said to him, "It is also written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
Then the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in all their glory.
"He said to him, 'I will give all these things to you if you will bow down and worship me.'"
Then Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! for it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'
Then Satan left him, and behold, angels came and were ministering to him. The beginning of his ministry in Galilee.
When Jesus heard that John had been handed over, he withdrew to Galilee.
He left Nazareth and went to live in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
"In order that what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:"
# The Land of Zebulun and Naphtali The land of Zebulun and Naphtali, the region along the sea, beyond the Jordan River, Galilee of the nations.
The people sitting in darkness have seen a great light, and for those sitting in the land and shadow of death, a light has dawned."
From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." The calling of the first disciples.
As Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
He said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
They immediately left the window and followed him.
Then he went on from there and saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And he called them.
At once they left the boat and their father and followed him. Jesus taught and healed the sick.
Jesus was going throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
So his fame spread throughout Syria, and they brought to him all who were sick with various diseases and afflictions, those possessing demons, epileptics, and paralytics, and he healed them.
A great multitude followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.

Phillips, Bartholomew. Thomas, Matthew the Tax Collector. James son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, surnamed Thaddaeus.
Simon the Cananite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: "Do not go to the Gentiles, and do not enter any city of the Samaritans.
Go instead to the lost sheep of Israel.
As you go, preach this message: 'The kingdom of heaven is near.'
Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you received, freely give.
Do not acquire gold or silver or copper in your regions.
No food for the journey, no extra clothes, no shoes, and no staff, for the worker deserves his food.
"Whatever city or village you enter, inquire who is worthy in it, and stay there until you depart."
When you enter the house, greet it.
If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.
"If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your message, leave that home or town and shake the dust from your feet."
I tell you the truth, it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that city.
Here I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.
Beware of people, for they will deliver you to councils, and you will be flogged in their synagogues.
# Mark 13:9 You will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them and to the nations.
When they deliver you up, do not be anxious how or what to say; for it will be given you in that hour what you are to say.
Because it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.
And the brother will deliver up his brother to death, and the father his child, and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.
# Matthew 10:22 You will be hated by everyone because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.
When they persecute you in this city, flee to another. For truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.
The apprentice is not better than the master, nor is the servant better than his lord.
It is enough for the disciple to be as his teacher, and the servant as his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of his household!
Fear them not. For there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, and hidden that shall not be known.
What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops.
Fear not those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.
Therefore, even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
Fear not! You are better than many sparrows!
"For whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge them before my Father in heaven;"
But whoever denies me before others, I will also deny before my Father in heaven.
"Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword."
I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
The enemies of man are his own household.
Whoever loves a father or a mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves a son or a daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
He who loses his life for my sake will find it.
He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.
Whoever accepts a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive the reward of a prophet, and whoever accepts a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive the reward of a righteous person.
"Truly I tell you, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to the Messiah will certainly not lose their reward."
John the Baptist, not Jesus.
When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their towns. Jesus and John the Baptist.
John, when he heard in prison about the works of Christ, sent two of his disciples,
He said to him, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?"
Jesus answered and said unto them, "Go and show John again what you hear and see:"
The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
Blessed is he who does not stumble.
And Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Behold, those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in kings' courts.
What did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way before you.
Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
"From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force."
For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
If you are willing to accept it, this is Elijah who is meant to come.
Let him who has ears to hear, hear.
"And to what can I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call out to their playmates"
They say: We played music for you, but you didn't dance! We mourned for you, but you didn't beat your chest!
# Came John, neither eating nor drinking, and they say: He has a demon.
# Son of Man, Eater and Drinker The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, "Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!" But wisdom is justified by her children." Woe to the cities that did not repent!
Then he began to rebuke the towns where most of his mighty works had been done, because they had not reformed.
Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
# The Parable of the Rejected Stone But I tell you, it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will go down to Hades. For if the deeds done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you." Comfort for the weary.
At that time, Jesus answered and said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in Your sight.
All things have been delivered to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, nor does anyone know the Father except the Son and he to whom the Son wills to reveal him.
Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
Bear my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
"For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
Lord of the Sabbath
At that time, Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.
The Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, "Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
He said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those with him?"
How did he enter the house of God and eat the bread of the offering, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those with him, but only for the priests?
Have you not read in the Torah how the priests on the Sabbath profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?
But I say to you, something greater than the temple is here!
If you knew what it means: I desire mercy, not sacrifice, you would not judge the innocent!
The Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.
Then he left from there and came to their synagogue.
If a man had a withered hand, they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" so that they might accuse him.
"And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?"
Man, how much better he is than the sheep! If only he would do good in the right place!
Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and it became restored, as whole as the other. Thus God's chosen one was proven.
When the Pharisees went out, they conspired against him to put him to death.
Jesus departed from there, and great crowds followed him, and he cured them all.
Let them know not to reveal it.
"In order that what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:"
Behold my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit upon him, he will bring forth justice to the nations.
He does not argue nor shout, and no one hears his voice in the streets.
A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till he brings justice through to victory.
"And in his name shall the Gentiles trust." Jesus and Beelzebul
Then a mad blind and dumb man was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb man spoke and saw.
Every crowd was amazed, and they said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
The Pharisees, when they heard this, said, "This man drives out demons only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil casts out the devil, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
If I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges!
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Who then is the one who conquers the world but he who is born of God?
He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.
Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this world or in the next.
Make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for by its fruit the tree is known.
Ye serpents, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart.
But I say to you that for every idle word that people speak, they will be held accountable on the day of judgment.
"For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned." - Jonah
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
"The people answered and said to him, 'We want to see a sign from you. But no sign will be given to this generation except the sign of Jonah the prophet.' "
Because as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
The men of Nineveh will rise in judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here!
The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here!
If the unclean spirit leaves a person and wanders through arid places seeking rest but does not find it,
He then says: "I will return to my house from which I left." So he comes back and finds it empty, swept, and decorated.
Then the evil spirit goes out of the man, takes with him seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they go in and live there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So shall it also be with this evil generation." The work of God's will.
While he was speaking to the crowds, suddenly his mother and brothers were standing outside, asking to speak to him.
"Then someone said to him, 'Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak with you.' "
And he answered and said unto him, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"
"Then he stretched out his hand toward his disciples and said: 'Here are my mother and my brothers.'"
"For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
Sow like a farmer and interpret it.
On that day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.
A large crowd gathered around him, so he got into a boat and sat down, and the whole crowd stood on the shore.
"And he spoke many parables to them, saying: 'A farmer went out to sow'."
And as he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them.
And another fell on the rocky places, where it did not have much soil, and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of soil.
And when the sun rose, it withered away; for it had no root.
And another fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it.
The good soil is where some seeds fell, and they produced a crop—a hundred, sixty, thirty times what was sown.
"He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
The disciples came to him and asked, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
"He answered and said to them, 'Because it has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.'"
For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what they have will be taken away.
In order to fulfill this, I speak to them in parables; for they see and do not perceive, and hear and do not understand.
"The prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled in them, which says: 'Hearing you will hear and not understand, and seeing you will see and not perceive.' "
# Revelation 17:17 For indeed, the hearts of this people have grown tough, and their ears are heavy of hearing. And their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn, and I would heal them.
Blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
Truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people desired to see what you see, but did not see it, and to hear what you hear, but did not hear it.
Listen, then, like the sower.
He that heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart: this is he which received seed by the way side.
The one who receives the seed on rocky ground is the person who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy,
But it has no root in itself, but endures for a while. Afterward, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately it falls away.
The seed that falls on rocky ground refers to those who hear the word and receive it with joy. But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. The seed that falls among the thorns refers to others who hear the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful.
The one sown on the good soil is the person who hears the word and understands it; he indeed bears fruit and produces, this one hundred, that sixty, and another thirty." Like wheat and weed.
"The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field."
While people were asleep, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and then left.
When the plants sprouted and formed heads, then the darnel also appeared.
The servants of the master of the house came and said to him, "Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where did the weeds come from?"
"The master replied, 'An enemy has done this.' The servants asked, 'Do you want us to go and gather it?'"
He said, "No! lest you uproot the wheat with the weeds while you gather them."
Let both of them grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, "Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn." What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to? It is like a mustard seed that, when sown upon the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth; yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs, and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade. It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.
The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field.
She is the smallest of all seeds. But when it grows, it is the largest of herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches."
"The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until all of it was leavened."
This is what Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable.
# To fulfill what was spoken by the Prophet who said: "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world." # # Interpretation of the Parable of Wheat and Tares #
Then Jesus sent the crowds away and went into the house. When his disciples came to him, they said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
The sower of the good seed is the Son of Man.
The field is the world. The good seed is the sons of the kingdom. And the weeds are the sons of the evil one.
The enemy he has sown is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world. And the reapers are the angels.
Just as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so will it be at the end of the age.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers.
They cast them into the fire of Hell. There will be lamenting and gnashing of teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let anyone with ears listen! Parables of the treasure, the pearl, and the net.
Also, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
The kingdom of heaven is also like a merchant in search of fine pearls,
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it."
The kingdom of heaven is also like a net that was cast into the sea and gathered fish of every kind.
When they had emptied it, they pulled the boat up onto the shore, sat down, and gathered the good fish into containers, but the bad fish they threw away.
Thus shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth and separate the wicked from among the righteous,
They will cast them into the fiery furnace. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Jesus said to them, "Do you understand all these things?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord."
"Therefore, every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household, who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old."
When Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there. Nazareth rejects Jesus.
When he came to his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?"
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
"Are not all his sisters with us? Then where has this man gotten all this?"
They took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, "Only in his hometown, among his relatives and in his own household, is a prophet without honor."
They did not make many troops there because of their lack of faith.
John the Baptist was beheaded.
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,
"He said to his servants, 'It is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and therefore these miraculous powers are at work in him.'"
Herod had seized John, bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother.
"For John was saying to him, 'It is not lawful for you to have her.'"
When he wanted to kill him, he feared the people, for they regarded him as a prophet.
At Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced in the middle and pleased Herod.
I then promised with an oath that I would give her whatever she asked for.
"She, having been taught by her mother, said, 'Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.'"
The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths and the guests reclining with him, he ordered that it be granted.
He sent and had John's head cut off in prison.
He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the boys, who brought it to their mother.
His disciples came and lifted the body and buried it. Then they came and told Jesus. Feeding the five thousand men.
When Jesus heard this, he departed by boat to a lonely place by himself. The crowds heard about it and followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus went ashore he saw a large crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
When evening came, the disciples approached Jesus and said, "This is a remote place and it's getting late. Send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus said to them, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
They said to him, "All we have here are five loaves and two fish."
He said, "Bring her to me here."
So he ordered the crowd to sit down on the grass. And taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, and blessed and broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
And they all ate and were satisfied. Then they picked up the fragments that were left over, twelve baskets full.
The eaters were about five thousand men, not counting the women and children. The miracle of walking on water.
At once Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd.
And after dismissing the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had come, he was there alone.
The ship was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was against them.
In the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went to them, walking on the lake.
When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. "It's a ghost!" they said, and cried out in fear.
"At once Jesus said to them: 'Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.'"
"Peter answered him and said, 'Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.'"
He said, "Come." So Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus.
When he saw that the wind was strong, he was afraid. And beginning to be in fear, he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”
Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
When they entered the ship, the wind became calm.
"And those who were in the ship came and worshiped him, saying, 'Of a truth thou art the Son of God!'"
When they had crossed over, they came to the land of the Gerasenes.
The men of that place recognized him. So they sent out to all that region and brought to him all who were sick.
They begged him that they might only touch the tassel of his garment; and as many as touched it were made whole.
# The Pure and the Impure
Then the scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying:
"Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread."
"Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?"
For God commanded, saying, Honor your father and your mother; and, He that curses father or mother, let him die the death.
"And you say, 'If anyone says to his father or mother, "Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift devoted to God," then he need show no more respect to his father or his mother.'
You nullify the word of God by your tradition!
Ye hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying:
This people draws near to me with their mouth, and honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
They worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men."
He then called to the crowd, "Listen and understand."
That which enters the mouth does not defile a man, but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles a man.
Then his disciples came and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees, when they heard this saying, were offended?"
He answered and said, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up."
Leave them be. They are blind leaders of the blind. If a blind person leads a blind person, they will both fall into a pit.
Then Peter said to him, "Explain this parable to us."
Jesus said, "Are you still without understanding?"
Do you not understand yet that everything that enters the mouth goes into the belly and is expelled?
For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:
Because out of the heart come evil thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, and slander.
"It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles." The faith of the Canaanite woman.
Jesus then departed from there and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
"A Canaanite woman from that region came out and started shouting, 'Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is suffering terribly from demon-possession.'"
He answered not a word. And his disciples came and urged him, saying, "Send her away, for she keeps shouting after us."
He answered and said, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
She came and bowed down to him, saying, "Master, help me!"
She answered and said, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
"Yes, sir! Even the dogs eat from the crumbs that fall from their masters' table!"
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that hour. The feeding of the four thousand.
Jesus then moved on from there and came to the shores of the Sea of Galilee. He went up into the hills and sat down.
Many people brought to him the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and they put them at his feet; and he cured them.
And the crowds were amazed, seeing the mute speaking, the lame walking, the cripples healed, and the blind seeing. They glorified the God of Israel.
Jesus called his disciples and said, "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat. And I am unwilling to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."
His disciples said to him, "Where could we get enough bread in this desolate place to feed these people?"
Jesus asked them, "How many loaves do you have?" They answered, "Seven, and a few small fish."
Then he ordered the crowds to recline on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to his disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowd.
Then they all ate and were satisfied. And the disciples picked up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.
The eaters were four thousand men, not counting the women and children.
Then he dismissed the crowds and went on board the boat, and made his way back to Magdala.
# Request for a Verse
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to him and, to test him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
"And he said to them, 'If in the evening you say, "It will be fair weather, for the sky is red."
In the morning: Today is winter because the sky is red with gloom. Hypocrites! You know how to discern the face of the sky, but the signs of the times you cannot discern!
A wicked and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah." Then he left them and departed. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
When his disciples came to the other side, they forgot to take bread.
Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
"And they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'We have no bread.'"
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said, "Why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread? Do you still not understand or remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? Are your hearts hardened?"
Do you not even now understand? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
There were seven loaves for the four thousand. How many baskets did you take?
"How can you not understand that I was not talking about bread? I told you to beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
Then they understood that he did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. Peter's confession of Christ
When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They said, "Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"He said to them, 'But who do you say that I am?'"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!"
"Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven."
I say to you: you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it.
"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
At that time, he instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus foretold his death and resurrection.
From that time on Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.
Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord! This shall never happen to you!"
"But he turned and said to Peter, 'Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.'"
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me."
If anyone wants to save their life, they will lose it; but if anyone gives up their life for me, they will find it.
For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
The Son of Man will come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will repay everyone according to his deeds.
Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
Revelation
And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
His appearance was changed in their presence, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.
"Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with him."
"Then Peter said to Jesus, 'Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, let us make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.'"
As he was speaking, suddenly a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son; listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were filled with awe.
Jesus came and touched them, saying, "Get up, and do not be afraid."
They lifted up their eyes, and saw no man save Jesus only.
As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
"His disciples asked him, saying, 'Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?'"
"Jesus replied, saying to them, 'Elijah does come first and will restore all things.'"
But I tell you, Elijah has indeed come, and they did to him whatever they wished, just as it is written of him. So also the Son of Man will surely suffer at their hands.
Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptist. The healing of the boy with the demon.
When they came to the assembly, a man approached him, kneeling before him.
"Sir, have mercy on my son; he is an epileptic and suffers severely. He often falls into fire and water."
"And I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him."
Jesus replied, "O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to me!"
Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and it came out of him, and the boy was cured at that very hour.
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked, "Why could we not cast it out?"
Jesus said to them, "Because of your little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
"This kind can only be cast out by prayer and fasting."
"While he was in Galilee, Jesus told them, 'The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men'"
They will kill him, and after three days he will rise." So they were very sad. Temple tax
When they arrived in Capernaum, those who collected the two-drachma tax approached Peter and said, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
He said, "Yes." And as they entered the house, Jesus spoke first, asking, "Simon, what do you think? From whom do the kings of the earth collect duty or tribute—from their own children or from others?"
Peter said to him, "Then the sons shall be free." Jesus replied, "You shall be free indeed."
Go to the lake and cast your net, and take the first fish that comes up; and when you open its mouth, you will find a shekel. Take that and give it to them for me and for yourself.
