# How Japanese Parents Raise Their Children? Are They Strict? Japanese parents have a unique approach to parenting, which differs significantly from Western parenting styles. They prioritize discipline, respect, and a strong sense of responsibility in their children's upbringing. Here's an insight into their parenting philosophy: Japanese parents believe in setting clear boundaries and expectations for their children. They establish rules and guidelines early on and expect their children to follow them consistently. This approach fosters a sense of discipline and self-control in the children. While Japanese parents are known for their strictness, it is not solely about imposing rules. They aim to teach their children the importance of self-discipline and self-regulation. By setting high standards and expecting their children to meet those standards, they encourage a sense of responsibility and independence. One key aspect of Japanese parenting is the emphasis on respect and manners. Children are taught to show respect to elders, teachers, and peers. They learn to greet others politely, use appropriate language, and exhibit good manners in various social situations. This focus on respect extends to all aspects of life, including family relationships and community interactions. Japanese parents also prioritize education and academic excellence. They encourage their children to work hard, study diligently, and strive for academic success. This emphasis on education is often accompanied by a strong support system, with parents actively involved in their children's learning journey. In terms of discipline, Japanese parents may employ various strategies. They might use gentle guidance and positive reinforcement to encourage desired behaviors. However, when necessary, they can be firm and enforce consequences for misbehavior. The goal is to teach children the importance of accountability and to help them understand the impact of their actions. Overall, Japanese parenting emphasizes a balanced approach, combining discipline with love and support. While they may appear strict to outsiders, their ultimate goal is to raise well-mannered, responsible, and independent individuals who can contribute positively to society.

# **The Egyptian Revolution of 1919** The Egyptian Revolution of 1919 was a pivotal moment in the country's history, marking a significant turning point in the struggle for independence and self-determination. The revolution, which lasted from March 1919 to January 1922, was a powerful display of national unity and resistance against British colonial rule. **The Spark of Revolution:** The revolution was ignited by the exile of the charismatic leader, Saad Zaghloul, and his colleagues by the British authorities. Zaghloul, a prominent politician and advocate for Egyptian independence, had demanded the right to represent Egypt in negotiations with the British. However, the British government refused, leading to widespread protests and a call for national unity. **Nationwide Protests and Resistance:** The country erupted in a wave of demonstrations and strikes. Egyptians from all walks of life, including students, workers, and peasants, took to the streets, demanding an end to British occupation and the establishment of a truly independent Egyptian government. The protests were characterized by their peaceful nature, with participants carrying flags and chanting slogans for freedom and self-rule. **Impact and Legacy:** The Egyptian Revolution of 1919 had a profound impact on the course of Egyptian history. It led to the eventual recognition of Egypt's independence by the British in 1922, although the country remained under British influence. The revolution also inspired a sense of national pride and unity, fostering a strong desire for self-governance and cultural preservation. **_The italicized part refers to the changes that took place in the 1990s._** The 1990s brought about significant transformations in Egypt's political landscape. The country witnessed the rise of a new generation of leaders and the implementation of economic reforms. President Hosni Mubarak, who assumed power in 1981, continued to rule until 2011, marking a prolonged period of stability but also raising concerns about political stagnation. During this time, Egypt experienced economic growth and modernization efforts. However, the gap between the rich and poor widened, and political freedoms remained restricted. The 1990s also saw the emergence of Islamic political movements, adding a new dimension to Egypt's political discourse.
