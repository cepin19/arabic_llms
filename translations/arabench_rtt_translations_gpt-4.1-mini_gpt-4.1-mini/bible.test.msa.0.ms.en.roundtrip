Who is the most important person in the kingdom?
At that time the disciples came to Jesus. They asked him, "Who is the greatest person in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus called a little child to Him. He made the child stand among them.
Jesus said: "What I am about to tell you is true. You must change and become like little children. If you do not do this, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
Whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me.
And if anyone causes one of the little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
How terrible it will be for the world because of the things that lead people to sin! Such things must come. But how terrible it is for those who cause them!
If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or one foot than to enter hell with both hands and feet. In hell, the fire burns forever.
If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The Parable of the Lost Sheep
See that you do not despise one of these little ones. This is what I tell you. Their angels in heaven can go at any time to see my Father who is in heaven.
<.>
What do you think? Suppose a man has 100 sheep and one of them gets lost. Would he leave the 99 sheep on the hills? Would he not go and search for the one that got lost?
What I am going to tell you is true. If that sheep is found, he will be happier with it than with the ninety-nine who did not go astray.
The same goes for your Father in heaven. He does not want any of these little ones to perish. When someone wrongs you
If your brother wrongs you, go to him. Tell him what he did wrong. Keep the matter between you. If he listens to you, you have won him back.
But what if he does not listen to you? Take one or two others with you. The Scriptures say: "A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he also refuses to listen to the witnesses? Then tell it to the church. And what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Do not treat him as your brother. Treat him as you would a wicked person or a tax collector.
What I will tell you is the truth. What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. What you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Again, I tell you, if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.
"Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them." The servant who had no mercy
Peter came to Jesus and asked him, "Lord, how many times should I forgive my brother if he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to collect all the money that his servants owed him.
When the king began that, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought to him.
The man could not pay. An order came from his master. The man, his wife, his children, and everything he owned had to be sold to settle his debt.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I will pay everything."
His lady felt sorry for him. She forgave him for what he owed and released him.
But then that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He grabbed him and began to choke him. He said to him: "Pay me what you owe!"
The other servant fell to his knees. "Give me time," he begged him. "I will pay you back."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison. And the man would remain there until he could repay what he owed.
The other servants saw what happened. It upset them a lot. So they went and told their master everything that had happened.
Then the first servant was called. He said to him: "O servant of evil, I have forgiven you all that you owed because you pleaded with me.
Shouldn't you have shown mercy to the other servant just as I showed mercy to you?
In his anger, his master handed him over to the jailers. He was to be punished until he paid off all his debts.
This is how your Father in heaven will treat each of you if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.
Jesus teaches about divorce
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee. He went to the region of Judea on the other side of the Jordan River.
He was followed by large crowds. They healed him there.
Some Pharisees came to test him. They asked him, "Does the law allow a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that at the beginning he created them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said: "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two, but one. What God has joined together, let no man separate.
They asked: "So why did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because you were stubborn. But it was not this way from the beginning.
Here is what I tell you. Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man is not allowed to divorce his wife unless she is unfaithful to him.
The disciples said to him, "If it is like this between husband and wife, it is better not to marry."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who have been helped to live without marriage can accept it.
Some men are unable to have children because they were born that way. Some were made that way by other people. And others made themselves that way to serve the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept living this way should do so." Little children are brought to Jesus
Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted Him to lay His hands on the children and pray for them. But the disciples asked the people to stop.
Jesus said: "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them. The kingdom of heaven belongs to those who are like them."
Jesus placed his hands on them. Then he went from there. Jesus and the rich young man
A man came to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?"
Jesus said: "Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, obey the commandments."
"Which one?" the man asked. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
"Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
The young man said: "I have obeyed all those commandments, what must I do next?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all you have. Give the money to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
When the young man heard this, he left sadly. He was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples: "What I am about to tell you is true. It is difficult for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.
I tell you again, it is hard for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. But it is harder for the rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were truly amazed. They asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered him, "We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?"
Jesus said to them: "What I am about to tell you is true, when all things are made new, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones. You will judge the twelve tribes of Israel.
Everyone who has left homes, families, or fields for my sake will receive a hundredfold. They will also inherit eternal life.
But many of the first will be last. And many of the last will be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who owned a vineyard. He went out early in the morning to hire workers to work in his vineyard.
He agreed to give them the usual wage for a day's work. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
Around nine in the morning, he went out again. He saw others standing in the market doing nothing.
He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard. I will give you what is right."
So they went. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock and did the same thing.
Around five o'clock, he went out and found others still standing around him. He asked them, "Why do you stand here all day without doing anything?"
"Because no one hired us," they answered. He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard."
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard spoke to the foreman. He said, "Call the workers and give them their wages. Start with the last ones you hired, then move on to the first ones you hired."
The workers who were hired arrived around five o'clock. Each of them received the usual daily wage.
So when those who were hired first came, they thought they would receive more, but each of them also received the wage for the day.
When they received it, they started complaining about the owner.
They said: "These people who were recently hired worked only one hour. They were paid the same as we were. We did most of the work and were under the scorching sun all day."
The owner answered one of them: "My friend," he said, "I am dealing with you fairly. Did you not agree to work for the usual day's wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to give those I hired last the same pay I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel deceived because I have generously given to others?
So those who are last will be first, and those who are first will be last. Jesus once again speaks about his upcoming death.
Jesus was heading to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to talk with them.
He said: "We are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death.
Then they will hand him over to people who are not Jews. They will mock him and flog him. They will crucify him. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" Or ask a favor from Jesus
The mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus. Her sons came with her. She knelt down and asked him for a favor.
Jesus said: "What do you want?" She said: "Promise me that one of my two sons will sit at your right hand in your kingdom." And he promised that the other would sit at your left.
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup I am going to drink?" They said to him, "We can."
Jesus said to them, "You will certainly drink from my cup. But it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or my left. These places are reserved for those whom my Father has prepared for me."
The other ten students heard about this. They were angry with the two brothers.
Jesus gathered them together. He said, "You know about the rulers of the nations. They hold power over their people. Their high officials command them to move about.
Do not be like this. But whoever wants to be important among you, let him be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first must be your servant.
Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give His life as a ransom for many. Two blind men regain their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho. A large crowd followed them.
Two blind men were sitting by the side of the road. They heard that Jesus was passing by. So they shouted, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stopped and called out to them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
They said: "O Lord, we want to be able to see."
Jesus felt deep concern for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they were able to see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem
When they all approached Jerusalem, they reached Bethphage. It was on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two disciples.
He said to them: "Go to the village in front of you. As soon as you reach it, you will find a donkey tied up. And its colt with it. So untie them and bring them to me.
If someone tells you something, say that the Lord needs them. The owner will send them immediately.
This happened so that what was said on the Prophet's tongue would be fulfilled. He says,
Say to the city of Zion: "Behold, your king is coming to you, righteous and having salvation, humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus commanded them.
They brought the donkey and the colt. They placed their coats on them. Then Jesus sat on the coats.
Very large crowds spread out and placed their coats on the road. Others cut branches from trees and placed them on the road.
Some people went ahead of him, and others followed them. Everyone shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was swept away. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleanses the temple
Jesus entered the temple area. He began driving out everyone who was buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of those who were exchanging money. He also overturned the benches of those who were selling doves.
He said to them: "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you have made it 'a den of robbers.' " (Jeremiah 7:11)
The blind and the disabled came to Jesus in the temple. There He healed them.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful works he did. They also saw the children in the temple area shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they became angry.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked Jesus. "Yes," Jesus answered. "Have you not read about it in the Scriptures? It says, 'You have established praise from the mouths of children and infants.'" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus left the people and went out of the city to Bethany. He spent the night there. The fig tree withered.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree on the road. He approached it but found nothing on it except the leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" Immediately, the tree withered.
When the disciples saw that, they were amazed. They said, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"
Jesus answered, "What I am about to tell you is true. You must believe and not doubt. Then you can do what was done to the fig tree. And you can say to this mountain, 'Go and throw yourself into the sea.' And it will be done.
"If you believe, you will receive what you ask for when you pray." The authority of Jesus is questioned
Jesus entered the temple courtyard. While he was teaching there, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. They asked him, "By what authority are you doing these things?" "And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will ask you one question as well. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
Where did the baptism of John come from? Was it from heaven? Or did it come from people?" They were discussing this among themselves. They said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' they will ask us, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"
But what if we said, "from the men"? We are afraid of people. Everyone thinks that John was a prophet.
They answered Jesus, "We do not know." Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." The Parable of the Two Sons
What do you think of this? A man had two sons. He went to the first son and said, "My son, go and work in the vineyard today."
"I won't," the son replied. But he changed his mind later and went.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing to him. The son replied, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live. But you did not believe him. Yet the tax collectors and prostitutes believed. You have seen this. But even then you did not turn away from your sins nor believe in him. The Parable of the Tenants
Listen to another story. A man owned some land and planted a vineyard. He put a fence around it. He dug a pit for a winepress in it. He also built a watchtower. He rented the vineyard to some farmers. Then he went on a journey.
When the time for harvest approached, he sent his servants to the tenants. He told the servants to collect his share of the fruits.
But the tenants seized his servant. They beat one of them. They killed another. They pelted the third with stones to kill him.
Then the man sent other servants to the tenants. He sent more than he did the first time. The tenants treated them the same way.
And finally, he sent them his son. He said, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the one who will inherit all the owner's property one day. Come on, let's kill him. Then everything will be ours."
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard. Then they killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to these tenants?
They said: "These wicked people will destroy." Then the vineyard will be leased to other tenants. They will give him his share of the crop at harvest.
Jesus said to them: "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
Behold, I tell you this. The kingdom of God will be taken away from you. And it will be given to people who bear its fruits.
Anyone who collides with that stone will be shattered to pieces. But the stone will crush anyone who falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard the stories of Jesus. They knew that he was talking about them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him. But they were afraid of the crowd. People believed that Jesus was a prophet.
The Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus told them more stories. He said,
This is what the kingdom of heaven is like. A king prepared a wedding feast for his son.
He sent a servant to those who were invited to the dinner. The servant told them to come. But they refused.
Then he sent other servants and said, "Tell those invited, 'I have prepared my dinner. I have slaughtered my bulls and fattened my cattle. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.'"
But the people did not pay attention. One went to his field. And another went to his work.
The others seized the servant. They treated him harshly and then killed him.
The king became very angry. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those killers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants: "The wedding feast is ready. But those whom I invited were not worthy to attend.
Go to the street corners. Invite to dinner everyone you can find.
So the servants went out into the streets. They gathered all the people they could find, whether they were good or bad. And soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
King Lear entered to see the guests. He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
He said to him: "My friend, how did you enter here without wedding clothes?" The man could not find what to say.
Then the king said to his servants: "Bind his hands and feet. Throw him out into the darkness. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They made plans to trap Jesus with his words.
They sent their followers to him. They sent the Herodians with them. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are a man of honor. You truly know the way of God. Do not let others tell you what to do or say. Do not care about how important they are.
So tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
But Jesus knew their evil plans. He said, "O hypocrites! Why do you try to trap me?"
"Show me the coin that people use to pay the tax." They brought him a silver coin.
He asked them, "A picture of this? And words of this?"
They said to him: "Caesar." Then he said to them: "Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give to God what belongs to God."
When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away. Marriage when the dead rise
On that same day the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people rise from the dead.
They said: "O teacher, this is what Moses told us. If a man dies and has no children, his brother must marry the widow. He must have children to carry on his brother's name."
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second and third brothers. This continued up to the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
So when the dead rise, whose wife will she be? For all of them were married to her.
Jesus answered, "You are mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures. Nor do you know the power of God.
When the dead rise, they will not marry. Nor will their fathers give them in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
What about the resurrection of the dead? Have you not read what God has said to you?
He said: "I am the God of Abraham. I am the God of Isaac. And I am the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead. He is the God of the living.
When the crowd heard this, they were amazed at his knowledge. The most important commandment
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not respond to Jesus. So the Pharisees gathered together.
There was a man who was an expert in the law. So Jesus tested him with a question.
He said to him: "Teacher, what is the most important commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Love him with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important commandment.
And the second is like it. "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"Everything written in the Law and the Prophets is based on these two commandments." Son of whom is the Messiah?
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he? They said to him: The son of David.
He said to them: "Then why does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet." (Psalm 110:1)
If David calls him "Lord," then how can he be the son of David?
No one was able to answer him with a single word. Since that day, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
He said: "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat."
You must obey them. Do everything they command you to do. But do not do what they do. For they do not practice what they preach.
They tie heavy loads and place them on the shoulders of others. But they themselves do not hesitate to lift a finger to move them.
All they do is to be seen by others. On their foreheads and arms, they wear small boxes containing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the tassels on their coats very long.
They like to sit in the place of honor at feasts. They also like to have the most important seats in Jewish temples.
They like to be welcomed in the markets. They like it when people call them "my lord."
But you should not be called "Rabbi." You have one Master, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth "father." You have one Father, who is in heaven.
You should not be called "teacher." You have one teacher, the Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
How terrible will be your fate, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. You yourselves do not enter it, nor do you allow those who are trying to enter to go in.
<.>
You brood of vipers, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.
O blind guides, how terrible you are! You say, "Whoever swears by the temple is bound by nothing, but whoever swears by the gold of the temple must keep their oath."
You are blind and foolish! Which is more important? Is it the gold? Or is it the temple that makes the gold sacred?
And it also says: "If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing. But whoever swears by the gift on it must keep the oath."
O blind ones! Which is more important? Is it the giving? Or the altar that sanctifies the giving?
So whoever swears by the name of the altar swears by its name and by all that is on it.
And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the sky, then indeed he swears by the Throne of Allah and by the One who sits upon it.
You brood of vipers, you teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You give God a tenth of your spices, like mint, dill, and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should have practiced
O blind guides! You remove the smallest insect from your food. But you swallow a whole camel!
You brood of vipers, you teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed. You only want to please yourselves.
O blind Persian! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate. Then the outside will be clean as well.
You brood of vipers, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs. They look beautiful on the outside. But inside they are full of the bones of the dead. And they are also full of things that are not pure and clean.
The same goes for you. On the outside, you seem to be doing the right thing. But inside, you are full of what is wrong. You pretend to be what you are not.
You brood of vipers, you teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets. You decorate the tombs of the righteous.
And you say, "If we had been in the days of those before us, we would not have killed the prophets nor would we have been among the wrongdoers."
You bear witness against yourselves. You acknowledge that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
So they completed the sins that those before you had begun!
O nests of venomous snakes! How will you escape being condemned to hell?
Behold, I am sending to you prophets, wise men, and teachers. You will kill some of them. You will crucify some of them. And you will flog others in your synagogues. And you will persecute them from city to city.
So you will surely pay the blood of all the righteous men whose blood was shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
What I am going to tell you is the truth. All of this will happen to those who are living now.
O Jerusalem! O Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you. How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings. But you would not allow me!
Look, your house was left empty.
I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." (Psalm 118:26)
End marks
Jesus left the temple. He was walking away when his disciples approached him. They wanted to draw his attention to the temple buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" Jesus asked. "What I am about to tell you is true. Not one stone here will be left on another; every stone will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There the disciples came to him privately. They said to him, "Tell us, when will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Watch out! Be careful that no one deceives you.
Many will come in my name. They will claim, "I am the Christ!" They will deceive many people.
You will hear about wars. You will also hear people talking about future wars. Do not worry. These things must happen. But the end has not come yet.
Nation will fight against nation. Kingdom will fight against kingdom. People will suffer from hunger. There will be earthquakes in many places.
All of these are the beginning of labor pains.
Then they will hand you over to be ill-treated and killed. All the nations will hate you because of me.
At that time, many will turn away from their faith. They will hate one another. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will appear. They will deceive many people.
Because wickedness will increase, the love of most people will grow cold.
But whoever endures until the end will be saved.
This good news about the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world. It will be a testimony to all nations. Then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of "the abomination that causes desolation." (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof should go down to their house to get something.
No one in the field should return to get their coat.
How terrible it will be in those days for pregnant women! How terrible it will be for nursing mothers!
I pray that you never have to flee in winter or on a Saturday.
There will be terrible suffering in those days. It will be worse than anything else since the beginning of the world until now. And there will never be anything like it again.
If the time were not shortened, no one would live. But because of God's chosen people, it will be shortened.
At that time someone may say to you, "Look! Here is the Christ!" or "There he is!" Do not believe it.
False Christians and false prophets will appear. They will perform great signs and wonders. They will try to deceive the chosen people of God if possible.
Look, I told you before.
If someone says to you: "He is in the wilderness," do not go out. And if someone says: "He is in the deep house," do not believe it.
The lightning that comes from the east can be seen in the west. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
Vultures gather wherever there is a dead carcass.
After the terrible suffering in those very days, "The sun will be darkened. The moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky. The heavenly bodies will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the nations on earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky. He will come with great power and glory.
He will send his angels with a loud trumpet blast. They will gather his chosen people from all four directions. They will bring them from the farthest heavens to the farthest.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. As soon as its branches become tender and its leaves come out, know that summer is near.
In the same way, when you see all those things happening, know that the end is near. It is at the doors.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. The people who were living at that time would certainly not die until all those things happened.
The heavens and the earth will pass away. But my words will never pass away. The day and the hour are unknown.
No one knows about that day or hour. Not even the angels in heaven know. The Son does not know. Only the Father knows.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were getting married. They were marrying off their daughters. They were doing all those things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They had no knowledge of what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. So it will be when the Son of Man comes.
Two men will be in the field. One will be taken and the other left.
Two women will grind using a hand mill. One will be taken and the other left.
So wake up; indeed, you do not know what day your Lord will come.
You must understand one thing. Suppose the homeowner knew at what time during the night the thief would come. Then he would have stayed awake. He would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
So you too must be ready. For the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.
Suppose a master entrusted one of his slaves with managing the rest of the slaves in his house. The slave's job is to distribute their food to them at the right time. The master wants a trustworthy and wise slave for this task.
It would be good for the servant if he finds the lady doing her work when the master returns.
What I am going to tell you is true. The lady will make him responsible for everything she owns.
But suppose that servant is evil. Suppose he said to himself, "My master is away for a long time."
Assume that he starts beating the other servants. And assume that he eats and drinks with those who drink a lot.
The master of that servant will return on a day the servant does not expect. He will return at an hour the servant does not know.
Then the master will tear him into pieces. He will send him to the place where the protesters go. There, people will cry and grit their teeth.
The Story of the Ten and the Bride's Maids
This is what the kingdom of heaven will be like at that time. Ten bridesmaids took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. Five were wise.
The ignorant took their lamps but they did not take olive oil with them.
The wise men took the oil in jars along with their lamps.
The groom did not come for a long time. So all the bridesmaids got tired and fell asleep.
At midnight, someone shouted, "Here is the groom! Go out to welcome him!"
Then all the bridesmaids woke up and prepared their lamps.
The ignorant said to the wise: "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
"No," they answered. "There may not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves."
So they went to buy the oil. But while they were on their way, the bridegroom arrived. The bridesmaids who were ready with him entered the wedding feast. Then the door was shut.
Later, the other bridesmaids also came. They said, "Sir! Sir! Open the door for us!"
But he answered, "What I will tell you is the truth. I do not know you."
So be vigilant. You do not know the day or the hour when the bridegroom will come. The story of the three servants
Again, the kingdom of heaven will be like this. A man was going on a journey. He sent his servants and entrusted them with his possessions.
He gave ten thousand dollars to one person. And he gave four thousand dollars to another. And he gave two thousand dollars to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could manage. Then he set off on his journey.
The servant who received $10,000 immediately went and put his money to work. He earned another $10,000.
The person who got $4000 earned an additional $4000.
But the man who received two thousand dollars went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money in it.
After a long time, the master of these servants returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 brought the other $10,000. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I earned another $10,000."
His master answered him: "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's joy!"
The man who had $4000 also came. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $4000. Look, I have earned another $4000."
His master answered him, saying: "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a little; I will make you faithful with much. Come and share your master's joy!"
Then came the man who received two thousand dollars. He said, "Sir, I knew you were a harsh man. You reap where you did not sow. You gather the harvest where you did not plant the seeds.
So I was scared. I went out and buried your $2000 in the ground. Look, this is yours.
His master answered him, saying: "O wicked and lazy servant! Did you know that I harvest where I did not sow? Did you know that I gather crops where I did not plant seeds?"
Well, you should have deposited my money in the bank. When I return, I would have collected it with interest.
Then his master ordered the other servants, "Take 2000 dollars from him. Give it to the one who has 20,000 dollars."
Whoever has will be given more. He will have more than enough. And what about the one who does not have? Even what he has will be taken from him.
"Drive that worthless servant out. There in the darkness, people will weep and gnash their teeth." Sheep and Goats
The Son of Man will come in all His glory. All the angels will come with Him. Then He will sit on His throne in the glory of heaven.
All the nations will be gathered before Him. He will separate the people into two groups. He will be like a shepherd who separates the sheep from the goats.
He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the king speaks to those on his right. He says to them: "My Father has blessed me. Come and take what is yours. It is the kingdom that has been prepared for you since the creation of the world.
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in.
I needed clothes. And you gave them to me. I was sick. And you took care of me. I was in prison. And you visited me.
Then those who did good deeds will answer them, saying, "O Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You? And when did we see You thirsty and give You drink?
When did we see you a stranger and take you in? When did we see you in need of clothes and clothe you?
When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?
The king will answer, "What I will tell you is the truth. Whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me."
Then he will say to those on his left: "Cursed are you! Depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the disbelievers and their brothers among the devils."
I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not let me in. I needed clothes. But you did not give me any. I was sick and in prison. But you did not take care of me.
They will also answer, "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and not feed you? When did we see you a stranger or in need of clothes or sick or in prison and not help you?"
He will answer: "What I will tell you is the truth. Everything you did not do for one of these least important ones, you did not do for me."
Then they will go to be punished forever. As for those who did what is right, they will receive eternal life.
The plan to kill Jesus
Jesus finished saying all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be delivered to be crucified on the cross.
Then the chief priests gathered with the elders of the people. They met in the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest.
They made plans to arrest Jesus in a clever way. They wanted to kill him.
"But not during the holiday," they said. "It might cause trouble." A woman pours perfume on Jesus
Jesus was in Bethany. He was in the house of a man named Simon, who was suffering from a skin disease.
A woman came to Jesus with a special sealed jar containing very precious perfume. She poured the perfume on his head while he was sitting at the table.
When the students saw this, they became angry. They said, "Why this waste?"
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. And the money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus was aware of that. He said to them, "Why do you trouble this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me."
You will always have the poor with you. But you will not always have me.
I poured the perfume on my body to prepare for burial.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. What I have done will be told everywhere this good news is preached throughout the world. It will be told to commemorate her memory." Judas agrees to hand over Jesus
One of the twelve went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He asked, "What will you give me if I hand Jesus over to you?" So they counted out thirty pieces of silver for him.
Since then, Judas had been waiting for the right time to hand Jesus over to them. The Lord's Supper
It was the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus. They asked, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?"
He answered: "Go to the city to a certain man. Tell him: 'The teacher says: "My time has come. I will celebrate the Passover in your house with my disciples."' "
So the disciples did as Jesus commanded them. They prepared the Passover meal.
When evening came, Jesus was at the table with the twelve.
While they were eating, he said, "What I am about to tell you is the truth. One of you will hand me over to my enemies."
The students became very sad. One by one, they began to say to him: "Is it not I, Lord?"
Jesus answered, "The one who dips his hand into the dish with me is the one who will betray me.
The Son of Man will go as it is written about him. But how dreadful it will be for the one who betrays the Son of Man! It would have been better for him if he had never been born.
It was Judas who would betray him. He said, "Is it I, Rabbi?" Jesus answered, "Yes. It is you."
While they were eating, Jesus took the bread. He gave thanks and broke it. He gave it to his disciples and said, "Take this, eat it. This is my body."
Then he took the cup. He thanked and handed it to them. He said, "Drink from it all."
This is my blood of the new covenant. It is poured out to forgive the sins of many.
This is what I tell you. From now on, I will not drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my Father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus says that Peter will fail.
Jesus said to them, "This very night you will all fall away from me. It is written that the Lord said: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
"But after I rise from the dead, I will go before you to Galilee."
Peter answered, "Everyone else may leave because of you. But I never will."
Jesus said: "What I am about to tell you is true, it will happen tonight itself. Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
But Peter said, "I may have to die with you. But I will never say that I do not know you." And all the other disciples said the same. Jesus prays in Gethsemane
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane. He said to them, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
Peter took Zebedee's two sons with him. He began to feel sadness and distress.
Then he said to them: "My soul is very sorrowful. I feel that death is near me. Stay here. Keep watch with me."
He went a little further. Then he fell face down on the ground. He prayed, saying: "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup of suffering be taken from me. But let your will be done, not mine."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, "Could you not stay awake with me for one hour?"
Watch and pray. Then you will not fall into sin when you are tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Jesus went away again. He prayed, saying: "My Father, is it possible for this cup to be taken from me? But if I must drink it, let your will be done."
Then he returned. He found them asleep again. They could not keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. And for the third time, he prayed for the same thing.
Then he returned to the disciples. He said to them: "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look! The hour has come. The Son of Man is about to be handed over to sinners.
Get up! Come on! Here he is, the one who hands me over to them, coming!" Jesus is arrested
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the twelve. He was with a large crowd. They were carrying swords and clubs. The chief priests and elders of the people had sent them.
Judas, who was going to betray Jesus, had arranged a signal with them. He said, "The man I kiss is the one." "Seize him."
Then Judas went to Jesus immediately. He said, "Peace be with you, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "My friend, do what you came for." Then the men stepped forward. They grabbed Jesus and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword. He drew it and struck the servant of the high priest. He cut off the servant's ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place. Everyone who uses the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He would send an army of more than 70,000 angels immediately.
But how will the sacred books be fulfilled then? They say it must happen this way."
At that time Jesus spoke to the crowd. "Shall I lead a band of armed men against you?" He asked. "Should you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me? I sat every day in the temple courtyard teaching. And you did not arrest me.
But all this happened to fulfill the words of the prophets." Then all the disciples deserted him and fled. Jesus is taken to the Sanhedrin
Those who arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest. The teachers of the law and the elders were assembled there.
Not far away, Peter followed Jesus. He went straight to the high priest's courtyard. He entered and sat with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin were looking for something to use against Jesus. They wanted to have him executed.
But they found no evidence, even though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses came forward.
They said: "This man claimed: 'I am able to destroy the temple of God. And I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and asked Jesus, "Aren't you going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God to tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Yes. Just as you say," Jesus answered. "But I say to you all: In the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One. You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes. He said, "You have spoken a very evil word against God! Why do we need more witnesses? You have heard him say this evil word.
"What do you think?" "He must die!" they answered.
Then they spat in his face. They hit him with their fists. And others slapped him.
They said: "Prophesy for us, O Messiah! Who struck you?" Peter says he does not know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came to him. She said to him, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean."
But in front of everyone, Peter said he was not. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the door leading to the courtyard. There another woman saw him. She said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Again he said he was not. And he swore: "I do not know the man!"
After a while, those standing there approached Peter. They said, "You must be one of them. Your way of speaking gives you away."
Then Peter began to curse and swear. He said to them, "I do not know this man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said. "The rooster will crow," Jesus told him. "Before it crows, you will deny me three times." Peter went outside. He broke down and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself
It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to execute Jesus.
They bound him and took him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, who was the governor.
Judas, who betrayed him, saw that Jesus had been sentenced to death. He felt deep shame and sorrow for what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He said: "I was wrong." "I handed over a man who is not guilty." They replied: "What is it to us?" "This is your problem."
Then Judas threw the money into the temple and departed. Then he went and hanged himself.
The chief priests picked up the coins. They said, "It is legally forbidden to put this money into the temple treasury. It is blood money. It has paid for the death of a man."
Therefore, they decided to use the money to buy a pottery field. People from other countries will be buried there.
For this reason, it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
Then the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He said: "They took the thirty pieces of silver. That was the price set for him by the people of Israel.
"They used the coins to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12, 13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus is presented to Pilate
Jesus was standing before the governor. The governor asked, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "Yes. Just as you say."
But when the chief priests and elders brought accusations against him, he did not respond.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear the charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus did not respond, not even to a single charge. The governor was truly amazed.
It was the ruler's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people would choose the person they wanted.
At that time, they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
When the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Which one do you want me to set free for you? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"
Pilate knew that the leaders were jealous. He knew that this was the reason they handed Jesus over to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him a message. She said: "Do not get involved with that man. He is innocent. I have suffered a lot in a dream today because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders urged the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.
"Which one do you want me to release?" the governor asked. "Barabbas," they answered.
Pilate asked, "So what shall I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?" Everyone answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What wrong did he do?" Pilate asked. But they shouted louder, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was making no progress. Instead, the crowd began to get angry. So he took water and washed his hands in front of them. He said, "I am not guilty of this man's death." They said, "You are responsible for it!"
All the people answered: "We and our children will accept the blame for his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas. But he ordered Jesus to be flogged. Then he handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mock Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus to the palace, which was called the Praetorium. All the other soldiers gathered around him.
They stripped him of his clothes and dressed him in a purple robe.
Then they twisted the thorns together to make a crown. They placed it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him. They said, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They spat on him. They hit him on the head with a stick repeatedly.
After they mocked him, they took off his robe. They put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him to be crucified on the cross. Jesus is crucified on the cross.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Kairouan. His name was Simon. They forced him to carry the cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha. The word Golgotha means the place of the skull.
They mixed the wine with bitter spices and gave it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they crucified him on the cross, they divided his clothes by casting lots.
They sat and guarded him there.
Above his head, they placed the written charge against him. It was written: ~This is Jesus, King of the Jews.=
Crucified with him were two thieves. One was on his right and the other on his left.
Those who passed by shouted at Jesus and mocked him. They shook their heads.
And he said, "Will you destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Then save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
In the same way, the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders mocked him.
"He saved others," they said. "But he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross! Then we will believe in him."
He trusts in God. May God save him now if He wills. He is the one who said: "I am the Son of God."
In the same way, the thieves who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. Jesus dies
From noon until three o'clock, the entire land was covered in darkness.
Around the third hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice. He said, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those standing there heard Jesus shouting. They said, "He is calling Elijah."
Immediately, someone ran and brought a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar and placed it on a stick. He offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said: "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah will come to save him."
After Jesus cried out once more in a loud voice, he died.
At that moment, the temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook. The rocks split.
The graves were opened. And the bodies of many saints who had died were revived.
They came out of the graves. After Jesus rose from the dead, they entered the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and those who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and everything that happened. They were very afraid. And they said, "Truly, this was the Son of God!"
Not far away, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to take care of his needs.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, was there also. And the mother of the sons of Zebedee was there as well. Jesus was buried.
As evening approached, a rich man from the city of Arimathea came. His name was Joseph. He had become a follower of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in clean linen.
He placed him in his new grave, which he had dug out of the rock himself. He rolled a large stone in front of the entrance of the grave. Then he left.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb
The next day was the day after Preparation Day. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
"Sir," they said, "we remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'After three days I will rise again.'"
So order the tomb to be sealed until the third day. If you do not, his disciples may come and steal the body. Then they will tell the people that Jesus has risen from the dead. This last lie will be worse than the first.
Pilate said: "Take some guards with you. Go. Make the tomb as secure as possible."
So they went and securely sealed the tomb. They placed a seal on the stone and appointed some guards to keep watch.
Jesus rises from the dead
Saturday has now ended. It was dawn on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
A strong earthquake occurred. The angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body was shining like lightning. And his clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so afraid of him that they trembled and became like the dead.
The angel said to the women: "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
Not here! He has gotten up, as he said! Come and see the place where he was lying.
Go quickly! Tell his disciples: "He has risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him." Now I have told you.
So the women hurried away from the tomb. They were afraid, but they were filled with joy. They ran to tell the disciples.
Suddenly Jesus met them. He said, "Peace be with you!" They came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." Report of the guards to the chief priests
While the women were on their way, some guards entered the city. They reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they made a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They said to the soldiers: "We want you to say: 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were asleep.'"
If the ruler hears this report, we will pay him the money. This will save you from trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were commanded. This story has spread among the Jews to this day. The final orders of Jesus to his disciples
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee. They went to the mountain that Jesus had told them to go to.
When they saw him, they worshiped him. But some still have doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations. Baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And be sure that I am always with you, to the very end.
John the Baptist prepares the way
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago the prophet Isaiah wrote, "I will send my messenger ahead of you. He will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
A voice of one calling in the wilderness: "Prepare the way for the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God." (Isaiah 40:3)
And so John came. He was baptizing people in the desert. He was also preaching that people must be baptized and repent of their sins. Then God would forgive them.
All the people from the countryside of Judah went out to him. And all the people from Jerusalem also went out. And when they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John was wearing clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He was eating locusts and wild honey.
This is what John was preaching. "After me, one will come who is stronger than I. I am not worthy to stoop down and untie his shoe."
"I will baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus is baptized and tempted
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee. John baptized him in the Jordan River.
Jesus was coming out of the water. At that moment, he saw the sky split open. He saw the Holy Spirit descending upon him like a dove.
A voice came from heaven, saying, "You are my Son, whom I love. I am very pleased with you."
Immediately the Holy Spirit sent Jesus into the wilderness.
He was in the desert for forty days. There the devil tempted him. The wild animals did not harm Jesus. The angels took care of him. Jesus chooses the first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee. He was preaching the good news of God.
He said: "The time has come. The kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe the good news!"
One day, Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake. They were fishermen.
Jesus said: "Come. Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
So they left their nets and followed him immediately.
Then Jesus walked a little further. As he did so, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat preparing their nets.
Immediately he called to them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men. Then they followed Jesus. Jesus casts out an evil spirit.
Jesus went with those who were with him to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue. There he began to teach.
People were amazed by his teaching. He taught them as one who had authority. He did not speak like the teachers of the law.
At that moment, a man in their assembly shouted. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said,
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!
"Be quiet!" Jesus said firmly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a scream.
And all the people were amazed. They asked one another, "What is this? A new teaching! And with great authority! He even commands evil spirits, and they obey him."
News of Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. Immediately, they went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon’s mother-in-law was lying in bed. She was suffering from a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her. He took her hand and helped her to stand up. The fever left her. Then she began to serve them.
That evening after sunset, people brought to Jesus all the sick. They also brought all who were possessed by demons.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They were suffering from all kinds of diseases. He also cast out many evil spirits. But he did not allow the spirits to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prays in a quiet place.
It was very early in the morning and it was still dark. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they called out to him, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go to another place. I want to go to the nearby towns. I must also preach there. That is why I came."
So he traveled throughout all Galilee. And he was teaching in their synagogues. And he was also casting out demons. Jesus healed a man who was suffering from a skin disease.
A man suffering from a skin disease came to Jesus. On his knees, he pleaded with Jesus. He said, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep concern. He reached out and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do it." "Be clean!"
The illness immediately left him. He was healed.
Jesus sent him away immediately. He gave the man a stern warning.
"Don't tell anyone this," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded. It will be a testimony to the priest and to the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to speak immediately. He spread the news to everyone. Therefore, Jesus could no longer enter the city openly. He stayed outside in remote places. But people still came to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk
After a few days, Jesus entered Capernaum again. People heard that he had returned to his hometown.
A large number of people gathered so that there was no room left. There was not even space outside the door. And Jesus preached the word to them.
There were four men who came carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not bring him close to Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus. Then they lowered the man through it on a mat.
Jesus saw their faith. He said to the man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Some of the Sharia teachers were sitting there. They were thinking,
Why is this man speaking like this? He is saying something very evil! Only God forgives sins!
Immediately Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Get up, take your mat and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who could not walk.
He said to him: "I tell you, get up. Take your mat and go to your house."
The man stood up and took his mat. Then he walked away while everyone was watching. All the people were amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus chooses Levi
Jesus went out again beside the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd came to him. He began to teach them.
While he was walking, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus. Levi was sitting in the tax collector's chair. Jesus said to him, "Follow me." So Levi got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at the house of Levi. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that followed Jesus.
There were some of the teachers of the law who were Pharisees. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard that. He said to them, "Those who are healthy do not need a doctor, but the sick do. I have not come to call those who think they are righteous before God to follow me, but to call sinners to follow me." Jesus is asked about fasting
John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting without eating. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "John's disciples are fasting. The Pharisees' disciples are also fasting. But your disciples are not fasting. Why are they not fasting?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They will not fast while he is with them.
But a time will come when the groom will be taken from them. On that day, they will go without eating.
People do not sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. If they do, the new piece will separate from the old one. And this will make the tear worse.
No one pours new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wineskins will burst from the new wine. The wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined together. But new wine must be poured into new wineskins." Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath.
On a Saturday, Jesus was walking with his disciples through the grain fields. The disciples began to pick some heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. Why do your disciples do that?"
He answered, "Have you never read about what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food.
This was when Abiathar was the high priest. David entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread. It was only permitted for the priests to eat it. David also gave some of the bread to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
For the Son of Man is Lord even over the Sabbath day.
Healing on Saturday
Jesus went again to the synagogue. There was a man with a weak and bent hand.
Some of the Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man who had the weak and crooked hand. He said to him: "Stand up in front of everyone."
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say we must do on the Sabbath? Should we do good? Or should we do evil? Should we save a life? Or should we kill?" But no one answered.
Jesus looked at them with anger. He was very upset because their hearts were stubborn. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and his hand was like new.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians. They wanted to kill Jesus. The crowds follow Jesus.
Jesus went to the Sea of Galilee with his disciples. Large crowds from Galilee followed him.
People heard about everything Jesus was doing. Many came to him. They came from Judea, Jerusalem, and Edom. They came from the lands east of the Jordan River. And they came from the region surrounding Tyre and Sidon.
Due to the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. This would prevent people from crowding around him.
Jesus healed many people. Therefore, the sick would crowd around to touch him.
When the people who had evil spirits saw him, they fell down before him. The spirits cried out, saying: "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell who he was. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up to the side of a mountain. He called some people to come to him, and they came.
He appointed twelve of them and called them apostles. And from that time on, they were with him. He also sent them out to preach.
They had the authority to cast out demons.
So Jesus appointed the twelve. Simon was one of them. And Jesus gave him the name Peter.
There was James son of Zebedee and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges. Boanerges means Sons of Thunder.
There were also Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James son of Alphaeus. There were also Thaddaeus and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was one of them as well. He was the one who would later hand Jesus over to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebul
Jesus entered a house. A crowd gathered again. It was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about this. So they went to take him. They said, "He is insane."
There were some teachers of the law. They had come down from Jerusalem. They said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! He drives out demons by the power of the prince of demons."
So he called them to come closer and spoke to them in parables. He said, "How can Satan drive out Satan?"
If a kingdom fights against itself, it cannot endure.
If the family is divided, it cannot stand firm.
