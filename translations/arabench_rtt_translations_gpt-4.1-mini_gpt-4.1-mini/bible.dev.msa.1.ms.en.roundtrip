The familial lineage of Jesus
This is the genealogy record of the family of Jesus Christ. He is the son of David. He is also the son of Abraham.
Abraham was the father of Isaac. Isaac was the father of Jacob. Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.
Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah. Tamar was their mother. Perez was the father of Hezron. Hezron was the father of Ram.
Ram was the father of Amminadab. Amminadab was the father of Nahshon. Nahshon was the father of Salmon.
Salem was Boaz's father. Rehab was Boaz's mother. Boaz was Obed's father. Ruth was Obed's mother. Obed was Jesse's father.
And Jesse was the father of King David. And David was the father of Solomon. And the mother of Solomon was the wife of Uriah.
Solomon was the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam was the father of Abijah. Abijah was the father of Asa.
Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat was the father of Jehoram. Jehoram was the father of Azariah.
Azariah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. Amon was the father of Josiah.
Josiah was the father of Jeconiah and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were forced to go to Babylon.
After that, the family line continued. Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel. And Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud. Abiud was the father of Eliakim. Eliakim was the father of Azor.
Azor was the father of Sadok. Sadok was the father of Akim. Akim was the father of Eliud.
Eliud was the father of Eleazar. Eleazar was the father of Matthan. Matthan was the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Messiah.
There were 14 generations from Abraham to David. There were 14 from David until the Jewish people were forced to go to Babylon. And there were 14 from that time to Christ. Jesus Christ was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ happened. His mother Mary and Joseph had promised to marry. But before they began living together, it became clear that she would bear a child. She was pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Yusuf, was a pious man. He did not want to expose her publicly. So he planned to divorce her quietly.
But while Joseph was thinking about this, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. The angel said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife. The child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
You will give birth to a son. You must name him Jesus. This is because he will save his people from their sins.
All this happened to fulfill what the Lord said would happen. He said it through the prophet,
"The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel." (Isaiah 7:14) The name Immanuel means "God with us."
Joseph woke up. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary to his house as his wife.
But he did not consummate the marriage with her until she gave birth to a son. And Joseph named this name Jesus.
The Visit of the Wise Men to Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judah. This happened while Herod was king of Judah. After the birth of Jesus, wise men came from the East to Jerusalem.
They asked: "Where is the child who was born to be king over the Jews? When we were in the East, we saw his star. And now we have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was very disturbed. And everyone in Jerusalem was also troubled.
Herod summoned all the chief priests of the people. He also called the teachers of the law. And he asked them where the Messiah would be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judah," they answered. "This is what the prophet wrote. He said,
"And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah. From you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men. He inquired precisely from them when the star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Search carefully for the child. Once you find him, bring me a report. Then I can go and worship him too."
After the wise men listened to the king, they set off on their way. The star they saw when they were in the East moved ahead of them. And finally, it stopped above the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They presented him with gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by a different route. The flight of Jesus' family to Egypt
When the wise men left, Joseph dreamed. In the dream, the angel of the Lord appeared to him. The angel said: "Get up! Take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return. Herod will search for the child. He wants to kill him."
Youssef stood up. During the night, he left for Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They stayed there until King Herod died. Then what the Lord had said through the prophet was fulfilled: "Out of Egypt I called my son." (Hosea 11:1)
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. He became very angry. He issued orders concerning Bethlehem and the surrounding area. All boys aged two years or younger were to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men saw the star.
In this way, the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He said,
A voice is heard in Ramah. It is a voice of weeping and deep sorrow. Rachel is crying for her children. She refuses to be comforted, because they are gone. (Jeremiah 31:15) The return of Jesus' family to Nazareth
After the death of Herod, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, the angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said: "Get up! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who were trying to kill the child are dead."
So Joseph got up. He took the child and his mother Mary and returned to the land of Israel.
But he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea. Archelaus was ruling in place of his father Herod. This made Joseph afraid to go there. After being warned in a dream, Joseph returned to the land of Galilee instead.
There lived in a city called Nazareth. He fulfilled what the prophets said about Jesus. They said: "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way
In those days, John the Baptist came and preached in the wilderness of Judea.
He said: "Repent of your sins! The kingdom of heaven has come near."
John is the one spoken of by the prophet Isaiah. He said: "A voice of one calling in the wilderness: Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths in the desert for him." (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was
People came out to him from Jerusalem and all Judah. They also came from all the surrounding region of the Jordan River.
When they admitted that they had made a mistake, John baptized them in Jordan.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath of God?"
Bear fruit that shows you have turned away from your sins.
Do not think that you say to yourselves, "Abraham is our father." I tell you, God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
The axe is already at the roots of the trees. All trees that do not produce good fruit will be cut down. They will be thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, calling you to repent of your sins. But after me will come one who is more powerful than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He holds his spear in his hand to remove the straw from his plow. He will gather his wheat in the barn. But he will burn the straw with an unquenchable fire." Jesus baptizes
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted John to baptize him.
But John tried to stop him. He said to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be this way now. It is right for us to do this. It fulfills God's holy plan." Then John agreed.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the heavens opened. Jesus saw the Spirit of God descending on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love. I am very pleased with him."
Jesus is tempted
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert. There the devil tempted him.
After forty days and forty nights of fasting, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city. He made him stand on the highest point of the temple.
He said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. It is written: 'For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'" (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered, "It is also written, 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said: "If you fall down and prostrate to me, I will give you all of this."
Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan! It is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus. The angels came and took care of him. Jesus begins to preach.
John was imprisoned. When Jesus heard this, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth. He went to live in the city of Capernaum. It was located by the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
And in this way, what the prophet Isaiah said was fulfilled. He said,
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! The Galilee, where non-Jews live! The land along the Mediterranean Sea! The lands east of the Jordan River!
"The people who live in darkness will see a great light. They now live in a very dark land. But a light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1, 2)
Since then, Jesus began to preach. He said, "Repent of your sins! The kingdom of heaven has come near." Jesus chooses the first disciples
One day, Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers. They were Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake. They were fishermen.
"Come. Follow me," Jesus said. "I will make you fishers of men."
So they left their nets and followed him immediately.
Advancing from there, he saw two other brothers. They were James son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee. While they were preparing their nets, Jesus called them.
They immediately left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus heals the sick
Jesus went throughout all Galilee. There he taught in the synagogues. He preached the good news about the kingdom of God. He healed every disease and sickness that people were suffering from.
His news spread all over Syria. People brought to him all kinds of patients with different diseases. Some of them were suffering from severe pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were trembling violently. Others could not move at all. And Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, from the region known as the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan River.
Jesus grants blessings
Jesus saw the crowds. So he went up on the mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said,
Blessed are the spiritually needy, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be shown mercy.
Blessed are those whose hearts are pure. They will see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for doing what is right. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.
Rejoice and be glad. Your reward in heaven is great. In the same way, people harm the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light
You are the salt of the earth. But suppose the salt loses its saltiness. How can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything. It will be thrown out. People will walk on it.
You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden.
Also, no one lights a lamp and puts it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand. Then it gives light to everyone in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others. Then they will see the good works you do. And they will glorify your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the full meaning to the law.
Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Heaven and earth will pass away before the smallest letter of the law disappears. Not even the tiniest dot of the law will disappear until everything is accomplished.
Do not break even one of the least important commandments. And do not teach others to break them. If you do, you will be called the least important in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, practice these commandments and teach them. Then you will be called important in the kingdom of heaven.
Here is what I tell you. You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder
You have heard that it was said to those who lived long ago, "You shall not kill." (Exodus 20:13) Whoever kills will be judged for it.
But this is what I say to you. Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be judged. And whoever says to his brother, "Raca," must stand before the Sanhedrin for judgment. But whoever says, "Fool!" will be in danger of the fire of hell.
Suppose you are offering your gift at the altar. And remember that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift before the altar. First go and be reconciled with your brother. Then come back and offer your gift.
Suppose someone has a claim against you and takes you to court. Set the matter quickly. Do it while you are on the way with him. If you do not, he may hand you over to the judge. The judge may hand you over to the officer. And you may be thrown in jail.
What I will tell you is the truth. You will not leave until you pay the last penny! Adultery
You have heard that it was said, "You shall not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But I say to you, do not even look at a woman with a lustful gaze. For whoever looks at her in this way has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. Your eye is only one part of your body. It is better to lose it than for your whole body to be thrown into the fire.
If your right hand tempts you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is only one part of your body. It is better to lose it than for your whole body to be thrown into the fire. Divorce
It was said: "Suppose a man divorces his wife. If he does so, he must give her a certificate of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But this is what I say to you. Whoever divorces his wife causes her to commit adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. A man may not divorce his wife unless she is unfaithful to him. Oaths
Once again, you have heard what was said to your people long ago. They were told: "Do not break the covenants you made with the Lord. Keep the oaths you have sworn to Him."
But this is what I say to you. Do not make such promises at all. Do not make them in the name of heaven. That is the throne of God.
Do not make it in the name of the earth. That is the footstool of God. Do not make it in the name of Jerusalem. That is the city of the great King.
And do not swear by your heads. You cannot make a single hair white or black.
Let "yes" mean "yes." Let "no" mean "no." Anything beyond that is from the evil one. Be kind to others.
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this is what I tell you. Do not fight against an evil person. "Suppose someone strikes you on the right cheek. Then turn to him the other cheek also.
Suppose someone sues you to take your shirt. Let them take your coat as well.
Suppose someone forces you to walk one mile. Then walk with them two miles.
Give to whoever asks you for something. Do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow something from you. Love your enemies.
You have heard that it was said: "Love your neighbor. (Leviticus 19:18) And hate your enemy."
But this is what I tell you. Love your enemies. Pray for those who hurt you.
So you will be children of your Father who is in the heavens. "For He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
If you love those who love you, what is your reward? Indeed, even sinners do that.
And if you only give life to your own people, what is your superiority over others? Do not the criminals do the same?
Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Giving to people in need
Beware of doing "good deeds" in front of others. Do not do them to be seen by others. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
When you give to the needy, do not announce it by blowing trumpets. Do not be like those who claim holiness only. They announce what they do in temples and in the streets. They want to be honored by others. What I will tell you is the truth. They have received their full reward.
When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
So your giving will be secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. Prayer
When you pray, do not be like those who only pretend to be holy. They love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners. They want others to see them. What I am telling you is true. They have received their full reward.
When you pray, go into your room. Close the door and pray to your Father who is unseen. And He will reward you. For your Father sees what is done in secret.
When you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans do. They think they will be heard because of their many words.
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need even before you ask him.
This is how you should pray. "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Let your kingdom come. Let what you want to happen on earth be done as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we also have forgiven those who have sinned against us.
Protect us from falling into sin when we are tempted. Save us from the evil one.
Forgive people when they wrong you. If you do so, your Father in heaven will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive people their mistakes, your Father will not forgive your mistakes. Fasting
When you fast, do not look gloomy like those who only pretend to be pious. They make their faces very sad. They want to show people that they are fasting. What I am telling you is true. They have received their full reward.
But when you fast, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
Then no one else will know that you are fasting. Only your unseen Father will know. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret. Store up treasures in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your heart will be where your treasures are.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. Suppose your eyes are good. Then your whole body will be full of light.
But suppose your eyes are bad. Then your whole body will be filled with darkness. If the light inside you is darkness, then it will be very dark!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one and love the other. Or he will be loyal to one and hate the other. You cannot serve both God and money at the same time. Do not worry.
I tell you, do not worry. Do not worry about your life and what you will eat or drink. And do not worry about your bodies and what you will wear. Is there not more to life than food? Are there not things more important to the body than clothing?
Look at the birds of the sky. They do not sow or reap. Nor do they gather grain into barns. But your Father in heaven feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Can you add just one hour to your life by worrying?
And why do you worry about clothes? Look at how the wildflowers grow. They do not work or make clothes.
But I tell you this: not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these flowers.
If God dresses the wild grass like this, won't He dress you even better? The grass here today, and tomorrow it is thrown into the fire. Your faith is very small!
So do not worry. And do not say: "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?"
The people who do not fear God run after all those things. Your Father in heaven knows that you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God. Do what you want to do. Then all those things will be given to you as well.
So do not worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when you judge others
Do not judge others. Then you will not be judged.
You will be judged by the same way you judge others. You will be measured by the same way you measure others.
You look at the sawdust in your friend's eye. But you do not pay attention to the piece of wood in your own eye.
How can you say to your friend: "Let me take the splinter out of your eye"? How can you say this while there is a piece of wood in your own eye?
O hypocrite! First, take the wooden plank out of your own eye. Then you will be able to see clearly to remove the speck of sawdust from your friend's eye.
Do not give what is holy to dogs. Do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet. Then they may turn and tear you to pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask and it will be given to you. Seek and you will find. Knock and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks will be given. Whoever seeks will find. The door will be opened to those who knock.
If your son asks you for bread, which of you will give him a stone?
Or suppose he asked for a fish. Which of you would give him a snake?
And if you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
In everything, treat others as you would like to be treated. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The great and small gates
Enter the kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that lead to death and hell. Many people walk that road.
But the gate is narrow and the way that leads to life is narrow. Few find it. A tree and its fruit
Beware of false prophets. They come to you pretending to be sheep. But inside, they are hungry wolves.
You can know their true nature by what they do. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes? Do they pick figs from thistles?
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit. But the bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit. And a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down. It is thrown into the fire.
You can know every tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven will enter.
Many will say to me on that day, "Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name? Did we not cast out demons in your name? Did we not do many miracles in your name?"
Then I will say to them plainly, "I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!" The wise and foolish builders
"Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
The rain comes. The water rises. The winds blow and strike that house. But it does not fall. It is built on the rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
The rain comes. The water rises. The winds blow and hit that house. And it falls with a loud noise.
Jesus finished saying all these things. The crowd was amazed at his teaching.
He taught as one who had authority. He did not speak like their teachers of the law.
Jesus heals a man who was suffering from a skin disease
Jesus came down from the side of the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man who was suffering from a skin disease came and knelt before Jesus. He said, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do this." "Be clean!" Immediately the man was healed of his skin disease.
Then Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone. Go, show yourself to the priest. Offer the gift that Moses commanded. It will be a testimony to them." A Roman centurion believes
When Jesus entered Capernaum, a Roman officer came to him. He asked Jesus for help.
He said: "O Lord, my servant lies in the house and cannot move. He is suffering greatly."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The commander answered: "Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man under authority. And I have soldiers who obey my orders. I say to this one: "Go," and he goes. I say to that one: "Come," and he comes. I say to my servant: "Do this," and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. He said to those who were following him, "What I am about to tell you is true. I have not found anyone in Israel with faith as strong as this."
I tell you that many will come from the east and the west. They will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
As for those who think they belong to the kingdom, they will be cast out into the darkness. There they will weep and gnash their teeth."
Then Jesus said to the Roman officer: "Go! It will be done as you have believed." And his servant was healed at that very hour. Jesus heals many people
When Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law. She was lying on the bed. She was suffering from a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many people who were possessed by demons were brought to Jesus. He cast out the spirits with a word. He healed all the sick.
He did this to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah said. He said: "Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering. We considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities." (Isaiah 53:4) The cost of following Jesus
Jesus saw the crowd around him. So he commanded his disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then the teacher of Sharia came to him and said: "O teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have dens, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
And another follower said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm
Jesus got into the boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a terrible storm blew over the lake. The waves crashed over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The students went and woke him up. They said, "Lord! Save us! We are about to drown!"
He answered, "Your faith is so small! Why are you so afraid?" Then Jesus got up and commanded the winds and the waves to stop. The weather became completely calm.
The students were amazed. They asked, "Who is this man that even the winds and the waves obey him?" Jesus heals two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived at the other side of the lake in the region of the Gadarenes. He was met by two men possessed by demons. They came out of the tombs. The two men were so fierce that no one could pass that way.
"Son of God, what do you want from us?" they shouted. "Have you come here to punish us before our time of judgment?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was grazing.
The demons appealed to Jesus, "If you cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" So the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep slope. They ran into the lake and drowned in the water.
The ones who were tending the pigs fled. They entered the city and informed everyone of all this. They told the people what had happened to the men who had been possessed by demons.
Then the whole city went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk
Jesus got into the boat. He crossed to the other side of the lake and arrived at his town.
Some men brought to him a man who could not walk. He was lying on a mat. Jesus saw their faith. He said to the man, "Do not lose hope, my son. Your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the teachers of Sharia said to themselves: "This man is saying something very evil!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said, "Why do you harbor evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say: "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say: "Get up and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the man who could not walk: "Get up," he said. "Take your mat and go home."
The man stood up and went home.
When the crowd saw this, they were filled with amazement. And they praised God because he had given this kind of authority to people. Jesus chooses when
As Jesus was going from there, he saw a man named Matthew. He was sitting at the tax collector's booth. Jesus said to him, "Follow me." So Matthew got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came. They ate with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this. So they asked the disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard that and said, "Those who are well do not need a doctor, but the sick do."
Go and learn what this means, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) I have not come to call the righteous who think they are right with God to follow me. I have come to call sinners to follow me." Jesus is asked about fasting
One day the disciples of John came. They said to Jesus, "We and the Pharisees fast. Why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom be sad while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast.
People do not sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. The new piece will separate from the old one. That will make the tear worse.
"No one pours new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst. The wine will run out, and the skins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins. Then both are preserved." A dead girl and a suffering woman
While Jesus was saying this, a ruler came. He knelt on his knees before Jesus. He said, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her. Then she will live again."
Jesus got up and went with him. Likewise, his disciples.
At that moment, a woman came from behind Jesus. She was suffering from a disease that caused her to bleed. It had lasted for 12 years. She touched the hem of his garment.
I thought, "All I need is to touch his clothes. Then I will be healed."
Jesus turned and saw her. He said, "Dear woman, do not lose hope. Your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that very moment.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the noisy crowd.
He said: "Go. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd was sent outside, Jesus entered. He took the girl's hand, and she got up.
News about what Jesus did spread throughout the whole region. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus was going from there, two blind men followed him. They called out, saying, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus went indoors, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They answered him, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes. He said, "It will happen to you as you have believed."
They could now see again. Jesus warned them sternly, saying, "Make sure that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it all over that region.
As they were going out, another man was brought to Jesus. A demon controlled him, so he could not speak.
When the devil was cast out, the man spoke. The crowd was amazed. They said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel before."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." There are only a few workers.
Jesus was going through all the towns and villages. He was teaching in their synagogues. He was preaching the good news about the kingdom. And he was healing every disease and sickness.
When he saw the crowds, he felt deep concern for them. They were exhausted and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples: "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few."
So ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest field.
Jesus Sends the Twelve Disciples
Jesus called his twelve disciples to come to him. He gave them the authority to cast out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then comes James son of Zebedee and his brother John.
Next are Philip and Bartholomew, as well as Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. There are also two others, James son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus.
The latter two are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas is the one who would later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent these twelve with the following orders. He said: "Do not go among the Gentiles." "Do not enter any city of the Samaritans."
Rather, go to the Children of Israel. They are like sheep who have gone astray.
And as you walk, proclaim this message: "The kingdom of heaven is near."
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse those who have leprosy. Drive out demons. You have received freely; give freely.
Do not take gold or silver or copper in your belts.
Do not take a bag for the trip. Do not take extra clothes, sandals, or walking sticks. The worker should be given what he needs.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone willing to welcome you. Stay at that person's house until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet those who live in it.
If that house welcomes you, grant it the blessing of peace. And if it does not, do not bless it.
Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. And if they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or city.
What I will tell you is the truth. On the Day of Judgment, the condition of Sodom and Gomorrah will be easier than the condition of that city.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore, be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.
Beware! The men will hand you over to the local courts. They will flog you in their temples.
You will be brought before governors and kings because of me. You will be witnesses to them and to those who are not Jews.
But when they arrest you, do not worry about what you will say or how you will say it. At that time, the right words will be given to you to say.
You will not be the speaker. Your father's spirit will speak through you.
Brothers will hand over their brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their children. Children will attack their fathers and execute them.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But those who persevere until the end will survive.
When people attack you in one place, flee to another place. What I am about to tell you is true. You will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
The student is not better than his teacher. The servant is not better than his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for the servant to be like his master. If the master of the house is called Beelzebub, what can the others who live there expect?
So do not fear your enemies. Everything secret will be revealed publicly. Everything hidden will be shown.
What I tell you in the dark, speak it in the daylight. What is whispered in your ear, shout it from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Are not two sparrows sold for only one falus? Yet not one of them falls to the ground without your Father knowing it.
He even counts every hair on your head!
So do not be afraid. You are more valuable than many sparrows.
What about someone who says before others that he knows me? I will also say before my Father in heaven that I know him.
But what about a person who says in front of others that he does not know me? I will say before my Father in heaven that I do not know him.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace. I came to bring the sword.
I have come to turn "children against their parents. Daughters will refuse to obey their mothers. And they will be against their mothers-in-law.
"Enemies of a man are members of his own household." (Micah 7:6)
Whoever loves his father or mother more than me does not deserve me. Whoever loves his son or daughter more than me does not deserve me.
And whoever does not carry his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
If anyone finds their life, they will lose it. But if anyone loses their life for my sake, they will find it.
Whoever accepts you accepts me. And whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.
Suppose a person welcomes a prophet as a prophet. That person will receive the reward of the prophet. And suppose a person welcomes a pious person as a pious person. That person will receive the reward of the pious person.
Suppose someone even gave a cup of cold water to a child following me. What I will tell you is the truth. That person will definitely be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus finished teaching His twelve disciples. Then He continued teaching and preaching in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked him, Jesus, "Are you the one who was to come, or should we look for someone else?"
Jesus answered, "Go back to John. Tell him what you hear and see.
The blind regain their sight. The disabled walk. Skin patients are healed. The deaf hear. The dead are brought back to life. And the good news is proclaimed to the poor.
Blessed are those who do not abandon their faith for my sake.
While John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, "What did you go out to see in the wilderness? Tall grass waving in the wind?"
If not, then what did you come out to see? A man wearing fancy clothes? No. People who wear fancy clothes are in the palaces of kings.
So what did you come out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
He is the one who is written about in the Holy Bible. It says: "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
What I will tell you is the truth. No one born is greater than John the Baptist. But the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is more important than him.
Since the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power. And the strong men seize it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you are willing to accept it, John is Elijah who was supposed to come.
Whoever has an ear, let him hear.
What can I compare the people of today to? They are like children sitting in the markets calling out to others. They say,
We played the flute for you, but you did not dance. We sang a funeral hymn, but you did not grieve.
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do. And people say, "He is possessed by a demon."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank just as you do. And people say, "This man eats and drinks too much. He is a friend of tax collectors and sinners." Those who act wisely prove that wisdom is right. Cities that do not turn away from sin
Jesus began to speak against the cities where he had performed most of his miracles. The people there did not repent of their sins. So he said,
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But they have worn sackcloth and sat in ashes.
But I say to you this. On the Day of Judgment, the condition of Tyre and Sidon will be easier than your condition.
And what about you, Capernaum? Will you be raised to the sky? No! You will go down to the place of the dead. Suppose the miracles that happened in you had happened in Sodom. It would still exist today.
But I tell you this. On the Day of Judgment, the condition of Sodom will be easier than your condition." Rest for everyone who is weary
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father. You are the Lord of heaven and earth. You have hidden these things from the wise and learned. But you have revealed them to little children.
Yes, Dad. This is what I wanted.
The father gave me everything. The father is the only one who knows the son. And the only ones who know the father are the son and those whom the son chooses to let know him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Be my servants and learn from me. I am gentle and humble in heart. You will find rest for your souls.
My service is easy, and my load is light.
Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath day
On a Saturday, Jesus was walking through the grain fields. His disciples were hungry. So they began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this. They said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. But your disciples do it anyway!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did? He and his men were hungry.
So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the sacred bread. It was only allowed for the priests to eat it.
Have you not read the law? It tells how the priests in the temple should perform their work every Sabbath day. But they are not considered guilty.
I tell you that there is one here who is greater than the temple.
The writings say, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You do not know what these words mean. If you did, you would not accuse those who are innocent.
The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
Starting from that place, Jesus entered their synagogue.
There was a man with a weak and crooked hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. So they asked him, "Is it lawful for us to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them: "What if one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath? Would you not hold it and lift it out?
Man is nobler than sheep! Therefore, the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and it was as good as new, as good as the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and conspired on how to kill Jesus. The chosen servant of God
Jesus knew everything about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to tell who he was.
That was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah. He says,
Here is my servant. I have chosen him. He is the one I love. I am very pleased with him. I will put my spirit upon him. He will proclaim to the nations that everything will be restored.
He will not argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
He will not break a bent branch. He will not extinguish a flame whose light is fading. He will make everything alright.
"The peoples will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebub
A man possessed by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed this man. Then the man was able to speak and see.
All the people were amazed. They said, "Could this be the son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man drives out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined. And every city or family divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil drives out a devil, he is fighting against himself. So how can his kingdom stand?
She says that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. So by whose power do your people cast out demons then? Then they will be your judges.
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or think about this. How can you enter the house of a strong man and take what he owns just like that? You must first restrain him. Then you can steal his house.
Whoever is not with me is against me. And whoever does not gather the sheep with me scatters them.
So I tell you this: Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But saying evil things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. That person will not be forgiven, neither now nor in the days to come.
If you make the tree good, its fruit will be good. If you make the tree bad, its fruit will be bad. You can know the tree by its fruit.
O nests of poisonous snakes! How can you wicked ones say anything good? Your mouths speak all that is in your hearts.
The good man says good things. These come from the goodness stored inside him. The evil man says evil things. These come from the evil stored inside him.
But this is what I tell you. On the Day of Judgment, people will be held accountable for every reckless word they have spoken.
"With your words, you will be condemned or acquitted." The miraculous sign of Yunus
Some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He answered: "Evil and untrustworthy people seek a miraculous sign! But only the sign of the Prophet Jonah will be given.
Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. Something similar will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.
The men of Nineveh will stand on the Day of Judgment with the people who live now. The people of Nineveh will prove that these people are guilty. The men of Nineveh turned away from their sins when Jonah preached to them. And now there is someone greater than Jonah.
The Queen of the South will stand on the Day of Judgment with the people who are living now. And she will prove that they are guilty. She came from a very distant place to listen to the wisdom of Solomon. And now there is someone greater than Solomon here.
What happens when an evil spirit leaves a person? It passes through dry regions searching for a place to rest. But it does not find one.
Then he says, "I will return to the house I left." And when he arrives there, he finds the house empty. The house has been cleaned and tidied.
Then the evil spirit goes out and takes with it seven other evil spirits more wicked than itself. They enter and dwell there. The condition of that man becomes worse than before. This is how the fate of the wicked will be in this time." The mother of Jesus and His brothers
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside. They wanted to speak to him.
Someone said to him: "Your mother and siblings are standing outside. They want to talk to you."
Jesus answered him, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples. He said, "This is my mother! These are my brothers!"
Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother or sister or mother.
The Farmer's Story
On that same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. So he boarded a boat. He sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things using stories. He said: "A farmer went out to sow his seed.
Scattering the seeds on the ground. Some fell on the road. The birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was not much soil. The plants sprouted quickly because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it burned the plants. They dried up because they had no roots.
And some seeds fell among the thorns. The thorns grew and the plants became crowded.
And other seeds fell on good soil. So they produced a crop a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.
Whoever has ears, let them hear.
The disciples came to him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you speak to people?"
He answered: "I have been given the opportunity to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. They were not given to outsiders.
Everyone who has this kind of knowledge will be given more. Indeed, they will have very much. And whoever does not have this kind of knowledge, even what little they have will be taken from them.
Here is why I use stories when I talk to people. I say: "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't truly hear or understand.
In them, the words of the prophet Isaiah are fulfilled. He said: "You will hear but never understand. You will see but never know what you are seeing."
The hearts of these people have grown hard. They barely hear with their ears. They have closed their eyes. Otherwise, they might see with their eyes. They might hear with their ears. They might understand with their hearts. They might return to the Lord, then He will heal them. (Isaiah 6:9, 10)
But blessed are your eyes because they see. And blessed are your ears because they hear.
What I am going to tell you is the truth. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see. But they did not see it. They wanted to hear what you hear. But they did not hear it.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes. He steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed sown along the path.
As for those on whom the seeds that fell on the rocky ground were sown, they are the ones who hear the word and immediately rejoice.
But they have no roots. Therefore, they only last for a short time. They quickly fall away from the faith when hardships or suffering come because of the message.
As for those who fell among the thorns, they are the ones who hear the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, so it does not bear fruit.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. They are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what the farmer planted." The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowd another story. "This is what the kingdom of heaven is like," he said. "A man planted good seeds in his field.
But while everyone was asleep, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The owner's servants came to him. They said, "O master, did you not sow good seeds in your field? So how then did the weeds grow?"
He said, "That was done by an enemy." The servants asked him, "Do you want us to go and uproot the weeds?"
"No," the owner replied. "While you are pulling out the weeds, you might pull out the wheat as well."
"Let both of them grow together until the harvest. And at that time I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: First, gather the weeds and bind them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn." The Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast
Jesus told the crowd another story. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. Someone took the seed and planted it in a field.
It is the smallest of all your seeds. But when it grows, it becomes the largest plant in the entire garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest on its branches.
Jesus told them another story. He said: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast," "a woman mixed it into a large amount of flour. The yeast spread through all the dough."
Jesus spoke to the crowds about all these things using stories. He did not say anything to them without telling a story.
So the words spoken by the Prophet were true. He said: "I will open my mouth with a parable; I will declare dark sayings from of old. I will speak of things that have been hidden since the creation of the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the story of the harmful weed.
Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him. They said, "Explain to us the story of the weeds in the field."
He answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the Day of Judgment. And the workers are the angels.
Weeds are uprooted and burned in the fire. This is how it will be on the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man will send his angels. They will uproot from his kingdom everything that causes sin. They will also destroy everyone who does evil.
They will be thrown into the blazing furnace. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear. The stories of the hidden treasure and the pearl
The kingdom of heaven is like a hidden treasure in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. He was very happy. So he went and sold everything he had. And bought that field.
Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls.
He found one that was very precious. So he went and sold everything he owned. And he bought that pearl. The Parable of the Pearl
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net. It was pulled to the shore. It caught all kinds of fish.
When it was full, the fishermen pulled the net to the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets. But they threw the bad fish away.
This is how it will be on the Day of Judgment. The angels will come. They will separate the people who did what was wrong from those who did what was right.
The wicked will be thrown into the blazing furnace. There the wicked will weep and gnash their teeth.
Jesus asked, "Do you understand all these things?" They answered, "Yes."
He said to them: "Every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old." A prophet without honor
Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he moved on from there.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? And where did he get this power to perform miracles?" they asked.
Isn't this the son of the carpenter? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers Jacob, Joseph, Simon, and Judah?
Aren't all his sisters with us? Then where did this man get all these things from?
They were not pleased with him at all. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not honored in his hometown. He receives no honor in his own house."
He only performed some miracles there because they did not have faith.
The head of John the Baptist is severed.
At that time, Herod, the ruler of Galilee and Perea, heard reports about Jesus.
He said to his attendants: "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to perform miracles."
Herod had arrested John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John was saying to Herod, "It is against the law for you to take her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he was afraid of the people, because they thought that John was a prophet.
On Herod's birthday, Herodias's daughter danced for Herod and his guests. She pleased Herod very much.
So he promised her by an oath that he would give her everything she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. The girl said to Herod: "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a large platter."
The king was very upset. But he remembered his promise and his dinner guests. So he ordered one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod beheaded John in prison.
His head was brought on a large plate and given to the girl. Then she carried it to her mother.
The disciples of John came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus feeds the five thousand
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he went by boat to a quiet place. The crowd heard about it. They followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus reached the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep concern for them. He healed their sick.
As evening approached, the disciples came to him. They said, "There is nothing here. It is already late. Send the crowds away so they can go and buy some food in the villages."
Jesus answered, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
They said: "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish."
"Bring them to me," he said.
Then Jesus directed the people to sit on the grass. He took the five loaves and two fish. He lifted his eyes to heaven and gave thanks. He broke the loaves into pieces. Then he gave them to the disciples. And the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were full. The students collected 12 baskets of the remaining pieces.
The number of men who ate was about 5,000. Women and children also ate. Jesus walks on water.
Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat. He commanded them to go ahead of him to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. Then he sent the crowd away.
After sending them off, he climbed up the side of a mountain alone to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.
The boat was already far from the shore. The waves were hitting it hard because the wind was blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus went out to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and got scared. They said, "It's a ghost!" and screamed in fear.
Immediately Jesus called out to them, saying, "Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid."
Peter said, "Lord, is it you?" He said to him, "If it is I, tell me to come to you on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat. He walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. He cried out, "Lord! Save me!"
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. He said, "You have such little faith! Why did you doubt me?"
When they boarded the boat, the wind calmed.
Then those in the boat worshiped Jesus. They said, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and landed at Gennesaret.
The men who were living there got to know Jesus. So they sent a message to all the surrounding regions. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
They pleaded with him to let those who were sick only touch the edge of his garment. And everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "impure"?
Some of the Pharisees and some teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,
Why don’t your students obey what the sheikhs teach? Your students do not wash their hands before they eat!
Jesus answered, "And why do you not obey God's command? Instead, you prefer to follow your own teachings!
God said: "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said: "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
But you allow people to say to their parents: "Any help you have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
They do not need to honor their parents with their gift. You make the word of God of no effect by your tradition.
O demonstrators! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said,
These people honor me with their words, but their hearts are far from me.
"Their worship means nothing to me. They only know human rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him. He said, "Listen and understand.
What enters your mouth does not make you "unclean." Rather, what comes out of your mouth is what makes you "unclean."
Then the disciples came to him. They asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were angry when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are plants that my Father in heaven did not plant. They will be uprooted.
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind leaders. If a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
Jesus asked them, "Do you still not understand?"
Don't you see? Everything that enters the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it leaves the body.
But what comes out of the mouth comes from the heart. Those are the things that make you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. Likewise, murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. Also theft, false testimony, and lying to others.
Those are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands does not make you "unclean." "The Faith of a Canaanite Woman"
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
There was a woman from Canaan living near Tyre and Sidon. She came to him and cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on me! A demon is controlling my daughter. She is suffering greatly."
Jesus did not say a single word. His disciples approached him and pleaded, "Send her away. She keeps crying out after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep."
Then the woman fell to her knees before him. "Oh Lord! Help me!" she said.
He answered, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Yes, Lord," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Jesus answered, "Woman, you have great faith! It will be done for you as you wish." At that moment, her daughter was healed. Jesus feeds the four thousand
Jesus left that place. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up the side of a mountain and sat down.
Large crowds gathered around him. They brought to him the blind and those who could not walk. They also brought the disabled, those who could not speak, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.
People were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. Those who were disabled became healthy. Those who could not walk were walking. Those who were blind began to see. So the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to come to him. He said, "I feel deep concern for these people. They have already been with me for three days. They have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry. If I do, they will become too weak on their way back home."
His disciples answered him, "There is nothing here," they said. "Where can we get enough bread to feed this large crowd?"
Jesus asked, "How many loaves do you have?" They answered, "Seven, and a little bit of small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks. Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples. The disciples distributed the food to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. After that, the disciples gathered seven baskets of the leftover pieces.
The number of men who ate was 4,000. Women and children also ate.
After Jesus sent the crowd away, he got into the boat. He headed to the area near Magdala.
Jesus is asked for a miraculous sign
The Pharisees and the Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a miraculous sign from heaven.
He answered, "In the evening you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'"
In the morning, she says: "Today will be stormy. The sky is red and full of clouds." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
An evil and treacherous people ask for a miraculous sign. But they will be given only the sign of Jonah." Then Jesus left them and went away. The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees
The students crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring bread.
Jesus said to them, "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students talked about this among themselves. They said, "He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said to them, "You have such little faith! Why are you talking among yourselves about not having bread?
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces were gathered?
Do you not remember the seven loaves for the four thousand? Do you not remember how many baskets of pieces were gathered?
How can you not understand? I was not talking to you about bread. But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to beware of the yeast used in bread. Rather, He was warning them about what the Pharisees and Sadducees taught. Peter says that Jesus is the Christ.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and others say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ. You are the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For this was not revealed to you by any ordinary man. But my Father in heaven has revealed it to you.
This is what I tell you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. And whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus speaks about his coming death.
Since then, Jesus began to explain to his disciples what would happen to him. He told them that he must go to Jerusalem. There he would have to suffer many things from the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law. He must be killed, and on the third day, he will rise from the dead.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. He said, "Never, Lord! This will never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me. You do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men."
Then Jesus spoke to his disciples. He said: "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself. He must take up his cross and follow me.
If anyone wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet lose himself? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
The Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father. His angels will come with Him. And He will reward each one according to what he has done.
What I am about to tell you is true. Some of those standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
The change of Jesus' appearance
After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John the brother of James with him. He led them up a high mountain. They were completely alone.
There is before them a change in his appearance. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became white as light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus: "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will set up three shelters. One for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud surrounded them. A voice came from the cloud: "This is my Son, whom I love. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!"
When the students heard this, they were terrified. They fell face down on the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said, "Get up, do not be afraid."
When they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. On the way down, Jesus told them what to do. "Do not tell anyone what you have seen," he said. "Wait until the Son of Man is raised from the dead."
The disciples asked him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus answered, "That is correct. Elijah is supposed to come and make all things new again.
But I tell you, Elijah has already come. People did not recognize him. They did to him everything they wanted to do. In the same way, they will make the Son of Man suffer.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was talking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy who was possessed by a demon.
When they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus. He knelt before him on his knees.
He said: "O Lord, have mercy on my son. He is trembling severely and suffering greatly. He often falls into fire or water.
"I brought him to your disciples. But they could not heal him."
Jesus said: "O unbelieving and wicked people! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I endure you? Bring the boy to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it came out. He was healed at that very moment.
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately. They asked him, "Why couldn't we cast out the demon?"
He answered: "Because your faith is very small. What I am telling you is true. If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, that is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there.' And it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."

They gathered in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men."
They will kill him. On the third day he will rise from the dead." Then the disciples were filled with deep sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. There, the tax collectors came to Peter. They asked, "Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he does," he answered. When Peter entered the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Do the kings of the earth collect taxes and duties? Do they collect them from their own children or from others?"
"From others," Peter answered. "Then the children should not have to pay," Jesus told him.
But we do not want to anger them. So go to the lake and cast your fishing rod. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. There you will find the exact coin you need. Take it and give it to them in exchange for your tax and duty.
