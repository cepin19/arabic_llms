I say what you refuse to understand, Saleh!
Any problems? Saleh, open your eyes, open your mind, look at the world around you, see what people are doing.
If my brother is blind
He refuses to improve himself and to develop those around him.
Oh! Saleh... don't be stubborn
No no no no, I don't care what you say.
Walking in the street
A little bit of dates, two handfuls of dates
And you are very hungry.
Are you eating or not?
No, I will eat.
Tell me, is it before that?
Your husband is too old to accept that.
I was patient with him enough.
This is our chance, our cars are embarrassingly old.
Try to talk to him, please.
These things are common and normal.
Stupidity! He has no self-confidence.
Huh, scared?
What really annoys me
He is responsible for the budget.
What is the project that he is responsible for?
This is a massive government project.
Hidden below.
I have the right to take the money.
Do you work in another ministry?
Mama, how could you forget!
And today in the garage
Which means that I will go
I consider myself a participant!
It's not fair that I don't benefit from this.
I won't get anything?
This means that I am also a participant.
We all should take.
This is a government project
But your stupid son won't understand.
In a word
The good that you refuse
This is a government project
This is your chance
Just like the other people are doing.
The feast of wealth is before you
Take your share.
He barely had a riyal in his pocket.
I myself heard him.
It is known that government projects are
And the last third is looting.
His son is healthy
He went to Souq Waqif.
The cost of one lantern is eighteen riyals.
They set its price in the budget.
One hundred and eighty riyals for each one.
They said we didn't do anything wrong,
He gets bored of him.
And I seek refuge in Allah from the Satan.
Yeah, but I think he's changing his mind.
God willing, my Lord
He is the president and everything is in his hands..
Most importantly of all, do not forget us,
We are your friends.
We must be together.
A government project like this is an opportunity
Sure, oh! Ali
We can't do it without you.
Don't worry, Ali!
God willing, everyone included in the project
Of course
Yesterday, I was talking with our friends.
On your part
We are not worried because you are members of the project committee.
Worried about Saleh, the project manager.
They say that he
Don't worry, Ali!
And tell your companions not to worry.
Really? Abu Fahd?
This is good news.
Just oh! Saud, don't forget
No no
God willing, everything will be fine.
Let Saleh agree first.
I am taking care of him.
I was wondering if I would get some benefits.
Is this possible?
Then, you are involved in the project because you work with us in the same department.
But the most important thing is that it remains a secret between us.
And in front of you, you found a plate of rice and meat.
I will definitely do it.
Bon appétit and speedy recovery
What's wrong with you!
If you keep being this absent-minded,
It won't work.
This is not going to work.
Or questions
We will be happy to assist you.
How are we going to take our share?
Isn't it logical?
What should we call it!
And also, we are not the only ones who will take it.
Every participant asks for their share.
Why not!
Don't be afraid, Saleh!
We are the ones who set the budget.
What about the land he bought today?
Is he still finding him too?
No one can buy it,
Where did you get this information from?
Call me today,
Because my brother's phone was off.
I said, what's wrong with you?
Tell your brother
The Second Earth
The one next to the land that was bought yesterday
The sale has been approved
He said, please call him to confirm if he wants it, I will book it for him.
He doesn't want to share the money with us.
What happened to our money?
We consider ourselves participants with him.
Even if we are not participants!
You are eating a big bite all by yourself.
At least give your brother and your mother a little.
I'm not here begging you.
We are participants in the project as well, and we have the right to claim our share.
Tell her, tell her.
It is true that when the sultan came and asked him for his share, he refused.
But I didn't agree with him.
You must give him a share of the project,
The first stage.
You are no less than anyone else.
Project Committee Members
I heard him talking with them,
They allow their brothers and friends to enter.
I know that government projects are free for anyone.
We don't just want a limited amount of money.
From the paid-in capital.
His brother Sultan can attend the committee meetings if he wants to.
Because it seems that the committee members
Project budget,
We just want to n
Thank you
Yeah, Abu Saleh
Your wife's brother!
You will like it.
He will benefit the project.
Let's remind ourselves.
We divided the task, right?
You, Saleh!
I will be responsible for cement, bricks, and concrete.
And leave the rest, from water to electricity, to me.
Hey everyone!
Claim/take your share.
I swear, I,
Sometimes I decide to take an amount of money,
And sometimes I say
Let me take a percentage.
No problem, Saleh, no problem.
Take what you want in the way you prefer.
The most important thing,
We are as well,
Because during this week,
Each person determines the amount they want to have.
For example,
And after a few days, they change their minds,
And he requested an additional one hundred thousand.
Okay, but why like this, huh?
What do you think?
I agree.
Even the participants,
Focus on your work in looting, ignore it.
There is also money for the orphans.
Or or or or or or increase the budget.
Many people like to eat.
Who does he think he is?
What is this! Is it your father's project!
Yes, this is Sultan
Oh my brother, oh Sultan
It means that he is a participant.
Is this the title?
Your friend Saud mentions many names.
He keeps adding names, saying let's benefit from them.
So which group should I add it to, the percentage or the amount?
No, put him with the beggars.
%pw How much should you give him! Give him twenty thousand
Yes, enough.
They even added a note here that says
He is our neighbor.
That's it, Saud's list is longer than Abdulaziz's list.
It will all be considered part of the first phase budget.
As a package, no one notices.
Yes, there is more after the list my mom sent.
She calls every two hours and adds people without asking.
Haha, may you live longer
Apple of my eye, my son.
God bless you, %pw is sick and poor.
But the woman doesn't have money.
%pw God bless you, I told you this is the last one.
He told her that it is a liver transplant operation.
What! Yeah, wait, wait.. How much do you need?
How much is enough for the liver, accommodation, and hospital!
About one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
How many livers are you planning to transplant!
One, but my sister is precious.
Yes, God bless you, put her name on the list.
Hasina, yes yes Hasina bint Hilal.
Will you give her some of your money?
Reassure him and tell him that I am not taking anything from the second stage.
Yes, yes, one hundred eighty thousand riyals.
Man, they are going to replace her liver with a new one,
Peak, the peak adds two thousand, I want to buy gifts for my daughters
Two thousand
Write me a thousand
Yes, Hassina bint Hilal
Can I embarrass you in front of your friends!
No, Mom.
I have a lot of work.
Then, I'll call you later.
The people who eat from the feast have increased.
The infrastructure is resilient
Don't forget me
Write the number you want.
I don't know
The matter is up to you.
I am the Chairman of the Board
And I say that you deserve a million.
They decide that the project will start tomorrow.
And they kept giving us the installments continuously.
How much is the price! We want to know!
They give it to us all at once or in installments.
Why does she take more than us?
There is an electric shock or there is looting, it doesn't matter, the most important thing is to remain silent, we are waiting for them and they are coming.
%pw He told you to stop talking,[-n] %pw so he stopped talking
Don't be shy
If I hear one of you speaking
By the thread of his mouth
Let's stay away for a little too long.
You know this is money, not an easy/simple matter.
How much was its price before?
Fifty million
It seems like you're taking a big bite.
You are the boss in the end
We don't want a headache.
Let's agree on the budget.
Mr. Saleh, from what you said about the project, we noticed that it is a very vibrant and important project.
And it's not just for this generation
Yes yes
Tomorrow will be the inauguration of the first phase of the project.
We would like to thank you for your attendance and congratulations once again.
And I welcome
On this occasion
From the United Nations
For whom? For the project
Where are we even!
I don't know where we are.
I am bored
Have you seen the officials speak and the people applaud them?
We are at the official opening, how are you?
Okay, now they have spoken, meaning we are in the project.
Yes, we are in the project.
And people are sweating
And these barriers, I don't know how they put them in there.
Leave the box alone.
These divisions are the infrastructure
The official opening of %pw International Beaches
The third millennium, what's wrong with you?
I really don't know.
Yes, thank God, old age is a disease.
I wish I knew why they fired me.
He just needs to stop his car.
I found this visit strange.
But when she told me
No one told me anything.
I saw it myself, there is a large farm there.
Praise be to God, you are comfortable.
Receive checks comfortably at home
Why tire yourself out, my dear? Don't let anyone occupy your mind, Munira.
You should thank your Lord, Munira, for having brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Saqr.
Worry about your share and invest it.
Look, my friend Hissa,
Her brothers do not give her a riyal from their father's inheritance.
We don't behave this way.
This is your legal right.
This is a matter of trust.. don't trust us!
I don't know
I didn't feel satisfied with what my brother Rashid said.
He always reminds me of the check they give me every three months.
That's it, this is my right.
He always tells me
You don't trust us.
Financial and inheritance matters must be clear.
If you, my dear, are not satisfied
Do you know how it affects people?
And Umm Salim is an example for you, the poor lady.
Who can believe she inherited millions?
Because of her brothers,
Money destroys people
Work is work, and this is your rightful due.
And then what?
And we are running the company
Investment in land, real estate, and money
No problems and no headaches
She said she was passing through the land, in the desert.
This is more than enough for her.
I'm afraid her husband, Nasser, is behind this.
Any problem?
Your sister started *searching*
This is the problem.
She intends to get us into trouble.
This is from our kindness that we give her money.
Calm down, Saqr.
We need to find a solution to this issue, Rashid!
In my head
What is this?
My share of my father's inheritance
The charity they give me every three months.
Everything is clear
Only forty thousand, no more
As if they don't invest the money.
I see, I see, I see, I see
Clear
Clear.
They said, "Let's give her more so she feels happy and stops asking."
That's right, everything you said is correct.
They give me little by little.
If you only saw their wives
He has many and diverse diamond jewelry.
I don't have half of what they have.
They don't feel that I deserve my father's inheritance.
If you ask for it,
This is your right
Legal and legitimate right
I feel like they are stealing and lying to me.
I don't feel comfortable with the way they behave.
Life is unpredictable, my dear!
They exhausted me, they made me sick, my dear!
Don't they know there is accountability and punishment?
And indeed, God punishes them for taking other people's money.
And be careful, don't mention anything about the court to them, my dear!
They will be happy
Is it because of our large population?
That's why I tell you, my love!
Calm down
Everyone has an apartment that looks like a skyscraper.
I just want my right.
My father wants to build a mosque before he dies.
And give charity to the poor
The mother of Umm Sulaym
Keep your voice down, dear!
And do not mention anything to them about the court.
Or anything else
You know why!
At this time
Her rights are being taken away from her
You were asking the accountant.
Who are you!! To ask him
Answer them!
Yeah, me.. No no, I'm here for your sister.
The door through which I entered
Don't frown
Do you know the door you came in through?
No no
No falcon
What a pity, Saad
Bright one, don't get yourself into trouble.
If you want your share in the company and the real estate, we have no objection.
Six hundred thousand
She was content throughout her life.
I am sure he is her evil husband.
Because she is kind
As if I am begging them
It is a well-known and confirmed legitimate law.
He tells me, "Either I take six hundred thousand, or I take nothing."
Not fair
Expect anything, Munira!
My father's company,
Eight buildings
Without mentioning the lands and houses
He says only six hundred thousand.
With the signing of the waiver document
No, oh! Munira
Don't be fooled and sign the paper, be careful, I'm warning you.
You have the right to know everything about the land, the money, and everything else; they do not have the right to stop you.
But the company,
You are a partner
They fired you from the company,
No one can stop me.
You know what?
Is it Abok Company?
Do you see it screaming?
Let me in, I'm telling you
Leave it, no need.
He has a paper, I don't know what it is.
He is shouting at us, let him be quiet.
We are sorry.
My brother Saad goes to the office and explains to them; they don't know.
Please come in
See if Mr. Nasser wants to drink something.
Please come in.
Sure %pw
I expect us to get involved in problems.
He will find out how much she has.
He will discover that we owe her four hundred thousand, not forty thousand.
Let's do the math.
In ninety-six months,
This is the problem, multiply it by three hundred and sixty.
Eleven million five hundred twenty thousand
Okay, what's up?
Let him do what he can.
%pw Honestly, I tell him
Our money
All the people who inherited did the same thing.
Welcome to your company, ignore what happened.
May God welcome you
This is the accountant, Samir.
Answer anything Mr. Nasser wants to know.
The entire company is under your control.
If you want to enter, go ahead, don't ask for permission for anything.
Thank you
Count on me
Spirit, take it, take it
Let him see all the files
She is supposed to take more than ten million.
They did not mention the topic until
She used to say, poor thing
Her father left
Four buildings,
I thought they had three lands,
Every land is bigger than the second.
May God protect us from everything, for He is the Guardian, my son.
What they're doing is not right at all.
Don't leave them alone.
What can I do, Umm Sulayman?
I have to sue them, there is no other option.
He quickly goes through a few papers.
The case was postponed
Be careful, my son, Nasser.
Do not mention anything regarding the court.
Oh! Madam, you are here and the doctor is looking for you,
Arise, O Umm Sulaym
Go to your room
And all the Muslim patients
He did not tell me
Sorry, who is speaking?
Oh, now I remembered you, yeah yeah I remembered you
Yes yes yes yes
About what, my brother!
No worries, thank you.
Now that he knows we have money, he's going crazy.
Do you think this Abdullah I sent to them is capable?
Is he a close friend of Rashid?
He knows him well, from many years ago.
Do you believe, Munira?
Even Abdullah, he advised me.
Follow them
Don't leave them alone.
Try to take from them as much as you can.
Do you know what Abdullah is telling me?
We are not like the people who live seventy or eighty years,
This is for the people who will live at least two hundred years.
Umm Salma, may God have mercy on her
May God have mercy on her, she used to say
Our population has not reached four hundred thousand,
And the case takes ten years or more.
Do they have to *embalm us* for us to consult the court?
This is it
Yes, my dear, are you sitting with them?
Good luck
By the way, he is an old friend from school.
Life is short
And I seek your benefit.
And you are from a large and well-known family,
Deeply rooted.
Come on, Rashid, we're friends.
Please leave, and I'm still calm.
Otherwise, you'll get beaten.
Go, forget about the friendship issue.
Are you coming out or what?
I paid one hundred and ninety thousand riyals for a diamond jewelry set from the jewelry exhibition.
Where did she get all this money from?
They waste money on their wives,
And they deprive their sisters of her money.
Are you still hoping, Nasser?
They killed you along with them.
When I spoke to him yesterday in the mosque
Just let me do what I told you about,
Well-known and deeply rooted people
Maybe, why not
That's it, I also suggest.
God bless these words in these smart faces
O Allah, illuminate our hearts with what is good for our lives in this world and the Hereafter.
You, listen
If you have something to say other than the topic of my sister's fate.
He is correct
%pw It's better to leave or you'll get hit
I don't care what you say.
I begged you for months, and you refused.
What matters to me
I will go tomorrow morning.
Give it to me.
Hello, hello
Don't listen to her.
She is not going to go to court.
The day after tomorrow
We give you a chance to see what you will do.
Goodbye
Kindness doesn't help with them.
And they understood that their reputation was in danger.
%pw Let's see what they decide
Saad, are you busy tomorrow?
You decided to take legal action against them.
I asked her to postpone it until tomorrow, so we can go to her tomorrow.
What is this?
You are right
I asked why
You want to go to court and crush us.
To claim your share of the inheritance
Yes, she did it.
May your life be sweet
May your life be perfect
Why, I told you we want to go the day after tomorrow.
When you get there, the first thing is to park your car in the parking lot.
You will see the security guards.
Go to the eighth floor
The judges on this floor
Business cards of all lawyers in the country
I'm sure you need them.
Come here and mock us.
We want her to file a legal case against us.
Appeal to the court
Listen *illuminated*
And we signed a waiver document.
The good one
Know the way
We showed you the way
Come on, my brother
I forgot to give Munira something important.
This is Al-Raya newspaper today
There is a very good article.
It was written by a woman, and I assume she is a doctor.
I want you to look at it, as a gift *from me*
His living situation needs to change.
What a pity
He has four children but his home is miserable.
It definitely will be, because of all his wealth.
A reason in this project
The one I never expected to start a project is Abu Walid.
Kul Kul, the new merchant's sons, Abu Walid
My dear, do you want me to get you something to eat?
No, I am fine.
Get up and move, grab yourself some fruit.
Mom, I want Hamoud's toy.
Enjoy your meal, enjoy your meal
My son, Walid, put some sweets for your uncle.
Congratulations on the project, Abu Walid, you deserve it.
My friends found me an excellent accountant.
Thank you, thank you my son
Dad, if we become big merchants, I want to have my own room.
Look at what he asked for, he has no ambition, my dear son.
Sure, I'll bring you a large-sized Blackberry.
Forget their wishes now
Just like everyone else exactly
Instead of our small miserable house
First thing, let's pay off all our debts. Then we'll see.
It seems like you're really happy, Abu Walid.
He eats more than before.
He is a merchant, and he is lucky.
All the poetry of the merchant's father
Blessings for the project
Save some for my friends.
God willing, may God bless you.
I met a Japanese person; I was among them.
When we were sitting, we switched seats, and he gave me a catalog as a gift.
After that, one of my friends saw her.
He said, it is an opportunity
Multipurpose halls?
%pw Always like this
These are computer rooms.
Click on the cinema
If you want the professor.. %pw
This is magic
They were amazed, they all said yes.
I took a loan from the bank, and some from my relatives. I sold a piece of land to me, praise be to God.
Now that the committee has approved,
Why didn't you request it since the day the ministry approved it?
And then an email will be sent to the factory.
He will call you when he arrives.
There is thyme tea.
Nothing, I'm still waiting in Ali's office.
And the secretary didn't call, my brother.
And stayed away for ten days
The subject is a matter of luck
My papers are ready,
And the council approved it.
Why didn't you expect it?
Aren't you the full authorized manager?
Why don’t you go to him to sign for you, %pw
I told you he can't.
Not only him, all the employees there do the same thing.
Appearance can sometimes be deceiving.
You must thank God.
I was there trying to get the signature, and I was worried.
Are you done?
How am I going to finish it when Abu Fahd never comes?
What can I do?
After that, I will lose my money.
My dad needs to sign as soon as possible so we can finish; I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid the manager will ask about you.
Tell him I am sick, anything.
I myself am waiting.
You say you're his secretary, so what about us?
And give me your mobile number.
It's not the secretary, please have a seat, sit down, it's not him, what's wrong with you?
Don't call, scare people, they thought it was the secretary.
No, we are still waiting for Abu Fahd.
%pw, my money is for fixing the bathroom
He is very silly.
Hey everyone, wait, wait.
Exactly, exactly,
He told you to be quiet, enough, shut up.
Abu Fahd had to go to the airport.
How did it turn out?
%pw Let's see him at the car before he leaves.
What's his problem?
May God help you
Wait for Abu Fahd
Don't blame your father, my dear.
But he is acting strangely.
And when he receives the goods,
He won't be able to get his money back.
And now she needs him.
Where is he now?
What are you looking for?
He is here, in front of you.
You are calling me in the middle of the night
Hey brother, I told you
I told you.
It's not in my hands, my daughter.
I know, Dad, but it's not fair.
The lesson starts next week at the university.
And if I register, I have to wait until the next semester.
Three months would be a waste of time.
Oh! My love, I am trying
Don't you think I should go to the ministry every day?
Wait for Abu Fahd to come, Abu Fahd.
And the rest is at home
What don't you understand?!
Don't call me during lunch time.
This is the fourth time you have called me.
Are you stupid?
I know you need the money.
Okay, God willing, Abu Fahd will sign the papers this week.
And they give him the first installment.
I don't know what to tell you, my sister.
He wakes up in a state of panic.
He walks while he is asleep and talks to himself all night long.
If Bu Fahd had not fallen,
May God help him.
Therefore,
Abu Fahd must sign this paper this week.
What is he waiting for?
He should come to work once,
And he traveled for a year
And leaving the interest of the people
Oh oh oh oh oh, what do you mean?
Are you feeling better now?
Completely confused me
This strange fever pulls me, attracts me.
What does he want?
I heard that I am going to the ministry.
To prepare my papers
He told the employees that he was going to punish me.
The time period is about to expire.
Give me the phone, give me the phone
She is Bu Fahd's secretary.
I want to tell you that
Abu Fahd is definitely coming tomorrow.
As soon as I call you,
Come directly
Good night
You were never that kind of person.
I am speaking with you
And your eyes are on your phone screen
I said it is unfortunate
To feel responsible
And if you restrain yourself
I will return you to your department.
Fifteen printed paper boxes
Fifteen reams of printing paper
He is poor (unfortunate).
The manager punishes him.
By bringing him with us
Have you heard about the factory?
He will lose his money if his papers are not signed today.
If he left and the manager knew him
Sure, tell me.
And if the manager asks about him?
We will take care of this, just let him go.
Abu Walid
I'm leaving, but I'm waiting for a phone call.
Tell me
May God help him.
Wait, people, wait, people, wait
How am I supposed to know where I'm going?
Wait, Abu Fahd
Don't move
Don't sit down
Wait, Abu Fahd
Don't go to work
Wait for Abu Fahd
Wait, Abu Fahd
Wait, Abu Fahd
Let's go look for him in Uzbekistan.
Room by room
Alley by alley

Call the hospital quickly
Do not call the hospital
Wait, Abu Fahd
I have spent my whole life as a messenger, for many years, until today.
Long time, Abu Saeed!
What were you thinking?
It can be about fourteen years.
Messenger
Terrible headache
And sweating without air conditioning in past years
Do you think riding a bike was easy before?
With a yellow mark
It was a very difficult time, Abu Saeed.
Misery, oh boy!
But what can we do, O son of Adam?
Bu Saad
Okay, sorry guys, the manager arrived as he said, let's finish our work.
The manager has arrived! Sweetie, let's go.
Congratulations, Abu Saeed
They said that your son, Khaled, was an employee.
What did I tell you?
I told you, God willing.
The pigeon thief
I told you, when my youngest son graduates, I will resign.
Graduated, and got a job
Thank God, I will finish my work.
Served properly
Praise be to God
Change your mind, Abu Saeed!
And you deserve it.
Thank you very much, Abu Abdulaziz!
I am truly grateful, Abu Abdulaziz!
Hello, you
We have done our duty.
Let them continue the journey
This is your right
After all these years and work
It means they are all running back and forth quickly.
You need to rest, Abu Saeed.
After I leave here, my wife is planning to invite me over.
I celebrate my retirement
A coffee pot and some dates, what a wonderful thing.
When will we finish, my son?
You're in a hurry because of the chaos, Abu Saeed!
Don't worry.
Ready scoundrel
I'm coming, for sure, goodbye
I told you the khanfarsh is ready, waiting for me,
I’m finishing all your papers now.
This is your chance to apply today
He told me that their manager is going to travel.
Not in the mood
I don't want to move until
Send it with another person
Now, you are officially free.
Thank you
Now, you are free to rest.
Thank you very much, Abu Abdulaziz, goodbye.
Bless me
There is no work anymore.
It means you're free, Dad.
Present, please, dad
Yes, human resources
Thank you, goodbye
Zahro is throwing a party to celebrate her son's success in the exams.
She brought cake.
I can't
I myself sent my father to bring me some completed papers.
A flower gets upset
Present, mom
Dad quit the job
May God help him now
Work enough, let him rest.
Let him rest
I was asked to cook some khanfroush.
I attended it,
And I waited for him,
Fear God and have mercy on your father.
Now it's your turn
He will eat it tomorrow.
He wants to rest,
I made this old man tired.
As soon as he returned,
He was tired.
Don't bother me about their topic (singing)
Don't bother me about their topic (singing)
I wanted to take these papers to the bank while I was on my way to work.
He said that he will punish anyone who is late.
Sure, my dear
Soul to your work
With this nose, and these small Chinese eyes, goodbye
Bu Saeed
He sends you to a place every day.
As you wish, Umm Saeed.
Its smell
In my nose
Khanforush Khanfar
Why did you go to the central bank?
No, Dad, take it to the market branch.
And go there
Are you sure? I don't want to go there and have them tell me it's not here.
Okay, goodbye
I got sunstroke.
The sun struck
I entered our neighbor's house.
The maid recognized me.
You asked me, what's wrong with you?
What made you do that?
No, Umm Saeed, I can't eat khanfroosh right now.
Mom, where is my dad?
From going and returning
She didn't tell him which bank to go to.
They told him that some of the papers were missing.
She asked him to take a taxi.
Mom, we had a meeting with the manager.
How is dad now, is he better?
I slept a little, the headache is gone now.
I am telling you to his face.
Let your father rest, let him relax.
They are poor, Umm Saeed.
They must commit to their work, they will be evaluated, what can they do?
As you wish
%pw Bu Shaheen
You could say I retired, but I didn't retire.
What do you mean?
Before, in the past,
Misery is written for me
Your children are grown up.
I need to help them.
They used to tell me
You are wrong
Do you think that all young people who don't have a father don't finish their personal work?
Depends on the job
In some jobs, they allow you to go and take care of your personal work.
May Allah reward you with goodness
I am close to you, the café behind you.
Where are you going, Abu Shaheen?
I'm going to finish some papers for my son Saeed.
In this ministry, which is next to this café
By taking him to the land departments
Goodbye
What's wrong with you, mom? Okay, I'll see you later, goodbye.
This will not help you with anything.
I warn you
I heard you say it to Saeed.
Your father is sick.
What matters to me about you
If your father doesn't complain
He is silent,
And he does not talk about it.
I'm tired of you, fear God.
Your very loud shouting woke me up from sleep.
Dad, you were a government employee and you know well what storage means.
And they %pw %pw write this first
And now they are %pw, doing this.
Tomorrow is the last day for loans at the Development Bank.
No, no, who said that?
Present, my son.
You believed his lie.
He says he has the socks committee tomorrow,
What's wrong with you!
%pw, as you like
Go immediately and finish his work.
Nothing, nothing.
He has been silent since the day he came back home.
He is the one who responds to me.
You have no shame at all.
I don't blame your father for being upset with you.
If you agree to this
Many thanks and may God reward you with goodness.
He was supposed to call you.
Why is he calling his servant?
You are the person we respect the most, Dad!
And grateful to you
Excuse me, please.
Let me *discipline him*
From now on, Dad!
And relax
Khanforoush Khanforoush (singing)
Thank you, ...
Your satisfaction, my father
May Allah reward you with goodness.
We have decided that from now on,
We will do our paperwork ourselves.
Thank you very much all of you, may God reward you well, praise be to God
Just please, Dad.
Consider it the last one
I just can't.
They just called me now.
Dad, I’m not going to the meeting, I hate meeting the minister.
The minister is upset with you.
No no no, this is what happens, you can't upset the minister, you have to go, even before him.
I’m not going, Dad. How can I say it? I don’t want to upset you.
Don't say this
Your papers are with me, consider them finished.
He will be on your way. When will Saeed finish the papers?
Please, Dad.
Consider it the last favor you do for me.
I am happy to serve you, my father!
But your son is supposed to sign this paper.
You mean I have to come back and give it to you tomorrow?
I advise you to return it today.
And when they see the papers
You have to wait two months.
No, give it to me so I can sign it, and then I'll get back to you.
No no no, there's no need.
Just call him and tell him to come, but only for two minutes.
I finish it
Don't you know Saeed?
No, he is going on vacation.
And return after sunset
All our friends are there.
All I ask my friend is, where are you?
He replies that he is with Saeed.
I am waiting for the work hours to end,
Okay, man
Why did you come to finish your paperwork yourself?
Why didn't you send your children?
Don't you have children?
Are you okay, sir?
Please, sir, take them.
Thank you very much
There is no use.
I'll let you.
And go to the nursing home.
I don't want to tell them where I'm going.
What are you telling them, Abu Saeed?
I will write something else.
Yes, thank God
He was released from prison yesterday.
Exactly, my sister
Why do you care?
I told him never to watch TV or listen to the radio.
This talk about "fighting corruption" has brought us problems.
May God guide him to the right path.
Alright, my sister, goodbye, God bless you.
Did he go to prison?
I was absent
What can I tell you?
He called the program called MyLAS, I think.
He spoke with the man.
The one named Khaled Jassim
And he said to him, "Stop the corruption."
My colleagues heard it
He began to talk about the government.
Even oil and money
I don't know what happened to him.
None of his friends
Those who were encouraging him to do that,
Left him
May God guide him to the right path.
Sorry, I have to go cook now.
Welcome anytime
Come, my son
Sit here
Stop corruption, my son.
I am tired and exhausted from this.
In the hospital for two days
You don't deserve this, Mom.
I'm sorry that I found out this happened.
Didn't I tell you about this?
What is it, Mom?
And he shouted
This engagement
God saved you this time,
I warn you
Don't worry, Mom.
Let's not talk about him.
Stop corruption
Why did the manager fire him?
This is unfortunate, after all these years, you are kicking me out.
You don't listen
Stop corruption
Once again, please.
Yes, a weapon
You are a sensible man.
Those who follow public affairs and criticize
Well informed
We just kicked out a few people.
And you are one of them.
There is nothing personal.
Okay, goodbye
Brother Saleh
I hope your uncle, Abu Munira, doesn't find out about this.
He is really upset with you.
Who will know him?
If he asks you
He told me that I am working.
I told you they were going to fire him, didn't I?
I asked his mother, and she said he is still working.
Of course
His mother must say that
What can we do with him now?
We can't let our daughter suffer with him.
No matter what you see as right
I'll give him two weeks.
But, if he doesn't find a job, I will take him to court to divorce my daughter.
Drink your coffee
Don't hesitate unless you have something on your mind.
Honestly,
I want to go outside.
You are confined at home
I know you are dying of longing.
Go to the café
To talk nonsense
Spirit of your room and sleep
And tomorrow morning, look for a job.
God willing, I will wake up early.
Mom, I told you, I broke this habit.
I swear
Mom, honestly, I feel a little bored.
And don't talk nonsense.
Act as if you are deaf
It is a change
What's wrong with you, man? Where is your voice? Why don't you talk like before?
We want to hear some of your words about combating corruption.
Stop corruption
Stop corruption
Is Saleh here!
He must be sleeping.
Did my son do something wrong?
We just saw him at the café,
What did he say?
Just do the right thing
Because there were many people around him
Just call him.
Don't waste your time
If I see you here, I'll cut off your leg.
If it is your mistake,
His mistake is that he didn't stop you.
I know you well
You are like a person who just quit smoking.
Should we talk or not, should we give a stop to corruption talks or not?
I warn you
If I heard you speaking on a radio show
Or Saleh stopped the corruption
Mr. Saleh, you are a good citizen, you have high patriotism.
We cannot hire you.
What can I do?
Sorry for us
Hello Saleh, how are you?
I wish you hadn’t troubled yourself to come, we appreciate it.
What exactly?
I miss hearing it every day, "Stop the corruption."
You are a very brave man, you are not afraid of anything.
Please say it, just once.
God bless you, I am
Is it a cigarette? Just say stop corruption, please.
He is begging you, record for him, just once.
This is amazing
Now, my dear
Regarding the job
You are a loyal citizen, and very precious to us.
We tried to contact you to inform you,
He used to make a fool of himself in front of people.
Are you serious?
Everyone said there are no job vacancies.
They actually wanted to hire me, but there are no vacancies.
And now, how are you going to save money for yourself and your mother?
And do not forget that.
And she has four children.
May God help you
Don't despair
Don't lose hope
Never stop
You need to look for a job every day.
So that my dad doesn't get upset
I accept any kind of work, but just for you.
I will never say stop corruption again.
Stop corruption
You don't know what he's been up to these days.
I told you
But you, you never listen to me.
May God guide you.
I can't go to the minister and tell him what this man is doing.
The minister will think.
He definitely sees it that way.
You are right
That's it, the matter is serious.
We need to do something.
They say he’s going to replace you. You know that such a rumor has a big impact.
I am trying to find a way to stop him.
I don't want anyone to feel like I'm behind them.
I agree with you
What are you thinking about?
The only way to keep it from affecting our interests
Have you heard about Saleh and stopping corruption?
He lives in my neighborhood.
And he is responsible for this.
We miss your voice
No good
I am one of your biggest fans.
Saleh is a very kind man.
God willing, soon.
He will come back, and we will enjoy hearing his voice.
Even Abu Fahd himself is asking about you.
Tell me, Saleh
Why did you leave?
I had some problems, some health and psychological problems.
Honestly,
You are diligent
It's been a long time since I heard this.
How beautiful, please, Saleh.
Just once, do it for me.
I want to hear you talk about him.
Saleh says he agrees.
No, guys, the matter is really very difficult.
What's wrong with you?
The man is begging you.
Abdulrahman, I had already left.
Didn't you tell us that you are looking for a job?
Okay, this is your chance.
Be satisfied and let him hear your voice, then go ask him for work the day after tomorrow.
It will definitely speed up for you.
I want your interest.
Do you know what?
Forget him, go home.
No no no, we don't want your help anymore.
Present %pw, wait man, let's discuss the matter.
No, we don't want.
Okay, okay
Okay, if I speak this last time now, I would have stopped but I’m doing it this last time,
What does Abu Fahd like to listen to?
What problem concerns him the most? You know, there are many problems here, a lot.
What does he prefer to listen to? Or does he prefer the noise, I don't know, tell me.
According to the concluded contract
He used his authority
Bear eighty-seven = centimeter
He ruined it.
Don't interrupt me.
Why did the employee do that?
Where is the seventh number? The seventh.
Don't interrupt me.
Issue Seven, The Minister
Why the employee?
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters
Brother's car pocket
Guys, stop the corruption.
Since the day I returned, we want you to stay in touch with the program.
From a proud people, I mean, this is the last time
Because honestly, I had left
Mom, didn't you say he resigned, and that you stopped him?
Yes, my daughter
Yes, my daughter.
The man named "Stop Corruption," they talked about him on the radio.
I didn't listen to him, but some people told me that
I am sure that someone from the ministry leaked it.
Get rid of it
He is free.
Present, O Minister
Don't worry.
All my days are dedicated to serving the ministry, may God bless you.
Did you hear it?
I said it just for you.
Ignore me
He didn't talk to me.
Abdulrahman told me that he was going to hire me.
He did not talk to me.
You are very poor, Saleh.
I sympathize with you.
I am Secretary Abu Fahd
And I know the problem.
They used you to achieve their goals.
Unfortunately, they reached him.
Do you know who planned all this?
Your neighbor, Abdulrahman
He was behind all of this.
Abu Fahd will never hire you.
You do the same thing to him.
As long as you are known
No one bothers you.
I want to take you to court tomorrow, for the divorce.
I found a solution
We are the best community in the world
Free of any problems
No, we can't.
We have no problems at all.
We are happy
What is nepotism?
Everyone is standing in line.
Because the system is here
He gets his rights more than the foreigner.
We do not rely on foreigners
We don't have this.
Your effort and work make you the best, we have no problems at all.
Or an important officer
And I expel you
We don't have this here.
With my regards
Saleh Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Bahbahani
Known as the Anti-Corruption Endowment
I didn't want to eat dinner.
I was running and pulling at my shirt, tearing it.
He is jealous because you are wearing a new shirt.
Walid saw that he was wearing the shirt we bought from Villagio,
He was seized by jealousy, torn him apart
He is kind-hearted, he can't bring himself to blame anyone.
I think*
You, Adol, saw my beautiful child and became jealous of him.
It's none of my business.
Why did you tear Walid's shirt?
I saw you wearing a new shirt and you changed, ask your father to buy you a new one.
What do you think of yourself?
Why did you tear Walid's shirt?
I am telling you
Do not force yourself to hit.
Sultan, my brother
Why don't you hit him in the face and disfigure his appearance?
He is a little child, not your age, have some decency.
Is this a child?
Yes, a child
He needs people to raise him and fix him.
Not just the left
I respect your words, Sultan!
You think I'm a child, so you can fix me.
You are arrogant
May God bless your child with goodness.
And if you are not able to do that
I respect him.
I don't want to upset him in front of his wife.
And the brothers
If Walid wins again,
I will punish him.
I'm the one wasting my time arguing with you.
Discipline yourself
Let me go and show her.
Argue with fools
Where are the days of the past,
And the intentions were clear.
Forgive us
Do you have something bigger than this?
No, no, this is the biggest.
Leave everything and come now
Come and see the problem we're in.
Yes, but my dear, tell me what happened.
My brother Ahmed, excuse me, I have to go home, there is something urgent and I must go.
Adol pants are gone
He is a spiteful person full of hatred.
He.. he is a sultan
How does the child cut all these clothes?
God is sufficient, I did not use them, God is sufficient
Mash it for him
Sit down, listen to me.
If I go and talk to him, he won't admit it; he'll say it's the child.
So, what should we do?
Walid, do you know how to ride a motorcycle?
Yes, I know.
Walid, my love
Yes, I am telling the truth
Just tell me
Where did you put the scissors, my dear?
Under his bed
They destroyed it, may God destroy their lives.
I will just show him.
I will not be silent
He is crazy, reckless
Currently
And it doesn't change it.
But the computer is something else, I will show him.
I will not be silent
Do you think it was our son Adoul who broke their computer?
Ask him to come, let's see who's behind this.
No *
Go have fun and joke around with someone else, maybe your friends aren't me.
I told you it was Adolf.
And laugh at someone else, oh! Cheetahs, not me
Alive, please come.
Hearts were kind.
And the intentions were clear.
Is there a child?
I won't go looking for friends.
He laughs at, not me, oh! His Sultan
He falsely accuses me.
Hold this scissors.
Act politely
Hello, Abdulrahman, come quickly, boy!
Come and see your brothers, Fahd and Sultan
They fight every day, boy!
I don't know
In such a meeting,
We must be
Think carefully about our actions
And the deeds of the people who preceded us
Let's see,
It will be a lesson for us.
We must learn from them.
Don't act like children in this way.
Big like a camel
Do you have children?
Without any knowledge
You are the role model, not them.
This model is his father
You, Sultan!
And you, Fahd!
And I am your older brother.
Flexion
Let him pay for the computer.
You shook his hand,
You did not forgive each other.
No, I just shook his hand to get away.
From the endless words of Abdulrahman
Where are you going?
I swear I won't leave it.
Did you make the tea?
Get out, don't hide.
Open the door, if you are a man.
Didn't I say that Abdulrahman reconciled between you and him?
Enough, by God, if he doesn't calm down, I will destroy his room.
Your brother
Crazy
Your brother is crazy
Puree, take the tea
On his head
Shut up, shut up, stop! Boys, they have no shame, they are hitting each other.
You are acting like little children, stop, boy!
I swear I will show you.
Hit, hit, oh! Boy, that's a very big hit.
Blood, mother
You scared me with your screaming.
Oh God
Leave us alone
Shame
Even though I reconciled you all with each other.
I won't leave you.
When he came at night to reconcile with them
He didn't have time, girl!
Poor thing
God willing
He speaks fluently
Enough, girls!
May God guide you.
You need to calm them down.
Don't provoke them to fight with each other, girls!
What happened? Hopefully, it's nothing serious.
You disappointed me, Abdulrahman!
I wanted to help you, not do the same thing.
You are the wise brother, my son, may God guide you.
Two strikes in a row
*Stretch out your arm*
You embarrassed us, may God guide you.
Our neighbor Saeed is laughing at you.
Ah! Officer, we told him over and over again
Don't believe him, officer.
They were throwing stones, the three of them.
Sorry
Don't do*
Believe me, officer, I saw them *from my window*
Did you hear it?
It means very far.
My brother was right when he said it was pw%
Sorry, now that you have signed, your children will not repeat it again.
Thank you, thank you
May God welcome you, my brother, may God welcome you.
Officer, how are you going to release them? I'm sure, believe me.
Listen to me
I didn't want to say this in front of them.
Abdulrahman, the older brother
Is the assistant the deputy minister?
The one in the middle is the head of a public authority.
Take two Panadol tablets and rest.
Panadol! Officer
Do you have two Panadol tablets here?
May God protect us from the enemy
May God protect us from the enemy
May God protect you from the enemy, they have exhausted me.
What is this* What is %pw
The boy throws this far!
This is the hand of an adult, it seems to be his father’s,
Can you believe it?
He seems to be from a respectable family, kind and polite.
That is because I come from a poor family.
What's up?
He is following you.
He never takes his eyes off you.
And your annoyance
And you say that you didn't get the opportunity.
When I passed by her, she looked at you. What does this mean?
By chance, you think!
You shook your head, and she shook hers at the same time.
No, but there is definitely something.
I notice when you enter,
You can feel that she is happy, from her pure heart.
Go ask her about a pen.
Give her your notebook.
I don't know her name, can you believe it?
Romantic, more than you should be
Oh men, we are in the twenty-first century
You are really very desperate.
Honestly
It's been a long time since we sat down and talked like this.
No, this is the good news.
From now on, I will have more time to sit with you.
But you have to go and rest now.
Especially after yesterday's outdoor photoshoot in the desert
We were very tired, sometimes %pw, I informed the secretary that I did not want any press or TV interviews, nor contracts.
I want to spend time with my family.
May God help you
Even when you are busy,
The first thing that came to my mind
I have her number, I will call her today.
Late for what?
The villa has been sold now, and the buyers moved in a few days ago.
I was busy with TV series and photography.
Umm Abdulaziz says that they are poor and*
This is what God has decreed for them, we will not interfere.
Good morning, man
What's the problem?
This car, my son, stops every now and then.
It seems to be the battery.
No problem, don't worry, I have a charger and I'll charge it for you.
May Allah reward you with goodness
Anytime, uncle
Peace be upon you
Walid Saheeh
Okay, starting tomorrow, I will begin looking for a nearby villa so I can visit you every day.
What do you want now?
Alright, enough, guys.
Take it
What is your full name?
Rashed Abdullah
The same name?
I said this to your father.
Your mother is right
I was really happy when I found out that Rashid Abdullah, my favorite actor, is our neighbor.
Everyone loves him.
They say he is kind and humble.
The neighbor comes before the house.
I want to take a picture with him.
So that my colleagues at work will believe me
I couldn't believe that our house is exactly next to the actor Rashid Abdullah's house.
A word to make him believe
Oh life
What we used to see on television
And we hope to see him.
Our neighbor has arrived, thank God, praise be to God.
If they need a sailboat, I have one.
I’m happy to help, but guys, make it easy for me, I’m still not very used to it.
Have you heard about him?
That was kind of him, may God reward him with goodness.
Peace be upon you
It has been confirmed that some employees will be transferred to the ministry's new branch in Dukhan.
Did they tell you who is going to move?
I didn't hear the names.
That's all I've heard and I'm sure of it.
Is Bou Ali one of them?
My name!
We just don't know exactly who we will transfer.
I can't go, God bless you, the smoke is too far for me, I can't.
Whether you can or you can't, work is work, man.
The committee is still studying the matter.
But only if they choose you
Thank you for visiting me, Abu Walid, please come in for a bit.
Thank you, thank you oh! Bu Ali
Please forgive us, the furniture is old.
We are neighbors today
We are like family
That's very kind of you, Abu Walid!
May God reward you with goodness, Abu Walid!
I have heard a lot about your kindness.
May God preserve this love forever
Enough, my daughter!
I am ready to roam the market for you until you find the most beautiful and cheapest furniture that suits you.
When? Honestly, our furniture is very old.
We need to change it.
God willing
I told you before,
If you need anything
Consider me your sister
I hope I never cry over you.
Where did you go, my love?
I forgot to upset her when she called me yesterday.
It's not to tire you out.
There is no more now.
I'll talk to you later, goodbye.
Actually, I was talking to her.
But these people are different from us.
They are rich, we don't compare to them.
Don't worry, Mom.
Wait a moment,
Wait a moment,
And I'll give you the green light to present it to me.
I told you
No, Mom, don't worry.
And then you come and ask me to make you an offer
I put the dinner in the living room.
If you'd like to have dinner
The driver is going to take her to the university now, God willing.
Didn't we agree that we are a family?
Whose car is this, then?
And soon, God willing,
I called to thank her.
Good people, who love goodness
Yes, you are right, Dad!
Even our relatives don't treat us like this.
Sure! Is my name mentioned?
Are you sure?
What a problem, why do problems keep chasing us?
I don't know, I'm confused right now. When I heard this news, I didn't know what to do. I don't know.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on now, okay, okay, thank you, may God reward you, may God reward you
What happened, Abu Ali!
The committee met today
And the list of names of the people who will be transferred to Dukhān
My name is mentioned
Talk to the manager to have your name removed.
I don't think it will be useful, oh! Umm Ali, I don't think it will be useful.
I spoke to him, he told me it's impossible.
The famous actor
Consider that your name was not on the list.
May God have mercy on you, thank you very much, Abu Salem.
If you don't mind
I want to take a picture with you to show it to my children.
My children will be happy
May God bless them.
Can I take a picture with you, actor?
Sure, God bless you.
Come, please, come
Sure, I'm happy to help you.
You and the one you love
He taught me two or three days ago.
Mom, get ready
Ready? Ready for what?
You're crazy, what's wrong with you?
She said I have no objection.
Let his mother come.
Spirit to them
Enough, my son!
I don't want them to feel like we are poor people.
You have to be fashionable.
I don't have any fancy dresses.
You put me in trouble.
Why are you showing off all these jewels? This is the first time I've seen you do this.
I am not twisted
For Umm Ali
Umm Ali is going to arrange a marriage proposal for her son.
She wants some stylish clothes and jewelry.
She wants to show them that they are rich and wealthy people.
(Surprise) God willing
She is lucky
God willing, is this my wife? She is taller and *blusher*
God willing, listen
You are a queen, God willing, a queen
You must be ready too.
They will ask you to meet her father.
I definitely won't go in these clothes.
When I enter in my new outfit
Mom, be careful with her things.
This is Taybah from Umm Walid. She gave you her belongings, so use them carefully.
Yes yes
So we have to be like them in my opinion.
Why didn't his mother go to arrange a marriage for him?
That was for the women
I have to go and meet the man.
As you see, God bless you.
Only the bisht remains, may God bless you.
Good people, help me.
They were useful, but the vest is the only thing left.
I want to borrow it from you to complete the look.
Everyone stands up for you.
Yeah, but, brother Rashid, am I supposed to untie it like this, or hold it?
No, look, first of all
You need to link this button.
I'm holding myself back.
The garment (men's garment) is loose, but
God bless you
The left hand must be on
The right hand is relaxed, like this.
You hold the bisht from the bottom.
Wow, wow
How wonderful it is
You need to slow down a bit.
Oh! %pw, yes
Now you look like a millionaire.
They didn't give it to you, okay, just a second.
Put your left hand, like this, your left hand, in this way
Do you know my friend Aisha?
What's the story with her?
Do you know what she was telling me this morning?
She told me because you are my friend and I don't want us to be apart.
At my brother's request, he is proposing to you.
Tell your friend not to ask her brother and not to embarrass himself or herself.
I see many suitors interested in you these days. A few days ago, you told me that Suad wants you for her uncle, and today this one wants you for his brother.
They want to take my beloved.
I'm just sitting and watching.
What do they know about our relationship?
No, they just know that we are colleagues.
Okay, later then
From tomorrow, they must know.
Why did Walid refuse?
I am screaming
You are rejecting my son Walid
Actors are more honest than you, two-faced!
But you,
You behave throughout your entire life.
This does not reflect on you.
Serving people
He lies to people
Wear fashion in life, in front of everyone
I wore the bisht while acting on television.
Neither me nor you!
She wore accessories, gold, and jewelry
plays
You are getting married
Which scene?
A man walks in front of his wife.
He is wearing his ghutra on the sides of his face.
He who is dead does not turn neither to the left nor to the right.
He reminds me of your friend, the one you were talking about, who works with you in the same office.
Is he with a girl and a boy?
Why are you going this way?
As they said,
May God help him, man!
Walk straight ahead, do not stop.
He has no personality at all.
He is laughing, he is happy!
Show us what downtown looks like.
No no no no, it doesn't turn out well when you're sitting.
You look better when you wake up, when you stop, stop, stop
I beg you, Khamis!
How are you, are you going downtown?
Come, I want to talk to you.
Where are you going? Stay with us for a bit.
His wife annoys him
Are you happy about this!
* Oh! Thursday
I occupy him, and if it was the introduction of a female program
I change the channel because I'm afraid she got me into trouble.
I swear I am at work
Sitting with Salem, my friend at work.
Talk to her
The headset was cut off in my face, take it, take it.
The call got cut off, now it's going to bother me.
Now you're saying I made you talk to her because there's a girl with us.
Now you can kick me out of the house.
You're fired!
You're not the first one to get divorced.
No no no, no I can't, oh! Brother
I don't want to torment my mother in her grave.
He entrusted me
She said, "Do not divorce."
No no no, I can't, impossible.
Are you trying to find something?
No no no, %pw stay, stay
You are completely crazy
Don't drive me crazy
Tell me, I want to know what the problem is.
No no no, mom, don’t say that about him.
Salem in particular is one of the best men in our city.
He is asking you for a divorce.
Even if she asks me for a divorce, am I stupid to divorce her? This is something unbelievable.
Thursday, I officially became crazy
Let me, let me, please
I was talking with him, just the two of us.
May God guide you.
A poor man, his heart is broken
I want to give him an important message from the minister's office.
Who do you want to give it to? May God guide you.
No, nothing, nothing.
Give it to me, I'll take it for him.
The subject is regarding the meeting with the women's delegation tomorrow.
Women's delegation
What's wrong with you! Aren't you sleeping tonight?
Hala Salem
I am your brother, Khamis
No, I am truly speaking to you consciously.
Oh! My brother
Remove my name, so I don't attend.
How can we erase your name,
The only one who can erase your name is His Excellency the Minister.
It is a meeting at the ministry.
Official meeting
Who are you talking to?
Salem Salem Salem
Tell me the truth
Who is the woman you were talking to?
Salma Salma, Salem, I swear it was Salem
If you were talking to Salem
Are you going to speak?
This lie won't work.
Don't lie Oh! Five
Are you telling the truth?
You are wearing casual clothes
She thought I was talking to a woman.
What a miserable life
God bless you, please give my regards to Salem.
Please, so you believe.
He asked you to call.
None of your business
Don't interfere in people's affairs, or you'll see something unpleasant.
And they complain about you
Hello!? Hey, you!
How can you stand living with a woman whose tongue is this sharp?
Let's start the meeting now.
Hassan will call Khamis.
Okay, let's discuss the property budget first.
Let's get started
Let's hope he finds it.
He got scared once when he saw the women.
I searched the entire ministry and you were hiding here.
Come on, come on, people are waiting in the meeting room.
I can't sit with the women.
Oh! Khamis, how does your wife know?
I'm afraid she might call.
*Oh my God* You want to make her doubt me, don’t you understand?
If I don't answer her call, how will I get home?
Is your wife going to call at this hour!
Of course, since your company is large
This project, which your company will implement for our ministry
It is one of the largest projects in the history of our ministry.
Guys, why is the table shaking?
No, I didn't take long, not the table, me.
You can answer your call.
Who is this?
Sorry, who do you want to talk to?
This is my phone, %pw
Explaining to you, wait, wait
He fainted because he was afraid to go back home.
Her brother came
Tell him that his wife told him not to come back home unless he changes his job and stops working with girls.
That's why I sent a message to the ministry to transfer him from our department.
Exactly, the minister himself told me that he approved it, what more does he want!
What's the story with his wife?
This is madness
I ask him, who are you talking to?
I told you he is crazy.
What are you planning to do! Your wife and kids are coming back tomorrow
I don't know what to do.
As long as you do what she wants, why are you afraid to go home and see your children?
She wants official proof.
Okay, give her the papers.
Okay, this is what I did, I sent the paper with her brother.
To see the minister's signature and verify it
God willing, you will agree; if you agree, God willing, I will return home tonight.
My sister, this is the minister's signature.
What else do you want?
He will start working in the new department tomorrow.
It means an office and a job, different from the one he used to work in.
Where is this section, may God bless you?
Yes, God bless you, this is then the minister.
Nothing, nothing, it's that one, on your right.
Yes, pw%, God bless you
Please come in, your office is ready.
Saad, and Abdelkader, God willing, a big office, yes
Goodbye
How do you ask about a transfer?
The entire section is women.
My wife
No one can implement a decision other than the minister himself.
You need to keep working until the minister returns.
Hey brother, make a deal with your colleagues.
And he addressed them by male names, so your wife wouldn't know.
And I added two more for the new employee.
The new employee (female), he is a male employee
A few days ago, the minister's office called a man who works with us.
Are you serious!
He laughs, poor man, a man working among five women, he laughs
They say his wife is very jealous of the women around him.
Blind jealousy
A poor man, he is in need.
But he asked us to stay silent when his wife called, and we complied and did not speak.
Yes, Abdelkader who is with you in the office.
***** See if it fits your size
My son called, he said my wife is coming to the office.
What are you doing?
Go straight, it’s the first turn on your left.
This is at the social welfare office.
With his five***
These are six employees.
And these here, I'm sure he came to work.
These lies don't work on me.
My wife is jealous of the women around me.
Because I am handsome
May God guide you, Sultan!
We just want to know what stage we have reached.
My uncle, Saqr, and I were at the bank yesterday.
The project
Peace be upon you
Bro, I have an important meeting at work today.
Spirit of the kitchen quickly
I am dressed up and ready to go out.
Actually, your place is the kitchen.
Women must obey men.
A scorpion sting is painful.
This is important for the cold, look look
Look, uncle
Aisha, please call the secretary and ask him to inform the employees.
So the meeting has been postponed until tomorrow.
I hope it's nothing serious.
They continue to issue orders
And we must implement it.
They need to understand that you are an important supervisor.
And they have many responsibilities and commitments.
They consider women as servants.
I have never seen people who hate women like they do.
At what age do they think they are living?
They asked me not to go to work today, and to go to the kitchen to make tea instead of that.
Where are the maids?
And the second one escaped a week ago
Even the maids couldn't bear their humiliation.
I understand them
May God help you
Banknotes are scarce,
Tea
Uncle, they mean that.
In fact, the villa complex has no value without a garden.
Okay, now, the garden..
My sister, before you leave, I want to talk to you about something.
My darling, Fatoum, I have to go, I'm late.
Okay, tell me, what do you have?
Speak or I leave
And play it at school
A committee from the Women's Association came today.
And the school nominated me to be in the league.
Are you crazy?
And you want to go to the league
Do you know if you tell your uncle and your brother about this, you won’t see any good?
You are responsible for what happened.
We warned you
Why don't you come and see me? It's been a long time since the last time I saw you.
It's been a year now, a year since the day I saw you.
Is he married or not yet?
May God guide you.
Who agrees to marry my mother without a certificate?
No no no, it doesn't matter if my mother is a man.
Khamis, son of the scorpions
His sting (scorpion sting) is painful.
And then he must marry someone from the same social class.
A scorpion like him
May God help you.
What can I do, Aisha!
Since the minister traveled, all the papers have reached me.
Mustafa, the head of the Human Resources department, informed me that he wants to meet with me tomorrow.
But the ministry's guests arrived today
Do you have the schedule?
And now I am free to talk to you, Aisha!
Yes, Maryam
Present, here, present, here now
What can I say! Ah! Aisha
My brothers are the source of all these problems.
I don't know what happened.
No problem, my dear, ice packs are necessary so your face doesn't swell.
Didn't we warn her not to go and talk to them about the matter?
He went to them, they had beaten her.
Do you know if I told them it was football?
They would have beaten you a long time ago.
What a pity, you play football!
Next time, we'll break your neck.
I know who is talking to you
The Great Scorpion
That little one
Yeah, but man, I didn't hit her, it was Sultan who hit her.
Did you hear that?
I chose economics and political science
I chose graphics because it is in demand these days.
Architectural Engineering!
It's not your turn.
You had your chance.
Don't be greedy
Okay, scorpion
Hit her, break her teeth in her mouth.
Let me hit it.
She is here with me.
Go to the scholarship department
And dropped architecture
Take your time
To make sure
I spoke with Sultan and Saqr
They don't mind if you marry Munira.
What else do you want?
Yes, our son Khamis deserves all the best.
I will arrange a meeting with them and let you know.
Your nomination to be with the delegation
I appreciate your personal circumstances
Just give yourself a chance to think about it until tomorrow.
Honestly,
They care about you a lot.
And your nomination by the minister
He is correct
I know my brothers well.
They will never agree.
I am surprised
Their car loans are paid from my salary.
And I provide for the house
She wants me to accompany her on the trip later.
Aren't we going to marry her off this week?
What are you saying?
Khamis is stupid, he doesn't even have a school certificate.
He got married and traveled with him.
Alright, let's go.
This is a shame.
They will kill her if she refuses.
Oh! My son, I told you many times.
Why don't you go?
Tomorrow, I’m going tomorrow.
It doesn't matter, as long as he is a Scorpio.
Appearance doesn't matter
I don't want to marry Khamis.
And go to the kitchen
Put it in the living room.
The match between Madrid and Barcelona tonight
I hope Valencia doesn't beat us.
My sources are reliable
She is loyal and works hard.
What do you think about this?
What do you want me to do?
We need to go.
Please go back to your offices.
Thank you, may God prolong your life.
Long life
The coffee is served there.
Her happiness
May God prolong her life.
Hello, may God prolong your life
Good evening, Your Highness
Yes, may God prolong your life.
Did you wash the coffee cup?
Spirit and pour coffee for Captain Emad
And also
We will play in China the day after tomorrow.
Hey Captain, I forgot to introduce you to my sister Maryam.
I am going to the official engagement.
Are you stupid?
You don't know anything about life, and you want to marry a minister.
Say hello to %pw
Yes, ma'am
Pour it and make a new one
Actors' calls
You know, after Mishaal called me a few minutes ago.
What can I say to her?
This is unfortunate, Nouf's role does not suit Mishaal.
Nouf is sixteen years old.
Mashael clearly looks like she is in her twenties.
Okay, why don’t you take the role of Maryam?
It suits her more.
Nove to Thirty
We need to get rid of the demanding person in the committee.
He is a person with problems, sure that he will not let things go smoothly.
He is very precise.
He will talk about art, family values, ethical art, content, and more.
Who did he choose for that committee?
The minister is the one who formed the committee.
Me, you, and Hamed can influence him.
No no no this is impossible
There is nothing that proves it is ours.
Even if he goes and asks at the Ministry of Economy,
He will not find our names.
The company is registered in the name of Hamed's wife, God bless you.
Don't worry about this.
Don't worry, in fact, who is the chairman of the committee?
My final word
No, no, man, everything is fine, please come in.
I just spoke with them and agreed on everything.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, hello Rashid, please go ahead.
As you know, this meeting is specifically to determine whether we will approve the series "Extortion of Conscience" or not.
It is produced by the Modern Touch Arts Institute.
It is a beautiful action series, unusual and bold.
I agree with Hamed
The story of the series is very good.
I agree with you
I was amazed when she took the gun and killed her neighbor.
She wanted to hide the gun, so she put it in the car.
And she didn't know it was her son's right, it was exciting, and when the police came
And her son is coming home from school.
And kicked a box
He kicked it and it flew into his mother's net.
Here comes the surprise.
This part of the box is inside the mother's room.
It is good that a local company produces this advanced level of productions.
We must encourage and support them.
Mr. Rashid, you didn't tell us your opinion.
You left me nothing to say.
With all due respect to your opinions and reflections on the series, this is "blackmailing the conscience."
And the extraction of human values
Disgusting surprises
One and a half people in each episode
The second text will be left for the next episode.
This series is written without social awareness.
What carries a moral message that helps society progress
Tears fall, why do you have to make the viewers cry?
Sorry, Rashid
You gave us your opinion, Ali gave us his opinion, let Mr. Rashid express his opinion.
Clear from the meeting
There is an agreement between you.
You organized it.
Some people understand and this is their field, while others have nothing to do with the field.
I do not agree with that series.
I'm afraid he might get us into trouble.
Ignore him
What can he do? He can't do anything.
I will do what I want.
He gave me the bag and said it was from Madame Samira.
I don't know what to do.
How unbelievable! Oh! Nasser
This is for the new series that we will be producing soon.
What makes the driver rape the girl
For the blessed things we obtained because of him
The first blessing is the beautiful ring on your hand
I'll tell you how
So they presented it in the name of Hamed's wife, who sent you the ring.
And your husband's role was to have their backs covered.
He has a five percent share of the production.
A sweet role
I played a similar role, haven't you seen "Lost Dreams"?
By the way
Extortion is called something, I don't remember exactly.
Yeah, blackmail dreams
Why are all the names similar?
Last year's series were all about girls.
You notice that every series has more than eight girls or even ten girls.
Your turn is guaranteed
You are very loved
You're lucky, Yak,
Yes, Omar
Okay, fine, fine
Sorry, my love, I have to go to work, I don't know what happened there.
Every relief
He said he wants to see me regarding a very important and urgent matter.
I have to go.
I heard that Rashid met the minister.
He spent half an hour with him.
And I told him that you are going to upset him.
I told you he complained about us to the minister.
What happened is that the minister's office called and wants to meet with me.
I'm also afraid that the minister will believe him.
Meeting with the minister
The man came to clarify his point of view regarding the series.
That's all.
That's true, may you live a longer life.
But first of all, Your Highness, I want to say that it is not acceptable for you to talk about a colleague behind their back.
Everyone knows that Rashid is
He is jealous of everyone around him.
He only cares about financial interests.
But this is his specialty.
That's it, God bless you, not everyone educated can handle these technical matters.
Special Television Productions
Excursion of the Conscience, the series we are working on
It is a massive production
We will have a media initiative at the Gulf level.
Strong distribution
Of course, this is your specialty; you know more about this subject than I do.
I promise you a very wonderful series.
He will defend our name.
Look what the journalist, Abdel Hamid, wrote, listen listen
Then, one of the actors said
The series promotes unethical ideas.
This is limited to the fall of literature.
This is indeed a very bold and strong critique.
They will be in big trouble if the journalist, Abdel Hamid, continues writing about them.
And if the people I hold accountable know about the matter
But they are smart; they know how to deal with her.
They are grumpy
We need to create our own website
And include all our company's activities on it.
What is the name of the company again?
From now on, you are the media advisor.
The series "Conscience Extortion," which is supervised by Mercury Media Production, is considered as
A qualitative leap in Arab drama
Because it carries ideas and moral values
It is a series aimed at developing the community.
He is the same journalist who criticized them a few days ago.
Is it possible that he changes his mind to the opposite?
How can he accept this?
The journalist Abdel Hamid and others like him
Don't worry, Mr. Hamed.
He asked me what I thought of the series, I told him it would be the best in the Arab world.
God willing
I feel like our series is going to be really amazing.
I don't know where he is.
The second one is getting ready and prepared to go.
Not an interesting start
Your stories are always unrealistic, and the events never actually happened.
Clear at first glance
Your book is amusing.
*It could happen*
Cyrillic is silly, silly
What do you think?
This is very tragic.
Bad series again are not considered an excuse
I can understand this production from the first time.
These are hidden lines and dimensions; it requires someone to focus in order to discover them.
By the way, this is political drama.
It's a shame that it was seen.
What's the problem?
I wasn't this nervous yesterday.
I was at Souq Waqif yesterday with Ali,
We were at a café
I ignored myself
Nasser, what do you think about what happened? If the minister is upset, that's a big problem.
Within one week, we will all be expelled.
What a failed series, everyone who watched it said it was a failure.
I heard that Rashid is planning to visit him.
Tell him the series is a failure and there’s no action in it.
This is a disaster
Leave it to me
Let's see what Nasser intends to do.
Listen, Eli!
From now on, I don't want any criticism of the series on your page.
Eli, please
A few days ago, I saw an article that didn't just criticize the production, but later cursed it.
Don't upset me.
Sorry
On that day, I was free.
I will never let them write this thing.
But honestly, I haven't received any praise messages.
Once again, a great success
Goodbye
Brother Rashid,
Should I believe you or the newspapers?
Pressure on the conscience is the best television production
May you live longer, they have an agreement.
Listen to what the second newspaper wrote.
Do they also have an agreement with the viewers' page?
I was about to have a heart attack.
In a little while, they told me.
Lucky, Minister Radi
Honestly, Nasser,
Be ready to see the exploitation of conscience 2
No no no no, enough, my brother,
The series, he said he won't write again.
He prefers to stay in his miserable job.
The second part, after all these problems
Third and fourth as well
What's wrong with you, don't you want to benefit?
One of his friends told me
Here I am
What can the magician do?
I wish you more success
Please, tell us your opinion on this success?
I thank God for this success
They are haters and enemies of our success.
I find it strange.
This series wins awards, yet it is a failed series.
Only the experts
They awarded her the prizes; surely they see what we cannot see.
Prepare the second part of the series
Alright, may your life be long.
A true magician
You will see, "exploitation of conscience" will
I saw you talking to the minister at the beginning of the event.
Do television festivals lie too!
I heard him say, "Get ready for part two."
The same thing
They are taken to the bank to be washed and become clean.
All the weak, silly, and immoral series that you watch
They nominate him at Arab and Gulf festivals.
He cleans it and gives it awards so that people consider it to be of high quality.
Yes, that's correct
As long as the judges are the producers themselves
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, praise be to God, I have arrived.
It's true that we signed a contract with them, but they want to lower the prices.
Come to my office
We are not a small bakery nor a bread shop.
We are one of the largest bakery companies in the world.
We will not release it.
Otherwise, we will cancel the contract.
We actually signed the contract yesterday.
With the British company
K Kb W Up
As you wish
Just a very wonderful job
He will be the first person in the world to produce this product.
He is not just the best baker in the world.
I'm telling you
How is the bread with (a worm)?
You open it with your hand or go to the kitchen and look for a knife to cut it, and the knife might cut your hand.
He made bread with sauce (Sahhab)
Put the cheese and sugar it again.
This is not bread, this is a pair of pants.
So, what do you think? Actually, this is a bread bag.
How can we remove that zipper?
If that's the case, he can tell his friend, "I ate two clouds."
Why didn't the pastries from Jabal Al-Noor hospitals arrive yesterday?
I know, but why didn’t you hand it in yesterday?
The bakers who make it
Once again, use the bakers
This is what happened, sir.
Why are you yelling at him?
You are wasting your time with football and delaying my work.
You know that your son loves football.
What's the problem if a few employees from the company hang out to have some fun?
You have four hundred employees in the company.
Eleven key players
Four substitute players, two administrative assistants, that's all, just seventeen.
Team Spokesperson
Why is he upset with him?
But the situation is fine at the moment. Although the fans are the most important players on the field, they are the twelfth player.
I let you enjoy with them.
And we have already signed a contract with the people.
When he first told you he wanted to play football
He heard you
Nothing else
No, you're just upset with him because he took some employees to play football in front of him and have fun.
I didn't say he can't take some employees.
Even if some of your friends need employees, you can lend them some of yours.
The important bakers
Hey boy, why are you taking the important bakers? This is not acceptable.
Next time, let me know before you take any employee.
No, no, let Hamdi do these papers.
He is in the hospital
Why, didn't they inform you?
I finished my work, and I am getting into my car.
Nasser called me.
I went to him.
He said they couldn't find the goalkeeper and they have an important match today.
*Dur told us about a goalkeeper, then we arrived at the stadium.
Wear the goalkeeper's suit
I have never played football nor touched the ball.
That situation
This is ridiculous
And we'll find you a job instead of wasting your time with football.
Let me explain to you
Dad, you want me to cancel and disband the team, right?
Yes, that is correct.
Yes, father, please, I beg you.
I can't clear the team, tomorrow is the final match.
No no no, it is true.
Do you agree?
Congratulations on the win
Congratulations, Professor Nasser, on your cup victory.
We wanted to know how you planned to win.
Look, I prepared the team mentally, physically, and psychologically, and the coach worked hard.
At the hotel
Congratulations to you all, and there will be a party, just as we promised you.
It seems that your father is happy.
I'm afraid he's just trying to be nice and polite.
Uncle Abu Nasser, first of all, we want to congratulate you on the victory of your great team, the International Bakers team.
For this very great success
God bless you, no no no
There is no picture without bishts (the traditional Arab men's cloak), wait, wait, stay still.
No no
He is wearing the bisht.
Your care, attention, and creative opinions played a major role in this success, definitely.
And the coach's plan
However, they played with a 5-5-3-2 formation in the final.
And as a player, you know that changing the team's plan confuses the players, yet Baker's team did not get confused and did an excellent job.
And the coach's plan
Bo Nasser, as the first player in the international Bakers team, what do you suggest the players should do?
To infinity
Hello hello
Long life
They are welcome, is Hamoud Sultan with them?
They are welcome to come, but they must have dinner with us first.
Dinner, perfect!
Thank you, Abu Abdulaziz.
This is considered a contribution to the private sector.
The team is still young.
Do not envy me
No, who?
Abdulaziz's father
The deputy of the engines that we use in the factory
You see
I wanted to know him for a long time.
Football introduced me to him, I said these words to him.
I said to him, "Oh! Abu Abdulaziz."
You have never been interested in football your whole life.
What business is it of yours?
The ball was always close to me, but fifty centimeters were between us.
Has Bu Nasser arrived yet?
No, what came today is not after.
There is a seminar about football injuries, he is the platinum sponsor, he must be there.
You see more
Did you see the building behind the bakeries that he wanted to make into housing for the workers?
He is obsessed with football.
As usual, we tend to meet and conduct an interview with a figure in the field of sports.
This man inspires the bakery team with his great ideas.
What’s the news about the International Bakeries team? We heard that you are doing a comprehensive development.
Compared to offices, and all efforts
This is a small amount, but one million dollars for all these efforts.
No, man, be generous.
It's not my fault, brother Shaheen.
My mistake
So, what was my mistake?
You told me that you need players for the Gulf countries.
Prices for the Gulf are very expensive.
It means if the player's price is two thousand
For the Gulf, it costs three or four million dollars.
I didn't understand it, explain it to me.
Receive my fax from here
And I read it in front of me when you are with me
Dad bought four new players for the team, in addition to a new batch of four players.
You know, he is amazing, he can easily beat Billy and Ronaldinho.
But it is written on it eight hundred thousand.
Yeah, that's right, God bless you, but a Turkish club set this price.
In the UAE, they sell it for one million two hundred thousand.
Don't look at me.
Okay, can we inspect the goods?
Here
Calf leg
Okay, fine
No no no, I guarantee you.
He is fat, God willing, thank God he is fat.
This one is slim, suitable for the waist.
The connecting muscle
It is the most important muscle; a player is useless without it.
Thank you
Let your driver take them to the Automatic Club, Automatic, I got a job! Automatic
What do you mean?
Hamdi, let's go.
Congratulations, congratulations
These, God bless you, are young players.
Yeah, we bring them from the jungles of Africa,
We feed them and raise them, then we release them onto the fields.
You’re very welcome, you can take it. Do you have a place for it, or should I load it onto the pickup?
When he saw them pressuring us
The attacking player is requested to play
Kakakano Makalali Danda, no
Ask the defender to play
Kajumakakani Lololo was supposed to play.
He is a beginner coach.
Even if it is on Mars
Spain! Even if the coach is on Mars
I love how he runs the game.
This has to be on the northern road.
There are rules for the game.
Even if it is only two days
What's going on, why are you shouting?
Your stupid son
He is not convinced that the coach is an expert in football.
Listen to her, she talks like Mitsu.
He knows that the offensive player Silolo Tikawa is a good central player, as Ahmed Al-Tayeb said.
No one gives you a headache.
Just stay away
I know how to deal with him.
Why did the team lose the home ground?
The team is supposed to consider changing the plan.
Because the players are not playing in their positions
And the player Takulamakakulalalo is in the wrong place, he needs to move to his usual position.
Ask the coach to change the...
To separate the love of Malalo
Okay okay okay
No no no no, what is happening on the field?
This is what is supposed to happen
The coach shouldn't do that.
Please postpone these issues until the end of the game.
People are sitting and watching this thing, it's happening right in front of the camera.
A fourth goal for the Success team, the ball has entered the goal area.
He scored the fourth goal; he is the star of today's match.
This coach is stubborn
He said to him, Uncle Nasser no longer wants you as the coach of his team.
And you, be quiet*
I'm sitting watching the match on TV while you remain a substitute player, do what I ask of you.
Don't do that, it's not good.
We have a match tomorrow, how are we going to play without a coach?
What does your father do?
Enough, Rashid!
What's wrong with you? You scared me, tell me what's wrong with you?
He divorced me, Mama, he divorced me.
I divorced you! How did it happen?
I don't know, Mom, I don't know.
Why did he divorce you? You were married for less than a month.
By God, Mom, I don't know, I don't know %pw.
He divorced you without a reason!
Yes, Mama, yes.
By God, Mom, I don't know, suddenly he came and told me, "Go to your family's house."
I asked him, "Why is that?" He said, "You are divorced."
I swear to God, I don't know what's going on?
They got married but only for one month. What will people say about us?
I agree with you.
I don't know what to say.
I just know that he divorced her, from you now.
Sit down. I'll be with you in a minute.
Because of her high morals.
She insulted Barcelona.
Light of my eyes, Abdullah.
He came crying.
She said that she insulted Barcelona, and he is very attached to this team and respects it.
, and he insulted him and hurt his feelings.
Mom told me she insulted Barcelona, and I told him to divorce her and I'll find you a second wife.
She tells him that your daughter is divorced because she insulted the Barcelona team.
That's it, he divorced her for that reason, are you serious?
What matters to me.
Is it easy to hurt someone's feelings?
A wife stabs a dagger into her husband's loyalty.
I can't believe what I'm hearing!
We don't need a girl who doesn't respect international teams.
This time she started mocking Messi.
Problems between spouses happen, and we must be prepared.
Instead of being one, there are a thousand girls.
There are many girls who want to marry him.
%pw Listen to me.
I don't want to hear anything.
And by God, do not interfere. This is my son, and I know him well.
I told you this is none of your business.
I am angry with you.
Don't tire yourself, boy, and don't think about it.
Instead of one, a thousand girls.
Why are you upset!
But when I remember what she said
Real Madrid is better than Barcelona
Present, my dear.
What's wrong with it!
Her name is Mona.
Was she married for a month?
If I told you her story and why she got divorced, you wouldn't stop laughing.
To share it with you, we want your attention.
What's the point with someone like this? He divorced his wife because of a football team.
The hairdresser knows them and told me the whole story. Mom, don't involve me in this matter, I don't want to get into trouble with this person.
That's it, you're listening to the empty talk of barbers.
Tell them I did not accept.
Let her say her nonsense and say whatever she wants.
Wealth is coming to her.
I said to her, "Oh! Girl, don't stop your luck."
If it were just her wealth, I wouldn't care at all.
But she will stop her luck and our luck with her.
This building
He couldn't say no to me.
God is enough to deal with this bad barber.
They hear a rumor and spread it.
Don't listen to her.
Tell her and make her understand: don't close the door of luck that will open for us.
He knows how to convince her.
You can't be joking. Do you believe he divorced his wife because of Barcelona?
Forget all these trivial things and don't go crazy.
Don't miss the opportunity.
And it could be the reason, or there is something wrong with her that made him divorce her.
Listen, girl, don't let Abu Burjin slip out of your hands.
What’s this, Abu Burjain?
But when they get closer, they discover that it is two towers.
That's why they called his father Shaheen Abu Burjain.
May God greet you.
Oh, no no no. Sweet. Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, thank you. Here you go.
May God prolong your life, they have already taken the money, you signed and they spent the money.
Your Highness, I was preoccupied and it seems you were very busy; this was a month ago.
The first marriage was a month ago, this is a new marriage, he divorced.
He was married and also divorced.
Yeah, this is his third marriage.
And this is his story, my brother, be strict with him.
Man! This is a tough generation.
Opinion and the other opinion
Congratulations, congratulations, girl.
My daughter, don't forget your fruit; I put it on top of the bag.
So you can take it with you when you board the plane.
When you arrive in London
Hey boy, don’t you want to go to London?
Hello, Mom.
Alright, this is good.
So you can come with us and shop afterwards.
, Malaysia, Malaysia.
Malaysia, take the fur with you
Goodbye, Mom.
What's wrong with it?
I don't know
I ask her, and I don't know what's going on.
Tell me, girl, what happened?
I did the right thing by ignoring her.
She is worth nothing.
On the honeymoon, she is supposed to take care of you by all means.
Is it logical that it's a base while you're pouring the water!
And the cup is beside you; it’s what you hold and makes you drink.
She was not raised with good upbringing.
You should have told her from the day you were born, I only drink water from my mother's hands.
What's wrong with it?
She looks very sad.
And who is with this lady?
Her name is Michelle.
Poor thing, she got divorced while on her honeymoon.
You wouldn't believe it if I told you her story?
God bless you, Aunt. Thank you.
Your aunt asked, and so did your other aunts.
Yeah, but I don’t know where my mom booked for us?
Hello, mom.
Where did you book for us?
Because she wants to go with us there.
There is no power nor strength except with God.
Why did he do that at the airport and why did he take the kids?
What happened between them?
You ask me, I don't know what happened between them!
Honestly, this is nonsense.
Where is Munira?
She is in her room talking to that idiot.
Now she says she was trying to call him for two days and his phone was off.
I just found it now.
We are waiting to see what he has.
How do you know he's upset? The boy is coming from outside tired and wants to rest.
Every day I tell my mom to peel the apple, but she doesn't do it. Every day she upsets me.
And you know that I don't like apples with their peel.
She doesn't peel the apple.
Hello, let me tell you
You are divorced.
And one more when it is necessary.
Come on, my light of my eyes.
Come on, my light of my eyes.
Munira, what did he say?
Why are you still upset!
Call him three times and tell him that you are divorced.
Be quiet, may God grant you health.
I don't know, Mom, who saw me at the disco in Spain and told him.
He has nothing to say.
Right, he has nothing to say.
She will dance two or three times.
And if he divorces my daughter, he will die.
How did he divorce you?
Where are you going?
Where are you going? I'm going to take out my anger on that rude man.
She has a tail like a peacock.
Adorned with gold, rubies, coral, and diamonds.
And the other girls are your game and your son's.
They don't have families and mothers who feel the bad taste in their mouths.
What you mock
And release them however you like
She is not the one who helped you drink water, she insults Barcelona, divorce her and forget about her.
Who is going to the nightclub?
Without shame or modesty
Deputy Minister, Arab and Muslim.
He cares about his reputation and the reputation of his children.
Stay where you are and don't move.
Be a little more humane.
It was my father's right.
Who would sell land like this?
Abu Saqr took it from Abu Bjadara.
Why did he sell it?
May God guide you, if Abu Saqr wants something, is there anyone who can say no to him?
Leave it to God, man.
Please, please.
%pw Come on, come on.
%pw What happened to your project, Abu Saad?
As you know.
Okay, last week you said you were going to go to his office?
I told you, if you want to run your project, you have to start paying for it.
Abu Saqr, this great millionaire
%pw Does he eat? Is there anyone in this world who doesn't eat?
This is not a problem, my brother. We will let him eat and feel full, and we will fill his stomach. The only problem is how to reach him.
You must know Abu Saqr's key to open all the doors for you.
I met him during Umrah and greeted him more than once,
What you need to know as long as you pay him and manage your work, all you need to know is the right time.
When the secretary told me that Abu Saqr is waiting for you at dinner
I came right away.
Abu Saqr, may God protect him, has a feast every day.
Hey man, anyone
He loves this gathering and meeting with friends.
It is very beautiful to stay on this farm overnight.
Yes, Your Honor, this is Abu Nasser, the owner of the car agency behind the mall.
He wants to get to know you, Your Highness.
Getting the license.
He is like my son who got his license.
Thank you, God bless you.
Congratulations on the license, Saqr.
God bless you.
Abu Saqr
I asked you not to disappoint me, say yes.
Just say yes, Your Honor.
As a gift for him.
And please, do not say no.
My work is going well.
This means that you met him and talked to him easily.
Don't be stupid.
Yeah, alright, Abu Nasser.
Tell me what the technique is, what did you do?
The circumstances served me.
When we were sitting with him.
His son just got the license.
I have a gift, Saqr.
If the topic is about the car,
This is easy.
Come on, come on, take me to him.
Yes, it happened.
I just got out of the hospital.
He underwent a tonsillectomy.
And he will definitely make a feast.
Your son's health is well deserved, Sharfak!
We hope he gets better, we hope he gets better, God willing, he won't see any harm, God willing.
We met each other at the rosary shop.
I think so.
Oh men! We have started to forget, and our age is growing.
They told me that your son Shaheen was in the next room and left earlier.
I thought I should visit you,
And we will congratulate you along with the health of Shaheen.
%pw Listen! For your honor, you’re not supposed to leave without having dinner with us.
I’m not in the mood for it.
Just say yes first.
Because our beloved son Shaheen has been discharged from the hospital,
In Burj Al Corniche.
Just say yes.
Oh! Boy, don't be stubborn.
Mom, don't try, I don't like business and I have no inclination for it.
Who can start a project without capital these days?
At the Vehicles and Bulldozers Agency, he said, just let him point.
Love is from God, and people love you because of their love for your father.
Even the university,
All the doctors love and appreciate your father.
Most of them are in his council every night.
Mashallah, everyone loves your father, you just have to point him out.
Oh! People take loans from banks to start a company or a business project.
Am I sitting in the supermarket?
Did you open a pickle shop?
This is something new as well.
This is a falcon, light of my eyes, he brought them to me yesterday and said these are samples, try them.
He just took their power of attorney yesterday.
You see
He also told me that all businessmen are like me; may God make everyone like you.
Yes, Your Honor.
When I was on my way to the office,
I saw a new supermarket.
They were preparing it.
Honestly, I love him.
I don't know who owns it.
Congratulations, congratulations Uncle Saqr, congratulations
God bless you.
In the name of God, in the name of God
Who is he to come as a partner and take it this easily?
You can now say no.
What's up?
What should I say?
Be a partner.
Don't you know who his father is?
Who knows his father!
I told him I am a friend of Qasim Abbas. He asked me if I have work experience.
I said I have a bakery, thank God I make a living from it.
No, no, I don't like the name.
What I noticed.
No, my brother! The name is not nice.
This is a suitable name for Iranian bread.
Understood, Big Bread.
Qasim, we will call it the Big Bread Bakery.
Wait for me a little.
Peace be upon you.
And peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you, my honor.
Excellent, excellent, do you need anything or any help?
No, thank God everything is fine.
Ayad is a new employee here!
Your Honor, she just sent her car for maintenance and came to take my car because she is an advertising agent at a marketing company and can't do anything without a car.
Maybe your car will need it later.
No, no, I don't need the car today.
Sure, no problem.
This is the era of science, knowledge, and study.
I agree with Dr. Rashid, everyone must have sufficient knowledge in their field, whatever that field may be.
Excellent! Oh! Dr. Sami
Yes, Your Honor.
Study and study.
You are repeating what is in the books.
He did not study commerce or economics.
He never read a book in his entire life, not even a newspaper. I've never seen a piece of paper in his hand throughout his life.
You all know who Saqr is today.
I didn't want to enter this commercial field and %pw, but...
Uncle Abu Nasser is still alive here in front of you.
The one he loves.
There are just people who were born for business and naturally love business.
You are right, Doctor!
God willing, Shaheen, you will be like your brother.
God is generous, God willing.
It's still early.
This depends on upbringing.
No one can be like you (example) Oh! Doctor.
Honestly.
How did Saqr, who hates commerce, manage to easily reach this great economic insight?
If today they count a hundred billionaires in the world, they count him among them.
Do you know Oh! Abu Saqr?
Choose Saqr for the market knights.
Peace be upon you.
How are you, Nasser!
Mohammed called me and told me that Abu Nasser is in the hospital.
Do you remember the day you told me once that you heard Saqr, the son of Abu Saqr, wants to take over the car dealership from my father?
The agency no longer owns.
People really never get enough.
Dad helped him enter the market.
He opened his eyes to commerce.
Honestly, the doctor said he is in critical condition.
This is not going to work.
There is nothing that doesn't work.
Shocked or stunned, as far as I'm concerned, I'm telling you to divorce her, divorce her and you will divorce her.
In the twenty-first century, there are people like these.
We meet, dear viewers, with one of the kind and generous men in this country.
A man who knows the way for the needy and the deprived.
So, for that reason, we have the founder and owner of Saqr Charity Association.
Of course, if we talk, your honor, about this organization,
We all know your noble goals that you are trying to convey to the world and, of course, to everyone,
Without hypocrisy or desire for fame, God forbid.
Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds. Recently, we were able to deliver thirty sacrifices to our brothers in Africa.
And now, thank God, we are ready for delivery.
Seven boxes of sweets for our children in Gaza.
Mashallah, may God honor you and keep many people like you for you.
We just left the house, my wife and I.
My wife just spends half an hour starting her new project.
And I am waiting for her.
No problem.
Honestly, I love their atmosphere and I love sitting with them, I really enjoy it a lot.
And a source of income for my children as well.
He is my whole life.
I think you want to waste my time.
And stay away from problems.
Okay, hot bread, hot bread.
Come on, everyone!
In the twenty-first century, there is a people like this.
In the twenty-first century, there are people like these.
If someone wants to dive, diving requires effort.
Brave men are needed.
Viva Souq Waqif.
You deserve it, you deserve it, congratulations, congratulations.
May God bless you all.
Mashallah, everyone loves you, Shaheen. Love is from God.
Dad, I want to say something, but please say yes.
On the occasion of the license, my son Shaheen must go to the showroom and take the best and most expensive car as a gift from me to him.
The wind blew upon us from the valley's cleft.
O breeze, for the sake of love, take me home.
Hello Fadi.
How are you, Anoud?
No, no, no, no, no.
You told me the dress would be ready in a week, and yesterday you sent me a message saying it would be ready in ten days, you idiot!
And you want your dress with crystals, and this takes more time.
And if God wills, you start talking to Al-Anoud and ignore me?
How many lights do we have?
No, no, no, no, no, let the whole world be upset, but Anund will not be upset.
What more do you need, Fadi? They're starting to get jealous.
Oh God, I love the way they speak, I am jealous of them unlike our people.
Don't let the matter slip my mind.
Is my dress ready?
Here you go, Fadi.
Thank you, my brother Fadi.
My brother Fadi, I will come by next week to pick up the dress, okay, goodbye.
How can I help you?
Just send the dress to my house.
No, I didn't like it.
God willing, today I went to Fadi at the shop, he is doing excellent work and the girls are coming and going.
Praise be to God, we were very successful in this project.
What's the problem?
Abu Nasser, my cousin.
What's wrong?
Look at the envy!
And we haven't heard that he started a project; where is this bankrupt person getting the money from?
They open their mouths, they plunder!
And when he begins his work,
Are you sure?
I heard some chatter.
And if God wills, what can you do?
7 AM.
Do you want them to bring you breakfast?
No, thank you, I have already eaten breakfast.
Just, I want to talk to you about something.
I heard that you,
You want to start a business project.
I don't know anything about these things, may God guide you, my cousin.
Design, women's fashion design, and so on?
Who lied to you?
I am a businessman!
No, no, no, no, no, no, just, me
You need consultation, you need %pw. I am ready if you need any help.
Thank you, thank you oh! Thank you, cousin.
So forgive me, I have to go.
Go ahead, boss!
The first time you tell me if you need more.
Come on, oh! Fadi tidied up the place, you’re busy as I see?
The shop is no longer sufficient.
You said you are renting the shop next to us, so have faith in God and take it.
God willing,
Did they rent the shop next to us?
Is there anyone named Khalaf Sultan Al-Saifi other than your cousin Abu Nasser?
No, there isn't?
I am from the Ministry of Economy. I saw his name on a document with my friend; his name is Issam, and he is responsible for his papers.
Women's Fashion Design
Are you sure?
I saw the contract and his name is written on it.
What's wrong, what's wrong, what's wrong.
What's the problem with him, what's the problem with him, what's the problem, there's something wrong with him.
Your sick heart didn't stop you.
When I saw that my project was successful,
I said I have to destroy him.
This market is open to everyone.
%pw Abu Nasser.
Is he a shepherd? What is he saying?
I was testing you, I asked you if you intend to start a project?
I did not lie to you, man.
Confidentiality is the best policy.
I don't care about you or your requests.
But this won't get you there.
Oh men, this is life, and everyone takes their livelihood.
You have defeated me.
Come on, you’re cousins.
No, no, no, Abu Saleh crossed the border.
You hit me in my own home!
Open to everyone!
You are brothers.
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
Lebanese designer bag.
I am a girl, ask me.
I know our women, they love the Lebanese.
Oh! Madam, this looks amazing on you, no, no, no, this, this is unparalleled in all of Doha.
Oh, this suits you, my lady, and with such sweet words and a piece worth a thousand, they sell it for thirty or forty thousand.
Yeah, just do it like him.
As you know, the cabinet I made last year when I brought the Lebanese carpenter.
Oh! Madam, I will design for you a wardrobe like no other in all of Doha.
Look, if you want to be successful
What's exactly in it?
Why don't you know?
This means he stole the customers.
What do you think about moving to another place, boss!
Don't mention it, don't mention it, Fadi.
And at this time, they will play by themselves.
It means that we were defeated, no!
We must confront them!
And we will bring back our customers whether they like it or not.
Do you have money to pay?
I am paying.
I am ready to do anything,
But the most important thing is that he will not defeat me.
This dress I chose is worth sixty thousand riyals.
Of course, without the buttonholes in the middle.
This is a gift from the designer, me.
And I put a crystal on it for you; there are only fifty pieces of this crystal in the whole world, and this piece is very unique.
Of course, there is no discount; our prices are globally recognized.
No, of course not, who would do that?
Just wait, wait, what's going on? What happened?
We have been harmed, Saad, we have been harmed.
Is this something they do?
They killed us, we no longer have customers.
This is called war, Abu Nasser.
We won't just sit and stare!
We must confront them just as they confront us, and we must respond to them as well.
Tomorrow I will take a loan from the bank.
He started the war against them, and you'll see what I do.
Abu Nasser will not stop it.
Check the announcement!
Check the ad you posted!
We announce two evening dresses free with every wedding dress,
Only four evening dresses with each wedding dress.
We publish an advertisement in a quarter page.
Look, he posted a half-page ad.
I don't know what he was planning to do!
Do you believe me, Umm Nasser?
For six days, not a single customer entered their shop.
No, and this afternoon they didn't open, they closed.
And you will hear that he put his shop up for sale.
I kill him, I kill him.
Even they can't stay there, he stayed outside.
Okay, drink your tea and go to him.
What kind of tea, may God guide you? I can't drink it, that's a problem.
Is there anyone who holds a grudge against you?
There is a guy, may God bless him, who intentionally sprayed the place with this scent.
These are chemicals.
Are you sure someone sprayed perfume in the shop?
You are cousins, you are grown-ups not kids to be fighting like children.
At night, a bad smell spreads in the shop, is this fair?
I didn't spray anything, your scent.
Do not cross the line.
You signed a statement at the police station.
Don't worry.
This time,
I prepared a hellish plane for him.
Without anyone catching me while I'm wrong.
No, everything is fine.
This is what puzzles me.
I swear, I have no idea what's going on; this is the fourth day without a single customer entering our shop.
Oh my, this is not the shop, we have to go to the other shop, I revealed my face, may God guide you.
What did the doctor tell you?
The shop is empty and no customers enter the shop.
I don't know, it's as if they cast a spell on him.
Women and girls do not come near the place.
It was as if magic had turned Saad into a monster.
Possible, everything is possible these days.
There is magic, and it is evil.
Okay, is he asleep or awake?
Go and see it, my brother. Go home, I'm afraid the ceiling will collapse.
I am lost, O Sultan, I am lost.
I don't know, he turned into a dog!
He's a monster!
Calm down, my brother, don't be upset.
I don't know what he did.
Tell me, my love, what did you do to him? His friends say they have started collecting money to pay off his debts.
Designer
I am not Lebanese,
I told him, I told him?
%pw Do you know where he is?
%Pw The stars are the same, and we are desperately looking for these extras.
Call the boy again, he might have an emergency.
What's wrong with you, what's wrong with you, Uncle Ahmed!
What's wrong with you, Ahmed! You're sitting here while the manager is yelling at me! What should I do? Where are those damn extras you said you would bring today?
It's better for you to leave me alone, I called him and got a headache, just to ask Mr. Abdullah.
First of all, don’t shout, we are actors and we want to rest a bit, we need to focus on our roles. Secondly, the man called more than once in front of me, but calm down.
%Pw What do you say, Professor Abdullah, what do you say?
Oh! Mr. Abdullah, what should I do now? The manager is about to finish the scene and he will be upset with me.
Okay oh! Guys, okay oh! Guys.
%PW We want to finish, but these extras who are supposed to appear in the scene haven't arrived yet.
You don't want anyone to upset you, right?
Do your work quietly and without shouting.
This is our situation, always shouting, since morning. We need to focus.
I found a solution for you.
What do you think about playing the role yourself? Hopefully, I'll find an actor who does a good job in the role.
It's true that he will appear in just one scene,
But this scene is the most important scene in the series.
But please, sir, go and shoot now, please.
But if you're not ready today, I will leave.
Hey guys, let's go upstairs.
Let me tell you something, there is a Filipino, okay?
You don't know Abu Walid, he always leaves. He needs someone who looks elite, must be elite and Qatari.
Oh man, he’s wearing a ghutra and agal, no one notices.
Are you serious, Alaa? You just want the easy way out; this is production work—respect people's feelings and intelligence.
Alaa gave you all the responsibilities, distributed the tasks, and you will be comfortable.
Calm down, so we can think. Reem, think with me, maybe you’ll remember someone from your friends.
Who is he?
Ahmadi, do you remember someone in the authorities' neighborhood named Saud Bukran?
The same Saudi sidr.
%PW Saud Alab's statement!
The manager said he needs a rich and prestigious man, and you say cans,
Dear, at the end of the day it's an extra role, you will bring a rich and prestigious man for the extra role.
Just with a little makeup, Reem, and I wear a suit and a clean dress and a fancy car.
God willing, it is suitable.
How can we reach it?
I know their house.
Peace be upon you
Happy cans?
So, who is he?
Yes, yes, yes, this is it, this is it.
Yes, this is it, thank you very much.
And now, how is it going to work, Mom? There’s nothing but this trilogy that my uncle brought from abroad.
Son, you only have what you wear.
Son, this is inside the closet under my clothes.
Mom, people are sitting outside, what do you want me to iron?
May God help you, boy.
This means that today I will follow you and you will be on television.
Yes, mom, and they said I will appear on television as one of the elite.
Sit down, you scoundrel.
Come on, man. What is this? Spit on you.
Spray, spray.
Here you go, Mom.
Quickly, Mom, do you feel better?
God willing, boy.
God forbid, hopefully they will give you just a little money.
May God help you.
Pray for me.
I bring you Saud's boxes, Saud's laptop.
Peace be upon you.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Is this Abboud, Fatima's son, Abboud?
Hello, hello.
Hello Saud?
Is he going to do the scene?
Yeah, yeah, God willing, God willing he’ll do a good job, calm down and stay quiet, so they give you a complex role.
Tell me, how is your mother?
She is not the same person who used to gather the hawthorn like before.
Shame on you, shame on you, keep quiet.
You are now wearing glasses.
You are an old man now.
You don't change, I will regret recommending you.
The person they brought to the role of Abu Abdulaziz.
He is here, they brought him, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Do your best, this is our manager Mr. Ghafil Fadel.
The most important thing is not to be afraid of the camera.
My brother, I fear only God.
Don't worry, stay calm, listen to his instructions, and say yes to anything the manager tells you.
Oh brother! Oh brother, for God's sake, you're playing the role of one of the elite, one of the rich, do you understand or not?
Come here, boy! Come here, boy!
I am speaking with you.
He is very lighthearted; the role requires a serious person.
Everything is acceptable from some people.
Ask me why I speak this way.
Brother, we bought this for filming. Listen to me, I will take you now to the makeup room and train you for the role.
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you
Come here, please.
Introduce me to her.
Stop, stop, stop here here!
Praise be to God, you are here, please, please.
Hey boss, the car you need for the scene is ready.
Saud cleans everything and tidies it up.
Let's repeat it one more time, and the assistant manager is here to see you and reassure the manager.
Imagine yourself as a well-known merchant.
You say this?
Hey, hey, I'm telling you, wait, wait, don't rush, I didn't expect this from you! Oh! (Abu Abdulaziz), say that you are Abu Abdulaziz.
For our rights.
Beautiful, and you must know!
Let him clean my teeth, brother.
He cleans and completes the full name: Abu Abdulaziz Faleh Al-Marzouq, sweet.
Sweet, go ahead, go ahead and think.
Consider your daughter divorced.
Don't worry about why he divorced her.
Your daughter is divorced, is she beautiful? Is she beautiful?
She is sweet, go ahead and consider yourself, we are not getting married.
Why shouldn't I spit on him?
Great, you are great and he saved everything, great.
Let %pw clean my teeth for me.
How? Why?
Hey guys, the homeowners surprised us and they need the hall, so the director decided to finish the scenes in the hall first and then shoot the outdoor scenes.
How come? They don't want %PW!
Yes, they want to, they want to, but it was postponed to another time. They will shoot another scene, and we will be behind them, God willing.
I say to them, "Will they bring you tea?"
Peace be upon you.
And peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.
Good morning, Your Honor.
Hello, which tribe are you from, boy?
My name is Your Honor Judge Salem Abu Shwai Al-Shwai.
* * The grills are famous.
You deserve it.
It tickles, a big nostril and also the lips can be placed here.
Tell me, my brother, about the people whose noses are high now,
I hold myself back.
If it were someone else, they wouldn't stop laughing.
Hold this for a minute.
Hello, Mom.
My mother is very sick, I have to go quickly, my brother!
You will wear these clothes.
I don't have time, I told you my mother is sick, she is very tired, and he says!
Listen to me, you can go wherever, but when I call you, you must come immediately.
He and I, we cannot leave the place.
Okay, okay, I'm trying to find a taxi. Oh! My brother.
Which taxi? If you try to find a taxi for a year, you won't find one.
You know, we rented the car for the scene.
As long as it's parked, take it.
Hey oh! Brother, please give me the key. My mother is sick, give me the key, give me.
She is in the car.
I need a wheelchair.
Wait, wait, I'll bring the wheelchair right now, right now. Oh! Sheikh.
Can I tell you something, can I tell you something?
My mother is very tired in the car, and I need a wheelchair, please.
Where is the patient? Inside the car?
Oh! Boy, what happened?
Stay silent and don't speak, just watch while you remain silent.
Peace be upon you.
There is nothing wrong, but my mother, madam, has asthma, quickly.
I tell them to prepare the bed.
Okay, okay.
And do not tire yourself.
May God suffice you, what did you do?
Zain oh! Rashood.
Take care of our son Rashid.
As you wish, come with me, Mr. Rashid.
Come with me, Mr. Rashid.
I will take Mr. Rashid and do what is necessary for him.
This is what is expected of you,
I tell the nurse to come see what you want to drink, Your Highness.
Come with me, Mr. Rashid.
Sorry.
What should I do? There are a lot of people, but I’m waiting!
The problem is that no one cares about us.
Sir, what would you like to drink? Tea, coffee, or cappuccino?
You're not the first one; we filmed the security guard at the hospital who married a Filipina.
Who told you that I am rejected?
None of them give me any attention.
They philosophize while they demand.
He doesn't have a certificate, he didn't want your mother, what is this, he didn't want your mother! Go look for your friends.
Hey brother, there’s a girl in the hospital, I like her.
If she ignores you, look for someone else.
I can't! Brother, my heart is attached.
Your brother fell in love, believe it, whenever I see her
Take this to Dr. Muhammad.
What's wrong with you!
Go now.
God's curse be upon you.
Your Honor, our aunt is now in full health.
You are a professional actor. Oh! Saud, oh! Hey, coming guys!
Bravo, see how they applauded you and how they praise you.
Now, go change your clothes and remove your makeup.
Oh man, forget about it, come and take a breath here first,
Yes, from now on, my name is Faleh Al-Marzouq.
Forget this and write Saud.
Saud passed away.
From now on, my name is Faleh Al-Marzouq, Abu Abdulaziz.
God bless you, my dear.
One buffet!
I made two.
I even heard one of the bride's relatives say, "Wow, they are very classy. I don't think anyone can do something similar to what they did at the wedding."
My love, goodbye.
Look at this, Mom.
I have to get them something on the occasion of signing my marriage contract.
What's wrong with you, mom?
Look at your brother who is going to expose us!
Oh my, this is embarrassing, by the way, it's cheap.
But this depends on our budget, it works.
Leave this for the maids to eat.
He wants to make a joke out of us.
It's good that I saw her.
This type is the free category, intended for the upscale community.
Almost above average.
No, we want something extraordinary, something that no one else can do.
Sorry, Sheikha, you can't blame someone who doesn't know your capabilities.
Be quiet, just be quiet, you don't know anything.
I'm afraid the money I have won't be enough.
Don't embarrass us, pay with the credit card.
What luxury is this, really advanced.
Yesterday, Saleh signed his marriage contract.
Saleh Nasser!
I am at your service, I am at your service.
I'm coming to you.
They booked the small hall and the food was disgusting.
Very cheap.
What did she say about the Saeedin wedding?
Sure, everyone says the same thing.
That's what scares me!
My dear sister,
He is just worried about the money.
And that is what people care about what others say.
He wants to make a joke out of us.
But we should get something according to our budget and circumstances.
Do you know that there are people who take out loans and sell their houses and cars just to have a lavish wedding and stop people from talking about them?
Leave it to us, and the cheap chocolate is enough—you were almost about to embarrass us with it.
I said that the manager liked the Chinese woman and took her home with him.
Okay, if the bride's family says that we choose the banquet hall, the stage, and prepare everything ourselves.
And you think that we choose anything!
No, it's nothing, but the place we used to go to before had a very reasonable price.
By the way, this shop designed Abu Dhahab's wedding.
Has anyone used it before?
Honestly, just once.
At the wedding of Izzah's daughter, congratulations.
No, no, no, we don't need anything used.
I need a platform where we are the first people in the world to use it.
This means you want to excel.
Show me what you have.
This stage is being used for the first time in Qatar.
Inspired by the information revolution like Facebook and Twitter.
Very modern and up-to-date.
How much is this stage with the other arrangements?
According to you now, but not less than one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Mama, mama, when we do this, our money is not enough, everything is very fancy, the best and the premium, and all of this costs money.
Everyone does that.
Please, be quiet.
What's the decision?
So, did you like this?
This is Noah's Ark.
Both are new, but Noah's Ark is twenty thousand more expensive.
No, God bless your parents, I think the mouse stage is much better.
Be quiet, no, I need Noah's Ark.
This is the wedding and its costs. By the way, we consider ourselves middle class.
Do I have to pay one hundred and fifty thousand for the stage and one hundred and fifty thousand for the hall, the one I booked, the Royal Hall as you call it?
I didn't say box, but why all this showing off, with everyone wanting to see the other and everyone wanting to do better than what others have done.
It's a battle of boasting, and no one benefits except the owners of wedding shops.
Who knows that everyone wants to be special, they exploit us and lie to us.
I swear I know one of my friends who says his brother has a wedding venue.
He says that the theater does not cost more than two thousand riyals.
I'm just waiting for that moment when his father says yes.
Okay, do something.
Like other young men who get married and take care of themselves.
Hello Sheikha, your honor.
How are you?
I know that you love excellence.
That's why I'm calling you.
For the first time in Qatar, designed by the world-renowned artist Peter Salamon.
A collection inspired by the nine planets
From the solar system.
With Noah Sheib's theater, it will look amazing.
In this harmony, you are the first person in Qatar to use the nine planets.
Okay, then,
It was one hundred and fifty thousand, and now?
Okay, then,
May God give you patience.
As you wish
These are a lot of expenses, my brother.
By the way, I couldn't get all eighty thousand.
All I could gather was sixty thousand, and I took twenty thousand from my brother.
Thank you, thank you very much, my brother Fahd.
How can I solve things? Oh! Fahd, as long as we boast at weddings, we're in trouble.
Without any boasting.
Of course, you will receive the invitations you want.
Yeah, this week, God willing, we will start with the invitations.
Our marriage will be better than theirs.
Mom, look at the invitations your son chose for the wedding.
Where does your brother live?
People now travel to countries just to design their invitations.
Unlike Amina's family, they went to Italy to design their invitation, print it, and come back. And also Munira's family,
They went to France, even people who are not rich go to Lebanon to get their invitations.
The system works like this in the country, do you want us to be different?
So, which country do you want to travel to?
We have seen some wonderful invitations.
Honestly, it's expensive, but.
But he is unique and no one has done it before.
Shine, how I love it.
Gold is much better, it shines.
Oh! Brother, if he can't afford the wedding expenses,
Why did he get involved in the matter?
And leave all this boasting and showing off for weddings, along with all these expenses that have no benefit.
The only ones who benefit from our madness are the hotels and wedding organizers.
That's it, he's leaving, may God help him.
Let me get it, maybe no one will come to take it.
Come on, I'll let you go.
Thank you, Abu Nasser.
Oh! Brother, the bride's family must support you.
I tried once, just once,
I told them there that there is no need for a dance hall in a very well-known hotel.
Why, you found our daughter in the street and the other people are no better than her.
This is the problem, everyone is staring at each other.
Who told you that I got married?
At least they don't have that arrogance.
The whole topic is about a simple party and some small expenses.
Come on, guys, these days people are having weddings on Facebook.
Cheaper and at a lower price.
This means that you will not marry someone from your country.
Forget the subject, do you want me to be crazy?
You see,
If you don't bring Abdullah Al Ruwaished or Nawal to my son's wedding.
Damn her, she won't be better than me.
I want to ask you something, my dear,
If your child has a Rawaished number, give it to us so we can contact him.
My dear, thank you very much, goodbye.
Mom, we agreed on the DJ, why did you change your mind?
And is there anyone who can take pictures better than me?
I forgot who she is and who we are?
The people who were less than us have become better than us.
Not like that, Mom, but look at my brother Saleh, he broke my heart even though we don't pressure him much.
Honestly, he broke my heart.
Wow!
At the hospital! When and which hospital?
I don't know, it suddenly fell.
I heard this and immediately signed.
He has no reason and no one can blame her, after she prepared everything and people knew, he simply said that he doesn't want a wedding.
He wants to embarrass us.
What did the doctor say?
He embarrasses us, he wants to cancel the wedding.
God willing, everything will be fine.
Don't break her heart.
Oh! Your son, you are a man and you are the provider.
Go, go and comfort her.
I swear, if I say these words to Abu Yusuf, his heart will stop beating.
Do you know why the minister has kept Abu Yusuf until now?
By the way, he was supposed to retire three or four years ago,
There is nothing wrong with him, he is helping me.
I swear, you are crazy.
Did you understand what I want from him now?
And have him hide the papers and data until the money is returned.
They call it delaying the cooling of amounts.
I won't talk, and I don't know why, why are you afraid.
There’s nothing to worry about, and in the end, I’ll refund you the amount.
Do you know what my name is, do you know what my name is?
The disciplined, the disciplined.
Uncle, uncle, I tried, but there is no other way than this.
If I give it to you and to the people who will come to review later,
They are strict in their scrutiny; they will take me quickly, quickly.
Quickly, the tablet, the tablet, the tablet.
You ate, you ate the tablet.
No, no, God willing, from seven thirty we will be in the banquet hall receiving the guests.
No, no, we will definitely be there.
I will throw a wedding for my son that will be the talk of all Doha.
Surprise!
Okay, my dear Fatima, I'll talk to you later.
I’m worried about you. They are jealous of you, boy. If you go to them tomorrow like that in Al-Bisha.
So, Mom, is the dress nice?
The police are here!
God willing, there is nothing wrong.
%Pw police, just stay here and I'll be back.
May God suffice you, Salouh.
Forget your marriage.
The marriage cage, now he is going to enter the prison cage.
They discovered the document I hid for your loan, and suddenly they discovered me.
Why are you upset!
You will hear disasters much worse than this.
What else can we say then!
A respectful and honest employee
Whoever loves their job, the ministry has contracted with a maintenance company.
The employee, out of his interest in his work, went and asked about the materials.
He discovered that it costs four hundred thousand.
He will save the ministry one million six hundred thousand.
And the minister punished him! No, no, no, I can't believe it.
Why can't you believe it!
Here is Saad,
Of course, he has all the news.
He was fired from work.
What happened to the world? Where are the values?
They say he called his office manager.
And he told him, let her work instead of Othman.
And who is she?
She is the daughter of the manager of the same company that submitted the maintenance offer.
Any Osman has been discovered.
No, no, no, no, this is unbelievable.
You are always surprised, Saleh!
Who is this company for?
For whom?
This is how we became!
What are you saying!
The issue is not with what I said, this poor employee Othman, what is his fault!
His mistake is that he is honest and sincere!
Do you think the manager is in his office?
Yes, he left a little while ago.
What's the problem in the world!
We started to see some strange people.
I agree with you, Othman doesn't deserve it, but we can't do anything about it.
Not exactly, Your Honor, he has seven children and does not have a passport.
He works this job to make a living! What is he doing now and where is he going?
Do you know what happened?
The new employee whom the minister hired,
I entered Othman's office and started working. Poor Othman came to get his things, I stopped him and told him to leave, and that I would send his things with the tea boy.
Where is he now?
Things have turned upside down! Oh! Othman?
This is the reward!
This is God's decree and destiny.
Praise be to the Almighty God.
God Almighty, the Generous, O Othman, God will not abandon you, goodbye.
What's wrong with you? You don't seem well!
I know, I know you're very sensitive.
Wow, amazing work! I can't work, I'm leaving now.
It is an opportunity for me to visit my mother and bring you the things.
I don't want you to stay upset like this.
Why are you yelling at me? I am your mother.
I'm not yelling at you, I'm just asking you.
What do you mean, by what right would you go with him? Is he your husband, your father, or your brother?
The world has changed, where are you living?
I don't know, Mom!
You are crazy.
People have been liberated, the world has become a small village, wherever you live!
But what can I say!
Be modern, live in the moment, and don't be late.
Take the things out of the car quickly! Come on, don’t just stare at me, and close it.
Is something wrong? Ya Saleh, what's wrong with you?
No, you are not okay today.
I shouted at the poor maid; it wasn't her fault.
You know I didn't mean it.
No, no, no, I have no appetite.
So I can forget the disasters I saw.
Dear, don't cry.
The president is a bit angry.
We are honored, Your Highness.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Hard work and perseverance.
Right, wow.
The most important thing,
The most important thing for me in this ministry
That's right! Your Honor.
Tell me, what’s the use of an employee who doesn’t take bribes?
He is useless.
That's why I want all of you
There is no place for sincere people and those who have worn-out principles and values.
If you ever discover
He will only blame himself.
Justice is a principle, no matter the reaction!
That's why I want you to cooperate with me.
If you have doubt
Just tell me.
We are thieves and the children of thieves, and no one can compete with our sisters.
If Noura takes a bribe during the day, she steals government tea before she returns home.
Excellent, excellent, bravo. This is what I expect from all of you, I don't want it to be just like this, I want each one of you to be like her.
God bless you.
That's why I want you to leave the purchasing department and become my office manager.
Honestly, you know how to choose; you picked the right thief for the right place.
Enough, Umm Saud, enough, don't torment me any more.
I don't want to live in prison.
But God is sufficient against Satan; He is a protector for me and has beautified honesty for me.
And he told me to be honest.
You are a father.
Why tire yourself out with honesty and sincerity?
All your life, you were a thief and comfortable.
It's good that I didn't become a loser.
Let me talk to your father.
Don't ever do it again.
He must be on the straight path, but he bribes, steals, and is hypocritical to live comfortably.
My father is in prison because all his money is illegal.
Stop, stop.
Is this something to wear!
We are a respectable family.
Shame on you.
Where is your stomach?
Why wasn't it exposed?
You don't feel shame, you are shameless.
I am shy, I dress, my brother.
Are there shy girls these days?
Why are you shouting?
Look what your daughter is wearing!
Is there a respectable girl who would wear something like this?
And you walk in the street without showing any part of your body?
I'm tired of her; she doesn't listen to what I say.
I haven't stopped supporting here.
I bought her some sheer clothes that weren't really necessary.
I warn you, if I ever see you in a place below the knee,
Since you know the situation, never blame me for the consequences.
We are here, God bless you.
God willing, he will be a spoiled and mischievous boy.
He is like his father.
As you see in front of you,
He is a very kind man, how can we find someone like him.
Don't worry, man, I'm bad.
Oh kind man. Honestly, I love my daughter Sarah very much and I care about her future.
Only after we heard about it.
Praise be to God, I heard it once badly.
I got home at half past three at night.
I arrived home at 5 in the morning.
Hello, hello, what! Hello.
Come and take me from the bar.
Start your car and come pick me up from the bar.
This is the first time I've seen a father who doesn't obey his son.
Stop, Dad. Start your car, I'm waiting for you.
Miri, I love you.
I still love you, I disappeared, disappeared, disappeared.
Basically, basically, paternal, dad here.
Where is he?
He is bold, unlike my father who doesn't like to have fun.
Let me introduce you to my beloved, Majid.
No, Dad, Abdulaziz was my ex-boyfriend.
Welcome, please go ahead, this is a golden opportunity.
Arab and Israeli satellites
I discovered that many Palestinians do not cut their nails.
According to what the State of Palestine adheres to in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement,
In any case, the United Nations is meeting today to discuss Israel's request to send special inspection committees to inspect the fingers of Palestinians.
So they can see if their nails are long or not.
There was a condition, which was that there should be nothing that cuts, injures, or causes bleeding.
State of Palestine
I call on the entire international community to visit Palestine.
From the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
Made of cork.
And the olive, man!
We press the olives this way, this way we press the olives.
We and our Arab brothers call on the international community
To establish inspection committees on the nails of Palestinians.
And now, let's start the voting.
No, no, no, no, it doesn't reach that level, no.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Saleh, Saleh, what's wrong with you?
What did you dream?
I dreamed of the upside-down world.
Oh! Rashid, you must have a strong personality,
Now, brother, what number is the school you will be working at tomorrow?
I am a teacher like you,
Why haven't I changed my school since I started studying?
What character, my brother?
But the problem is his weak personality.
By the way, the teachers who are with him are the ones who complained about him.
To that extent, my brother.
That's why you see him calm.
After that, he began teaching.
It wasn't ketchup, it was mayonnaise with %Pw.
Oh! Brother, we are not talking to you to upset you,
We are telling you because this is your last chance.
He told me that I accepted Rashid, even though he has a weak personality.
He is hesitant and very kind.
No matter what, he is still a citizen.
Why are you so quiet, brother?
Because everything you say is true.
Everything you say is true.
From tomorrow,
A new wise man.
Mr. Rashid,
You are absolutely right.
Okay, forget the matter.
And from tomorrow,
Yeah, this is Zain, what's the story now?
Here I am telling you,
I am a teacher who does not like mistakes,
Let's say a boy jumped and told you the same thing the second boy said at your previous school, and the inspector is there.
And take your bag!
Slowly, slowly, break the door.
Okay, one learns from their mistakes.
From the first minute,
Here I am telling you,
I am nervous.
The matter is up to me!
Just be quiet!
It seems like he said just be quiet!
Did you hear it?
Tell him Mr. Rashid fired me.
It seems like he said what matters to me, but we'll see, I don't want to see your face here in class.
Professor, do you know who he is?
Whose son is he?
Here comes Mr. Rashid.
Did you see it?
The problem is if he told his father.
Okay, where do you usually see him sitting, sitting during the break?
You might find him in the chairs area, sitting.
On the chairs.
Chairs, chairs.
At the end of the day, he is a human.
But you yelled at me!
Friends are joking, you are joking with me.
My dad is out of town and next week he will come back, and when he comes back I will tell him.
No, no, no, no, Abdulrahman, may God protect you.
We, we are friends. By the way, the red berry ice cream is really good, maybe you haven't tried it. It has a bit of tartness, but it tastes amazing.
Okay, go and take it quickly.
The only thing I'm afraid of is that he will tell his father.
I said that his father is outside.
Yeah, he's outside, his father isn't coming back? I mean, they took his father's stuff and kicked him out!
I hope there are no serious consequences.
I carried his bag and gave him his meal, and I gave him your phone number, and I told him if he needs anything, to call me—I am your friend.
Yeah, just.
Yeah, but what?
You are the ones who told me
Scream and pretend you are strong.
Bath, bath, bath.
Oh! Rashid!
Sleep, you can sleep, you can sleep, don't tire yourself, sleep.
Mr. Abu Nasser, Mr. Rashid is in the bathroom.
One juice.
Come here, come here, come here, come here, give me.
Go quickly.
Put them on the table.
All people are equal.
That's why I gathered you all, to hear your opinions about the party.
How can anyone guarantee a child?
This will get us into trouble, this is it, he is calling.
At three o'clock.
I mean, hello. He hung up, honestly he’s joking.
Faster, faster.
Peace be upon you.
Stand for the precise, sit down.
Yes, I am at your service.
Oh! Teacher, come, come here, oh! Teacher.
Are you done screaming?
I'm not making fun of you! Man, I'm just asking you, are you done?
Are you done or not? Where is the teacher's dignity? When you do this, you insult yourself and degrade the teaching profession.
Okay, okay, good, good.
And you raise your voice too?
Yes, I raise my voice. The first thing you need to know is who this boy is?
Faster, faster.
Just two cars.
Two cars, no, no, I want for four or five cars. More, more, we have a lot of space. Come on, come on, come on.
He thinks he owns the neighborhood!
Abu Nasser used to do this and not do that.
May God help him.
I am the manager here.
It is known that Abu Nasser
They were giving all the teachers extra classes.
Except me.
Who is the manager here,
You are the manager, may God guide you, what's wrong with you?
Put your foot down.
I didn't put it in your head, she's on the chair, oh! My brother.
%Pw What do you mean?
No need, honestly, I just want to give you a break.
What do they call it?
So, what should we do with you now?
Behave better for yourself and you will gain extra lessons whether you like the subject or not.
What's wrong with you? Go, go, go, get out!
Okay, outside.
As you wish, we told you, man.
We must stop him at his limits.
Wait! People, wait.
Don't blame us, Abu Sulayman.
Oh! Abu Nayef, you are the neighborhood leader and you must stop him from crossing the line.
I am not my father's son.
You’ll see what I do with it.
Faster, faster.
Goodbye, Your Highness.
Wow, when did he buy this new car?
I told you, but you didn't believe me.
He shaved his mustache and his face turned red.
I believed it when it came because I did not know it, and when he spoke, I recognized it by his voice.
Do you know that he was promoted a week ago?
This means that he is responsible for eight schools for boys and girls.
What is this magical secret? Ask him and he'll tell you, what is the secret that made him rise from the bottom!
Here I am telling you from the very first day,
When I study, I don't want to hear any noise.
And in the soul.
Behave politely.
And you still respond to me, and you still argue with me. Get out of my sight, get out, get out, get out.
When you appoint a minister, look for a good job for yourself.
So don't tell me to come and take this job.
Or the second job, no brother, give me options, different jobs and I will choose the most suitable for me.
My brother, the minister!
I swear I'm not comfortable with the call I received.
Everyone congratulates me.
What are they saying, Mom? May God guide you.
This is very common. Every minister hires their friends and people automatically.
From this side, don't worry, we are honored %Pw.
They know that I will become a minister.
It means, they are bribing me, this is a bribe.
A fortune is coming to us, a treasure, a treasure that will be open to us.
The Great Land.
Come on, everyone go congratulate the new minister.
Come on, come on, come on.
Congratulations, Your Excellency the Minister.
With your blessing, congratulations.
Congratulations, Your Highness, you deserve it.
You deserve it, Your Excellency the Minister.
O brothers, the responsibility is great, may God help us bear it.
As they say, you are very qualified for this job.
You left, then Abu Saleh's phone rang.
He was far from him.
Forget it.
I'm surprised, how does he love him now?
And Abu Sultan is not naive.
Yes, I opened the car door for him.
Bravo, you did a lot!
We are waiting for our brother to become a minister.
I told you, Mom, but you wouldn't believe me.
You used to say they were café stories, café stories.
After her husband died, she said that she used to envy her husband.
God forbid, God forbid.
Yeah, you have nothing to say, you have nothing at all.
Mom, let's go, I'm tired of this matter up to here.
What do you mean when you say "none of your business"?
You just need to rest.
I cut them off because they made me nervous.
Yes, they are right.
I just didn’t like saying it in front of my mom, you know, my mom says it to everyone.
She says whatever she hears, they call her the filter, we don't want a scandal.
What guarantees do you have that if he falls from power, they will put you in his place?
Because I asked.
If you are out of the office, you will be the first candidate.
What guarantees make you sure that they will throw it away?
No, I am very sure about this.
Don't thank me, I saw him outside the office just like I see you now in front of me.
You are casting a spell on him.
But the plan in my mind is guaranteed and effective.
This is a plan to burn it and throw it away.
I had him attend every event that took place in the country.
At this time, he is burning out, and when he burns out, he is out of the office. When he is out of the office, he gets fired.
I swear to God! Brother, I don't know how, and I don't know what to say to you!
Your visit is called, it is called participation that reflects how much you love your country.
You think so?
Today you are a statesman, you must always be present.
You have to participate in everything, sorry Your Honor, sorry, sorry.
Before I forget, thank you for the sheep you sent me yesterday.
Come on, Your Highness, this is a simple sheep, not your status. What do you think, Your Highness, will you come with me today?
The man is waiting for you outside!
Honestly,
I don't want to go.
I am tired, tired of the awe, tired of it.
You are a minister today, that's true. Just like you said, you are sociable, so make a place for yourself!
May God send you this good man.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Don't imagine me.
Take, take.
Today I took him to the night of poetry and the wedding, and they took at least a hundred pictures of him.
I’m telling you, there’s something really nice you should get for him.
Listen, I also arranged a really nice educational activity for you.
Yes, just like that. Make it shine, I want it to shine, shine, shine until it sparkles. I'm looking for that shine.
The seller, thank you, congratulations, congratulations, a blessed bike. %PW picture, a picture of your highness. Take a picture, take a picture. Don't take my picture, I am far away, take it.
This is the bike.
A blessed beginning and congratulations, Your Excellency, he greets you.
A picture, a picture like this. You are my flesh, my flesh, I swear on your honor.
Nothing, God bless you.
Go to the second page.
No, he knows it.
It is a national participation.
Say, "What God has willed."
This is the fourth friend to call me today.
Everyone praises your activities; Umm Khaled calls you the active social activist.
Yesterday I heard a word that hurt me.
The party that Abu Sultan took me to yesterday.
The celebration of the young children's victory in swimming.
One person was saying to his friend,
They thought I didn't hear them,
This minister said
I want to buy a birthday gift for my nephew.
Hello, hello.
I see you, sir, every day in the newspaper.
Correct, correct,
I came to the shop and brightened it up, I'll give you a discount on everything you want.
Whether you want to pay or not, no problem.
This means you won't go hang out with your minister.
I, I am Abu Saleh, the minister.
Abu Sultan hasn't come to take me anywhere; I am waiting for him.
He seated me in the front row, then went to the car to rest.
We don't need anything from him, may God guide you.
Please, woman, may God bless your parents, ask him. I will call you later just to double-check.
And you call yourself.
People are giving us discounts.
I told you.
This work is awesome.
Just let this man come and take me!
The minister's happiness upset me, may God harm him.
Hello, hello, Your Excellency the Minister.
No, but I'm a little tired today and
Okay, if you are very excited, we are at your service.
We are at your service, but my brother Saad will take you and go with you, and God willing, he will find you a party or something.
Later, a party?
No, no, we don't have any activities today.
No, we don't have.
Okay, where can we find it?
Yes. Thank you, thank you.
Is there someone we can ask?
May God help you.
Sleep and rest.
Wait a moment, Saad.
Anything until the henna night?
Yeah, that's good.
And there may be extra time.
Take him! Put him in the cabin and find a photographer to take pictures of his face.
Okay, okay, goodbye.
What did you find for him?
I don't know, a match in the Radf League. Let him stay alone on the field!
What is this! This minister is a curse on us!
Beautiful, this means he has reached the summit.
Its end is very near to becoming the talk of the people.
Your Honor, he has become much more famous than you.
If you go somewhere and take Abu Saleh with you,
Oh! Your Highness,
A star shines.
We will freeze it and return it to its natural size.
The minister came, came, came. The minister came.
You wouldn't believe it! You wouldn't believe it! I swear, if any of you take a picture of me, I'll break it for you. I won't appear.
Broke their cameras, I don't want pictures.
She sends you her regards.
As they say, I missed the train.
This is Khaled, my brother.
There is no power nor strength except with God.
Why is it like this?
This is the first time I see him.
The first time you see him!
The first time I've seen him in years.
Oh God.
Is this my eternity?
I haven't seen you in a long time, come to me, dear.
What is he doing? He is really attached to her.
There is no power nor strength except with God; it goes back to the same topic.
Get out, get out and don't give me a headache. I came back from the wedding at 3 in the morning.
Just let me rest, and don't make a big deal out of it.
Your brother is a girl.
I swear I'll tell my dad, watch yourself, you look like a girl.
This means he was playing, playing.
Yeah, he was playing, I tell you he was playing with the makeup palette.
This is Saud, I know what to do with him.
Poor Khalood, I wish all children were like him.
About these campaigns and the nonsense he does about his brother.
Come here, my dear brothers, come and say hello.
How are you, dear?
No, my dear, we are not going to Spain this summer.
Who are you talking to?
Cheetahs from Kuwait.
Hello Hamada!
Listen to what I'm saying.
There is no power nor strength except with God.
I'll let my beloved Amal choose for herself.
But honestly, what do you think?
I say the one overlooking the sea is better.
So that in the near future, if we buy a yacht, we can go straight from our house to the sea.
We and our children.
Please, you need to decide on the wedding date.
No problem, just a year and a few months.
What's up with your brother, he puts on a lot of perfume.
Amal, honestly, I noticed that your brother Khaled, I don't know.
But he is completely different from your brother Saad.
Different or not different, my dear, everyone is free in their actions.
And your fiancé is late, he doesn't know that there is a unisex perfume.
Let your fiancé keep his opinion to himself!
What matters to me.
How true, Khaled!
It's not your perfume that you use like women,
So that you use their colors.
Why are you doing this, Khaled?
Honestly, you have nothing to say.
Mom, why don't you want to believe anything about him? Don't you see his actions and behavior?
Currently, perfumes are unisex.
Here I warn you.
Did you see the Bluetooth?
I heard about this from our friends at the council; they say it is very common in Doha.
I heard about him, show him to us.
You have to see it, and I'll tell you later.
Look at how this girl dances!
Look at the moves!
These girls! Look at this one who says she dances well and does moves, do you know who she is? She is Khulood Mohammed's cousin.
To my cursed brother Khaled.
Okay, I'll see what I can do for him.
Wait, Saad's brother is here now.
Why? Let him come and see, let Saad come! I'll send him the Bluetooth, so his family can see him.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, hello, hello.
Of course, you were defeated.
Why is my cousin sitting so far away?
It's nothing, but is your Bluetooth on?
No, but I will send you something.
No, thank you, Princess.
He ran away from his family.
Are you crazy, Saad?
And I will travel tomorrow.
You will not see my face in this country.
Where are you going by yourself? (expression), Where are you going by yourself? (expression).
What are people saying?
They say their son left them and traveled, they don't want to cause us a scandal!
Oh, really?
What your son Khaloud has done is honor and glory!
A man turned himself into a woman, isn't that a scandal?
I can't face people if they say this is the brother of a gay person.
Say that he is traveling for treatment, study, work, or even if he decided to commit suicide.
The most important thing is that I don't live in a place where scandals chase me every day.
Where are you going?
I don't care where I go.
This is the end.
The second one, we don't know where he is, and this one here is packing his bag to travel.
Even we don't know where we're going?
What were you expecting it to be?
What's wrong with you? I came to you for comfort, and you throw harsh words at me that break my heart.
I was telling you to take care of him.
Do not leave it to the servants.
You don't know anything about him and you were busy.
And the pope is busy with his work and has left the responsibility to you.
You are right, Mom.
Is there no hope for your sister?
In this, you are right.
What Khulood did humiliated us in front of people.
I can't see anyone.
Did I say something to him?
This is my father's biggest flaw.
We are in a problem, strange Khaloud.
I did not tell him.
Put it on a CD and give it to him.
But only when I am going to the airport.
I am very worried about him.
Our house must reach this level, yes! {Amal.
Don't be surprised,
Kholoud and her companions do not care about their families' reputation.
And they heard their brothers and sisters.
No matter how noble the religious values are called.
They appear to be dancing and cheering.
In the evil bank.
By God, my son, I am confused,
Goodbye, Dad.
Take care of yourself, boy.
Yes, Dad, I have a simple gift for you, Dad.
A gift for me!
Now put the CD in the laptop, I'm afraid of what will happen, come with me!
Yes, Mom.
I can't believe my dad is still watching the CD; it's only three minutes long.
It might come out.
Where is he going to go? There isn't enough time for him to go anywhere.
Answer me, what's wrong with you, Abu Saad?
Dad!
No problem, oh! Amal,
And if I try, I will fail.
To find someone with your principles,
Just forgive me
May God help you,
I see you’re coming up to the roof!
Yes, my love.
We live in the age of freedom.
The era of human rights, and no one owes us anything.
If anyone has one riyal, they can take a thousand, oh light of my eyes.
Of course, I can deal with him. May God protect America, my dear.
Did you know that salaries are high now?
One thousand two hundred.
May God suffice you, every time you talk to a driver you ask him, how much is your salary?
My salary is very low.
When he sees me, he starts complaining, "My salary is low and there's no benefit." We agreed with him that his salary is seven hundred and we raised it by a hundred when he got the license, what more does he want?
I told him, when you finish a year of work, we will raise your salary.
It seems he is greedy, and we will go through difficult times with him.
Stop, stop, just be quiet, just be quiet, just be quiet, turn him back and finish him off.
This word is easy for you, easy.
So she lets him annoy her, I hate going out in the car with him.
Sure, leave it to me.
Now you told me the story, I am the head of the house.%Pw. Be quiet, stop, you be quiet too, I will handle it.
People, I want you out, people!
Come stand.
What did I tell you?
Did you tell your friends not to come to your room? Did you say it or not?
Hey manager, this is not my friend, this is my uncle.
He'll come in five minutes and leave, God willing.
Five minutes!
And keep it in mind!
Don't tell the lady I need a raise, I need a raise!
Everything in the world has become expensive now.
And when did I give you two hundred?
Sir, I have many problems at home.
These drivers in Doha earn one thousand one hundred, one thousand two hundred.
It could be one thousand three hundred.
Wait, I'm thinking.
Listen, I will raise a hundred and %pw, be quiet, I won't raise you.
Don't say I raised you an extra hundred, go work!
What did he say?
I'm telling you,
There is no benefit at all,
There is no use in two hundred,
I am afraid of the screen.
Why are you afraid?
All the drivers are fleeing,
Because they work abroad for three thousand or four thousand.
What's the problem? When you work at home, there's no benefit, but when you work outside, you earn more money.
I am very scared.
Look at these, they are all drivers.
How much?
Two thousand five hundred.
I'm just afraid of the police who will take me and put me in prison.
No, don't be afraid.
I guarantee you.
I was wearing my abaya and was about to go out.
I was calling, but no one answered me just now.
He opened his room and the closet was empty.
The maid Munira escaped for a year.
Just saying, God is enough for him.
Okay, I will come to you.
I went to the police.
If you file a report, you have no responsibility.
We will do everything we can do.
And you also look here and there in the neighborhood, maybe you'll see him and tell us.
Yes, he will bring money, and when he is satisfied, he will surrender himself.
We accommodate them, provide for them, give them clothes, food, and driving training.
It's none of my business.
The match is starting now, go inside, going inside is better.
Yes, we were worried,
These are foxes, and foxes are not easily hunted.
Do you know that if we score more than three, it means we didn't win; we need ten or fifteen.
This is clear sarcasm, clear sarcasm. Let's be clear, this is clear sarcasm.
This is his level. If he doesn't score more than three, this is not the Fox team.
Take it from me.
In ourselves, in the players, and in the performance.
They have nothing; they must thank God if they get less than three, they must thank God.
Any goal, these are just appetizers. Our team is still hungry, these are the foxes team, leave us alone, guys.
I just scored a goal, now you're relaxed and happy.
Do you think there will be other goals, or does the matter stop here?
This fox is very clever, he is very smart. He goes here and there and no one can catch him, it makes you dizzy. This fox eats chickens.
No, no, I don't have a car.
You are my friend.
Did you hear what he said?
He said that this fox has many problems,
You can't catch up with him.
Yes, oh! Sir.
Do you know it or not?
He is a fan of the Foxes team.
He sometimes appears on the program "Renew Yourself."
They will win today, and you will lose.
I swear I'll hit you. The Foxes team never loses, they're always the winner.
Thaloub, what do you think about the result today?
Why are you asking me about the result?
It's over, the foxes are the winners.
The birds came to take their sustenance and fly away.
Let's be a bit realistic, don't say that the foxes won and then run away.
These are the foxes, my friend.
This fox took the chicken and ate it.
I haven't seen what your honor did on the field.
The audience can't stop laughing at him.
Clear on the field, and thank you for listening.
The true fan who has genuine loyalty to the club
He hangs out with the Qatari elite who go to malls and similar places.
I am determined to have a cappuccino.
Oh, strange world! Oh man.
The boy gave me five hundred riyals and paid the bill.
Tell us the poem you wrote about our match with the frogs.
Thank you to all the listeners here.
You are a frog.
Don't feel embarrassed that my team beat you by four.
Speak rudely, speak rudely about the club and the team and see what happens!
Don't say that!
When one of the foxes was expelled
And the reason behind this is the ruling.
A player was expelled from the Foxes team,
He changed his name from "wise" to "stupid."
Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the listeners here.
Every month, we used to meet to choose the best fan.
Great, and who did you choose this month for the honor?
A member of the club's board of directors is the one who will decide.
They are all kids, and each one of you is as big as a camel.
From the management of this great club. Thaaloob.
Come, come and see the driver who ran away from us, he is on the television, come.
Is this it?
This one speaks well, the other is mute.
What do you think, is this a pen or a watch?
Now, I know how to reach him.
The crowds have left.
Wrap it around.
He is wrapped here.
He was driving fast.
We lost him now.
Beautiful!
Be quiet, you don't decide. I am the head of the house and I am the one who decides.
We need to be sure.
Majid Abdulrahman Al-Subaie.
Yes, yes, yes, God bless you.
I am from the Subaj tribe.
Buy it and register it for me. No, no, no, no, I don't want to live in it, I have a house.
I just want to invest.
Because the investment price is rising, God bless you.
How can I help you? Guys, what do you want?
* * God bless you,
Please, everyone, would you like some coffee?
You have nothing to say, God bless you, you don't need anything, God honor you.
You say I'm sure, is that right? We're about to embarrass ourselves in front of the elite!
I am very worried.
Mama, mama, I am mama.
Now, what is your father going to do to us? I don't know.
I didn't mean it like that, Mom!
Please, Mom, don't tell Dad.
Your father is turning the house upside down.
Of course, he is going to kill you now.
Mom, I swear I didn't break it on purpose.
Come on, Mom, why don't we buy glue and stick them together?
What are we committed to, boy?
How can we find something like this? I don't know where your uncle bought it, it was a gift.
I am worried about you because of him.
Mom, I'm afraid he will hit me.
I locked the door until I find a solution to this issue.
Quickly, go to your room.
Blind, blind, blind! Are you blind?!
Are you blind to break the vase, are you blind?
Mama, didn't Walid come to you?
No, girl, he didn't come. What happened to you?
He ran away from home, afraid of his father.
This is not right. Be a little more compassionate with the boy!
This is not upbringing, may God guide you, girl!
What should I do now, Mom?
I don't know what to do!
I don't know, but I was worried about him because of the cars on the street.
May God protect him, I think he went to the supermarket or went to their neighbors to play with the kids.
Yes, he is kind, gentle, and lovable. Oh! A girl.
No, no my daughter, seek refuge in God from Satan and do not worry, God willing everything will be fine.
Alright, goodbye my daughter.
Where is Walid?
Dad is going to hit me.
My grandmother, dad is beating me to death.
Don't be alarmed, my light of my eye.
Don't be afraid, my love!
I won't let him hit you.
I didn't mean to break it.
Come here, my son, come drink some water and rest in my room.
Your face has turned yellow.
May God guide him, may God guide him. Come with me, boy, a little.
O Generous God.
I'm afraid my dad will come here.
Come on, boy, don't worry,
No one should interfere in raising my son.
This is my son, and I am raising him the way I want.
But the poor man was scattered, trembling, and terrified by something he did not intend to do.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
Let him see!
The bag accidentally hit the vase, believe me, he didn't mean to do that.
You! You must support him!
Don't say anything about me to him, please. Forgive him this time; his state of fear breaks my heart.
But where, where is he now? Why is he here at this time?
He is not here.
He is here! Where?
Come in, hurry up!
No, no, I’m going to take it to my brother today.
Why don't you bring something other than the old stuff!
Come on, Nasser! Brother, we want to play!
And your mother says that you are studying!
Dad, let's play this game and then we'll study!
Don't you have an exam tomorrow?
Yes, Dad.
Come on, Dad, go ahead and don't ruin the game.
Come on, Dad, come on, don’t take it seriously. Come on, come on, Dad, we’re studying.
What are you saying! %Pw. Listen to me,
If you don't go, I'll call your uncle Abu Walid now.
No, no, no, no. Don't tell my uncle, don't tell my uncle, no!
What matters to me,
I tell him that you do not obey me.
Go. Everyone take your book and start studying.
Okay, Dad, put your phone in your pocket, we're studying, Dad, but don't tell my uncle.
Mom, I swear I'm really confused. I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid if he finds out, he'll cause us trouble.
Of course, he asks me, why are you taking him to the hospital?
So what's the problem if I tell him?
If he finds out that Walid is peeing in his bed, he will kill him.
Oh! Mom, he's the one we should blame. It's all his fault.
Oh! Girl, it has a psychological effect.
The boy is not a child; he is now twelve years old.
Alright, my girl.
He will come to have lunch with us, and I will give him some hints.
And I will see his opinion.
Her mother went to Bahrain to buy abayas.
This is just an excuse, girl.
Fun and shopping.
She says he pees in his bed every night.
My son wets his bed every night and you don't tell me the story.
He said I have to take him to the hospital so they can treat him.
Her husband is stupid
And this is what Shi understands.
It is true.
They need to take him to the hospital! Oh boy, so they can know what he's suffering from.
And he is looking for a good dry hose.
A soft blow, the last person in the neighborhood hears the screaming.
Sit down!
Eat, my daughter, eat.
No, I didn't say anything.
Take it and go quickly and shower, I'll bring you some clothes. Come on!
I beg you, please.
I have to punish them.
Don't interfere!
Is this considered a pass?
And Khaled scored forty-nine out of fifty.
Is this a pass?
But their grades are good.
He told them that you will be punished if you don't get fifty out of fifty.
Please, don't take them to your brother!
They must be punished.
They are my children.
Okay, really, uncle, uncle, this will be the last time.
Why don't you get fifty out of fifty, fifty out of fifty.
One more gift.
I tell him, don't go to public places with us.
Yesterday we went to the hospital and they told him not to enter. You are not allowed.
You are different, you do not walk with us.
Be quiet! Let me punish his brothers.
Stop, man, I'm about to die, stop, stop, stop, stop. I'm about to die, stop, man.
Let me punish you.
Keep in mind that this is not a punishment; what you will see at the end of the year, if any of you did not get fifty.
I want to use the pool.
Fill it with oil.
Where is your certificate? Where is your certificate?
%Pw They said it will be ready tomorrow.
Khalid Abdulrahman
Wow! Khaled, excellent job.
Faisal Abdullah Rashid.
Excellent! Oh! Faisal.
God bless you.
You are an outstanding student and you were second in your class.
The teacher is crying because he got forty-nine out of fifty in mathematics.
The teacher is afraid of his father because his father wants him to get fifty out of fifty.
Hey boy, I'm talking to you!
Call, call his classmate.
He said he saw him next to the school entrance.
Call, call your mother, she might be at your father's mother's place.
No, we are not going there.
Where is he? Where is he?
There is no power nor strength except with God.
What's wrong, brother?
Ah, of course, he is a failure and he is afraid of his family.
No, he did not fail, but he is an outstanding student and was second in his class.
However, he was afraid to go back home.
Because he only lost two marks in mathematics.
May God have mercy on him.
Walid, Walid.
Walid, Walid.
Oh! Walid, come here.
Forty-eight, forty-nine, missed one or two marks, it's okay. I won't say anything, I won't scold you or hit you. Walid,
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Nuclear energy
Which constitute sixty percent of the world's oil reserves
Saudi Arabia leads the scene with twenty-four percent of the world's reserves.
Then Libya, America, and Nigeria
Three percent each, and then the rest of the world together with fifteen percent.
Therefore
As well as production
And this could be one of the secrets and reasons behind why the major industrial countries are racing to occupy this region and its countries.
And above them is the United States of America, which is the largest oil consumer in the world.
Nevertheless, oil prices are continuously rising.
At the same time as the fall of the US dollar
Which is considered a unit for pricing oil
Where was yesterday, the price of a single barrel reached
This led to an increase in income in the producing countries and at the same time
To increase its inflation
Inflation in some of these countries has reached fifteen percent.
The most important source of energy in the world
Commodity Prices and Cost of Living
In a live interview with the Deputy Prime Minister
Qatari Minister of Energy and Industry
Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah
And for the viewers who would like to participate, they can contact us through the program's communication numbers.
Dear Deputy, peace be upon you and welcome
I would like to start with you by discussing the unprecedented prices that oil has reached.
Where could prices go?
Of course, where prices can reach is a puzzling question.
Or what we call market power
Isn't it OPEC?
And what about the producing countries?
What are the producing countries, and what is OPEC's relationship to oil pricing?
Is the only relationship of price between supply and demand?
So far, supply and demand don't have much to do with the matter.
What are the factors?
There are other factors besides supply and demand.
What made the investors
I feel a lot of pressure and have turned to oil and gold, or what is called (commodity trading).
Investors have lost confidence in the stock markets.
And also gold
We have seen gold rise from three hundred and fifty dollars in the past years to now reaching nine hundred and seventy dollars.
And until today, as I mentioned before, about one hundred and nine dollars.
But they are all rising, and if they go down, it will be a slight decrease.
Let me remind you that in the first quarter of this year
The second quarter, which is supposed to witness a decrease in prices due to low demand for oil
But we saw the market in an exciting and strangely changing state.
In the second quarter and at the beginning of spring, it rises above one hundred dollars.
But this means that the previous factors that determined the rise in prices in winter and consumption have now changed, and there are other factors.
And economic growth
At the same time, we see oil prices rising to this level.
I mentioned the political factors and said that political tensions play a role in this.
About Iran. Do you think Falun's resignation amid the political complexities
The one who was accompanying and today led most of the activities of American newspapers and the global press. It could affect oil prices.
Yes, one hundred percent, and today any
Today we are in the era of globalization, and influence comes quickly.
Unrealistic factors may affect
It causes a kind of disruption in the market.
Likewise, some types of political rumors were created.
He said there is no plan, but he did not deny the existence of other options that could apply to Iran.
Markets always react to uncertainty.
Of course, right now there is nothing certain that America is at war with Iran.
And I am one of the people who do not see this scenario.
And maybe what we saw is what will happen in the future.
But we, who work in the energy field
We see that these political tensions
In global oil supplies
On the contrary, there are very profitable supplies.
This indicates that there is oil going into storage.
There is never any shortage in oil supplies.
It could be preparation for the next war.
In light of this reassuring picture you are talking about regarding supply and that there are no obstacles in supply
In case US President Bush and the United States decide to change their plan
This is something else
Prices will rise to reach record-breaking figures, especially
The price of oil may reach
From the world's oil reserves
You are here,, today the Gulf represents the most important.
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and the rest of the Gulf countries
Today, they represent more than 60% of oil reserves, and this is certain.
You are today
If it becomes a very small accident
Therefore, it refers to
This means that in the event of any war with Iran, there is no guarantee as to how far oil prices will go.
God knows today we can reach, we arrived without
The wars have reached one hundred and seven and one hundred and ten dollars, and they could jump to one hundred and ten, God knows.
Today, oil, as I told you, is living under political and psychological tensions.
And the speculators took advantage of these tensions.
Just invest in oil
Or what is called unreal investment, of course not future buying nor future marketing.
And they call it olive leaves.
They are all speculations in the oil paper.
Its total production is about three hundred thousand barrels or less.
These people may lead to more purchases rather than more updates.
I hope April will be April Fools' Day.
I hope there isn't any
It is said that Cheney is coming to the region, and this is on his main agenda.
Cheney is the owner of this project, as stated by many politicians and media figures.
I didn't know what was in the Chinese guy's bag.
And I can't predict what will be in it, I mean.
Is he starting the war?
America in a transitional phase
And why doesn't the boy do something else?
Let's see what happens, if we're talking about April, April is coming soon, just a few weeks and we'll be in April.
And the world can pay
And America is a huge consumer.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf is the tough number.
You can't just throw away this number.
Their production cost is very cheap.
Compared to West African countries, most of which rely on
The Gulf, there is no other country in the world that can
Look, we have heard this talk from the West and from the United States for many years.
Use of the
Until the last drop of it. And do you remember the story of the Caspian Sea War?
No matter what these dreams are
When you sit with Westerners in a tight circle
You hear them speaking in a different way
What are they saying?
About supplies, the importance of the region, and the value of reserves
When I asked one of the European officials, I said: It's strange that you talk among us behind closed doors.
Not in the same way you speak in front of people.
Or the media said: This is for political reasons.
And of course, there are what they call double standards or double talk.
The language known in the Gulf countries
It is as important today as Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The largest oil producer and exporter in the world
And it includes
Despite all this
Leader of the Central Region
Start a war on Iran
Even with an air war or an air strike, as they say.
In supplies
You are not late, you are actually very generous.
I do not agree with what she says.
We don't even deal with Westerners.
We deal with America
Where are the good prices?
Regardless of the nationality of this market
I mean, non-renewable energy.
For (generosity)
Arab generosity
Please, bring it to me.
Observers say that the real price of oil
The reason behind the rise in oil prices
You are the Gulf citizens, OPEC, and the countries
You are very generous with the Americans and insist on sticking to their currency.
I said that the price of oil must be seventy dollars.
I said the actual price against the decline of the US dollar is from sixty to seventy.
Okay, now the price is perfect.
One hundred and nine because the dollar dropped by thirty percent.
And now over one hundred dollars
If we take the percentage and the ratio
No one denies it.
And one of the main reasons
Compared to the decline of the US dollar
If we take
This comparison
Those oil prices
Because the United States of America
Of course, it is in our interest at the moment for the dollar to go down.
Weakness or stagnation in the American economy, the United States "can't do anything"
So, what happened to this weakness and economic stagnation?
You will become like that too.
The United States reduces interest rates on the dollar
Why insist on linking oil to the dollar?
Let's talk about why oil prices are pegged to the dollar
The first one, more than 100 years ago
The first one to start exporting was the first barrel of oil exported from the United States of America.
And it was exported in dollars
And it has been from the twentieth century until today
Oil pricing in dollars
Historically became
For a hundred years, the world has been interacting and setting prices.
Norway is today considered the third largest oil-producing country.
Oil production and exportation
Russia is the second largest oil exporter.
And the production of the North Sea field in Europe
Pricing in dollars and not in
Everything changes in the world, in other sources and information that point to something different from this.
You are the Gulf countries
Do you have secret agreements between you and the Americans?
And oil became the real cover.
This is true and there is nothing in it.
And these agreements
Oil remains the cover for the dollar in exchange for the United States continuing to support these regimes.
This is not true and there are no secret agreements.
Today, let's take OPEC.
You have sixty-six percent, a decent deputy.
Among thirteen countries
Among the eighty-five barrels, forty percent are allocated to the OPEC organization.
There are many large countries in oil production.
Outside the OPEC organization
What are the obstacles that prevent pricing in a different currency?
Search for prices in another currency
Isn't it when the adults decide?
You, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf countries are very smart.
Today, OPEC's share is like everyone else's.
It is sixty percent.
Even if we assume that OPEC wanted this.
There is an agreement among all oil-producing countries.
There is a direction and intention towards change
What kind of attempt is it?
But right now, these countries cannot change the pricing currency.
Unless there is an agreement between
What is the effect of the
Let me talk now about why the Europeans
They do not export their oil
From the North Sea or Russia or Norway in euros or rupees
Because it is in their interest that their currency is high and valuable.
On the contrary
This is where they have a loss.
For one euro, they export one and a half barrels.
No, you are the one losing because your currency has depreciated since it is pegged to the dollar.
And it is after a great loss, a very huge loss.
The currency association here in the Gulf has a historical connection.
Do you remember when the dollar was the strongest currency in the world?
And now it is connected when you talk about separation.
It is like marriage when we get married.
And if you want to get a divorce, the matter is not easy.
Not here
Or I did a Catholic marriage in dollars
Costs must be examined in a manner
It has been professionally examined and inspected.
And likewise Kuwait, it has pegged twenty-five percent of its currency to the dollar.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, and Qatar
The price of its currency may be adjusted.
Today about the topic, but this just means that you have no intention to study the topic or think about it.
The exam naturally differs, as His Excellency the Prime Minister stated.
He stated that the Qatari currency is thirty percent below its real value.
Be in this study
You are not the only ones heading in this direction on this matter.
Kuwait walked its own way, so why not follow its path?
Economists say it is more profitable for countries and their peoples than loss.
But we are
And there is nothing else.
That these four Gulf countries declare
All people believe.
I mean the one they personally support.
He will support him.
It must be included in the study.
In itself
Made from one state or two states?
Until the time of the currency came
It means the situation won't be fixed now.
Of course, there will be experts who will conduct this study.
And they are the ones who
Not experts, this requires a political decision.
Let's wait and not rush now, see what's happening today.
People started,,, I mean
Of course, there is a situation of collusion.
Dear Deputy, the inflation rate in Qatar in 2007 reached 14% and will reach 15% this year.
He eats people's salaries, swallows their salaries, the salaries of the people who work here.
Salaries of Qatar residents have eroded by a percentage ranging from thirty-five to forty percent.
We will get back to you after the break to find out the extent of the salary increases.
The number of employees in Qatar for at least the upcoming period, so stay with us.
Welcome back to "Without Borders" in this episode where we host the Deputy Prime Minister, Qatari Minister of Energy
And the industry, Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah, about the significant increase in prices
In oil, which brought back tens of millions of dollars to the Gulf countries and the producing countries
About oil, and my question was about the upcoming increase in employees' salaries, but before this increase, I would like to give you some important information.
The UAE has 97.8 billion in reserves and produces 2.6 billion.
Only tons, and the report in Kuwait Times is an economic report; the Gulf's revenues are among the largest revenues.
The expected revenues for Saudi Arabia in the year two thousand and eight are one hundred and nine billion.
And was
One hundred and seventy last year in the UAE, and sixty-six this year, and it was expected to be seventy-five.
Kuwait is sixty-four years old and was fifty-four.
Twenty-one barrels of oil in addition to fifty-five billion
From the puzzles, as other reports said, and by God, there is no jealousy, I mean we are not jealous of the Excellence Deputy.
Iraq seventy-four billion
One and a half trillion
In terms of spending, it was one and a half trillion dollars.
The Gulf countries exported one trillion, that is, one thousand billion.
The dollar was a variety of imports
The United States' investment was three hundred billion.
Nine out of every ten billion
In Bahrain, it was three percent.
In 2007 in Amman, it was six and a half but it will rise to seven; in Qatar, it was thirteen point seventy-five but it will rise to fifteen percent in Qatar.
This means that those living in Qatar expect a high cost of living, in terms of goods and prices.
Life is getting tougher, and prices are rising, reaching high and even higher levels in Qatar.
We sympathize with everyone
Then the solution must be
And the solution means that it aims to control inflation.
It means that you will increase their salaries by 50%.
No, they are saying that you are against raising salaries.
This is not correct
In the Cabinet, against raising salaries
He is in trouble, and the solution must be the perfect solution.
And what is the patchwork solution?
Okay, there is a balance between the two.
And that's it.
The important thing is to solve the problem of inflation.
And here in Qatar, there is a committee
His Highness issued the formation of
And he lands
And lays a strong foundation
To solve the problem and control inflation
The important thing now is to control inflation.
Inflation
If I control it
Just, Mr. Deputy, now
The one who specialized in market research and was published last February, a few days ago
Among them because of the salaries for
Now you will solve the inflation problem and let inflation eat away at these people's income.
Many of them now
Entry to other countries
We increase our salaries, then solve the inflation problem, and then lower them again.
I am repeating what they say, which is achieving balance on the subject.
Just now
And it will be a temporary solution
Add it in a bigger way
That's why here
To stop inflation
Boredom always
Because the increase was huge during the past year, right?
The second point is
Those who work in the private sector are not the same as those who work in the government sector.
The private sector is very neglected.
So now we need to look at the issue of the increase fairly as well.
I don't know where you got these notes from.
We live in Qatar, Your Highness, not in Germany.
I am telling you the opposite; today the private sector has started to pay.
More than that
Some of the Qataris who were working in government departments have moved to the private sector.
Due to the high salaries
Facing a problem
To move to the private sector because the private sector is more vibrant and dynamic
And it gives good salaries
Related to what is called market power
Or market power
They don't come with very high certificates.
They don't come to Qatar because the salaries in Qatar are low or the expenses are low.
Or with the expenses they bring with them
All with our clear understanding
I don't expect the events, and I say that there will be an increase in salaries.
There is no hope anymore.
To control inflation
Let's give him some time.
On controlling inflation
And by the will of God, this is what the report said, that Qatar in the year two thousand and eight
God willing, we say that.
We see that these numbers will change.
Sprinkle a little of it on the people.
It is a professional process
Of course, with professionalism and everything, but...
Inflation
Because spending
Many on different projects
Let me take a few questions from the viewers, and I hope everyone asks a direct question. Abdulaziz Mohammed from Morocco, what is your question, brother Abdulaziz?
It is based on the ruling families in the Gulf.
That's why I don't think the justification for this is the difference in OPEC.
Secondly, the total income from oil goes directly to the ruler.
Then to the royal family, and the rest will be spent on development.
In the absence of accountability, the situation will remain as it is.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God
Hello my brother Ahmed
I won’t make this long, the brother mentioned regarding the rulers and regimes and the issue of the Qatari riyal and its link to the dollar or the other Gulf currencies with the dollar only.
America wants to globalize the world and force it to pledge full allegiance to it.
The American deficit has become, and the volume of trade between China and America reached eighty-two billion dollars.
With it, the European Union has eighty-six billion dollars.
This means that all trends in global politics are against the dollar.
We are paying the price of its consequences now as Arab countries and Gulf oil states.
It will end with a confrontation between America
Among the developed countries of the world such as China, Russia, and others, the issue may become
Pure soldier
The explosions are from Chinese bombs, Russian bombs, Japanese bombs, and also American bombs.
Thank you very much for this clarification and this information.
Your question, O Muhammad, is
Hello, your question
Can you turn down the TV and ask your question?
Okay, your question is
But from what I saw, Saad insisted on not responding.
The issue of not being correlated with the dollar because the dollar is declining
And God willing, you will reach the bottom.
He is a good man.
What is supposed to follow the style of the Arab brothers?
Thank you, brother Mohammed. Thank you. Now we ask for the final intervention from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. Your question, Ahmed, is
Good evening to you again
Thank you and thank you for the wonderful interview.
What is required, a raise in salary? God willing, things will get better.
It's true that we all face problems, but not with salaries.
Salaries are things by the will of God
Okay, quickly tell me your question.
Your line will be cut off, do you have a question?
All of this is due to high prices; the increase has affected all goods, all of which are exported.
From the European countries
In the Arab world, we have factories and laboratories.
Thank you, Ahmed. Thank you, you took your time.
The issue of rising prices is an important issue now.
In the case of supporting the poor, the man told you to hold on to the poor, Your Highness.
Who doesn't have a billion here is considered poor.
Here we are for some brothers
Who knows Qatar
This is not true for the State of Qatar.
Today, anyone who comes to Qatar can see the indicators.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar, and they are
The highest growth rates in the world
Where does this wealth go and what do you do with it?
What is included within the framework of the response?
When the Moroccan spoke, he spoke in a way that was neither true nor realistic.
The person who does not see with his own eyes is
If he came and saw Qatar and the many major developments that are happening there
As a big cat, you are right, you are asking
And everyone has the right
And since your number is small, where do you get people from?
Does this really mean that you will bring the surplus from China, for example?
No, we will not export, God willing.
The country is built on a plan and on
The ideal independence from the amount of money that comes from oil and gas, and everyone knows that oil and gas will eventually run out.
The State of Qatar will become
It is considered one of the best achievements in the Arab world.
Today as well
Focus on
And that will have a big impact
In the post-oil and gas phase
So you don't imitate Dubai.
Every country has its own particularities.
In the State of Qatar, we focused on education
About the ingredients
There will be a medical city where people come for treatment.
There will be a media city that adapts.
Of course, the world today, today we must build
Build a vision
About the post-oil and gas era
There were fatal errors.
Unfortunately, we did not welcome this mutation because it caught us off guard.
And we were not prepared for it, neither humanly, technically, nor even educationally.
Now it has changed after thirty years.
And even better
Today in a vision
And the vision
And the vision
Thank you, Your Excellency the Deputy, and I also thank our audience.
To keep following us, and we hope that we have provided you with...
Qatar's foreign policy appears ambiguous to many observers.
Qatar enjoys special ties
At the same time, Qatar had relations with Israel and still has.
Islamic Resistance Movement "Hamas"
And Qatar presented
Started
The largest Arab country
Those who angered the regime in Egypt
To the extent of accusing Qatar of conspiring against Egypt
Qatar was also not far from the important files.
Like Darfur, the Houthis in Yemen, and even the Israeli prisoners
Gilad Shalit, the reach of Qatari foreign policy extended to him in a way that upset the largest Arab countries.
And what kind of power keeps her in this position?
These achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
Or write to us through our website www.Aljazeera.net
Hello Your Highness
In September two thousand and seven twenty-two, to Saudi Arabia
The visit was different in the relationship between the two countries, at least in the past two years.
Redrawing the borders
Wash what was stored.
This is what was mentioned
In Al-Hijaz newspaper or magazine
The one that was held with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in which communication was restored and the Saudi ambassador returned.
To Doha
First, your introduction was very long and required many answers without your last question.
Who I think you gave it to
Especially on the Saudi issue
What is flour?
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is very important to Qatar
Between the two countries
You talked about the silence of the island.
You talked about a revolutionary movement
I believe these matters have been clarified by both parties.
And we accepted the clarification.
In the State of Qatar
Dispute with Saudi Arabia
He was always limited in scope.
From perspectives
And thanks to God, this was due to the wisdom of the two leaders.
King Abdullah and His Highness the Prince
Significantly in the Gulf
For more than a hundred years
They were smart, honorable, and trustworthy relationships.
I want to limit it to the misunderstanding between the two parties.
This matter has been dealt with and there were no conditions.
In solving any case
But there was understanding and there was sincere intention between the parties.
To resolve this pending issue
It is not a seasonal relationship but a strategic one.
We hope it does not continue but rather develops.
A pleasant diplomatic conversation
Saudi Arabia will withdraw its ambassador from Qatar
I'm not used to speaking diplomatically, otherwise I would have avoided a lot of problems.
I always say what I believe in.
Saudi Arabia, so this is not diplomacy but faith.
The topic of Al Jazeera falls under media.
Between the parties, and many countries have intervened.
The idea that he can take points and gain points at the expense of other countries.
Or at Qatar's expense
Or at the expense of Saudi Arabia
For reconciliation within the Gulf household
I mean compared to what was before.
It is part of a political agreement
No, no, there was no agreement, just an agreement of love and interest.
But other than that, you can ask Al Jazeera management.
Have you established strategic relations between you and Saudi Arabia to prevent what happened before?
It was originally based on a close strategy.
Can I say it one, two, three, and four?
There must be unity.
Some disputes were settled based on this.
Between some Arab countries and an attempt to reconcile other disputes
Because now, if we observe the differences in the Arab world, they are all differences based on different perspectives.
When we have a point of view about a certain policy in a specific procedure in a particular case, and another country has a different opinion
The two points of view are considered
Some observers see that you enjoy criticizing Saudi Arabia.
He criticizes him
Were you exhausted and decided to switch to another direction, and from there you moved to a bigger country, which is Egypt?
The exact same idea
No, no, we don't enjoy this thing or that other thing, we have nothing to do.
To deal with any party in this way
I mean, the reasons for the conflict with Saudi Arabia have ended.
Between them and me, I know there is a very great understanding.
And you know that we established
And there will be a kind of model
But Saudi Arabia
Let me put this under two lines
She began exchanging clashes with the Egyptian Al-Ahram newspaper, issue eighteen, last April.
The Egyptian Official Gazette
In a comprehensive investigation, he said that the extensive investigations
A sabotage plot was uncovered within Hezbollah's network.
The three countries targeting Egypt are Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
And a media figure known for his conspiratorial role
Qatar is the smallest Arab country
Conspiracy against Egypt
We respect
And his struggle over the years
I'm not saying this to emotionally influence anyone.
Let me finish, I haven't finished yet.
We appreciate
The Egyptian president
And who is eager?
About Arab relations
The first point
The Gaza Issue
As they say and as we admit
Qatar is
A country of smaller size
This can be part of such plans
Because we suffered from interventions by other countries at one time, and I don't want to go back to that again.
After the intervention of some countries in Qatari affairs
Therefore, His Highness's government's policy
Now when they discovered what they call a conspiracy
What I'm trying to say is that the head of the household can protect it, Syria and Iran can defend themselves, and I will not defend them.
If the situation stabilizes in Egypt
And why does Qatar want to change or interfere in a matter like this?
And the pyramids don't just appear out of nowhere.
He said that the small state of Qatar sought to undermine Egypt's role and its relations with Turkey and the European Union.
He tried to organize a conference equivalent to the Arab Summit to steal the spotlight.
And you are using a media megaphone, which is Al Jazeera channel.
Yes, go ahead.
With Hezbollah
And we are not comfortable with it.
I can only say that we are sure.
That is for us
The principle is non-intervention in such circumstances.
Our brothers in Egypt forced us, and that's why we blame the Egyptian officials.
The existing conflict with some members of the Egyptian government
But some officials have problems with
With what
I am coming for this.
The days of the sweet scent of peace and the issue of peace, and we
It had previously been held in Egypt.
And then with us
Because Israel
We have a disagreement with him.
You don't have a conflict with Israel.
And now, because of the conference and since that day
Any Islamic conference, an Arab conference, they have sensitivity.
This sensitivity
Why don't you sit with them?
Let me finish
We always hope for the best.
We discovered that this allergy
Two or three
The Gaza conference that took place
Egypt does not want revenge in Qatar.
Not Arabic
In Qatar, and it is at the top in Kuwait, we told them.
The Palestinian people are under attack
For more than two weeks
But we hold it before any organized conference, the Kuwait conference where we were the first to attend.
People are being killed and
And with procrastination
The conflict has begun
Not even a small country can manage.
I know that there are some brothers in the government, and this is also considered a crime against Egypt and not against anyone else.
When they said later
Okay, are you on the island?
The Israelis reported a day earlier that there is a gathering to stop hostilities before any speech, any person, or anything.
What is it?
My brother let the medicine and food in during the time of the beating that our brothers had to endure.
Once they said the gate was narrow.
I can't let the trucks enter.
Sometimes they tell us that there is an agreement on the other side and they have to come.
Now is not the time for us to bring up Fatah or Hamas.
What matters to me is neither Fatah nor Hamas, what matters to me are the one and a half million and six hundred thousand who are being hit.
And those who do not have medicine
When we started talking about this topic and talking about the Gaza conference
Qatar's involvement in the matter affects the Egyptian regime.
What is intervention?
We did not say how Egypt will solve the situation because this is within its jurisdiction.
One official said that we have uncovered a major conspiracy regarding this matter.
He didn't tell us what the plot was afterwards.
We, I mean this officially
He tells us that Egypt is a big subject.
Okay, we understand that Egypt is a large Arab country, and we always say that Egypt is a great country.
That's why we always ask a big country for many things.
Because Egypt is ours
You were also invited to a conference that was a provocation to them.
We were not invited to the conference.
Reconstruction of Gaza
We coordinated and had a unified stance.
People are suffering in Gaza
Forbidden, I know that Turkey brought the things in through Israel.
I would be happy to see him enter through our brothers in Egypt.
They are part of us
If Egypt wins or carries out a good political action
We believe that this is in our interest in Qatar and in the interest of the entire Arab world.
The stability of Egypt is very important to us.
If he does a good job, this is important to us.
Let me finish your question, and your introduction took fifteen minutes.
The situation now is that you have just lost me.
No, I'm telling you, I'm telling you now the anger
You are responsible among the officials in the Egyptian regime.
We are the ones behind the failure of the Qatar summit
The second thing is that they are the ones who failed the Qatar conference.
King Abdullah had a wisdom he wanted.
He wanted to make a reconciliation.
That's why you enter and some countries are not allowed to attend.
And I said these words to our brothers in Saudi Arabia because we
I have no disagreements with Saudi Arabia, not even on this point.
Because, as explained, there are internal problems.
Or a person from the officials
Among senior officials
A large country where an official discovers that a small country is doing things like this.
It means "So there was for you."
Takes on any role
Darfur is part of the national security of Egypt and Sudan.
The five major countries have decided
Any country other than Qatar will be fine.
But these sensitivities will make the situation worse. Why do you have to put your voice in everything close to you?
I want to get rid of this allergy, take an antihistamine, they need to tell us what this allergy is.
Why the sensitivities?
They are some brothers from the government.
They want, they have an internal disorder
They want to draw attention to a conspiracy in Gaza Revolution
As the English say, blame the Italians.
Everything that happened
Not just for instructions but also for analyses
We know what happened because
The issue must be resolved locally.
And it was not resolved
No, my priority is my country.
My priority is to first look at the reasons that matter to my country.
Then I'll see if I have enough time.
To investigate the reasons that concern my Arab nation
Or Qatar tried to reconcile
And thinking about any Arab issue in which he can contribute to the fullest extent possible
Why are you provoking me? Why don’t you take it in good faith?
I can't fix you.
I can clarify my point of view.
Don't throw it at me.
From our point of view
What springs from his heart
Let me finish
When he announced the reconciliation initiative and gathered all the presidents in Kuwait, we were hoping for something good, and I welcome this.
There are dictations.
Of course, the Egyptian official who clarified his achievements
In a report, I think, or a TV interview or something like that, I will not respond to it.
Because I have a response to every point.
But to maintain the minimum level of relations that connect us and connect the Arab interests
And it is also a response to the invitation mentioned by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
But what I can advise him and others is
They are trying to correct their mistakes, whether internally or externally.
In politics, economics, or elsewhere, we have our own mistakes in politics and economics; no one is infallible.
Because they accuse Qatar of all these charges.
Do you deny the existence of a relationship between Qatar and Hezbollah?
This is a funny topic
To undermine Egypt's relations and weaken its role and connections with Turkey and the European Union
The first thing is that we are few in number.
If we can do this role
This is not correct
There are some accusations against you personally.
To pay money for the release of Shalit detainees so that Qatar takes Shalit and bypasses the Egyptian role in this matter.
They always accuse us of paying money. First of all, we didn’t pay any money nor did we talk to anyone about paying money.
Just this case
We support Egypt in solving the same problem as we support Egypt and we are still doing so to resolve the issue between the Palestinians.
He is the one who made the Palestinian president remain patient until the issue is resolved.
We were there and the first to support the State of Qatar
The authority and Palestinian institutions should remain until the conflict is resolved.
And we said that
At the Arab League, but he said no, we let it happen because we believe there are people who do not want this.
We just did it smartly.
Is he addressing his boss?
Prime Minister
I really don't know if there is a problem.
From us, from them, I don't know.
They decided now in the twelfth issue of last April exclusively with Al-Shorouk newspaper
The political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a satellite news channel to counter what is called the Al Jazeera media channel. The end.
It's just a matter of days and everything will be over.
Are you afraid that Al Jazeera will become a thing of the past?
Do you mean that we are currently living in the stage of political adolescence?
He also traveled to Saudi Arabia, and the Emir of Qatar met with the King of Saudi Arabia.
We did not concede to them, nor did they concede to us.
We dealt with them as brothers.
Settlement of a small state versus the large state Egypt
In Saudi Arabia, there is an important point we need to clarify.
The relationship between Qatar and Saudi Arabia is different.
And then we'll talk
Okay, how is the relationship between Qatar and Egypt?
And we rely on him a lot.
Let me be honest with you.
Is it not a dispute in the main policy?
I hope this is not a personal dispute because we have no personal disputes. I told you we respect the Egyptian people.
If I asked you, you said there are two problems: Gaza and what else?
And this situation affected all of us a lot.
We want to solve this problem from the psychological perspective, meaning we want to resolve this dilemma.
Published in some newspapers
Minister of Foreign Affairs
In the presence of Prince Saud Al-Faisal
We talked about everything
It's clear that things have gotten worse and haven't been resolved.
No, no, there was a "listen."
I can't tell you that our relationship with Egypt
They blame us, and that is their right as our brothers.
And we blame them, this is their right as our younger brothers.
With a big country, we don't want to compare ourselves to any big country.
I mean Egypt is large in terms of satisfaction.
The matter is not life or death, but the solution comes from the sky.
So for us, there is someone who awaits satisfaction.
Or waiting for a method
In Qatar
You will deal with others besides the nobles or brothers.
As a great country, yes, we are proud of Egypt as a great nation.
But only if someone deceives someone else
I know that the Israelis are doing this to us.
Also, the previous American policy in the previous administration is either with me or against me.
I don't think they want to imitate either Israel or America on this matter.
Also, if we take their policies, they are also pressured by third parties.
In many cases, let me finish my sentence.
We understand and know that there are some instructions even for large countries.
Who controls your policies?
We have no movement; the only thing that moves us is one thing.
Qatar's internal interest is our internal affair.
And whenever we can help the Arab world, we do.
What are the sources of power: Al Jazeera and Al Udeid Air Base
Can you say this is not strength?
Our faith in God and our trust
Or the vision of His Highness the Prince
We don't want to bother anyone.
Let me finish, I don't want to cause problems for anyone.
And we don't want to compete with anyone.
They can say whatever they want, whether it's "Great Qatar" or not.
We just have a point of view.
The first thing we did was disconnect the Israeli office and shut it down.
The first thing they said was to close the office, so we closed it. Then they got upset and went to complain to the Americans. Can you believe these people?
Join the team they call the Devil's team
What are they saying?
The Americans and Europeans, these are my friends, and we know how to deal with them.
Schemes
What has been done
This is shameful, we reached a certain point and then what?
Tell me now
In points, how do you plan to solve the problem with Egypt?
On the basis that Egypt has a significant role in the Arab world
We believe it is important to consider it.
And I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak was cautious on this matter.
Just some of the crew
I need to go out
Occupying the Egyptian public opinion, the government, or any other leadership, or nonsense
And focuses on Arab and Egyptian interests
Are there any steps?
We are behind them, not ahead of them, because they are a great nation.
In the near future
Honestly, I can't imagine how this is going to turn out.
And I know that there is a time for reason
And the time will come, O you from among us
If only I were
Or from them
Great Arab interests brought them together.
One day we will find this matter.
Do you mean life is still going far?
It means that we will not respond in the same Egyptian style that you have.
If someone helps us, we will lend him an arm.
Now His Highness Sheikh
We never used to run
Unless it is on a good basis, and we are ready to run for Egypt.
Standing with Egypt
There are many rumors about the Egyptian workers in Qatar and how they were affected because of this issue.
There are contracts for Egyptians who work either in universities or in high-ranking positions.
You know that in this matter, it is not our habit to cancel work and cancel.
Because these people have nothing to do with this matter.
This is a market with changing demands; one cancels and another comes in.
This is a matter of supply and demand, and there are other nationalities that have increased while some have decreased.
Present, quick answer
The office was there
We have disturbed the office, so it's better to leave now.
We used to pressure him on the days they had a campaign; all our losses in negotiations with Israel were because of this office.
So we shut it down and let them fix it with Netanyahu.
He was a guest
Among them, and as is our custom, we invite all accredited ambassadors in any foreign country.
It was not an official invitation to honor Gabriella Chalif.
No, we didn't honor her before when the relations were, as they say, good. We used to honor her, now the situation is a bit difficult.
There is no reason now that would make you open the office during this period.
The office will reopen once there are no more reasons.
I made it large.
Who made it as big as Egypt?
Egypt imposed this
Let me be clear with you, our relationship with America is a strategic one.
In some things, and this is it
What is the most important thing?
There are things in our region regarding the resolution of some issues where we had disagreements with the previous administration.
Right now, we have great hopes for the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe there is great hope that this administration
Serious in advancing the peace process and serious in resolving the Palestinian issue
They are our friends, and we do not deny this.
What is happening in Iran and what could be its impact on the Gulf and on you?
Iranians must decide how to resolve their issues.
Among themselves
In their usual ways, and I am sure they will overcome this crisis.
The stability of Iran as mentioned by the Emir of Qatar
Important for our region, the Gulf area, and we share the same borders with Iran
Of course, we have special relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because our country seeks peace and stability in this region
We intervene whenever any party wants to change the Doha Agreement.
And I believe that Saad Hariri said
Now it's finished, and what remains is the strategic talk between the president.
And the Lebanese groups
On How to See
Regarding Yemen, you have no role or they just took a stance.
Listen, it is well known that we support unity when almost the entire Arab world was against the unity of Yemen.
We are the only Arab and Gulf country that stood with the unity of Yemen.
In the south, we spoke with Yemen, and His Highness the Prince sent me twice to meet the President of Yemen.
I explained to him that our goal is the stability of Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
They did not respect this agreement, and I don't want to say what each party did.
But what really affected me
Did Qatar take this position and then get accused of paying money to the Houthis and senior Yemeni officials?
Because we do not interfere in such matters.
Whoever stands with unity does not stand against it.
And another goal for the benefit of Yemen, whether political, economic, or otherwise.
We don't have a problem, but honestly, I was surprised.
Because I went more than ten times during the fighting, His Highness sent me to Yemen among the Yemenis.
Unfortunately, this is a strange accusation.
Time's up, just tell me briefly: these problems that happened to you because of your efforts to solve issues, will you change your policies regarding intervening in other Arabs' problems?
If they called him, he would hear me; I don't see the need.
And it was once in a great show
More than five billion dollars at that time, if we had invested it, it would have been fifty billion dollars, better than the headache.
I just say it with faith because maybe the time in the Arab world now
What is allowed under these circumstances
Thank you very much, Your Highness
He can even be exceptional in the case of Sheikh Hamad.
Why did what happened in the agreement in Doha happen?
How did the Doha miracle happen?
To authorize the committee and grant it all support
To discuss Lebanon after the Israeli invasion
When there was an Arab consensus
And when we went to New York, we were able to make the decision a bit more balanced.
We sought this in Doha because both parties were concerned.
We tried as hard as we could not to hear it, otherwise it wouldn't exist.
Because we knew the committee, we knew
The real land, and we know what the problem is after we sat with the Lebanese for many long hours.
And I believe it is a shared success.
But there was determination
I believe Lebanon's problem is that the atmosphere of the region is directly reflected on it.
Whether peaceful or non-peaceful
Lebanon was supposed to have this site.
Under these conditions
And unfortunately
External repercussions
I can say that the problem among the Lebanese, even if there is a problem, will not be the number one problem.
Sheikh's condition, I know maybe the time is not right now, maybe it's a bit early to talk about the scenes, but...
What happened, I came here?
Participation on the ground has somewhat stopped now.
I didn't delay even for a single second.
I know exactly what happened, even the Lebanese leaders were telling me what happened.
Not from the beginning
When I spoke to His Highness
I told him, "If we go to Lebanon"
I will present the idea; His Highness agreed and supported it.
Where are all the Lebanese leaders supposed to be present?
Because here in Beirut, you have to go to each of their special areas.
They are in the same hotel and the same place.
They met each other on the same plane and talked.
So we created this atmosphere, but from the beginning, it was our idea.
And this was the most important decision they both made.
Of course
And I felt this from the Arab League.
Then we must be honest intermediaries.
And praise be to God, I believe this matter has been proven to everyone that Qatar has exerted its effort.
On both sides
To reach an honorable solution for both parties
And there will be a solution, and no one will lose.
Before you take any step
Consultation was held at the Arab League, and we received support.
What we did
And I told him while we were there
If we succeed in Lebanon, we will bring them to Doha.
And he advised me
They lock them up and take their phones.
We were able to bring them there, and the brothers in Syria also supported the situation.
And I told you from the beginning that without the support of the Arabs, the committee cannot do anything.
Why did they want the solution?
I think the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that happened
And this tension
There is tension in Somalia, there is tension in Sudan.
There are many things happening in the world.
And every time we put out a fire
It will be in the best interest of the Arab world rather than external intervention.
We try our best
Send forces
Even if he is a soldier
For example, I think this is a topic.
There is a point we need to discuss.
He always said that the solution to the Lebanese file
Saudi-Syrian Agreement
To the Arab stand, I mean Qatar and the Arab League
Could what happened in Lebanon lead to serious reform between Saudi Arabia and Syria?
I need a self-review in the Arab world
Due to the Arabic differences
And any agreement between two Arab countries
And we tried this.
In the war of seventy-three
When the Arabs agree on a solution to a problem
I think it's interest.
Saudi Arabia and Syria have an important role in Lebanon.
Both parties must
The invasion of wisdom
Arab Relations on the Right Track
Because here in the Arab world, we face many major challenges.
Everyone is playing in our yard.
And we have neither strength nor power.
And how can we stop the game in the Arab countries' arena?
As Arabs, at least the minimum of the agreement
Unfortunately, we complain
And we see
Our disagreement as Arabs and the lack of trust among us, trust is missing between the Arab countries.
And the Arab countries
It's not betrayal as much as it is a kind of
What does the word jealousy mean?
This is a situation that needs support from everyone, I mean I believe
Okay, will you fulfill this wish and actually request an Arab summit?
We suffer when he suffers and rejoice when he rejoices.
It came in the middle of the speech.
Is it possible to take a role in repairing the situation between Damascus and Riyadh even if
Eager to find solutions, and I am confident in their wisdom.
They might reach an understanding.
Between them in many cases
He was in harmony in politics, and I am sure that, God willing, this is...
Relations have improved
Both parties need to take a step.
I just can't be sure that this is what's happening right now.
I am sure that if the Arabs focused on resolving the disputes between Arab countries and the problems of some Arab countries that I mentioned earlier
Optimism and a sense of pride for the citizen that there is a general Arab call to wake up
I just can't say what happened in Lebanon.
It can be explained on the ground by the presence of an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
There may be an American-Iranian escalation, and there may be other cases afterward.
Will you remain afraid of him in the coming months?
We as Arabs
We can only deliver food and medicine.
And electricity for the people
We in Qatar are ready, and His Highness is always [ready].
There are more than one and a half million Palestinians under siege.
And we do not want them to have either weapons or support.
They are sitting and doing all this.
And it has no electricity.
And we give it to the Red Cross organization to deliver it to the Palestinians.
With the Palestinians, we just deliver food and medicine to them.
And our dispute with them may continue.
I hope that Palestinians on both sides put the national interest above everything else.
And leave illusions behind you
The Palestinian division is now a great wound.
To find a solution
But they did not commit
This is a serious matter; they must adhere to the Mecca Agreement.
They must even request to go back to Mecca and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
And this dispute was resolved
They will not benefit.
And any promises from any party
I just hope there is a solution.
Our position is known and communicated to all concerned parties that we
We will not be part of it, and we will not accept being part of any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with her.
But we are a sovereign state, and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone looks out for their own interests, but these interests neither harm them nor harm us.
We believe that the fate of the Gulf must be in a clear agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council.
Iranian Cooperation and Peaceful Neighborhood
But when they called you, they said that Qatar is not a party.
Any details or clarifications
Just a mark
Never
Okay, I want to go back to the Lebanese file if you don't mind.
Honestly, Your Highness, we are facing a major obstacle, but we reached a solution in the last few hours.
There are those who linked what happened to what was announced.
It might be scattered information that is unrelated, but that's what happened.
What made you come to this conclusion?
What happened in Istanbul, do you know if it has specific dates before?
It means you knew that there were negotiations.
Continuously to find a solution
And without a doubt, the support of the Kingdom is very important.
And changing negotiation tactics
These negotiations led to
For a positive outcome; we gathered some parties from various entities.
And we started talking
In this research, there is an Arab and Qatari approach.
Tell me what is wrong with this paper.
And we started talking about the material little by little.
At the last moment to overcome an obstacle that lasted until the end
But the prince met with the parties.
And get rid of this obstacle.
And there was a solution in it.
We heard a speech from the Emir of Qatar at the opening session in Doha.
You don't consider your role right now.
Listen, the most important thing is that we stay away from the spotlight.
I have no regional ambitions.
Or even to have control over a second country or something because our country
Our size... we take pride in ourselves and believe that we can contribute to solving problems with our other colleagues.
But in the Arab world, this is very important.
So that we have countries to be
We want them to do something, and this is important.
Delegating some small countries to take on this role and supporting them
In some things excellent, in other things good, and in some things less than good.
One last question, Your Highness
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority?
Security or reconciliation of enmity
Or confronting Israel
We stop playing in the Arab court
We fix the problems in the Arab countries.
To select an active member in Iraq
To calm things down
At the national and regional levels
But only if we become stubborn
Or will he have any hope?
Thanks to His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani for this meeting
And the international efforts to end what is happening in the war on Gaza
We begin with your request to hold a meeting with the Arab League Council at the ministerial level.
As if you have changed your mind about
Request to hold an emergency Arab summit
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. First of all, I am happy, my brother Hassan, to be in this program.
Despite the humanitarian circumstances
Facing our brothers in Gaza
Conditions that require us to do a lot
Qatar did not ignore the Arab summit
In fact, when we went with the idea of the Arab summit before
Not only a Security Council resolution but also through
What is not to be stepped on or devalued
Let me put it in another sentence.
And we are polite
The street can no longer bear it, if we bear it as those responsible for the Arab street.
He can't stand it.
When we were in Egypt
There was written approval from ten to eleven.
Some of them spoke at the meeting, and it was possible to hold a meeting.
We adhere to it as long as there is Arab consensus.
And I don't blame them if in a meeting they might have a point of view.
And how can the problem be solved?
Because it will be solved
This is the important issue.
Because our goal is not advertising and promotion, our goal is to find
So you didn't ignore the summit?
So that we ask ourselves
We will go press on the other weak side.
The previous and the subsequent and the Security Council resolution, but let's just focus on the topic of the Arab summit, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
Speak clearly, the situation may require an Arab summit with anyone who attends.
We found that most of our brothers support holding the summit.
With those who attend
And I don't know what they mean by moderation.
We are the only nation
Only the Arab nation, if we go to any nation in Asia or Latin America
Without solution
Those classified as moderate countries
What does moderation mean in our eyes?
Will he abandon the Palestinian cause?
Just because we don't like them
Do we intervene in Palestinian affairs in some way?
There is no country that allows interference, neither by the good nor the evil.
Like Hezbollah, and who knows, maybe another movement will emerge tomorrow.
Is he asking?
And can we accept them as part of the Arab body?
As if it was intended to make us enter into an internal Arab conflict.
Okay, if we go to the Security Council
There is no decision in the Security Council.
I hope that after Israel completes its mission
Okay, the second Arab ministerial meeting that you were invited to attend
What was dominated by intense discussions, disagreements, and fights
There is an important point.
This is not the thing that matters.
When we call for a meeting
About terminals
There is no peace anymore.
Are the ministers ready for that?
Because on one hand, they tell you that we must wait
But we are in an Arab initiative
And froze peace negotiations with Israel
We say that we are at a party that says we are going to lose in this.
There is a bigger loss than the one we lost now, but we have always been respectful, polite, and committed to the decisions since the days of the truce.
You say that fights are not important
There were people who wished Hamas would be destroyed and things like that.
This expresses a political stance more than it expresses a disagreement between one minister and another.
Unfortunately, this happened.
But not everyone
I don't want to speak on behalf of others.
It is important to be men for ourselves and men for our country.
We are working on the policies of our countries
Who does these things on his behalf?
I think
I don't think they will respect us in the end.
Yes, is there anyone doing things on behalf of the West?
No, and I hope I don't accuse anyone; I don't want to accuse anyone in this matter.
After the Security Council decision
What will his agenda be?
The situation began with the decision of the Arab efforts.
The disagreement here is whether Israel implemented the resolution immediately.
We can say there is a decision.
But Israel did not implement the decision.
Are we ready now to go and file for Chapter 7? I'm sure there are difficulties.
What is being questioned by the international community, and if that happens
He will be a little shy.
The situation
Look, they did something for the Jews and Israelis.
They take their rights
This is the current Arab situation
If the Arabs do not go to the Security Council
He agreed to hold a summit and make tough decisions.
And the Western countries will try for us.
Because we are deep in the Arab world and there are many people, you can see how the Arab street reacts to this.
But this decision is important
On the subject of calling our leaders one by one
In the end, they said there was nothing and that it was a lie.
Okay, so are we like Germany now or are we not demanding?
They don't have to pay any compensation because they were the ones who launched the attack, just say that you have incorrect information.
And hundreds of thousands were killed
This is because you are a weak Arab party.
We went as Arabs, united.
Work hard in how
To present it
As if it were destiny and an act from God
If the Arab nation says, "If you send forces to Darfur, we will send forces to Darfur."
The Arabs considered, or there are those who considered, decision one thousand eight hundred and sixty.
Our colleagues worked hard to come up with the decision.
What was issued by the Security Council
I don't want to say it was a victory or that it wasn't.
What will lead to
Let's assume that victory
What are we going to do?
We are not supposed to gather with the rest of the group.
I just want to assure you that we will adhere to the decision.
Unfortunately, you will have to stick to the decision even though you’re not supposed to.
Even after the Israelis refused, Israel came and agreed.
It means we
Do you have an alternative, or is it better for you to be the ones calling for a ministerial meeting?
I don't think the Arab nation
In the meantime, ready for any alternatives.
And I don't think the Arab nation is ready.
In the implementation of the Gaza blockade
For various political reasons
To make one group dominate another in Palestine instead of reconciling between them
We start trying to make plans
Once they held a meeting, I don't know if it was Arab or European intelligence or something like that, without mentioning names.
And when they did that, I mean, we participate.
In implementation
What is required of us from the West?
But if we go
I want there to be order in this.
Of course, I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about
The follow-ups, because the Gaza problem started two years ago, not now.
I will talk about the topic from two years ago, but specifically regarding the decision.
Do you have reservations about its conditions?
What has been issued but not executed
We did not receive our invitation.
They might think that our point of view is different.
It was required that everyone have the same point of view.
Not everyone necessarily has to share the same point of view, but I believe those who went made an effort.
And we thank them for that.
Regarding what happened in Gaza two years ago, I mentioned the parties.
Preference of one group over another involved in the Gaza siege
Are you really agreeing with the statements, hints, or accusations that have come from here and there?
About a real Arab conspiracy with everything that is happening now in Gaza
We are partially aware
About the problem, let me tell you that we are not fully informed.
But I know
The Palestinian conflict
It has been fed at the Arab and international levels.
And if it weren't burning, they wouldn't differ much.
And it was after the elections
Hamas came and took power.
By majority
I had to give them a chance and see.
They want reform, or are they still revolutionaries who only know weapons and fighting so far?
Only the ones who came in today
At the Arab level, some of our brothers believed that these extremist movements should not come to power.
Some of them say that now it has become an attack.
Was it Hamas that broke the truce, or the Palestinians from Gaza who broke the truce?
The truce
The Palestinian people in Gaza continue to suffer from hunger for two years.
No problem
For reasons related to Israeli security
It's clear that we don't want them in power, but that's not what concerns me in Qatar.
But what fault do the rest of the people have?
And then, is he supposed to decide?
This or that, not every country with sovereignty gets to choose.
Our government
This is the main problem
I'm just sure it could have been solved.
If we had worked hard, we worked hard to fuel the conflict.
But it is clear that we were asked to allow one group to dominate over the other because this group
We consider them terrorists or we consider it.
All that happened led to
Even the promises they made to the party that they would provide them with a decent life
They didn't do anything for them.
We return to the international and Arab efforts exerted to put an end to what is happening, as I said before.
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has rejected until now.
And there is the Egyptian initiative, unity
And Egypt in Cairo
Those Egyptian efforts
Not at all, this is not cheating.
This is required for an important role
Also, the borders of Egypt next to Israel and Palestine
We are
And there is no prophet to stop the chaos now.
In Gaza, we bring people together to stop the chaos in Gaza because
This is not the path of peace
It must be
That is why we always ask them to play a major role.
What was announced?
Does this mean that you cannot evaluate the initiative now?
Or to provide the possibility of success or study
I believe in its chances of success
So the brothers in Egypt can.
Let Palestinian perspectives be more similar.
And the one who must discuss the initiative is the affected party in Gaza.
Because he is the one who can say yes or no
This is an important point.
When Decision No. 1860 was issued
This is an Arab Palestinian problem we have.
We don't want to hear any side.
I just really wanted this, when the Palestinian delegation left.
And when they went to the league, they requested that one person from Gaza be with them.
Let's show the Israelis that these are our brothers and we are with them.
This is an important point.
We do not allow the authority
That our goal is not to build our policy
Remains in power
The Sheikh now
I don't know if we can discuss the Egyptian initiative because you haven't reviewed its materials yet.
Do you think in principle that this could be suitable as a mechanism for implementing International Resolution No. 1860, as some people have announced?
Balanced role
Not now, not tomorrow, nor the day after tomorrow because
Every day that passes
There will be bloodshed for our brothers there.
That's why we don't want to delay, nor do the Israelis delay on this matter. When they finish their task, we will present this initiative.
And I am sure that the brothers in Egypt know this and are aware of it.
I want to clarify everything I said.
We now have to solve the problem.
And not in the way that Israel wants it to be.
The Turkish role has attracted attention since the beginning of the crisis.
Does it express
Arab vacuum
And undoubtedly, it is a distinguished position.
And he has an Arab depth
It is an entrance for Arab people with disabilities.
We know that there is an Arab disability.
Part of it was due to disagreements
Part of it is due to perspective; everyone believes that their point of view is completely correct.
And another person believes that his point of view is better.
And what conscience is there, how can you make people respect and know that there is an Arab decision?
And not even one of them comes to us one by one.
There is another person who says no, no problem, we just give them two or three extra days to contact them and bring the guys to be equal and solve the problem.
We must rise above this and not accept it.
Hamas may have mistakes, but we are dealing with them.
At the Arab level
Just yet
At least we say no to them
Within the framework of the position required from Qatar, positions like, we will return to this point later though.
Also, in the field at the same time, I heard
Yesterday, Khaled Mashal, head of the political bureau of Hamas movement
First, what brother Khaled Mashal said is unnecessary, with all due respect and appreciation for him.
Why don't we sit with Khaled Mashal and talk to him as Arabs?
We go to him at the Arab League and tell him.
This is an important word
From Hamas
Israel imposes conditions, it also imposes conditions.
Let them impose conditions, are they not allowed to impose conditions while Israel can?
First, what do you think of this Arab gift?
They are walking, and we shouldn't listen to these people. Sometimes they say De Gaulle didn't listen.
It is completely different; the first thing De Gaulle did was liberate his country.
With or without allies, he liberated his country from fiery occupation.
So, what are we talking about now?
Is this the Arab gift that we are supposed to give?
Leaders must represent the views of their people.
The Arab people in all those demonstrations we have seen
Those that can be verified from these requested rows
Likewise, many of those who criticize Qatar in this situation are demanding
About what’s happening, the actor and the office are still open.
They don't speak the same logic.
To cut ties, we will go along with all the Arab countries.
Cut off the relationship, all ties, even if someone says they have a treaty with him.
They just want Qatar to sacrifice itself.
We are
This is more important than the relationship.
Not only in this decision, in this decision and there are even harder decisions.
Who is this decision from?
It means we must have a unified Arab stance.
For others
That no one sells to another for the purpose of achieving moral or material gains or is called as such.
Yes, before we close this file on this matter, there are other countries that have taken individual steps.
Chávez Al-Zain is a different matter; he has disagreements with the United States.
Our people don't need us to recover.
Five ambassadors with their permanent membership presented arguments that these are films.
We finished the matter, and the street knows more now.
With a high ceiling, Your Highness Sheikh
Or demand that the Lebanese forces confront the Israeli aggression, and so on.
Do you think if it is placed within a single Arab framework, it could succeed?
But we call for an Arab stance that makes people respect us.
I don't think the Arab countries are ready for fighting.
And we do not encourage
How are Syria, Lebanon, and the other countries going to unite, when there are Arab countries that don't even talk to each other?
It must be there
Change in Arab relations
This is the current policy among the Arab countries.
It's still there, but I think it has actually ended.
In the goals
The important issue
And we know what the Lebanese structure is like.
There is no doubt that Lebanon
He gave an example if he returned his lands.
The situation in Gaza is going to change, they are still...
Surrounded from all sides
This siege
Give a different nature
Yes, I mean here the targets for Israel, meaning the operational targets for Israel.
A day someone is punished, a day someone is disciplined, and a day someone is pleased.
An example is what happened in Lebanon; for them, it is not a good example.
The solution sample that happened in Lebanon
I consider it good.
To Gaza
Listen, the problem in Gaza or Palestine is easier to solve than the problem in Lebanon.
Those who disagree with each other, should we return to our land today or tomorrow?
Their disagreements over power
In the distribution of power
This is different because they are closer to each other intellectually.
More than the Lebanese intellectual
That's why the solution is much easier.
And here is the problem
His Highness Sheikh
It means we only have a few minutes if we finish the topic as soon as possible.
And a diplomat
How could this process end?
From the Palestinians in Gaza
Let me tell you
Or reject
And assistance
This is what worked for us.
It will be an Arab failure.
In terms of strategy
Only on the Palestinian side
There were some efforts, but we did not see a complete initiative.
Not before, not now, why?
The problem is not with the initiative as much as how we feel.
Whoever solves the problem, we help them without mentioning the name of Qatar because some people have issues with mentioning the name of Qatar.
And not to bring a summit because there is a summit happening in March.
If we take the initiative, we will be better than our brothers; I don't think so.
And do not pressure them.
Because history does not forgive us if we pressure them.
We are going through this initiative, we saw all the parties and where there was a meeting on the fourth day, it was postponed due to the Security Council.
We hope, God willing, to make progress and wish that our Arab brothers help us as much as they can in this matter.
And we hope to keep him out of the competition.
The Arab Competition
In its heating due to their dispute with the Sudanese government at one time
These are our problems, okay, we struggle among ourselves and disagree.
I don't want to deal with this matter.
In Kuwait in the upcoming nineteenth month, I think, of course, the Arab situation
As you know and as you mentioned and explained, Your Highness
Do all the Arab atmospheres help? Is it the first economic summit?
His Highness
And of course, any summit held in a brotherly country, we attend it.
We have no objection to attending any summit.
But he is not afraid of becoming a political summit.
Of course, taking into account that time imposes itself.
The time is late even if it is after ten days.
Are you talking about the Palestinians after they have been beaten for twenty-five days?
It will be
Don't they say that Arabs can't get along?
We said that.
We said that.
With all due respect, this summit was scheduled and we are committed to it.
I mean, I think we
The Arab street is against us
In the way we take it
Therefore
And he entered safely.
And say this is it, guaranteed.
For this meeting
Thank you to the audience for watching
Coverage of the ongoing war on Gaza continues, goodbye
A few days ago, there was a celebration for the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Hissa bint Khalifa Al Thani
In Doha and contributed to the preparation of a draft law related to
She was also a member of several local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
He has also delivered more than seventy-five lectures, working papers, presentations, and articles published in Arab and international journals.
First of all, let's agree on the term currently used.
When we talk about people with disabilities, do we say "people with special needs" or, as I said, "people with disabilities"?
Good early evening
Taken from a human rights perspective or a human rights culture because persons with disabilities
Because he treated people with disabilities as people first
Human
And then he developed a disability because of his attempt to adapt to society.
The medical concept was the prevailing one at that time.
Move towards the concept
Pedagogy and private education have emerged
This group has become
That's why we started calling them people with special needs.
What are the basic rules it was built upon?
The role of the Special Rapporteur in monitoring the implementation of this document
And the pace quickened until the emergence of the international convention, which was legally binding and characterized by rules in this regard.
And I set a fundamental condition or basic rule for this term
Those who deal with these people are human and they are people.
With the change in conditions as mentioned, is there a change in the perspective of this segment of society?
Yes, and it is measured in a specific way.
This varies from region to region.
But the special thing about this
The Arab world was distinguished or different
However, legal trends include human rights and are present, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons are probably a lack of financial resources, right?
Of course, this is what I wanted to say: that culture exists, but sometimes there is a lack of resources and a lack of political will.
Sometimes legislation but
But unfortunately, awareness is somewhat low and also the culture of human rights is not present.
Ten percent of the world's population are people with disabilities.
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities are from developed countries in the working age.
And they suffer from unemployment
I mean during my visit to Darfur
Or with the presence of mines and weapons
Men are better by one degree
Add disabilities, they will be in remote and distant areas
Therefore, there are many regulatory bodies working in this field and trying to improve.
Awareness and Realization of the Right to Education
Instead of establishing many religious centers, I mean in general
They went on to establish rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
And this is one of the things that, thank God, through our work in the office
I tried with the current organization in Qatar
To set an agenda
Or include the agendas of these humanitarian organizations to encompass those centers
In light of the deteriorating situation of persons with disabilities worldwide
I can't say that, and I agree with you that there is a decline.
If there is a decline in the Arab region due to cases of disability
Within the social, political, and economic context, we cannot predict the conditions of people with disabilities.
While they are from marginalized groups
In a country like, as I told you, like Gaza and Darfur
On the contrary, I can't say definitively that there is no improvement in the situation.
It has actually been implemented on the ground, and if I may give an example, I would say
Qatar Red Crescent
We agreed that the projects include
People with disabilities who suffer from health problems within this strategy, and there are other programs.
What we tried to ensure later
Within the work of ground-based organizations
Kamal Kirro is with us now from Syria, welcome.
Good evening, I am Suleiman Kiro
Suleiman Kiro, excuse me, please go ahead Suleiman
Best regards to you and Mrs. Hafsa
First, is there an intellectual barrier within the United Nations laws?
Intellectual blockage means that a healthy person became, as a result, a pressure factor that led to intellectual blockage.
She caused my son to become disabled as a result of torture and imprisonment; he suffered a mental disability and is still undergoing treatment, and it has been six years now.
I know that there are about four hundred people, including children and disabled individuals, in prison.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
In fact, I am
Because they know as they know their own children
And the whole meaning without them pretending
And it is valued in the West.
Agreed upon, but the people
Some of them are apostates or do not follow the wisdom of Islam; wisdom is not taken from them.
Thank you very much, Naif Saeed from Kuwait
Let's return to our guest for commentary on
In the calls, Suleiman was wondering if there was any intellectual disability.
Yes, it is among the global rankings.
Regarding disabilities, of course, intellectual and mental disabilities, as they are called.
Among these disabilities are sensory disabilities such as visual or hearing impairments and mobility disabilities.
Of course, as I mentioned, the disability is
Action and reaction that occur within a social context
In the Arab world or any other provinces
Certainly, dealing with the disability took a long time.
And even at the level of the United Nations
For example, during my experience and work as a special rapporteur, one of the things I tried to deal with and work on
In other words, the right is for everyone.
Until they provide for them
And various rehabilitation aspects to ensure their ability to enter schools as well as the labor organization
Working on vocational rehabilitation, which includes persons with disabilities
There were some improvements.
Especially after the reform
In general, this international committee exists
Me too, I mean as a special course.
The reality of my work, and this was positive for me even if it was not directly related.
Who supported this position?
I saw it in many meetings, such as the international conference.
For the rights of persons with disabilities
Concealed by these restrictions or by these deficiencies
For example, regarding legal capacity
This is one of the main points in the world of disability.
Unfortunately, the United Nations delayed it slightly during the preparation and drafting.
Regarding organizations and agencies
For example, and I will end with this.
From the governments of the world and the non-governmental organizations members in the United States
We processed a second questionnaire.
In United Nations organizations and agencies in various regions
To find out to what extent there are programs for people with disabilities on their agendas
If budgets are determined if there is participation of people with disabilities
Human Rights
And it is not limited only to development issues.
We are receiving more calls, with us now is Mishri Naji from Algeria, welcome Naji.
You must continue
I wanted to ask my sister exactly who should be held responsible.
I wanted to ask, I am originally physically disabled.
Okay, we will direct this question to her. Naji Mishri from Algeria, thank you very much Ahmed.
Halabi is from Greece, welcome.
Good evening, madam. Good evening to your guests.
Healthcare, housing, seasonal clothing, and even hosting them in seasonal tourism, and this is what happens in Europe.
Is a psychiatric patient considered disabled?
Especially those who can harm themselves or others
All we talk about in the field of unproductive discussion, and thank you.
Sister Hessa mentioned the financial shortage.
In poor countries, especially in Africa, Latin America, and the Arab world
Establishing an international fund to support people with disabilities and allocating one percent of the net profits of every organization in the world.
This must be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
It will address the deficit of many people with disabilities and war victims, and so on.
Thank you very much, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia
Naji Mishri was wondering and mentioned his problem that he is disabled.
At the local or national level means through Algeria
Needs within the community must be met within that community.
Are these the same rights that should be granted to anyone else?
In other words, the right to live first, then the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education.
Therefore, I truly call from here, from this platform, on governments, and Arab governments in particular.
For the benefit of the citizen and the individual
Guarantees
Those needs and rights within the current agendas
No, there is no need to create any new devices.
To meet the needs of the person with a disability or what is needed for this matter if the state
They are appreciated and must be committed to performance indeed.
I advise him first to refer to and approach the relevant authorities at the government level, if possible.
Because it is within a national scope and must be within this scope
You mentioned the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but there are many countries that have signed it yet do not comply with it.
And here we pose a question from one of the callers: Why are there no laws?
We are certainly in a human society, and this means the presence of many mistakes and many correct things.
Certainly, many agreements and definitely many treaties do not have literal binding commitments.
Or an ideal commitment from several countries that have joined several conventions such as CEDAW and others
But there are breaches and violations, and we know that.
But the issue of adopting and regulating the agreement
First, we will ensure that there is at least some awareness.
This awareness starts from the top of this pyramid with the decision-makers.
Officials, and then it gradually develops until it reaches society as a whole.
Also, the issue of our commitment to preparing reports and submitting these reports to the United Nations.
The issue of knowledge, understanding, and a high degree of awareness
In the reports in which I worked as a rapporteur at the United Nations, it was
Yes, from what I saw and noticed, there is interest.
It has a relative advantage in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
I advise, encourage, and call upon
It is also important for people with disabilities to be
And we will hear what Ali Obeid Al-Senari, President of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute, has to say to us.
Mr. Naji Sagrana will talk about the topic. Welcome, Mr. Naji and Mr. Ali as well.
Peace be upon you
And peace be upon you too.
With me is Mr. Ali Obeid Al-Sanara, Chairman of the Board of Directors at the Qatari Cultural and Social Center for the Deaf.
Which is chaired by Her Excellency Sheikha Hessa
Former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
As a deaf person from Qatar
And the chairwoman of the committee, in fact, Sheikha Hessa, had a long history.
And the international agreement that you are talking about now is actually
A great benefit for all people with special needs around the world
Especially the Arab world
I wish I were a deaf person.
These countries apply this international agreement.
This will serve people with special needs, it is necessary that
You actually need to have someone who can activate this agreement in all countries.
Obaid Al-Sanari, President of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute
Stop
Here, and we will continue our discussion after a short break, stay with us.
Send and share your opinions on important economic, political, sports issues, and a variety of other matters.
Text messaging service through Al Jazeera Live
Dear viewers, we welcome you once again and our guest in today's episode, Sheikha Hessa Khalifa Al Thani.
Disabling an International Support Fund
Disability and the obligation of all countries to provide funding, what is your opinion on this proposal?
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Fund.
Unfortunately, these contributions are very weak.
Task of Monitoring the Application of Regulatory Rules
When I worked for six years, there was no significant support.
Only from China and Austria
And always means I thank this country for its support.
The main supporter of the country is my country, Qatar.
The one who established the office, through whom we were able to carry out many activities and projects, praise be to God.
Yes, what does this lack of support indicate?
I mean, like we discussed at the beginning, this point is always raised.
The circumstances of ordinary people
So how is the care of people with disabilities or the care of the disabled called?
It means if there is a real, genuine, and serious commitment.
In all circumstances, in all categories
Persons with disabilities, refugee and displaced children and women
All of these can reach a level they call
Equal opportunities, participation, and equality
And there are these voices that always ask and never get tired or bored.
In the Islamic and Arab region, why don't we allocate a part, sorry
For the benefit of these programs and projects
As he presented, and I truly thank him from this platform.
Islamic Development Bank
Within the allocated budget
Failure to comply with what you told me regarding the payment of financial dues
Does the money to help people with disabilities include only developing countries and Arab countries or not?
Even advanced countries do not provide.
I mean, the person who was before me, who is Swedish, yes.
And also some European Union countries
And of course, in many countries, especially in the Arab region, it may not...
So far, they know about the existence of this special course.
In my case, I mean what happened.
In Sweden and China
And the Arab region, unfortunately, there were many promises, but unfortunately there was only one country.
We will only talk about the Arab region.
We have more calls with us, Hamad Al Marri from Qatar. Hamad, welcome.
Peace be upon you
And also upon you
Hello Dr. Sheikha Hessa
Almost ten
We noticed that this girl has a psychological disability.
What is your role for the girl who is suffering like her?
With her colleagues
I mean, sometimes even when we continue
What is your role with the daughters of the Qatari girls?
Thank you very much Hamad Al Marri from Qatar, Karwan Bahjat from Kuwait, welcome
As they say, Sheikha Hessa
Why don't we leave our oil in its crude form?
Those who have special needs, we can assist them.
And we can help them.
We have massive financial components.
We can break the psychological barrier between us and them.
By boosting individual morale
And spend it on this noble goal
This is if we are truly believers.
Thanks and appreciation to Sheikha Hessa for all her efforts and everything she has done during her tenure as Special Rapporteur.
With our thanks and appreciation to her, and our thanks to the State of Qatar for all that it has provided to people with special needs.
Thank you very much Aisha Mohammed from Qatar
Peace be upon you, Professor Wasila
Peace be upon you too
And to your honorable guest
Her Highness Sheikha Hessa
My question is about prevention.
As they say, prevention is better than cure.
There is a second level of disability, regardless of wars and traffic accidents.
The genetic level may result from families that practice consanguineous marriage.
I think it's a large percentage.
This leads to disability
Thank you very much, Brigadier General Sharif from Tunisia, now I return to our guest.
The first caller was Hamad Al Marri, and he was wondering
Where does a girl with a psychological disability go?
And to whom should he go?
In every country
There are definitely services that provide for all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether they are mental disabilities as we mentioned or any psychological disabilities
For schools
It was previously
Or not, I mean private education in the Ministry of Education, which is now the Supreme Council.
Brigadier General Sharif from Tunisia pointed out something very important
Scientific papers, and so on
From the programs of organizations that work only on disability, but even within the campaigns
Programs for Women
All of these have attracted many campaigns and programs to reproductive health.
I talked about this aspect.
Adopts healthy strategies
Based on awareness
To show the risks of marrying relatives
Genetic factors
I believe it was implemented in the State of Qatar.
Customs and traditions, but it definitely takes time.
Especially in tribal societies
But over time there will be a response to it, but there must be a legal commitment, meaning no...
Yes, Karwan Bahjat inquired and suggested allocating one percent of the budget of Arab countries.
To help those with disabilities, let me first
Yes, there is a statistical estimate conducted by the World Health Organization for the world as a whole.
There are forty or close to forty million disabled people.
Their text is women
But these numbers keep doubling.
Like a study in South Africa where they observed and proved
Certainly, the statistics that emerged from the war in Iraq and from the war in Gaza
For every person killed, three are disabled.
Since the Arab region became an undeniable area of conflicts
Even the suggestion that Karwan Bahjat made
One percent is not enough.
To assist people with disabilities in the Arab region
The issue of the percentage of persons with disabilities or other marginalized groups
Honestly and sincerely, I don't think it suits with
This requires addressing their problems and needs.
Make sure that people with disabilities are the most neglected.
What governments usually do does not take people with disabilities into account.
True, and this is sometimes related to the culture of society and its restrictions.
When the census is conducted by
Concerned parties
There is a disabled person in the house.
There was only one question asked: Is there a disabled person or not?
The section related to this topic and through the concerned individuals there
We collaborated in preparing the model
We recommend obtaining more details.
First, specify the gender of the disabled person, whether male or female.
Did he receive any assistance or not?
In fact, even if the numbers are correct, we have not reached an accurate result.
Attention and care must also be continuous. Fatima Al-Dosari is with us from Qatar, welcome Fatima.
And peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a disabled child.
I thank His Highness the Ruler of our country, Sheikh Hamad
And his wife, Sheikha Moza, for supporting this group
I am truly proud to receive all this attention and care.
For its important role
Latifa Al-Musaifri, hello
Because they represent major disturbances in society without education, without treatment
Thank you very much, Latifa Al-Musaifri from Qatar. Nassim is with us now.
Abdul Karim from Jordan, hello Naseem
Come on, Kareem, we're listening to you.
And peace be upon you too.
God bless you, honestly I have an intervention.
First of all, I am a voice specialist and I worked in the State of Qatar for about four years.
We had a month dedicated to raising awareness about speech and hearing problems.
We used to hold conferences, lectures, and awareness sessions about hearing loss.
Now I want to talk about Jordan, I have lived there for almost three years now.
Honestly, it offers new and good services.
Honestly, it offers new services whether they are material, immaterial, or moral.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education, resources
Ministry of Education in public schools
And also our private institutes
They receive good support
Okay Kareem, do you have a direct question? The matter is just due to lack of time, I apologize.
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, the UAE, and Jordan, the services are excellent and I think they are very great.
Can you comment on the viewers' questions?
A person working in this field
Regarding the subject
I will review the agreement issue later.
Whoever is required, as soon as they obtain the certifications and join him.
As a duty of the state or of these organizations
Because it is based on the issue of rights for these people, regardless of
And honestly, what?
What we do during this period for people with disabilities and why
And now she wishes it would happen
Of course, I wish either way
I hope this will be a measure in this research or this survey and will provide higher quality research in this field.
And it also became clear to me from this experience
Six years of experience
And coordination between Arab countries as well
They also have a role, it's not just about rights, they also receive rights.
Sheikha Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Disability, thank you.
Now with us is the presenter from the league and Al Kass channel, Lana on the line, good morning Lana
I am also happy to welcome the active captain in Umm Salal, Captain Ali Qasim.
Hello Ali!
Hello %pw
Good morning
I want to open the floor for congratulations, everyone can honestly offer their blessings, Lana, please.
I had an open studio for five hours and a studio for two hours the day before.
Qatar, the land, the government, and the citizens have been congratulated, as they deserve this international achievement.
I might have the opportunity to congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
And his crown prince, Sheikh Tamim
Yes, of course Lana, you are from the sports field and one of the experts in this area, and you have extensive knowledge in this field and in these lines.
Because even our file
And competitive, meaning we deserve a six-vote difference between us and America, fourteen votes for Qatar, and eight for America.
This is because our file is rich, comprehensive, and supported by many ambassadors, very well supported, for example, the stadiums
Maybe some people were scared, maybe there was a bit of %pw, like America.
And there may be some countries that are ready, they do not need to provide fields, and they prepare some projects specifically for this event.
Because they are already ready
But they were worried about this point.
Captain Ali, you players, I believe this is a very important achievement for athletes.
It will affect the economic, political, and health sectors, I assume.
Okay, you as players
What does this achievement mean to you?
Of course, this is a great achievement, especially for us. I even saw how people who don't exercise were very happy.
God willing, Ali, tell me about the moment of announcing the victory.
I was leaving training and we were listening to the radio station.
We were waiting for the announcement, me and one of my friends.
While you are driving the car and listening to the radio
The moment they announced that Qatar and
We both screamed, and of course, we had the sunroof open.
Farfi's body came out of the car roof.
We were screaming, everyone was staring at us, we turned on the flashlights and started our celebration alone.
We started the celebration from the beginning
Praise be to God, it was a very special day, and I believe that all the channels focused heavily on this event.
Lana, of course you were participating in this event.
Especially sports channels
How did they celebrate this event and what were their reactions?
There were many media outlets and channels from all over the world.
He became a main teacher, very clear on the map, Qatar became famous.
Sure, Ali, having the player on the team is very important.
And I assume it is a responsibility that must be taken seriously.
What do you think about this specific point?
Okay Ali, did they mention the required characteristics to be in the league?
Now, more sports events are coming.
We must prepare a strong generation.
He has solid foundations and well-planned football tactics.
What are the rules and fundamentals that a player must excel in?
And I believe that professionalism encompasses everything from
Intense and continuous training and discipline
All of these are basic things that help him dedicate all his efforts to games or training.
I believe that every stage has a unique advantage.
It has a distinctive taste and feel.
Talk shows and sports programs, which one do you prefer? Where do you see yourself?
It is wonderful
It helps you maintain your physical fitness and know how to take care of your health through sports, and this is the important part.
Also, everyone watches football matches; you will automatically love it when you enter the stadium.
Are the people working in the media limited to only one aspect?
What limits you on one side?
This is an open field, not just for football.
It's all sports, but the sport is very nice.
Ali, there are also some other important topics that we would like to talk about.
Have you ever wished to go back ten years in your life to reach the year two thousand and twenty-two?
Yeah, I didn't wish for you to
Of course, now one dreams of this, especially since it's the World Cup, now any player
Anyone who just watches a World Cup match will be happy; imagine if they were playing in the World Cup.
I hope they meet the expectations, and this is their chance.
What do you want to say as a professional player, Captain Ali, what do you want to say to them from your heart?
I want to be with you all.
As I said, I am currently on vacation, but
His return to the leagues after a twelve-year absence from the Gulf Cup Championship
You had a nice comment from Qatar TV and sweet memories.
God willing, Qatar TV has become like a university that graduates a large group of media professionals.
Our league is brave, and God willing, it will win several different awards.
Let's talk about an important point regarding Umm Salal Club.
How are you doing there, how are you, I hope you are well
Sure, thank God, honestly
Yesterday, of course, in the studio, we talked about many players.
I think some of the young people who were watching us might think that it was you.
Wanted
This is very normal in the Qatar league for players to transfer to other clubs.
I think I had a good opportunity in Umm Salal, *as an offer*
I was able to secure a spot in the Asian Cup with the team, thank God.
My situation with the team is really great.
How can we make sports a social topic?
And away from Qatar, how can we make women, children, and youth interested in sports?
Everything connects, everything completes the sport
Women play a role in all areas of sports.
Every individual, whether young or old in this society, is aware of the importance of sports, and awareness is expanding further.
Approximately eleven or twelve years, until we reach this event, is sufficient.
We have newer generations more
The generation is growing up, but we must raise a generation that is aware of sports from an early age.
We understand Aspire, Aspire is an efficient building
And fundamental for the new sports generation
We must be firm and move forward.
Especially football
How can we attract the audience to engage in all the matches of the different teams?
Honestly, the lack of audience is a problem for us in the Qatari league.
But the problem is attendance; the Qatar Football Association still hasn't been able to find a way to attract the audience.
What method should we use to attract them to attend these football matches?
It depends on the person themselves; some people don't like attending the stadium.
By the way, the media plays a fundamental role in the audience's abstention.
And now they use a ticket or collect points here.
No, no, the Football Association has a plan and many steps to attract the audience.
Some clubs have ways to attract the audience, like Al Rayyan. Al Rayyan is a famous club and doesn't need to attract the audience.
Some clubs %pw, and some club administrations organize some activities and events
For attendance, to motivate them, I think these are the only ways.
The players, I mean the new generation
They love what they do and believe in their abilities, and as I said, they don't just need financial support, moral support is much more important.
Thank you very much for this wonderful meeting, God willing.
I wanted to hear your final opinion on Qatar winning the bid to host in 2022, Lana, please.
I want to confirm once again that Qatar is always supportive, and
God willing, Captain Ali, your final words that you would like to say in this interview.
Congratulations and I wish you continued success
Thank you, Captain and the knowledgeable player. I wish you success in your athletic progress and in your life. May God bless you.
And I love sports more.
The episode will be about young talents.
Some young people say that these songs are popular these days; but they have a very deep and great history.
A group of young people singing Arabic or English words,
Today we will talk about this with a group of rap enthusiasts,
We will get to know them better through the interview that brings us together with them directly.
Welcome to our program, dear viewers, wherever you are.
For years, a new type of singing has dominated the Arab and Gulf scene,
Coming from the West, especially from America, which is rap.
Before we start talking about rap singing,
There is boldness in using any word without any hesitation.
Anyone can rap.
To write song lyrics,
Almost all rappers write their own lyrics.
So, we will learn all these many important details through two people who have strongly entered this field.
Just a nice band.
Yousef Al-Nuaimi and Salman Abdullah, good morning, Yousef.
Hello we are here, good morning Salman.
Good morning, hello.
I am very happy to have you with us through this program,
And of course, through the topic of rap singing.
Youssef, how did you get into this?
We discovered that rap did not exist in Qatar.
In a better way.
On behalf of the citizen.
Including joy, sadness, and political topics.
Yes, I can say that rap,
And these words, I believe, are like an artist painting a picture and a poet writing a poem.
The singer can sing, and the musician can play any musical instrument.
Do you think there is acceptance from Qatari society, from Gulf society, for this type of words?
Two thousand and ten.
Do you feel that people like to buy CDs of rap songs?
Various ages,
There are families and many people sitting and listening more than before.
There was something like a website.
How many of you are still in this band until now?
This means that all of you can say words, write poetry, and sing in the style of rap.
As the singer, the rapper, says,
He is the one who sometimes plays, writes the words,
Oh, okay!
I ask him to listen and tell him that I recorded this song.
Okay, all these songs that you produced from Salman, from Youssef, from, from anyone in the same band.
I didn't think of putting it on a CD and making it available in stores,
Just know that if someone is on their own, I mean I make the album and release it to the market, so this is difficult—commercial recording and procedures.
Okay, why didn't you think? You are twenty-five years old, and a single hand never claps.
There must be two of you, God willing you have twenty-five, may God protect you, all of you as young men and brothers.
You make a CD and you can market this CD through more than one website on the internet.
You have Facebook, YouTube, and also local newspapers.
I think there are thirteen songs.
Registration was not like it is now,
It's a bit old, but it was clear.
Its quality is poor, not like now, but it's clear.
Only about fifty CDs.
There is rap; I can't say it didn't exist because there might have been young people who knew this art form ten years ago.
Not as strong as the recording, and I think the distribution at that time was different. Now the situation is different.
Especially since there is diversity in music, and many types of techno music now.
These young people and these artists who produce a collection of wonderful songs.
Also, we would like to talk about the parties I participated in,
Look, the party we participated in in Doha was unique.
It was organized by Al Sadd Club, and they were very cooperative.
We sneaked a look at the audience.
We were surprised; we did not expect such a large number.
And we were still surprised that there were even more families coming.
More than the youth
The organization was very excellent.
We were a bit nervous because this was happening for the first time in Doha.
We didn't expect the attendance to be this large.
The audience's reaction was wonderful
It took a long time, as it was in many songs.
Okay, let's hear something, or the lyrics of a song you wrote, and the audience, especially the youth, likes it.
Let's listen to some words, so we can present them to the audience.
Can we listen to it live?
Take your time
Here you go, Salem.
The problem is that it is random.
Let's listen
I don't know
We are here on the Doha Morning program
It is nice to attend the program in the morning.
Salman is an expert; this is his fifth year practicing rap.
Even if people don't like him
They have no idea about him.
Random words
Okay, the songs I sang, give me some of your previous lyrics.
Look, not all songs are random, or what they call in English "freestyle."
They are on the same rhythm
But when we sing, we choose some words carefully.
Thank you, let's see.
I can say, good morning my country, good morning Doha Program
We are live on television, to the audience.
Let's see what one one two one will present.
With some of Doha's morning
The beautiful song I just heard
I insisted that the youth distribute it everywhere and on the internet.
I really appreciate this, when will you launch it?
Teamwork
Everyone writes by themselves.
He won't find the matter easy to carry out.
Everyone writes.
Sure, I assume that every artist, whether a painter or a poet, always
He can still write it out of love for sports.
Or love of the homeland
I am sure that you participated in the National Day.
Through beautiful songs, represent the youth of Qatar
He is waiting for Doha to shine to welcome the Asian Cup, and there will be a celebration on the Corniche.
To celebrate this event
We are broadcasting this video live
From hosting the Asian Cup, Doha
From Doha Airport until now
Let's watch these live clips together.
Reception, audience, our children, students
The Asian Cup arrived at Doha Airport this morning to continue
Preparations for hosting the major continental event
Let's get back to our guests, Youssef and Salman, who are happy to be with us.
They are from an Arab Gulf rap group, right?
Can we call it that way?
Currently, honestly, we are
We are preparing a party, but it's not certain.
Okay, you are working on a party that will be announced, God willing, Youssef
God willing, but this is not certain; we are still beginners.
You are still at the beginning of your career journey. I wish you all the best, and be sure that our program will support you wholeheartedly.
Also, Salman, and where do all of you gather, twenty-five people?
Where do you meet, and how do you gather all the ideas together?
Sure, there are some shared songs.
It's not necessary for anyone to like Salman or Youssef or any of you singing a whole song.
There must be cooperation among all of you.
Honestly, it's difficult to gather all twenty-five of them in one place.
I start calling Youssef and the rest of the guys and ask them to meet in one place.
To consider the song and the lyrics
And in another way
I record my share
And it continues
He records it and sends it to me again.
And see other experiments.
Collecting some CDs of well-known artists
Do you benefit from their expertise and techniques?
Sure, we always are
Artists have been doing this for years and have experience in the field.
We listen to them, learn the techniques, and try to come up with a unique style.
Because if we do the same thing, the same tone, and the same words,
We don't produce anything new, we want to do something that exists.
So we benefit from them a little.
Yes, there is also a large group of young people from the Gulf, in the Gulf.
In a simple way, let's watch the report together to benefit and enjoy, let's watch it together.
The talents that some people have are mysterious.
Using very primitive tools
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah Al-Dalil
This is one hundred and fifty kilometers.
From the Saudi capital, Riyadh
He has good experience and capability.
Discovery of Surface Groundwater Sites
At a depth of more than one hundred meters
You know that drilling wells is very expensive.
Determining the appropriate location for drilling the well, but with the expert, one can
Discover, locate
Groundwater sites
Since ancient times
Our parents and grandparents
I was seeking help from experts to locate the well sites.
pierces
Abu Ibrahim's Techniques in Groundwater Exploration
What are modern techniques?
Or soil analysis in laboratories
He relies on the grace of God in his work.
They are underground tables.
Either pomegranate sticks
Pomegranate branches or fig branches
Now, the process of water table detection is applied scientifically.
In conclusion, this is the end of the broadcast
Come back again
Go back
From here, we begin to put a mark
And here, the table ends.
It requires a lot of experience and patience.
So that we can understand the sensitivity of the movement of Toe
I went to many places.
It means ninety-five percent of success.
Of course, in this way and using copper rods
And there is no precise scientific explanation for
This way
What is truly astonishing is the success rate of those who practice this primitive profession.
Exceeds ninety-five percent
In search of shallow groundwater reservoirs
Praise be to God who taught man the unknown, this report is from Saudi Arabia
Those who have their own band and more than one CD
Whether online or by phone
Sometimes there are competitions between the Gulf countries, such as Qatar against Bahrain and Qatar against Kuwait.
They produce a stronger song with a stronger theme.
Problem solving, etc., there are many issues.
I see him as a role model for me.
God willing
At the same time, we want to
To broadcast a wide range of songs
As much as you can
From time to time, let's keep in touch with you.
To know the latest news of the band
But let's focus on the name of the band.
They are the rappers
Let's go back to our guests at the Corniche and the beautiful weather.
We are with you live through this direct link
Wherever you are on the Corniche, you are welcoming the Asian Cup.
We are proud of them and their wonderful arts.
Deals with various social and psychological issues of youth
But he only has two with us in the studio.
I am sure they are representing the rest.
Youssef and Salman, welcome back again
Sometimes the subscription ends
We tried to contact the company but no one answered.
As a team, you must develop yourself, the people in
Facebook and YouTube
And other similar sites
Name of the band
You will find us among the top search results
Organize and work together on this wonderful production.
You compose and match images with songs, are these personal photos?
Or you can just download it from YouTube and websites that contain videos, and one can watch them.
There are people, we did it before.
There are many songs in it.
The obstacles you face, such as the absence of a sponsoring company and no website
You really need a place where you can all meet as a band.
What are your wishes, the ones you hope to achieve and reach?
The one who takes care of us
And arrange an album for us.
I hope it becomes official.
Because we spent five years
Just a hobbyist, nothing more
Yeah, we shared in some things, in some TV series.
We hope it improves
And we have someone to support us and stay with us.
Yeah, Salman, we want to know what your wishes are next.
My only wish is to produce a music video.
We wish you success
We hope all your songs become famous in the Middle East.
This is a very beautiful and very popular art.
And carry a message, just as I just said.
Good luck, I wish you all the success.
Say hello to the group, and we wish you success.
We will conclude with the song they produced especially for the program.
This is the KD and DJ MREldoha program
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen
This is KJ Madam Bobo with SKT, very hot on the body.
I can say, good morning my country, good morning Doha Program
We are live on television, to the audience.
Don't forget, the show airs at 9:30, everyone must watch.
Let's see what one, one, two, one will present.
With some of Doha's morning
Produced by Hassan Naama, presented by Shaimaa Al Hammadi
The director is Nasser Al-Maliki, and the guests are the Qatari rap singers, of course.
It can be repeated again and used at home.
Like a shopping cart or a handcart
While shopping at the supermarket
When you put any product, or anything you want to buy in
A big screen will appear showing the components of this product.
This was a great and feasible idea afterwards.
Just a barcode, the scanner in the cart detects the item
And made shopping easy for the buyer
He can get all the details on the screen.
I assume it raises health awareness.
When the device is with you or in the cart
Ingredients
Any warnings and side effects
Full details
Or our ambition, for example, in a number of projects, is about four or five.
The one who deals with traffic problems
He deals with traffic congestion and other issues like the parking problem, and he was very creative and beautiful.
God willing, the Children's Cultural Center
Professor Abdullah, let's talk about the different activities that will take place in the coming days.
Yes, and there are also surprises, but we will discuss them briefly.
Ideas, I’m not sure if you want me to mention some of the projects that were presented or not.
For example, for underground transportation, the brilliant idea is
As soon as the man leaves his house, he finds the elevator.
They gathered at one point
I assume that all the viewers are enjoying the images they are seeing now.
From the creativity of children
Exactly, this is, for example, like an ATM machine.
For women, for example, I have a card
I put it on, and say I need a T-shirt.
For example, these are some shops, or if you lose things in the house, like the key.
This is lost, for example the office key
We have a primary goal set by Her Highness Sheikha Moza.
The wife of His Highness
At an early age, and this is of great importance in project design.
For three hundred of the selected children
We also invited the speakers and preachers
Yes, she was the one who hosted the closing ceremony.
To showcase their programs, we must open the doors to children who are truly interested.
And then they can start
We need them to be there and support us; this is our priority.
These programs and activities that serve this main idea
From the various diverse skills of children
Self-development
Okay, do you have any collaborations with youth clubs in Qatar?
There are also scientific clubs in Qatar.
Of course, all our programs are based on the exchange of ideas.
It's all a professional partnership.
With other community service institutions specialized in developing such talents
Participation of all concerned institutions
Photography Association
The Girls' Innovation Center and the Secretariat of the Cabinet also played a very important role.
Yes, they played an important role in clarifying Qatar's vision.
And training children on it
Attracting and encouraging children, as every program is built on institutional partnerships.
According to the specialization of projects and institutions
What difference does it make?
Being here in Katara gives us a strong boost and great support.
And faster
We are now, in collaboration with Katara, preparing some projects that will be ready for launch within the next two months.
Of course, there is collaboration in many programs.
Especially what relates to reading
Chairman of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
And we are operating it, especially since we are in the preparation stage.
To build a promising future for all children, the next generation, and youth
What is your final word that you would like to say to the parents and children who are following us now and are interested in joining the center?
What we offer them now
Sometimes our children come up with ideas that we should not underestimate.
We must take their ideas into consideration no matter what.
Because when we take it seriously, it will develop, at least we will encourage the child to think.
It is important to provide care and attention to children.
And spiritually as well, our problem is that most parents
Support it,
And encourage him, for we encourage the parents.
To give greater attention to the child's imagination, today's children are the roots of the future
We took a tour of the exhibition and while viewing their projects
We lived the dream
Dreams and ideas were from a vast imagination
And dreams come true; many of them are accomplished and become reality.
Praise be to God, we wish success to our children who were there.
Our hearts are with you
God wills
Of different ages and nationalities
Up to seventy projects
This is considered a very pioneering thing and deserves to be implemented.
Let's talk more about this national exhibition.
And the cultural center for children as well
Professor Abdullah, briefly tell us about the exhibition.
Many events have happened, for sure, so what can you say about them?
The children introduced a new style of expressing patriotism and loyalty to their country.
It was under the patronage of the Minister of Education
On the tour in the exhibition
I will grow up until the year 2030.
We began training children to envision Qatar 2030 in all its three pillars.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, environmental development
First, to understand Qatar's situation in 2030
Then, to start thinking about
Creative Ideas, and How to Be Innovative
I assume they really have broad thinking.
But when we help him
I assume their mind will grow more and more.
Sir, I launched the exhibition under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation, Realities or the Nation of Tomorrow"
The slogan says "Dreams of the Generation"
It will be part of Qatar's future, Qatar's tomorrow
We felt this when we were walking around with the children, when the child says to the minister,
I want to open my project, I invite you to visit my project at twenty thirty.
A child thinking about the future after twenty years
They express their love for their countries in the field they are interested in.
There must be some activities, events, and competitions.
One of them won the Stars of Science award.
They were also the first prize winners at the Arab League.
Sure, all the children
On the sides, there were different shows at a specific schedule.
To showcase the projects they have done
There is a great presence, a very unique presence.
Stars of Science
Some of the winners in the projects that participated in the exhibition
Who won one of the main prizes?
What is an innovative or creative forest or reserve?
And we also want to talk about the colored ball.
The colored ball is also part of the dreams and vision of children for the future of Qatar.
It is an idea for twenty thirty.
How can a child contribute a creative idea for twenty or thirty?
The main idea is that there is a layer inside the ball.
The referee gives a colored warning.
For example, the referee can monitor the movements of the ball.
Or the field changes through this electronic slide.
The one installed in the ball
There are creative ideas, and of course, that is the main idea, and some people might ask
And projects
We always say, we've reached this stage.
Skill development and broadening their horizons
They give them an idea of how to express patriotism through these projects.
It gives them confidence in how to present the project, interact with the audience, and explain its concept.
In a field he loves, connected to something he likes, all of this is an achievement.
Provide support, we thank him for it
Currently in the development stage
Likewise, the audience, the committee, and some responsible individuals supported the projects.
First, no, it was the second, because this girl
Pipes, underground attendance channels, and the method of audience entry require arrangements
A very large protected forest
Where can the visitor roam and see the animals and reptiles?
There is also a sensor installed on some animals to monitor their condition.
There is also the marine environment, and the way of entry is innovative as well.
One of the reasons that made her win is the vast and detailed imagination.
All this qualifies them for victory.
There is also someone who talked about an underwater tourist city.
, Butterfly City
Forest on the ground
And many tourism ideas
Very exciting
This might be something on their minds, at this time, maybe in twenty or thirty.
And in the future, it will be achieved.
Three projects
It was adopted by the science club; they said these are the projects we need to work on.
There is a project, the excess water from the air conditioners.
Let's watch Al Arab newspaper
The article says, Qatar University celebrates graduation
Presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al-Mahmoud
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Secretary-General of the Supreme Council for Education
Dr. Sheikha bint Abdullah Al-Misnad, the President
A new record for the university, definitely
Qatar University and the University of Calgary
There is also great news about our students.
It is an educational achievement, and we wish them success, God willing, in all fields of study.
He is considered one of the young actors who are coming strong in the Qatari drama scene.
Until when, and also notebooks and colored threads.
The actor Abdel Hamid Al-Sharshani is considered one of the actors who made themselves on their own.
If it wasn't convincing,
It will not be chosen to be among the works done inside Qatar.
Currently, actor Abdel Hamid Al-Sharshani is participating in the two series "The Killer Feeling" and "Tasaneef Part Two."
We are happy that he is our guest this morning,
So that we can talk to him about his participation in these two works and about his experience in general.
Hello and good morning.
We are happy to have you on the Doha Morning program. This is my first time meeting you, and this is your first time on Doha Morning.
With the people who work hard for the program
And you, Madam Lisa.
Welcome with us. Let us, before we start the conversation,
Okay, let's see.
I am a responsible and executive man.
And I enforce the laws.
The only thing I can tell you,
Give me the bisht.
Listen, why are you asking me?
Go and ask them, if anyone agrees that you don't return the cloak,
From him. Of course, I have a second question to start with, but because we saw this part of the series, classifications of the first part.
He referred to Khalid ibn al-Walid
Some historians associate the well-known poet Imru' al-Qais with the city of Marat.
Many things and information related to that city in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
For more information, we will watch this wonderful report with you from our colleague Abdulrahman Morshed.
Let's see it together.
Certainly, it is the testimony of people who know about flattery or favoritism.
And as proof of the history of this city or the second.
As much as we see of its effects and hear from those who tell its stories and poets
Their classics and modern works, so this is considered an important record added to the city's record.
Marat City is one of the cities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Historically, it is an ancient city founded in the pre-Islamic era.
There was a debate among historians about how it was named?
Some of them believed that it was named after the famous poet Imru' al-Qais al-Kindi.
And the creek that is named after him.
The date of its establishment is unknown.
In the pre-Islamic era.
The most famous thing in the city of Marat is Mount Kemit, on which many proverbs have been built.
Because it is in the city and close to it.
Al-Jaf. These are historical places.
This scene is considered one of the tourist landmarks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Marat Municipality has made a great effort in accomplishing
A garden on top of this mountain
And places to sit for local residents and for all people in the kingdom.
It was named after the companion of the Prophet, Khalid ibn al-Walid, may Allah be pleased with him.
To fight the apostates and Musaylimah the liar.
Among its landmarks is the Kemit Valley.
This is a place where water from streams gathers and is stored for a long time.
It was one of the most important sources of water in the past.
Among its effects is also the House of Disasters for Heritage.
Marat is a city whose history dates back to the pre-Islamic period.
He was famous for his poets who were influenced.
With its beauty, its ruins, and its famous mountain Komait.
Abdulrahman Al-Murshid for the Doha Morning program,
Marat City, north of Riyadh.
We have returned once again to our dear guests.
I hope you can tell us and the viewers about these methods and techniques.
At the beginning, I mentioned that our infrastructure is very distinctive.
We open a page for him and register him through the presence of a special record in our system.
His guardian's email.
This report contains the extent of increased attention, typing speed, reading speed, and overall distraction.
The guardian receives a full report.
Okay, this report will be added to the student's record.
To register his son online.
And he saw his son's progress.
He can see his grades and concentration with the teachers.
So we can truly enjoy the intelligence of this sweet girl.
So that we can gather most of the children at the center and send them our warmest regards.
Who registered at this center with a professor there?
To understand her intelligence and the level she has reached since the day she entered the center.
Of course, this year.
He focuses on one job and after Ramadan.
But this effect, of course, always comes at the expense of other works.
There are people who only watch television during Ramadan.
He stays up late watching television while people turn the months of worship into television time.
Lessons, lessons, a series of lessons, lessons, let them do the same job every two years, is this better?
Of course.
I hope they like me during Ramadan,
I just wanted to send you all my regards.
And God willing,
And also with the plays.
From drama to fashion.
A fashion show was organized at Katara Cultural Village.
Of course, we continue with you with great love and sincerity.
And further developing the abilities and skills of children.
Different from the various schools in this generous country.
We have a model and we talked with our guest who was with us before.
Now with us is Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Abdulsalam, we welcome him with us and good morning.
How are you, Omnia?
I am fine.
What grade are you in now?
Mr. Ibrahim, to begin with, could you please introduce us to the course offered by the center?
And Amineh is an example of this.
We will also try with her the technique or method that Mrs. Nesma mentioned.
Do you feel there is a difference in his thinking?
Do you feel that these skills and methods,
Things will not change regarding his mental skills, nor will his educational level change.
Scientific methods
Including initially testing the child with an international test called the TONI test before starting anything in the program.
I also start the second part of Tony's test.
We can measure through it the student's level or the change in their level.
Now there will be a test or something like that.
Omnia will calculate and respond immediately on air.
Of course, Omnia doesn't know anything about the questions.
We surprised them with this.
Of course, I have another question to start with,
We would like to ask you about your participation in the second part this year.
What is your participation, can you tell us about it?
Of course, after we presented the classification series of the first part,
Praise be to God, I have been fortunate in several roles.
Mr. Ghanem,
Distributed the roles with the Executive Director Ashraf Shehata with Mr.
It is an opportunity from Tara to produce art.
For the youth.
Mr. Ghanem nominated me this year for
Of course, each episode is different.
I have more than one episode in which I will play different characters.
On the contrary, this is a great experience. In this work, we have...
A pyramid from the pyramids of Kuwait, Mr. Saad Al-Faraj.
We have actors from Bahrain, Abdullah Malik, Ali Al Ghurair.
Like Ali Mirza, we have
You also have a group of young actors like Abdullah Adam.
Yes, among the young actors, we have Abdullah Al-Essam.
This happened a year ago, and last year we were working two jobs in the year.
This might be the reason that made me ask you before going on air. You have been representing, since 1997,
But you couldn't achieve anything, or your ambition in acting.
Praise be to God for everything.
Did you study acting or was it just something casual?
No, I consider it a hobby.
I chose acting as a talent. %PW who supported me in my beginnings is the actor Abdulaziz Jassim.
He is one of the actors who consider me as if I were his son.
If you need anything, call me.
We were in all his series.
We worked hard, thank God.
Now, without Tara, a very special thanks to Mr. Abdulrahman Al-Saliti, and a very, very special thanks to Mr. Abdulrahman.
If we compare ourselves to Kuwait. In Kuwait, between twelve and sixteen new actors come every year. Why?
They have.
Of course, many thanks to him because he provides many opportunities.
So, let's say,
Let's talk about the second series, we had an idea about the classifications,
We need to know about the killer feeling.
And also the man.
We have a sample, and with us is the processor Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Mayouf Al-Tamimi.
So that this procedure happens live
And we can see how we can treat the person. Let me first say good morning to Mr. Sobhi bin Hamza, welcome.
Excuse me, and peace be upon you.
Let's get started with you, sir, please.
God willing
In the name of God.
We hold hands.
Let's see the nerves.
It is like a painting or a message from God Almighty showing all the organs in your body.
From the inside and its problems.
Sometimes you feel dizzy.
Headache and dizziness.
Relax your hand, relax it. Let your nerves rest, yeah.
By doing this, Mr. Abdulaziz, you will discover something specific from his hand that indicates he is suffering from a certain disease.
On his left side. His ears, he has a mild inflammation in his middle ear.
There is pain! What does this mean, Professor Abdulaziz?
The ear. Do you have a problem with your ear?
From the day I was born and from the day I was a baby.
Do you still have pain here?
It's the sinuses!
Do you have pain in the nose and headache here?
I have a headache here.
He has a problem with his sinuses.
It causes him a headache between the eyes.
Weight increases without eating.
Your thyroid is not working well, you feel lazy and sluggish all the time, and your body feels heavy.
I sleep a lot.
Either too much sleep or laziness, you always feel heavy.
You always have tonsillitis.
There is. Look at the vibration, you notice the vibration.
He is suffering from stress, and you are walking barefoot; it might be the last time.
Are you from Tunisia?
Wow, you mentioned things about him.
Is this massage beneficial for children afterwards?
A mother's thumb, glory be to God, is the size of a child's palm.
Most children do not sleep, why?
When you carry him, he doesn't like to be put down, but people think he likes to be put down. He has gas in his stomach, God bless you.
When the mother places her thumb, she stretches the thumb.
In the palm of the child's hand.
The hands are parallel, and the child is parallel with them.
Let's watch it, so every mother can learn this move.
She starts pressing like this. Right and left, right and left.
This is about the child, about, about, about the child and he is sweet.
Okay, regarding discoveries, you have special discoveries for women.
As we said, in every house there are ninety percent women, may God protect them.
The first thing, the first warning is about ceramic and conductive floors.
When we walk barefoot on the ceramic, there is no problem walking barefoot, but walking on an uneven surface is dangerous.
Walk barefoot! The proof of this is that when they use ceramic tiles in houses, health problems increase.
Because it is cold and even.
When it was the carpet, there were problems, they were suffering from asthma.
Increased.
A woman should focus on walking barefoot on the ankle.
This foot and the area behind the ankle, the ankle
From here, this is the foot and now under the ankle.
This is the first discovery, and the second discovery is the method of facilitating delivery.
Focus with me a little.
In her seventh or ninth month.
In general, once in the delivery month.
This means, what comes on the eighth, the eighth is dangerous and the most dangerous thing is walking barefoot.
A pregnant woman must be careful when walking barefoot,
If it were on time,
I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan, "And shake towards you the trunk of the palm tree; it will drop upon you ripe, fresh dates."
We know that Mary, peace be upon her, we know that her sustenance comes to her.
I even discussed it with the scholars, and they said to me: Why change Ibn Kathir's interpretation?
I told them, I am giving you the idea that God placed in this knowledge and that He inspires me with.
Shake a palm tree trunk towards you, when you shake the palm tree, what does it look like?
It is sharp like nails or thorns.
When you shake the palm tree, it gave an order to the wombs, which is the womb area, here in the middle.
They are the viscera. They give orders to facilitate childbirth and reposition the fetus.
Raising the fetal head or repositioning it so that it comes out naturally.
Glory be to God, this is one of the benefits of this fruit.
He holds the hand and begins to soothe it.
Some take it as a practice, and some know that it is a science.
That's why they're afraid to tell you, and you won't believe them.
Yes. Mr. Abdulaziz, your discoveries are important.
I just want to ask you one last question because time has passed very quickly.
If someone wants to get in touch with you, anyone who wants to get in touch with you, there is a specific email or you.
Okay, the mobile number is in the control room. If anyone wants to contact Mr. Abdulaziz, they can call us after the program.
Of course, on Qatar TV's numbers, so he can contact us and get this number.
I was created just to serve people.
If we believe in this faith, may God bless your work and guide the people.
I have sins like everyone else and do everything you can imagine, I am an ordinary person.
Nevertheless, we aspire to greater good.
We always think of good.
Our viewers, I hope you enjoyed this segment about reflexology and hand massage.
And also through the man.
We saw a live example on air, how they diagnosed the diseases that this person has,
What he is suffering from. I hope we can benefit from you, and if anyone wants to contact him, they can read about him online.
The method that will be applied, whether in the coming days or the coming years, or if it will include more schools.
Good morning
How do you rate this experience?
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
The fact that obesity in the Gulf countries has become a major problem.
We were afraid that Qatar would become the fifth country with them.
Honestly, this program became that she was the first woman in New York.
I visited Doha and they have a program for this.
They offered it to us, we adopted it and said it was fine.
Our students along with the students of New York, Spain, and England,
Therefore, we can observe the level of our students in Qatar among the world, and this is something we want in the future.
Because we encourage students to eat fruits.
And he stops playing sports.
Of course, the fifth week is your family's meal with your family.
Killing two birds with one stone (proverb)
In the sixth week, Wash tells us what he gained from this experience. Thank God, we are at the conclusion today.
We are happy with the students.
You know they were three independent schools, for boys Abu Ubaidah,
Independent for girls Ruqayya,
And with a high spirit.
The family became more aware, and their siblings were excited at home and started eating this food like them.
It has become a transitional culture between the student and him transferring this culture to the home and his family.
He goes and tells them, they are the ones who gave me this or they are the ones who taught me this.
The training staff or the person who gave this information to the students,
How did you choose him and how was the communication with the student? Who initiated the communication?
Yes, there were many parties that helped us, may God reward them well.
Our brothers at the diet center teach them about food, healthy eating of course.
Learn with Mrs. Aisha Al-Tamimi the etiquette of eating.
How they organize themselves, how they arrange their priorities!
To learn cooking, sports, or awareness of the value of healthy eating.
It was in the form of separate lessons, a curriculum, or
How were these ideas conveyed to the students?
In different ways, some of it inside the school,
We organized a day at the beginning of the program in the Aspire area, gathering all the boys and girls.
These matters are not something that concern a specific person; we are all responsible, responsible, because these are our children.
How do these students behave at the beginning!
I said at the beginning that the results were satisfactory,
Is it enough to have three classes or specific classes in those schools?
Now, when you start an experiment in the world, you don't start on a large scale.
It starts within a reasonable range that includes all characteristics; boys, girls, independent, and private.
Since it is not appropriate in our culture, environment, and family circumstances, such as how they accept certain things for their children and do not accept others.
They basically want to participate in it, and honestly, it is very important.
The student who is twelve or thirteen years old, this is the right time for him to learn about his health.
This is a struggle for many people who want others to be thin, but he imagines that this is impossible.
Some actors we've seen in the cinema with slim bodies, he says this is impossible, no!
We talked in detail, but there were many weeks we couldn't cover.
And through Doha Morning, we can remind them of it.
And the fruits that contain vitamin B, which you can get from fruits and vegetables.
So the person must know the benefits of fruits and must know that if they eat them, their health will improve, so they will have high morale.
As for the fruits, they went to the supermarket and chose their fruits.
So this is the point.
It is diversity, and of course they compete; each school was creative with the different ideas of its teachers.
Spirit of competition.
We give them guidelines, and each one must innovate.
Did the teachers train the students, or do you have a special team?
Our door, our door.
But the teachers were adding, for example, some schools like Abu Ubaidah said that they would make Saturday for student activities.
This is a day outside school hours, they decide and adopt it, Ruqayya School said they will hold a procession.
They said they were going to have a healthy cooking day for the girls, but we didn't force the guys to do the healthy cooking themselves; the girls were more skilled at this.
Also, I would like to thank Al Rayan Water, which provided all the water for free to the schools. Al Rayan Water for this matter.
Of course, water is much healthier because it needs to cleanse the body of all these toxic substances that enter the body daily through water.
We said the third week.
This means that his body is moving.
He might be playing football or basketball and doesn't know that this is the game I love.
Right, right, exactly, and some of them might want a different game, maybe they don't like group games.
Welcome to us live.
Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Jaber, founder and director of the Multiple Sclerosis Association in Qatar, we welcome him with us.
Which, of course, we try as much as possible to focus on important topics.
We would like to introduce and inform our dear viewers about multiple sclerosis.
Because this name might be strange to us later,
The number of women was more than that of men.
All available treatments now are preventive treatments.
The white blood cells that are supposed to protect us begin to
He kills us by hitting the nerve cell.
Let me simplify it for the audience, it's like a wire
Covered with a layer called myelin, let's say it's like a nylon layer.
Of course, it usually causes dizziness and blurred vision, double vision.
This also led to problems in the digestive and respiratory systems.
Leads to madness in its worst cases, leads to tetraplegia or hemiplegia.
Of course, the treatments.
The most important functions in the body will be significantly affected.
Or from this disease, a disease called multiple sclerosis.
Some theories say that it was transmitted through a virus.
The disease is a non-epidemic disease.
What is transmitted to children
Some people consider it a disease depending on the region.
The equator, for example, was exempted from this disease.
Currently, we have some cases of this disease on the equator.
This disease has no treatment so far because its cause is unknown.
Until now, scientists have not been able to find the cause of the disease, so they can find a treatment for it.
Currently, the process is reversed.
They try to avoid the effect of the disease itself on the human body.
In other words, they seem to be working from behind.
We might be a little afraid of this issue, which we can say is that this disease comes suddenly.
Is there a specific group, a group that feels this disease spreads particularly among them?
Internationally, it was ranked between twenty and forty.
Currently, the international association for the same disease has reduced the number from twenty to fifteen.
Because it has begun to include young people up to the age of forty.
Nevertheless, a person never fully recovers from it.
Of course, as a society, we are open to alternative medicine and prophetic medicine.
Yes, through the association, the Multiple Sclerosis Association Qatar
Why do we have this society?
There was a large group, so they thought about forming an association for this matter.
Of course, I will give you some random numbers.
In Kuwait, they say there are sixteen thousand cases.
One thousand cases.
The rest of the Gulf countries range between one hundred and three hundred.
When I was diagnosed five to six years ago,
My number was sixty or sixty-six.
Are there symptoms that indicate the patient is actually suffering from this disease?
We are not sure that it is a virus, so we do not want to adopt a specific theory; that is the point.
The second point is how I can know if I have the issue or not.
This is very difficult.
I am confused! Mr. Abdulaziz, I am trying to pinpoint a specific point.
