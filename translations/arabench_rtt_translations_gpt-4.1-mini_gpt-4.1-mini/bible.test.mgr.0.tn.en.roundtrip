Who is the most important person in the kingdom?
At that time the disciples came to Jesus. They asked him, "Who is the most important person in the kingdom of heaven?"
Issa called out to a small child to come over. He made the child stand in the middle of them.
Jesus said, "Truly, I tell you, you must change and become like little children. If you do not do this, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
Whoever becomes like this child, free from pride, is the most important in the kingdom of heaven.
Anyone who welcomes a small child, how come he welcomes me like this?
But what if one of those little ones who believe in me challenges him to sin? If he does that, it would be better for him to have a large millstone tied around his neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.
How terrible the world will be because of the things that make people make mistakes! Things like this have to happen. But how terrible it will be for those who cause them!
If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or one foot than to enter hell with two hands and two feet. In hell, the torment is always burning.
If your eyes cause you to sin, pluck them out and throw them away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of Hell. The story of the lost lamb
Look, don’t underestimate one of these little ones. I’m telling you. Their angels in heaven can go anytime to see my father who is in heaven.
<.>
What do you think? Suppose a man has 100 sheep and one of them gets lost. Wouldn't he leave the 99 sheep in the mountains? Wouldn't he go look for the one that got lost?
What I'm going to tell you is true. If he found that sheep, he would be happier with it than with the 99 that didn't get lost.
The same goes for your father in heaven. He doesn't want any of these children to be lost. When someone sins against you
If your brother wronged you, go to him. Tell him what he did wrong. Keep it between you. If he listens to you, you have won him back.
But if he does not listen to you, take one or two others with you. The Bible says, "Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But if they persist and refuse to listen to the witnesses? Then tell it to the church. And if they persist and refuse to listen even to the church? Then do not treat him as your brother. Treat him as you would someone without faith or who does not pay taxes.
What I am going to tell you is true. What you close on earth will be closed in heaven. And what you open on earth will be opened in heaven.
Once again, this is what we tell you. Suppose two of you on earth agree on anything you ask for. Father in heaven will do it for you.
"So that two or three gather in my name, I will be with them." The servant who has no mercy
Peter came to Jesus. He asked, "Lord, how many times must I forgive my brother when he wrongs me? Only seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The Kingdom of Heaven: How a love king gathers all the money that his servants owe him.
When the king started doing it, they brought him a man who owed him millions of dollars.
The man could not pay. Because of that, his master gave him an order. The man, his wife, his children, and all that he owns must be sold to repay the debt he owes.
The servant fell on his knees in front of him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "So I can fix everything."
Sido felt pity for him. He forgave him for what he owed and let him go.
As for what follows, this servant went out and met one of the other servants who owed him some money. He grabbed him and started choking him. He said, "Pay me what you owe!"
The other servant fell to his knees. "Give me time," he pleaded. "So I can return your money."
As for the first servant, he refused. Instead, he walked away and let the man be imprisoned. The man will now stay in prison until he collects the money and repays the debt.
The other slaves saw what happened. This upset them a lot. They went and told their master everything that happened.
Then the gentleman called the first servant. He said to him: "O wicked servant, I have forgiven you all that you owed because you asked me."
You shouldn't have shown mercy to the other servant the way you showed mercy to me.
In anger, his master handed him over to the guards. To be punished until he takes responsibility for everything.
This is how your father in heaven will treat you unless you sincerely forgive your brother.
Jesus teaches about divorce
When Jesus finished saying these things, he left Galilee. He went to the region of Judea on the other side of the Jordan River.
They were followed by large crowds. He healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to test him. They asked, "Does the law allow a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female'? (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two, but one. Therefore, a man should not separate what God has joined together.
They asked, "Why at that time did Moses command that a man could give his wife a divorce paper and send her away?"
Jesus replied, "Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because you were stubborn. But it was not like this from the beginning.
Here's what I tell you. A man who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man can only divorce his wife if she was not faithful to him.
The students told him, "If that's how it is between a man and a woman, it's better that we don't get married."
Jesus replied, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who are able to live without marrying can accept it."
Some men cannot have children because they were born this way. Some became this way because of other people. And others made themselves this way to serve the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept living like this must do it." The little children are brought to Jesus.
Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted Him to lay His hands on the children and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Do not stop them. The kingdom of heaven belongs to people like them."
Isa put his hands on them. Then he walked away from there. Isa and the rich young man
A man came to Jesus. He asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?"
"Why do you ask me about what is good?" Jesus answered. "There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, follow the commandments."
"Which one?" the man asked. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
"Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
The young man said: "I have obeyed all these commandments. What else must I do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go and sell all you have. Give the money to the poor. So that you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
When the young man heard this, he walked away sad. He was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "What I am about to tell you is true. It is difficult for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.
Once again, we tell you, it is difficult for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle. But even more difficult for the rich to enter the kingdom of my Lord.
When the students heard this, they were very surprised. They asked, "So who can pay?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man, this is impossible. But with my Lord, everything is possible."
Peter answered, "Let us do everything so that we may follow you! What reward will you give us?"
Jesus said to them: "What I am about to tell you is true. When everything is renewed, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. At that time, you who have followed me will also sit on 12 thrones. You will judge the 12 tribes of Israel.
Everyone who left homes, families, and fields because of me to receive a hundred times more. And also to receive eternal life.
Many who are at the beginning will end up at the end. And many who are at the end will end up at the beginning.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The Kingdom of Heaven: There was a man who owned land. Early in the morning, he went out to hire workers for his vineyard.
He agreed to give them the regular pay for daytime service. Then he sent them to Karmo.
Around nine in the morning, he went out again. He saw other people standing in the market and not doing anything.
He told them, "You also go and work in my vineyard. I will pay you what is fair."
So they left. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock and did the same thing.
Around five o'clock, he went out and found other people standing. He asked them, "Why are you sitting here all day and not doing anything?"
They told them, "Because no one called us." They told them, "You also go and work in my vineyard."
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard spoke to the person in charge of the workers. He said to him, "Call the workers and give them their wages. Start with those who worked last. Then continue with those who worked from the beginning."
The workers who finished around five o'clock came. Each of them took the regular daily wage.
Just as the people who worked first came, they expected to receive more. But each of them also usually received a day's wage.
When they received it, they started complaining about the owner.
They said: "These people who were hired last time only worked for an hour. You paid them like us. We did most of the work and were under the scorching sun all day long."
One of the owners answered. He said: "My friend, I will be fair with you. Didn't we agree that you would work for the regular wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to give those who worked after you the same payment I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my money? Do you feel like I cheated you because I generously gave to everyone?
"Those who are last will be first. And those who are first will be last." Issa keeps talking about his upcoming death.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to talk with them.
"To go up to Jerusalem," he said. "The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death."
Then they will hand him over to non-Jewish people. The people will mock him and beat him. They will nail him to the cross. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks a favor from Jesus
Zubdi's mother came to Issa. Her children came with her. She knelt on her knees and asked him for a favor.
Jesus said: "What do you want?" She said: "Promise me that one of my two sons will sit at your right hand in your kingdom. Promise me that the other will sit at your left."
Jesus said to them: "You do not know what you are asking for." They said to him: "Can you drink the cup of suffering that I am going to drink?" They said: "We can."
Jesus said to them, "Surely you will drink from my cup. But it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or my left. These places are reserved for those whom my Father has prepared."
The other ten disciples heard about this. They were angry with the two brothers.
Isa gathered them together. He said, "You know about the rulers of the nations. They have authority over their people. Their top officials command them.
Don't be like that. On the contrary, the one who wants to be important among you must be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first must be a servant to you.
The Son of Man came not to be served. On the contrary, He came to serve people. He came to give His life as a price to free many people. Two blind men regain their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho. A large crowd was following them.
There were two blind men sitting by the side of the road. They heard that Jesus was passing by. So they shouted, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd was told to stop. They were told to be quiet. But the two men shouted louder, "Oh Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood and called out to them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
"Oh my God," they answered, "we want to be able to see."
Jesus felt deep concern for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately, they were able to see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem
When everyone approached Jerusalem, they reached Bethphage. It was on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two disciples.
He told them, "Walk to the village ahead of you. As soon as you arrive, you will find a tied donkey. Its owner will be with it. Untie it and bring it to me."
If someone tells you something, tell them that the Lord needs them. The owner will send them immediately.
This is about to fulfill what the Prophet said. He says,
Say to the city of Zion, "Look, your king is coming to you. He is gentle and riding on a donkey. Riding on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
The students went and did what Jesus told them.
They brought the donkey and the little donkey. They put their cloaks on them. Then Jesus sat on the cloaks.
A very large crowd spread their coats on the road. Other people cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people went ahead of him, and some followed him. Everyone shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest heavens!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred. People asked, "Who is this?"
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleanses the temple
Jesus entered the temple area. He began to drive out all the people who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers. And he also overturned the chairs of those who were selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you are making it a 'den of thieves.'" (Jeremiah 7:11)
The blind people and those with disabilities came to Jesus in the temple. He was going to heal them.
The chief priests and teachers of the law saw the amazing things he did. They also saw the children in the temple area shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they became angry.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," Jesus answered. "Have you never read in the Scriptures, 'You have made children and infants praise you'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Afterwards, Jesus walked away from the people and left the city for Bethany. He spent the night there. The fig tree withers.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree on the road. He walked to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, "God willing, you will not bear fruit again!" Immediately, the tree withered.
When the students saw this, they were amazed. They said, "How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?"
Jesus replied, "What I am about to tell you is true. You must have faith and not doubt. Then you can do as happened with the fig tree. You can tell this mountain, 'Go and throw yourself into the sea.' It will happen like that.
"If you believe, you will find what you seek when you pray." The authority of Jesus is questioned.
Jesus entered the temple courtyard. While he was teaching there, the chief priests and elders of the people came to him. They said to him: "By what authority are you doing these things?" "Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus replied, "Let me ask you one more question. If you answer me, I will tell you with authority what to do with these things."
Where did John’s baptism come from? Was it from heaven? Or did it come from people?" That’s how they talked among themselves. They said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask us, 'Then why didn’t you believe him?'"
But if we say, "from the men"? We are afraid of people. Everyone thinks that John was a prophet.
They answered Jesus, "We don't know." Jesus said, "Then I will not tell you by what authority I do these things either." The Parable of the Two Sons
What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "My son, go and work today in the vineyard."
"I’m not going to do it," the boy answered. But then he changed his mind and left.
Then the father went to the second boy. He said the same thing to him. The boy answered, "I will do it, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, tax collectors and prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God before you."
When you were young, he showed you the right path to live by. And you didn't believe him. But when taxes and prostitutes came, you believed him. You saw it like that. But even then, you didn't repent from your sins and you still didn't believe him. The story of rent.
Listen to another story. A man had a small piece of land where he planted a vineyard. He built a wall around it. He dug a pit to make a grape press in it. He also built a watchtower. He rented the vineyard to some farmers. Then he went on a trip.
As the harvest time approached, he sold his slaves to the tenants. He told the slaves to collect his share of the fruits.
As for the cars, their workers tightened up. They hit one of them. They killed another. They threw stones at the third to kill him.
After that, the man sent other servants to the tenants. He sent more than the first time. The tenants treated them the same way.
In the end, his son sent to them. He said: "So they respect my son."
As for the cars, they saw the boy coming. They said to each other, "This is the one who will inherit all the owner's property one day. Let's kill him. Then everything will be ours."
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard. Then they killed him.
When the generous owner returns, what will he do to these tenants?
They said: "He is going to demolish those wicked people." They said: "Then, he will rent out the vineyard to other tenants. They will give him his share of the harvest at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Haven't you read in the Scriptures, 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22,23)
Here's what I'll tell you. The kingdom of my Lord will be taken away from you. And it will be given to people who will produce its fruit.
Everyone falls on this stone to be broken into pieces. But the stone will crush anyone who falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' stories. They knew that he was talking about them.
They were looking for a way to arrest him. But they were afraid of the people. The people believed that Jesus was a prophet.
The Story of the Wedding Dinner
Issa told them more stories. He said,
Here is how the kingdom of the heavens is: a king prepared a wedding dinner for his son.
He sent his servants to invite them to dinner. The servants told them to come. But they refused.
After sending some of the most trusted servants, he said: "Tell those who are invited that I have prepared my dinner. I have slaughtered my bulls and the finest cows. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding dinner."
As for the people, they didn't pay attention. One went to his field. Another went to his work.
The rest tightened their grip on their servants. They treated them badly and then killed them.
The king was very angry. He sent his armies to destroy them. Those killers were killed and their city was burned.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding dinner is ready. As for those who were invited, they were not suitable to come."
Walk to the street corners. Invite anyone you find to dinner.
The servants went out to the streets. They gathered all the people they found, whether they were good or bad. Soon, the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to see the guests. He noticed a man present who was not wearing wedding clothes.
"My friend," he asked, "how did you get in here without any wedding clothes?" The man had nothing to say.
Then the king said to his servants, "Tie his hands and feet. Throw him outside into the darkness. There, people will cry and gnash their teeth."
"Many are invited, but few are chosen." Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They made plans to trap Jesus with his words.
They sent their followers to him. They sent the Herodians with them. "Teacher," they said, "we know you are an honest man. You teach the way of God sincerely. Don’t let anyone tell you what to do or what to say. Don’t care how important they are.
We said just now, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to the Caesar or not?
As for Jesus, he knew their evil plans. He said, "O hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
"Show me the coin that people use to pay the tax." They brought him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words are these?"
They said to him: "To Caesar." Then he said to them: "Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God."
When they heard this, they were surprised. Then they left him and went away. Marriage is like waking the dead.
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people rise from the dead.
"O sir," they said, "this is what Moses told us. If a man dies and has no children, his brother must marry the widow. He must have children to continue his brother's name."
We had seven brothers. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second and third brothers. It happened exactly the same even to the seventh brother.
In the end, the woman died.
Now, when the dead rise, who will be his wife? All seven of them were married to her.
Jesus replied, "You are mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures. And you do not know the power of my Lord."
To raise the dead, they will not marry. And their parents will not marry them off. They will be like the angels in heaven.
What do you think about the resurrection of the dead? Didn't you read what God told you?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham. I am the God of Isaac. And I am the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead. He is the God of the living.
When people heard this, they were amazed at what he was teaching. The most important advice
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus. So the Pharisees gathered.
One of them was an expert in the law. So Jesus asked him a question to test him.
"Sir," he asked, "what is the most important commandment in the Sharia?"
Jesus answered, "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important advice.
And the second is like it. "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
Everything is written in the Sharia, and the prophets are based on these two commandments. "Who is the son of Christ?"
The Pharisees were gathered. Jesus asked them,
What do you think of the Messiah? Whose son is he? "Son of David," they answered him.
He said to them, "Why does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet." (Psalm 110:1)
If David calls him "my lord," how can he be the son of David?
No one was able to answer him with a single word. Since that day, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
Jesus Judges the Pharisees and the Teachers of the Law
Jesus spoke to the crowds and his disciples.
He said: "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat."
You must obey them. Do everything they tell you. But do not do as they do. They do not practice what they preach.
They tie heavy weights and put them on other people's shoulders. But they themselves don't even want to move a finger to carry them.
Everything they do is for people to see. On their foreheads and arms, they wear small boxes containing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they lengthen the fringes on their coats a lot.
They like to sit in the place of honor at dinners. They also like to have the most important chairs in the synagogue.
They like to be greeted in the markets. They like it when people call them 'Sir'.
As for what you need, you don't have to be called "Lord." You have only one Lord, and you are all brothers.
You cannot call anyone on earth "Dad." You have one Dad, and He is in heaven.
You don't need to be called "teacher." You have one teacher, and that is Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
He who raises himself will be brought down. And he who is brought down will be raised.
What is the evil that will happen to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor do you let those who are trying to enter.
<.>
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You travel all over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell
How much of a disaster this is for you, blind guides! You say, "If someone swears by the temple, it has no value. But whoever swears by the gold of the temple must keep the oath."
Are you blind and stupid! What is more important? The gold? Or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
Zada says, "If someone swore by the altar, it has no value. But if someone swore by the gift they have, they must keep the oath."
Oh blind ones! What is more important? The gift? Or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
So whoever swears by the altar swears by the altar and by everything on it.
And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the sky swears by the Throne of God and by the One who is seated upon it.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You give God a tenth of your spices, like mint, dill, and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should have practiced
O blind leaders! You can swallow the smallest insect from your food. But you cannot swallow a whole camel!
What a disaster upon you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! Clean the outside of the cup and dish. But inside, you are full of greed. You only want to enjoy yourselves.
Oh blind Persian! First, clean the inside of the glass and the plate. Then the outside so it will be clean too.
What a disaster upon you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs. They look beautiful on the outside. But inside they are full of dead bones. And moreover, they are full of other things that are not pure and clean.
The same goes for you. From the outside, it looks like you're doing the right thing. But inside, you're filled with what’s wrong. You pretend to be something you're not.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets. You decorate the graves of the righteous.
And she says, "If we had lived in the days of those who lived before us, we would not have done what they did. We would not have helped in killing the prophets."
This is how you bear witness against yourselves. You admit that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
So they continued the sins that those who lived before you started!
O nest of venomous snakes! How will you escape the punishment in the fire?
To send you prophets, wise men, and teachers. So that you kill some of them. So that you crucify some of them. And others you whip in your temples. So that you chase them from city to city.
To pay for the blood of the righteous people who were shed on the earth. That is, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah. Zechariah is the one you killed between the temple and the altar.
What I'm going to tell you is true. All this is going to happen to the people who are living now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and throw stones to kill those sent to you. Many times I wanted to unite your people together. I wanted to be like a hen gathering her chicks under her wing. But you did not let me!
Look, your house has remained empty.
We say to you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." (Psalm 118:26)
Signs of the End
Jesus walked away from the temple. He was walking when his disciples came to him. They wanted to draw his attention to the buildings of the temple.
"Do you see all these things?" Jesus said. "What I am telling you is true. Not one stone here will be left on another stone. Every stone will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. The disciples came to him alone. They said to him: "Tell us, when will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Be alert! Be careful that no one deceives you.
Many will come in my name. They will say, 'I am the Messiah!' They will deceive many people.
You will hear about wars. You will also hear people talking about upcoming wars. Don't be afraid. These things have to happen. But the end has not come yet.
The nation will fight the nation. The monarchy will fight the monarchy. People will go hungry. There will be earthquakes in many places.
These are all the early signs of labor pains.
After that, people will greet you only to treat you badly and kill you. All the peoples will hate you because of me.
At that time, many people will turn away from their faith. They will hate one another. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets appear to deceive many people.
Evil grows because of anger, love for most people is to cool down.
As for those who endure until the end, they will be saved.
This joyful news of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world. It will be a testimony to all peoples. Then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke about "the abomination that causes desolation." (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Then those in Judah must flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof should go down to his house to take something out.
There is no one in the field who goes back to get their coat.
How hard these days will be for pregnant women! How hard they will be for breastfeeding mothers!
I pray that you never have to run away in the winter or on a Saturday.
It will be a great suffering these days. It will be worse than anything that has happened since the beginning of time until now. And it will never happen like this again.
If time did not shorten, no one would live. But because the chosen people of God, it will shorten.
At that time, someone might say to you, "Look! Here is the Messiah!" or, "Here he is!" Don't believe it.
They will appear as false Christians and false prophets. They will perform great signs and miracles. They will try to deceive the chosen people of God if possible.
Look, I told you before.
If someone tells you, "He is far away in the desert," don't go now. And if someone says, "He is deep inside the house," don't believe it.
The lightning that comes from the east can be seen in the west. So it will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
The eagles will gather wherever there is a dead corpse.
After severe suffering in those days, "The sun will be darkened. The moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky. The heavenly bodies will shake." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the peoples on earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky. He will come with great power and glory.
He will send his angels with a loud trumpet blast. He will gather his chosen people from all four directions. He will bring them from one side of the sky to the other.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches begin to soften and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
Same same, when you see all these things happening, you know the end is near. It’s right at the door.
What I'm going to tell you is true. The people living at that time definitely wouldn't die before all these things happen.
The sky and the earth will disappear. But my words will never disappear. The day and the hour are unknown.
No one knows the day or the hour. Not even the angels in heaven know. The Son does not know. Only the Father knows.
Think about how the days of Noah were. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were getting married. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They did all these things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They did not know anything about what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. This is how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
Two men will be in the field. One will take, and the other will leave.
Two women are going to grind with the hand mill. One will be taken and the other left.
So keep your eyes awake. You never know on which day your Lord will come.
You need to understand something. Suppose the homeowner knew the time at night when the thief was going to come. At that time, he would be watching. He wouldn't have let his house be robbed.
You also have to be ready. The Son of Man will come at an hour you do not expect.
Suppose the master appoints one of his slaves as the overseer of the other slaves in his house. The duty of this slave is to give them food at the right time. The master likes a trustworthy and wise slave for this job.
It would be better for the servant if he finds the master working in his service when the master returns.
What I'm going to tell you is true. The master will make this servant responsible for everything he owns.
Let's assume that this servant is evil. He assumes to himself, "My master has been absent for a long time."
Assume he starts hitting the other servants. And assume he eats and drinks with the people who drink a lot.
The master of the servant will return on a day the servant does not expect. He will return at an hour the servant does not know.
Then the man is going to cut him into pieces. He is going to send him to the place where the protesters go. People will cry and grit their teeth.
The Story of Ten Bridesmaids
Here is how the kingdom of heaven will be at that time. Ten brides took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were virgins. Five were wise.
The fools took their lamp but did not take olive oil with them.
The wise took the oil in jars along with their lamp.
The groom did not come for a long time. Because of that, all the bridesmaids got tired and fell asleep.
In the middle of the night, someone shouted, "Here comes the groom! Go out to welcome him!"
After that, they woke up all the brides and prepared their lamps.
The ignorant said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are about to go out."
"No," they answered. "Maybe there isn't enough for all of us. Instead, go to the people who sell the oil. Buy some for yourself."
So they went to buy the oil. But on their way, the groom arrived. The girls who were present went in with him to the wedding dinner. Then the door was closed.
Afterwards, the rest of the brides also came. "Sir! Sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
As for him, he replied, "What I'm going to tell you is true. I don't know you."
So always stay alert. You never know the day or the hour the groom will arrive. The story of three workers.
Once again, Hani, I will tell you how to be the kingdom of the heavens. There was a man who was going on a journey. He sent for his servants and left them in charge of his possessions.
He gave ten thousand dollars to one. He gave four thousand dollars to another. And he gave two thousand dollars to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could manage. Then he went on his journey.
The servant who received $10,000 immediately put his money to work. He earned an additional $10,000.
Whoever has 4000 dollars earned an additional 4000 dollars.
As for the man who received 2000 dollars, he went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money in it.
After a long time, the master of servants returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 brought the second $10,000. He said: "Sir, you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I earned an additional $10,000."
His master replied to him, "You have done well, O righteous and faithful servant! You have been trustworthy with little. I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's joy!"
The man who had 4000 dollars also came. He said: "Sir, you trusted me with 4000 dollars. Look, I earned an additional 4000 dollars."
His master replied to him, "You have done well, O righteous and faithful servant! You have been trustworthy in a little. I will give you responsibility over many things. Come and share your master's joy!"
Then came the man who received 2000 dollars. He said: "Sir, I knew you were a harsh man. You harvest in places where you did not plant. You gather crops in places where you did not sow the seeds.
I was scared. I went out and buried your $2000 in the ground. Look, this is yours.
His lady replied, "Oh wicked and lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest in a place where I did not plant? You knew that I gather the crop in a place where I did not sow the seeds?
Well, I should have put my money in the bank. When I returned, I was going to return it with interest.
Then his master ordered the other servants, "Take the $2000 from him. Give it to the one who has $20,000."
Everyone has something to give. To have more than enough. And what about those who have nothing? Even those who have will have some taken from them.
Expel the worthless servant outside. He is going in the dark, people crying and grinding their teeth. 'Sheep and goats'
The Son of Man will come in all His glory. All the angels will come with Him. Then He will sit on His throne in the glory of heaven.
So that all the peoples gather before him. So that he divides the people into two groups. So that he is like the shepherd who separates the sheep from the goats.
He put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the king will talk to those on his right. He will say to them, "Father bless you. Come and take what belongs to you. This is the kingdom that has been prepared for you since the world was created.
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in.
I needed things. And you gave them to me. I was sick. And you took care of me. I was in prison. And you came to visit me.
Then the people who did the right thing to answer him. "Oh Lord," to ask him, "When did we see you hungry and give you food? When did we see you thirsty and give you a drink?
When did we see you as a stranger and force you to enter? When did we see you in need of things and not give them to you?
When did we see you sick or in prison and went to visit you?
The king was about to respond, "What I'm going to tell you is true. Anything I did for one of the least of these brothers has value; I did it for myself."
Then he says to those on his left, "You are cursed! Depart from me into the fire that burns forever. It is prepared for the devil and his angels.
I was hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I was thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not call me in. I needed clothes. But you did not give me anything. I was sick and in prison. But you did not take care of me.
And they will be told to answer, "O my Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty and not help You? When did we see You a stranger or in need of clothes or sick or in prison and not help You?"
He will say, "What I'm going to tell you is true. Anything I didn't do for one of the least important people among them, I didn't do it for me."
Afterwards, they will go on to be punished forever. But those who did what is right will receive eternal life.
The plan to kill Jesus
Jesus continued to say all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be nailed to the cross.
Afterwards, the chief priests met with the elders of the people. They gathered in the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest.
They made plans to catch Jesus in a clever way. They wanted to kill him.
But not during Eid, they said. People might cause trouble. A woman pours perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in Bethany. He was in the house of a man named Simon, who had a skin disease.
A woman came to Jesus with a sealed jar containing a very expensive perfume. She poured the perfume on his head while he was sitting at the table.
When the students saw this, they got angry. They said: "Why this talk?"
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. And the money could have been given to poor people.
Jesus was aware of this. So he said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done something very good for me.
You will always find the poor with you. But you will not always find me with you.
I poured the perfume on my body to prepare me for burial.
What I am going to tell you is true. What I did will be told everywhere this joyful news is announced throughout the whole world. It will be remembered." Judas agrees to betray Jesus.
One of the twelve went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He asked, "What will you give me if I hand over Jesus to you?" They counted out 30 silver dinars for him.
Since then, Judas had been watching for the right time to hand Jesus over to them. The Lord's Supper
It was the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus. They asked, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
He replied, "Go to the city to a certain man. Tell him, 'The teacher says, "My time is near. I will celebrate the Passover at your house with my disciples."' "
Do what the students Jesus told them to do. They prepared the Passover meal.
When evening came, Jesus was sitting with the twelve at the table.
While they were eating, he said: "What I'm going to tell you is true. One of you is going to betray me to my enemies."
The students became very sad. One after another, they started telling him, "Not me, sir, right?"
Jesus replied, "The one who has dipped his hand in the bowl with me is the one who will greet me."
The Son of Man must go as it is written about him. But how great will be the disaster for the one who betrays the Son of Man! It would have been better for him if he had never been born.
It was Judas who was going to betray him. He said, "Not me, Rabbi, right?" Jesus answered, "Yes. You."
As they were eating, Jesus took the bread. He thanked and blessed it and broke it. He gave it to his disciples and said to them, "Take this and eat it. This is my body."
Then take the cup. Thank and hand it to them. He said, "All of you drink from it."
This is the blood of the new covenant. It is poured out to forgive the sins of many people.
Here's what I'll tell you. From now on, I won't drink alcohol with you until the day I drink with you in the kingdom of Dad.
Afterwards, they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus says that Peter will fail.
Jesus said to them, "Tonight, exactly, all of you will flee from me. It is written that the Lord said, 'I will strike the shepherd. And then, the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
As for what comes after death, I will go before you to Galilee.
Peter answered, "Everyone can stay away because of you. But I will never stay away."
Jesus said: "What I am about to tell you is true. It will happen tonight, specifically. Before the rooster crows, you will say three times that you do not know me."
But Peter said, "Maybe I have to die with you. But I will never say that I do not know you." And all the other disciples said the same thing. Jesus prays in Gethsemane
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane. He said to them, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
Peter took my son Zubdi with him. He began to feel sad and worried.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sad. I feel close to death. Stay here. Watch with me."
He walked a little farther. Then he fell and his face hit the ground. He prayed, "Oh God, if possible, take this cup of suffering away from me. But let whatever you want happen, not what I want."
He came back later to his disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter: "Could you not stay awake with me for one hour?"
Watch and pray. That way you won't sin when you're tempted. The spirit is willing. But the flesh is weak.
Jesus prayed again, "Daddy, can this cup be taken away? But if I must drink it, let whatever you want happen."
Then he came back. Again, he found them sleeping. They couldn't open their eyes.
So he left them and walked away again. For the third time, he called out the same thing.
He returned to the disciples. He said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look! The hour is near. The Son of Man is about to be handed over to sinners."
People! Let's go! Here are those who are going to arrest me!" Jesus is arrested
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the twelve. He was with a large group. They were carrying swords and clubs. The chief priests and the elders of the people had sent them.
Judas, who was going to betray Jesus, arranged a signal with them. He said: "The one I kiss is the man." "Seize him."
So Judas immediately went to Jesus. He said to him, "Peace be with you, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus replied, "My friend, do what you came to do." Then the men stepped forward. They grabbed Jesus and arrested him.
At this moment, one of Jesus' friends drew his sword. They came out and struck the servant of the high priest with it. The servant's ear was cut off.
"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him. "For all who draw the sword will die by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask Dad to help me? He sends an army of more than 70,000 kings at once.
As for how the sacred books are fulfilled afterwards? They say it must happen like this.
At that time, Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I leading a band of armed men against you?" He asked. "Do you need to come out with swords and clubs to arrest me? Every day I sat in the temple courtyard teaching. And you did not seize me."
But all this happened to fulfill the words of the prophets." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus is taken to the Sanhedrin.
Those who arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest. The teachers of the law and the elders were gathered there.
Not too far away, Peter followed Jesus. He went straight to the high priest's courtyard. He entered and sat with the guards to see what was going to happen.
The chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for something to use against Jesus. They wanted to kill him.
As for not finding any evidence, despite many false witnesses coming forward. In the end, two other witnesses came forward.
They said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of my Lord. I will build it again in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up. He asked Jesus, "Aren't you going to answer? What are the charges these people are bringing against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I charge you by the living God: tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
"E. Exactly as I said," Jesus answered. "Now I tell you all. In the coming days, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One. You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes. He said, "He said something very evil about the Lord! Why do we need more witnesses? You heard him say this evil thing.
What do you think?" "He must die!" he answered.
Then they spat in his face. They hit him with their fists. Some slapped him.
They said, "Tell us, Messiah! Who struck you?" Peter says he doesn't know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came to him. She said to him, "You also were with Jesus from Galilee."
But in front of everyone, Peter said it wasn't him. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the door that leads to the courtyard. Now another woman saw him. She said to the people, "This man was with Jesus the Nazarene."
He said again that it wasn't him. And on oath, he said, "I don't know the man!"
After a while, the people standing there went to Boutros. They told him: "You must be one of them. The way you speak gives you away."
Then Peter began to curse himself. He swore and told them, "I don't know this man!" And suddenly the rooster crowed.
Then Peter thought about what Jesus had said. "The rooster will crow," Jesus told him. "Before it crows, you will say three times that you do not know me." Peter went outside. He broke down and wept.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They tied him up and took him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, who was the governor.
Judas, who betrayed him, saw that Jesus was sentenced to death. He felt great shame and sorrow for what he had done. He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
"I was wrong," he said. "I handed over a man who is not guilty." "What does it matter to us?" they answered. "That's your problem."
Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went and hanged himself.
The high priests took the money. They said, "This is against the law to put this money in the temple treasury. This is blood money. It was paid for a man's death."
They decided to use the money to buy land for burying the poor. People from other countries will be buried there.
Why is it still called the Field of Blood today?
Then the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He said, "They took the thirty pieces of silver. This price was set for him by the people of Israel.
"They used the money to buy a potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus stands before Pilate
Jesus was standing before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" "Yes. Just as I said," Jesus answered.
But when the chief priests and elders brought him to accuse him, he did not answer.
Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the accusations they are making against you?"
But Jesus did not answer, not even to a single charge. The governor was very surprised.
It was the governor's custom on Easter to release one prisoner. The people would choose the person they liked.
At that time, they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
To gather the crowd, Pilate said to them: "Who do you want me to release? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"
Pilate knew that the leaders were jealous. He knew this is why they handed Jesus over to him.
While Pilate was sitting in the judge's chair, his wife sent him a message. She said, "Don't do anything with this man. He is not guilty. I suffered a lot in a dream about him today."
As for the chief priests and the elders, they conspired together to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed.
"Which one of the two do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered him.
Pilate asked: "What should I do with the man they call the Messiah?" They all answered: "Crucify him!"
"Why? What mistake did he make?" Pilate asked. But they shouted even louder, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that it led to nothing. On the contrary, the crowd began to get angry. Because of that, he took water and washed his hands in front of them. "I am not guilty of this man's death," he said. "You are responsible for this!"
Everyone answered, "We and our children will accept the blame for his death!"
Pilate let Barabbas go free. But he took Jesus and whipped him with whips. Then he handed him over to be nailed to the cross. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers brought Jesus into the palace, which was called the Praetorium. The rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They took off his clothes and dressed him in a purple robe.
Then they wrapped the thorns together to make a crown. They put it on his head. They gave him a stick in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and laughed at him. "Hail to you, King of the Jews!" they said.
They spat on him. They hit him on the head with a stick again and again.
After they mocked him, they tore off his robe. They gave him back his clothes. Then they tied him to fix him on the cross. Jesus is fixed on the cross.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Kairouan. His name was Simon. They forced him to carry the cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha. The word Golgotha means the place of the skull.
There, they mixed the wine with bitter spices and gave it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they nailed him to the cross, they divided his clothes and cast lots.
They sat and watched him there.
Above his head, they placed the written charge against him. It was written, ~This is Jesus, King of the Jews.=
There were two thieves crucified with him. One on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by shouted at Jesus and laughed at him. They shook their heads.
And he said, "You mean to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Then go ahead! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
In the same way, the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders mocked him.
They said: "He saves others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross! Then we will believe in him."
He trusts in my Lord. My Lord will save him now if He wills. He is the one who said, "I am the son of my Lord."
In the same way, the thieves who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. Jesus dies.
From noon until three, the entire land was covered in darkness.
Around three o'clock, Jesus cried out loudly. He said, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" This means "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of the people standing there heard Jesus calling. They said, "He is calling Elijah."
At the same time, one of them ran and brought a sponge. He soaked it in wine vinegar and put it on a stick. He offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Leave him be. Let's see if Elia comes to save him."
After Jesus cried out loudly once again, he died.
At that moment, the temple curtain was torn from top to bottom. The ground shook. The rocks split.
The tulips have bloomed. Many bodies of deceased saints have come back to life.
They came out of the graves. After Jesus rose from the dead, they walked to the holy city. There, they appeared to many people.
The Roman leader and those who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and everything that happened. They were very afraid. They said, "Surely he is the Son of God!"
Not too far, many women were watching. They followed Jesus from Galilee to take care of him.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, was also present. Likewise, the mother of the sons of Zebedee. Jesus is buried.
As night approached, a rich man from the city of Arimathea came. His name was Joseph. He became one of Jesus' followers.
He went to Pilate and requested the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in fine linen cloth.
He placed it in his new grave that he had dug into the rock. He rolled a large stone in front of the entrance of the grave. Then he walked away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting in front of the tomb. The guards were at the tomb.
The next day was the day after the day of preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
Sir," they said, "we remember something this liar said while he was still alive. He said, 'After three days, I will live again.'"
Give the order to close the grave until the third day. If I don't do this, his disciples might come and steal the body. Then they will tell people that Jesus has risen from the dead. This last lie will be worse than the first.
"Take some guards with you," Pilate answered. "Go. Keep the tomb as secure as you can."
So they left and made the tomb secure. They put a seal on the stone and left some guards on duty.
Jesus rises from the dead
Saturday daytime just ended. It was dawn on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
There was a strong earthquake. The angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel walked to the tomb. He rolled the stone away and sat on it.
His body was shining like lightning. His clothes were white like snow.
The guards were so afraid of him that they trembled and became like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
The mouse is here! He got up, just as he said! Come and see the place where he was lying down.
Walk quickly! Tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there.' I told you.
So the women rushed far from the tomb. They were scared, but they were very happy. They ran to tell the students.
Suddenly, Jesus met them. He said, "Peace be with you!" They came to him, grabbed his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." The guards reported to the chief priests.
As the women were on their way, some of the guards went to the city. They told the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the high priests met with the elders, they made a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They said to the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were asleep.'"
If the governor hears about this report, we will pay him. This way, you will stay away from trouble.
The soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has spread among the Jews to this day. The last orders of Jesus to his disciples
After that, the hyenas went to the Galilean disciples. They went to the mountain that Jesus had told them about.
When they saw him, they worshiped him. But there are still those who have doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
You must go and teach the students from all nations. Baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And be confident that I am always with you, to the end.
John the Baptist prepares the way
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago the prophet Isaiah wrote, "Behold, I send my messenger before you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
A messenger calls out in the desert, "Prepare the way for the Lord. Make straight paths for Him." (Isaiah 40:3)
And so came John. He baptized people in the wilderness. And he also preached to the people that they must be baptized and turn away from their sins. Then the Lord would forgive them.
All the people from the Judean countryside went out to him. All the people from Jerusalem also went out. When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John used to wear clothes made from camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He used to eat locusts and wild honey.
This is what John was preaching. "After me, someone stronger than me will come. I cannot even stoop down to untie his sandals.
"I will baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus is baptized and tempted.
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee. John baptized him in the Jordan River.
Jesus was coming up out of the water. At that moment, he saw the heavens open. He saw the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice came from the sky. It said to him, "You are my son, and I love you. I am very happy with you."
Meanwhile, the Holy Spirit sent Jesus into the desert.
He was in the desert for 40 days. There the devil tempted him. The wild animals did not harm Jesus. The angels took care of him. Jesus chooses the first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee. He was preaching the good news of the Lord.
"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the good news!"
One day, Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting nets into the lake. They were fishermen.
Come. Follow me, Jesus said. So I will make you fishers of men.
Meanwhile, they left their window and followed him.
After that, Jesus walked a little further ahead. As he was walking, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat preparing their nets.
Meanwhile, he called them. They left their father Zubdi in the boat with the hired servants. Then they followed Jesus. Jesus casts out an evil spirit.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath day came, he went to the synagogue. There he began to teach.
People were amazed by his teaching. He taught them how someone with authority behaves. He did not talk like my Sharia teacher.
At this moment, a man in their temple shouted. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said,
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Did you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!
"Be quiet!" Jesus said firmly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it left him screaming.
Everyone was amazed. They asked each other, "What is this? New teaching! And with such great authority! Even evil spirits obey him, and they obey him."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout all of Galilee. Jesus heals many people.
Jesus walked with those from the synagogue. They immediately went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Hama Simon was lying in bed. She had a fever. They told Jesus about her.
She held her hand and helped her get up. The fever passed. Then she started taking care of them.
That evening after sunset, people brought all the sick to Jesus. They also brought all those who were possessed by demons.
All the people in the city gathered in front of the door.
Jesus healed many of them. They had all kinds of diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he did not let the demons speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prays in a quiet place.
The morning was very early and it was still dark. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his friends went looking for Jesus.
When they found him, they called out to him, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus replied, "Let's go to another place. I want to go to the nearby towns. I have to preach now as well. That's why I came."
He went throughout all Galilee. He was preaching in their synagogues. He also cast out demons. Jesus healed a man who had a skin disease.
A man who had a skin disease came to Jesus. On his knees, he asked Jesus. He said, "If you want to cleanse me, you can do it."
Jesus was filled with deep concern. He reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing; be made clean!"
At the same time, the illness left him. He recovered.
Jesus immediately expelled him. The man gave a strong warning.
"Don't say that to anyone," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded. So that it will be a testimony for the priest and for the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and started talking immediately. He spread the news to everyone. That's why Jesus could no longer enter the city openly. He would sit outside in lonely places. But people still came to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk
After a few days, Jesus returned to Capernaum. The people heard that he had come back home.
A lot of people gathered to the point that there was no space left. There wasn't even any space outside the door. And Issa preached to them with the word.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who couldn't walk.
As for those who could not get close to Jesus because of the crowd, they made a hole in the roof above Jesus. Then they lowered the man through it on a mat.
Jesus saw their faith. He said to the man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Some of the Sharia teachers were sitting there. They were thinking,
Why is this man talking like that? He is saying something very evil! Only God can forgive sins!
Meanwhile, Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Why are you thinking about these things?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Get up, take your mat and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke again to the man who could not walk.
"We tell you," he said, "get up. Take your bed and return to your home."
The man got up and took his mat. Then he walked, and everyone watched him. Everyone was amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this!" Jesus chooses Louis
Once again, Jesus went out beside the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd came to him. He began to teach them.
No matter what, Louis saw Alphonse's son. Louis was sitting in a tax booth. "Follow me," Jesus said to him. Louis got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that followed Jesus.
There were some teachers of the law who were Pharisees. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this. He said to them, "Those who are healthy do not need a doctor. The sick are the ones who need him. I did not come to call those who think they are righteous before God to follow me. I came to call sinners to follow me." They ask Jesus about fasting.
The disciples of John and the Pharisees were not eating. People came to Jesus and said to him, "John's disciples are fasting. The Pharisees' disciples are also fasting. But your disciples are not fasting. Why are they not fasting?"
Jesus answered, "How can the bridegroom's guests stay without eating while he is with them? They will not fast as long as he is with them.
The time will come when the groom will be taken from them. On that day, they will go without eating.
People do not sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothing. If they do, the new piece will pull on the old one. This will make the tear worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do this, the wine will burst the skins. Then both the wine and the skins will be ruined. No, each one should pour new wine into new skins." Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath.
On Saturday during the day, Jesus was walking with his disciples in the grain fields. The disciples began to pick some heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! This is against the law on the Sabbath. Why are your disciples doing this?"
Answer, "Have you ever read about what Dawood did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food.
At that time, Abiathar was the high priest. David entered the house of God and ate the sacred bread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it. David also gave some to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man. Man was not made for the Sabbath.
For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath day.
Healing on Saturday
Once again, Jesus went to the synagogue. There was a man whose hands were weak and crooked.
There were some Pharisees trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day.
Jesus spoke to the man whose hand was weak and crooked. He said to him: "Stand before all the people."
Jesus asked them, "What does the law say we must do on the Sabbath? Must we do good? Or must we do evil? Must we save a life? Or must we kill?" But no one answered.
Jesus looked at them with anger. He was very upset because their hearts were stubborn. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored like new.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians. They wanted to kill Jesus. The crowds followed Jesus.
Jesus walked to the Sea of Galilee with his disciples. A large crowd from Galilee followed him.
People heard about everything Jesus was doing. Many came to him. They came from Judea, Jerusalem, and Edom. They came from the lands east of the Jordan River. And they came from the region around Tyre and Sidon.
Due to the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to bring him a small boat. This would prevent people from crowding around him.
Jesus healed many people. That’s why those who were sick would push themselves to touch him.
When the people who had evil spirits saw him, they fell down before him. The spirits cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell who He was. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up on a mountain. He called certain people to come to him, and they came.
He appointed twelve of them and called them apostles. Since then, they have been with him. And he would send them out to preach.
They had the authority to cast out demons.
Jesus appointed the twelve. Simon was one of them. Jesus gave him the name Peter.
They were James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges. Boanerges means Sons of Thunder.
There were also Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James son of Alphaeus. There were also Thaddaeus and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was also one of them. He was the one who would later hand Jesus over to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebub
Jesus entered a house. Once again, a crowd gathered. It was so large that Jesus and his disciples couldn't even eat.
His family heard about this. They went to take care of him. They said, "He is crazy."
Some of the Sharia teachers were present. They came down from Jerusalem. They said, "He is possessed by Beelzebub! He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons."
Then Jesus called them and sat down to tell them stories. He said to them, "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
If a kingdom fights within its soul, it cannot stand firm.
If the family is divided, it cannot hold together.
