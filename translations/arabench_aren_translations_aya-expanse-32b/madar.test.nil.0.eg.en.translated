This is not a mathematically correct statement in Arabic, but a literal translation would be: "It is two two three ones ones." However, if we interpret it with the Arabic numbering system, it could be: "It is 22, 3, and 11." But without proper context, it's hard to give a definitive translation. In Arabic, numbers are often written and spoken in a way that can be ambiguous without context.
