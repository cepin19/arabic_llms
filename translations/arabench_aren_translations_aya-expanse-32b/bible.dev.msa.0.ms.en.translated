The genealogy of Jesus
This is the record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Abraham is the father of Isaac. Isaac is the father of Jacob. Jacob is the father of Judah and his brothers.
Judah the father of Pharez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar. Pharez the father of Hezron. Hezron the father of Aram.
Aram was the father of Aminadab, and Aminadab was the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon was the father of Salmon.
Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab. Boaz the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth. Obed the father of Jesse.
Jesse was the father of David the king. David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife.
Solomon was the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam was the father of Abijah. Abijah was the father of Asa.
Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram. Joram was the father of Uzziah.
Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. Amon was the father of Josiah.
Jeconiah the father of Shealtiel, #Jeconiah. 11:1 Another name for Jehoiachin. And his brothers. This was during the time of the exile of the children of Israel to Babylon.
After the deportation to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zerrubbabel was the father of Abiud. Abiud was the father of Eliakim. Eliakim was the father of Azor.
Azor the father of Chadad, Chadad the father of Achi, Achi the father of Eliud.
Eliezer father of Eleazar. Eleazar father of Matthan. Matthan father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary. And Mary was the mother of Jesus, who is called the Messiah.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the exile in Babylon, and fourteen generations from the exile to the Messiah. The birth of Jesus Christ
Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit.
But Yusuf, her husband, was a good man and did not want to expose her, so he decided to leave her quietly.
And while Joseph was pondering these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."
This happened in order to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through the prophet:
Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel, which means: "God with us."
When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took his wife into his house.
But he did not know her until she gave birth to the child whom he named "Jesus."
Wise men from the East
Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,
And they said, "Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
So when King Herod heard this, he was perturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
So Herod summoned the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
They said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:
"You, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times."
Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them the exact time when the star had appeared.
Then he sent them to the town of Bethlehem, saying, "Go and search for the child. When you find him, tell me, so that I too may come and worship him."
Then the wise men listened to the king and went their way. And behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, until it came and stood over the place where the Child was.
So they were overjoyed when they saw the star.
So they went and found the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Then God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod, so they traveled to their homeland by another route. The flight into Egypt
And when the wise men had departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child to kill him."
So Joseph got up and took the child and his mother by night, and departed for Egypt.
And he remained there until the death of Herod. This happened that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, "Out of Egypt I called my son." #My_son. 15:2 From the book of Hosea 11:1. Herod kills the children of Bethlehem.
When Herod realized that he had been deceived by the wise men, he became furious. He gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and all the surrounding regions who were two years old and under, according to the time that he had learned from the wise men.
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying:
A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and great mourning. It is the voice of Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted, because they are dead. - Return from Egypt
After the death of Herod, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream in Egypt.
And he said to him, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead."
So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over the region of Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And after being warned in a dream, he went to the region of Galilee,
And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene. #Nazarene. 23:2 Named after the city of Nazareth. It also resembles the Hebrew word for "branch" in Isaiah 11:1, referring to the promise of the coming of the Messiah from the line of David.
John the Baptist
In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
And he was saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
And this John is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke when he said, "A voice of one crying out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.'"
John wore clothes made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
At that time, all the people began to come to him from Jerusalem and all the region of Judea and from the district beyond the Jordan to hear him.
And he baptized them in the Jordan River after they confessed their sins.
When John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Bear fruit that proves your repentance.
Do not boast about having Abraham as your ancestor. I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
Here is the axe laid to the root of the trees. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
"I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to remove his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
He will take the chaff in his hand, and will clear his threshing floor; he will gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire." - The Baptism of Jesus
Then Jesus came from the region of Galilee to the Jordan River, wanting to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and yet you are coming to me?"
Jesus replied, "Let it be so now, for it is proper for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented to baptize him.
So Jesus came and was baptized. As he came up out of the water, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.
And a voice from heaven said, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased."
The translation of "تجربة يسوع" into English is "The Temptation of Jesus." Here's a breakdown: - تجربة (Tajriba) means "temptation" or "trial." - يسوع (Yasu') means "Jesus."
And Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
After fasting forty days and forty nights, Jesus was hungry.
Then the tempter came to him—it is written #the tempter. 3:4 that is, Satan—and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become loaves of bread."
But Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"
Then Satan took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
And he said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Jesus answered him, "It is also written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
Then Satan took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
Then he said to him, "I will give you all these if you worship me."
Then Jesus said to him, "Go away, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and serve him only.'"
Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came to him and served him. Jesus begins his ministry in Galilee.
And when Jesus heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee.
But he did not stay in Nazareth. Instead, he went and lived in the town of Capernaum by the Sea of Galilee in the regions of Zebulun and Naphali.
This happened to fulfill what God had spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
"The land of Zebulun and Naphtali, the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan, in Galilee of the nations."
The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; those living in the land of the shadow of death, a light has shone upon them.
From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses some of His disciples.
As Jesus was walking along the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
So he said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men."
So they left their nets at once and followed him.
Then Jesus went from there, and saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. He called them.
So they left the boat and their father immediately and followed him. Jesus teaches and heals.
Jesus was traveling throughout every city and village of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. And he was healing every disease and every affliction among the people.
And the news about him spread throughout all Syria. And they brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and pains, those possessed by demons, the epileptic, and the paralyzed, and he healed them.
And a great multitude followed him from the region of Galilee, and from the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from the region of Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.
The translation of "تعليم يسوع" from Arabic to English is "The Teaching of Jesus."
When Jesus saw the crowds, He went up on the mountain; and after He sat down, His disciples came to Him.
And he began to speak to them and say:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. #They shall inherit the earth. 5:5 See Psalm 37:11. Here, inheritance might refer to a future spiritual inheritance.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. #For they will be filled. 6:5 Literally: "for righteousness." For God will satisfy them.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven. For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you. Salt and light.
"You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its taste, with what can it be seasoned? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.
People don't light a lamp and put it under a bowl! Instead, they put it on a stand and light it so that it gives light to everyone in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. - Jesus and the Law of Moses
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
Truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.
Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
For I say to you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Wrath.
You know that it was said to your fathers, 'Do not murder,' and 'Whoever murders shall be liable to judgment.' (Exodus 20:13, Deuteronomy 5:17)
But I tell you that anyone who is angry with another will be liable to judgment; and anyone who insults another will be brought before the council; and anyone who says to another, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the hell of fire.
"Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,"
So leave your gift there before the altar and go. First, make peace with your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
"Quickly make peace with your adversary as you go with him to court, or he will deliver you to the judge, and the judge will deliver you to the jailer, and you will be thrown into prison.
I'll tell you the truth, you won't get out of there until you pay the last penny. Bastards.
You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' #Do not commit adultery. Exodus 20:14, Deuteronomy 5:18.
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
Therefore, if your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you; for it is better for you to lose one of your members, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
It was also said: 'When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a certificate of divorce.' #When a man divorces ... therefore. Deuteronomy 24:1.
But I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
You have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, "Do not swear falsely, but fulfill the oaths you have made to the Lord." #Do not break your oath ... to the Lord. 33:5 See Leviticus 19:12, Numbers 30:2, and Deuteronomy 23:21.
But I say to you, do not swear at all.
Do not swear by heaven, for it is the throne of God, nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet, #his footstool. 35:5 That is, under his authority. Nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
Do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.
"If you want to say 'yes,' say 'yes.' If you want to say 'no,' say 'no.' Anything beyond that comes from the evil one." #TheEvilOne. 37:5 #Devil #ResistEvil
"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' #The_eye ... for a tooth. 38:5 From the Book of Exodus 21:24 and the Book of Leviticus 24:20.
As for me, I say: Do not resist evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to him as well.
If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat as well.
If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles.
If anyone asks you for something, give it to them. Do not refuse to lend to those who ask you. Love everyone.
"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' #Love ... your enemy. 43:5 From the Book of Leviticus 19:18.
As for me, I say to you: Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute you.
So be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. For He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
If you love only those who love you, what reward do you deserve? Even tax collectors do the same, don't they?
If you only greet your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
The translation of "العطاء" into English is "giving" or "generosity."
Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them; otherwise, you will have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.
"When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be praised by people. I tell you the truth, they have already received their reward in full."
But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
"So give your charitable gifts in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you." - Matthew 6:4 (New International Version)
"When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray in the synagogues and at the street corners to be seen by people. I tell you the truth, they have already received their reward."
But when you pray, go into your room, close your door, and pray to your Father in secret. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
When you pray, do not babble as the pagans do, for they think that by their many words they will be heard.
Therefore do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
Therefore pray like this: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil." (#evil 13:6) Satan (Devil). "For yours is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, forever and ever. Amen."
For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses. —Matthew 6:15
"When you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by men. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,
So that people do not notice that you are fasting. Your Father, whom you do not see, sees it. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. God or money
"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
No one can serve two masters. For either he will hate one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth. #Wealth. 24:6 Literally "Mammon," an Aramaic word meaning "wealth," here representing a deity whom people serve instead of God. The Kingdom of God first.
Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?
"Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?"
Which one of you can add a single hour to your life by worrying?
"And why do you worry about what you will wear? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them.
But I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.
"If God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?"
Therefore do not worry, saying, "What will we eat?" or "What will we drink?" or "What will we wear?"
For these are the things that the Gentiles of the world seek after, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
Do not worry about tomorrow, for each day has enough trouble of its own. Tomorrow will have its own worries.
Judging others
Do not judge others, lest God judge you.
For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you.
Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye, but do not notice the great beam in your own eye?
And how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when there is a log in your own eye?
You hypocrite! First, remove the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Persistent asking.
Ask and you shall receive, seek and you shall find, knock and the door will be opened to you.
For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, it will be opened.
"If any of you asks for bread, does he give him a stone?"
Or if he asks for a fish, will you give him a live one?
You, evil as you are, know how to give good gifts to your children. So will not the Father who is in heaven much more give good things to those who ask him? The Golden Rule
"So as you would like others to treat you, so you should treat them. This is the sum of the law of Moses and the teaching of the prophets. The way to heaven and the way to hell."
Enter through the narrow gate that leads to heaven, for the gate that leads to destruction is wide and the road is easy, and many enter through it.
But the gate that leads to life is very narrow, and the road to it is full of difficulties, and only a few find this way. A warning against false teachings.
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes, nor figs from thistles!
Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Therefore you will know them by their fruits.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'
Then I will say to them plainly, 'I never knew you. Depart from me, you workers of iniquity.' The wise man and the foolish man.
"Everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.
And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
So the rain fell, and the flood came, and the wind blew and beat on that house; and it fell, and great was its fall."
When Jesus had finished speaking, the people were amazed at his teaching.
For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
Jesus cleanses a leper.
Then Jesus went down from the mountain, and many followed Him.
And a leper came to him and bowed down before him, saying, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean."
Then Jesus reached out his hand and touched him. "I do want to," he said. "Be clean." Immediately the leprosy left him.
Then Jesus said to him, "See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof to the people." (4:8) The priest was the one who, according to the law, determined when a leper was considered clean. And offer the gift that Moses commanded, so that the people may know that you have been healed. #FaithOfARomanCenturion
And Jesus came to the city of Capernaum. Then a Roman centurion came to Him. #Roman centurion. 5:8 Literally, "centurion." Repeated in verses 8, 13.
He said, "Sir, my servant is very sick, bedridden at home. He is immobile and in great pain."
So Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."
The officer replied, "Sir, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof; just say the word, and my servant will be healed."
For I myself am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who followed him, "I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with such faith."
I tell you, many will come from east and west and sit at table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
But those who were meant to inherit the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness. There, weeping and gnashing of teeth will take place!
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go, and let it be done for you as you have believed." And at that very moment his servant was healed. "He took our illnesses."
When Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a high fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
That evening many demon-possessed people were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
This happened to fulfill what God said through the prophet Isaiah: "He took our infirmities and carried our diseases." Following Jesus.
When Jesus saw the large crowd around Him, He gave orders to His disciples to go to the other side of the lake.
Then one of the scribes came and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
So Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus Calms the Storm
And Jesus got into the boat, and his disciples followed him.
Then a fierce storm swept over the lake, and the waves crashed against the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
So they came to him and woke him, saying, "Master, master, we are perishing!"
Then Jesus said to them, "Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?" Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
But they were amazed and asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!" Jesus drove out a demon from a man who had been possessed by two demons.
Then Jesus arrived at the region of the Gadarenes on the other side of the lake. Two men possessed by evil spirits came out from the tombs to meet him. They were so dangerous that no one dared to travel that way.
And the unclean spirits cried out, saying, "What have we to do with thee, Son of God? Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?"
And a great herd of swine was feeding on the other side of the mountain.
The evil spirits begged him, saying, "If you cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Then Jesus said, "Go." The demons came out of the men and went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
So the shepherds fled to the town and told the people what had happened to those possessed by evil spirits.
So all the people of the town came out to see Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a paralytic.
So Jesus got into a boat and crossed over and came to his own town.
Then some people brought to him a paralytic lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
So some of the scribes said, "This man is blaspheming."
So Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?"
Which is easier to say: "Your sins are forgiven" or "Get up and walk"?
But I will show you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat, and go to your home!"
So he got up and went home.
When the people saw this, they were filled with awe; and they praised God, who had given such authority to men. (Matthew 9:8) Note: The original Arabic text you provided seems to be a verse from the Bible, specifically from the Gospel of Matthew. The translation maintains the same formatting and structure as the original.
As Jesus passed by, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. Jesus said to him, "Follow me!" And he got up and followed him.
While he was eating in the house of Matthew, tax collectors and many sinners came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
So go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.” — Matthew 9:13 (quoting Hosea 6:6). **Question about Fasting:**
Then John's disciples came and asked him, "How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
So Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast."
"No one tears a patch of new cloth from an old garment, for then the new cloth would tear away from the old garment, and the tear would be worse."
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will spill, and the skins will be ruined. Instead, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved." Jesus Raises a Dead Girl // Heals a Bleeding Woman
As Jesus was speaking, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him and said, "My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live."
So Jesus went with him. And a large crowd followed him and crowded around him.
And there was a woman who had been suffering from a severe hemorrhage for twelve years. She came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his cloak.
For she said within herself, "If only I touch his garment, I will be made well."
Then Jesus turned around, saw her, and said, "Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well." And the woman was healed instantly.
When Jesus arrived at the house of the synagogue leader, he saw the mourners wailing, and he said, "Go away; the girl is not dead but sleeping."
He said, "Go outside. The girl is not dead; she is sleeping." And they laughed at him.
And when the people had gone out of the house, Jesus entered the room and took her by the hand, and she arose.
The news about Jesus spread throughout that whole region. Jesus heals two blind men // and casts out an evil spirit.
And after Jesus had left that place, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Son of David, have mercy on us."
When Jesus entered the house, the two blind men came to him, and he asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to heal you?" They answered, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith let it be done to you."
And the two blind men received their sight. Then Jesus sternly warned them, "See that no one knows about this."
But they went and spread the news throughout that whole region.
As they were going along, some people brought a man who was demon-possessed and could not speak to Jesus.
Then Jesus commanded the unclean spirit to leave, and it departed from him. The mute man began to speak, and the people were amazed, saying, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees began to say, "He casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus was going through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom. He was healing every disease and every weakness among the people.
When Jesus saw the crowds, He had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
So Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
They were asking the Lord of the harvest to send out harvesters into his harvest.
Jesus sends his disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and over every disease and every sickness, to heal them.
And these are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
Phillips and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus,
Simon, also called "the Zealot," 4:10 was a member of a Jewish political party that resisted Roman rule, known as the Zealots. Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus, was also a Zealot.
Jesus sent out the twelve and instructed them as follows: "Do not go into any non-Jewish region, and do not enter any Samaritan town.
But go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
And they preached that the kingdom of heaven was at hand.
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. You received without paying, give without being paid.
Do not carry in your belts gold or silver or copper coins,
Do not carry a bag or extra garment, or extra shoes, or a walking stick. For the worker deserves his food.
"When you enter any city or village, look for a person who deserves to receive you, and stay with them until you leave the city.
And when you enter a house, greet its people.
If the household is worthy, your peace will come upon them. If they are not worthy, your peace will return to you.
If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your message, leave that home or town, and shake the dust off your feet.
Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that city. Jesus warns of tribulations.
Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
Beware of people, for they will hand you over to the courts and flog you in their synagogues.
And you will be handed over to authorities and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.
And when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say, for you will be given the words at that hour.
Remember, it is not you who will speak, but the Spirit of your Father who will speak in you.
"Brother will give up brother to death, and father will give up son. Children will rise up against their parents and kill them."
And everyone will hate you because of my name, but he who endures to the end will be saved.
When they persecute you in one town, flee to another. I tell you the truth, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
No student is better than his teacher, nor is any servant greater than his master.
Let the disciple be content to be like his teacher, and the slave to be like his master. If they call the head of the house Beelzebul, #Beelzebul. Matt. 25:10 One of the names of the devil. See Matt. 9:34. what will they not call the rest of the household? Fear God, not people.
So do not fear them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known.
So whatever I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light, and whatever you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops.
"Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell."
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father's care.
As for you, even the hairs on your head are all numbered.
So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.
"Everyone who acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.
"Whoever denies me before others, I will deny before my Father in heaven." - Jesus Christ
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword!
I came: "A man should not be divided against his father, nor a daughter against her mother, nor a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law."
So it is that man's enemies are his own family!
"For whoever loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
"And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
Whoever tries to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it.
"Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
For he who welcomes a prophet because he is a prophet, will receive a prophet's reward. And he who welcomes a righteous person because he is righteous, will receive the reward of the righteous.
"And whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of my little disciples, because he is my disciple, I tell you the truth, he will certainly not lose his reward."
John the Baptist, not Jesus.
And when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities in the region of Galilee. Jesus and John the Baptist
While John the Baptist was in prison, he heard about all that Christ was doing, so he sent a message with some of his disciples.
And he asked him, "Are you the one we have been expecting, or should we look for another?"
Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you have seen and heard:
Here is the translation: "And the blind receive sight, and the lame walk, and the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them."
"And blessed is he who does not hesitate to believe in me."
When John's disciples had left, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John, saying, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
Why then did you go out? To see a man in soft clothing? Those who wear soft clothing are in the kings' palaces.
So why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes. But I tell you, you saw more than a prophet. Indeed, I say to you, among those born of women, there has not arisen one greater than John the Baptist.
This is what he wrote: "Behold, I send my messenger before you, who will prepare your way before you."
"I tell you the truth, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
From the time of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence, and violent people have been trying to seize it by force.
For the law was given through Moses, and grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
If you wish to accept what the prophets and the scripture say, then John is the Elijah who they prophesied would come. #Elijah ... his coming. 14:11 Elijah was one of God's prophets around 850 BC. The Jews expected his coming based on Malachi 4:5-6.
"He who has ears, let him hear."
What does this generation resemble? It resembles children sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to their playmates and saying:
We piped unto you, and ye danced not; we mourned to you, and ye lamented not!
For John came neither eating nor drinking like the others, and they said, "He has a demon."
Then the Son of Man came eating and drinking wine, like the others, and people said about him, ‘Look at this man! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is proved right by its fruits.” Jesus warns the sinful cities.
Then Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent of their sins.
And he said, "Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades! For if the miracles had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained until this day.
But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. Jesus is the source of comfort.
At that time, Jesus spoke and said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father, because you enjoyed doing that.
The Father has given all things into the Son's hands. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you #my_yoke. 29:11 The yoke is a wooden tool placed on animals to help them carry heavy loads, and it is a Jewish symbol of the law. Learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
"For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."
Jesus: Lord of the Sabbath
At that time, Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and they began to pick and eat the heads of grain.
But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, "Behold, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those with him?"
He entered the house of God and ate the loaves of bread presented to God, even though it was not lawful for him or those with him to eat that bread, but only for the priests.
Have you not read in the law of Moses how the priests on the Sabbath do not keep the Sabbath law, and yet they are not guilty of breaking the Sabbath?
But I tell you, there is something greater than the temple here.
"If you had known what this scripture means: 'I desire mercy, not animal sacrifices,' you would not have condemned those innocent people." - Hosea 6:6 (NLT)
For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath." Mark 2:28
Then he left that place and went to their assembly.
And there was a man there with a withered hand. So they asked Jesus, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" They asked him this so that they might accuse him.
So he said to them, "If one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?
Man is more important than the sheep. Therefore, doing good on the Sabbath is in accordance with the law.
Then Jesus said to the man with the paralyzed hand, "Stretch out your hand." He did, and his hand was completely restored, just like his other hand.
So the Pharisees went out and began to plot how they might kill Jesus. Jesus: Servant of God Chosen
So Jesus, knowing their intentions, departed from there. And a great crowd followed Him, and He healed them all.
And he commanded them that they should not make him known.
This happened to fulfill what God had spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
Here is my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
No one will contend, or cry out, and no one will hear their voice in their streets.
Not even the bent reed will he break, Nor will he quench the smoking wick. He will faithfully bring justice to all.
"And every nation will place their hope in him." - The authority of Jesus.
Then they brought to him a man who was blind and mute, possessed by a demon. He healed him, so that the mute man could both speak and see.
And the people were amazed, and said, "Can this be the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons only by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil drives out spirits and fights against himself, how can his kingdom stand?
"So if I drive out demons by the power of Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? Therefore they will be your judges."
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
How can anyone enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.
"He who is not with me is against me. And he who does not gather with me scatters."
That is why I tell you: Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. The fruit reveals the truth."
To get good fruit, plant a good tree. A bad tree gives you bad fruit. For the tree is known by its fruit.
You brood of vipers, how can you speak good things when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. A good man brings good things out of a good treasure, and an evil man brings evil things out of evil treasure.
But I tell you that on the day of judgment people will have to give account for every idle word they speak.
"And your words will determine your innocence or guilt." The Jewish leaders demanded evidence.
Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He answered them, "This generation is an evil and adulterous generation. They seek a sign, but no sign will be given to them except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
Just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
"And the queen of the south will stand #Queen of the South. 42:12 The Queen of Sheba. She traveled nearly 2,000 kilometers to hear the wisdom of God from the mouth of King Solomon. See 1 Kings 10:1-13. On the day of judgment against this generation, she will condemn it. For she came from the ends of the earth to hear Solomon's wisdom. And now, here before you, is one greater than Solomon. The empty soul."
"When an unclean spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest but does not find it.
Then he says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' And he goes and finds the house empty, swept, and put in order.
Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there. And the last state of that person becomes worse than the first. So it will be with this evil generation." The disciples of Jesus are his family.
While Jesus was speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers arrived and stood outside, asking for him.
Then one said to Jesus, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak with you."
Then Jesus answered and said, "Who is My mother and who are My brothers?"
Then he pointed to his disciples and said, "These are my mother and my brothers.
For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.”
Like seeds.
On that day, Jesus left the house and sat by the lakeside.
So large a crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while the people stood on the shore.
And he said to them, "Many things have been given to you in parables. For to you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God, but for others they are in parables, so that 'seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.'
While he was sowing, some seeds fell by the wayside, and the birds came and ate them.
Some of the seed fell on rocky ground, where there was not much soil, and it grew quickly because the soil was not deep.
But when the sun rose, it scorched, and because it had no roots, it withered.
And some fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked it.
Other seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop—some a hundred times more, some sixty times more, some thirty times more.
"He who has ears, let him hear." - Hearing and understanding
And the disciples came and asked him, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
Jesus answered them, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given."
For whoever has, more will be given to him, and he will have an abundance. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.
Therefore I speak to them in parables, for seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.
And so the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled in them: "You will indeed hear, but you will not understand; you will indeed see, but you will not perceive."
For the mind of this people has become dull, and their hearing has become heavy; they have closed their eyes, so that they may not see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn, and be healed."
But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
Verily I say unto you, Many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them. The meaning of the parable of the sower.
So listen to the parable of the sower.
When a person hears the message of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one (#the_evil_one) comes, 19:13 that is, the devil (also in verse 38), and takes away the seeds that were sown in his heart. This is the meaning of the seeds that fell by the wayside.
But that which fell on the rocky ground, these are the ones who, when they hear, receive the word with joy.
But because he has no root in himself, he endures for a while; and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away.
But that which fell into the thorns, these are they who hear the word, but the cares of life and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
But as for that which fell on the good soil, these are the ones who, when they have heard the word, receive it with joy, and bear fruit, one thirty, one sixty, and one a hundredfold. Like wheat and weeds.
And he told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
But while everyone was sleeping, the man's enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and then went away.
And when the wheat sprouted and formed heads, the weeds also sprouted.
So his servants came to him, and said to him, "Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?"
The man answered, "My enemy did this." His servants asked him, "Shall we go and pull it up?"
The man replied, "No, because when you pull up the weeds, you might pull up the wheat with them.
Let both grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the harvesters: 'First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned, but then gather the wheat and store it in my barn.' " Examples are mustard and yeast.
Then Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.
It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree so big that birds come and nest in its branches."
He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until all the dough had risen."
Jesus spoke all these things to the multitude in parables; and without a parable he did not speak to them.
For this is what God says through the prophet: "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things from when the world was created."
Then Jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field."
He said to them, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man,
The field is the world, and the good seeds are those who have the kingdom. The weeds are those who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sowed them is Satan. The harvest is the end of the world. And the harvesters are the angels.
"Just as weeds are gathered and burned in the fire, so will be the end of the world."
For the Son of Man will send His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and those who practice lawlessness,
Then they throw them into the blazing oven. There people weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear. Parables of the treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. A man found it, hid it again, and in his joy went and sold everything he had and bought that field.
The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of beautiful pearls.
And when he found a pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had and bought it. Like a fishing net.
The kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered fish of different kinds.
When the net was full, the fishermen pulled it to the shore. Then they sat down and started to sort the fish, putting the good ones in baskets and throwing away the bad ones.
This is what will happen at the end of the world: the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous.
Then the wicked are thrown into the blazing furnace. There people weep and gnash their teeth.
Jesus asked his disciples, "Do you understand all these things?" They replied, "Yes."
He said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old." Jesus Goes to His Hometown
When Jesus had finished telling these parables, he left that place.
When he came to his hometown, he began to teach them in their synagogue. Everyone was amazed and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these miracles?
Isn't he the son of the carpenter? Isn't his mother called Mary? Aren't his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Don't all his sisters live among us? So where did he get all that he has?
So it became a stumbling block to them, preventing them from accepting him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home."
He did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.
Herod hears about Jesus.
At that time, Herod the tetrarch of Galilee heard about Jesus. 1:14 Literally, "tetrarch." The Romans had divided Palestine into four tetrarchies, so the ruler of each tetrarchy was called a tetrarch or ruler of the fourth part. See the Gospel of Luke 3:1.
So he said to his servants, "It is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him." The Death of John the Baptist
It was Herod who had John arrested and imprisoned, because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
For John had said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
That is why Herod wanted to kill him, but he feared the people, for they regarded John as a prophet.
But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before him and his guests; and the king was very pleased with her.
He even promised and swore to give her whatever she asked for, no matter what.
But her mother had instructed her what to ask, and she said, "Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter."
So the king was grieved, but because of his oath and for the sake of his guests, he ordered that her request be granted.
So he sent someone to cut off John's head in prison.
Then he brought his head on a platter and gave it to her, and she gave it to her mother.
Then John's disciples came and took away his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus what had happened. Jesus Feeds More Than Five Thousand
When Jesus heard this, he got into a boat and went to a secluded place. The crowds, when they heard this, followed him on foot from their towns.
And when he went ashore, he saw a large crowd, and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
In the evening, his disciples came to him and said, "This is a desolate place, and the time is already late. Send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves."
But Jesus said to them, "They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat."
So his disciples said to him, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish here."
So Jesus said to them, "Bring her to me."
And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass. Then Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. And he gave them to his disciples, and the disciples gave them to the multitude.
So they ate and were satisfied, and the leftover fragments were picked up, twelve baskets full.
And they that did eat were about five thousand men, beside women and children. Jesus walks on water.
Then Jesus asked His disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, while He sent the crowd away.
And after sending them away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.
The boat was already in the middle of the lake, and the waves were crashing against it violently, because the wind was blowing against the boat's direction.
And just before dawn Jesus came to them, walking on the lake.
When his disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified and said, "It's a ghost!" and they cried out in fear.
So at once Jesus said to them, "Take heart, it is I; do not be afraid."
Then Peter answered him, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water."
And he said to him, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and went toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid and began to sink, and cried out, "Lord, save me!"
Then Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, saying, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
And when Jesus and Peter got into the boat, the wind ceased.
And those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus and said, "Truly you are the Son of God." Jesus healed many.
When they had crossed the lake, they came to the region of the Gerasenes.
When the people of that region recognized Jesus, they proclaimed His arrival throughout the surrounding area. They brought to Him all who were sick,
And they begged him to let them just touch the hem of his garment. And all who touched him were healed.
The law of God and the traditions of men
Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked him,
Why do your students break the traditions we inherited from our ancestors? They don't wash their hands before eating.
Jesus answered them, "Why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?"
For God commanded and said, "Honor your father and your mother," #Honor ... your mother. 4:15 From the Book of Exodus 20:12 and Deuteronomy 5:16. And He said, "Whoever curses his father or mother shall be put to death." #Whoever curses ... shall be put to death. 4:15 From the Book of Exodus 21:17.
But you say, 'If anyone declares to his father or mother: "What you would have me give you is given to God," he is not to honor his father or mother.'
And thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition.
You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you, saying:
This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
Their worship is useless, for they teach doctrines that are nothing but human commandments.
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand this..."
Not what goes into the mouth defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person.
Then his disciples came and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?"
Jesus answered them, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up."
Leave them alone; they are blind guides leading the blind. And if a blind person leads another blind person, both will fall into a pit.
Then Peter said, "Explain this parable to us."
Then Jesus said, "Do you still not understand?"
Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth of a man goes into the stomach, and is eliminated?
But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person.
For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander.
These are the things that make a person unclean. But eating with unwashed hands does not make a person unclean." Jesus helps a stranger woman.
And Jesus left that place and went into the region of Tyre and Sidon.
And a Canaanite woman from that region came to him, crying out, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon and is suffering terribly."
But Jesus did not answer a word. His disciples came to him and pleaded with him, "Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us."
He said, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
But the woman came and knelt before him and said, "Lord, help me."
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs."
She said, "True, sir, but even dogs eat what falls from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus Heals Many
And Jesus left that place and went to the region near the Sea of Galilee. He went up on a hill and sat down there.
Then large crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others. They placed them at Jesus' feet, and he healed them.
The crowds were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the lame walking, the paralyzed healed, and the blind seeing. They praised the God of Israel. Jesus feeds more than four thousand.
Then Jesus called his disciples and said, "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may faint on the way."
So his disciples said to him, "Where will we get enough bread to feed all these people in such a desolate place?"
Then Jesus asked them, "How many loaves do you have?" They answered, "Seven, and a few small fish."
So Jesus had the people sit down on the ground.
And he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they distributed them to the people.
So they all ate and were satisfied. Then the disciples gathered up the broken pieces, and there were seven baskets full.
And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
And when Jesus had dismissed the multitudes, He went up into a boat and came to the region of Magdala.
The Jewish leaders examine Jesus.
And the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him, asking him to show them a sign from heaven.
Jesus answered them, "At evening you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'
In the early morning, you say, "Today will be stormy, for the sky is red and sullen." You are good at interpreting weather signs, but you are not good at understanding the times in which you live!
This evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And He left them and went away. (Matthew 16:4, ESV) (Note: The phrase "عدم الفهم" at the end of your text translates to "lack of understanding" in English, but since it's not clear if it's part of the quote or a separate comment, I've kept it separate.)
Jesus' disciples went to the other side of the lake, but they forgot to bring bread.
Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
So the disciples began to discuss among themselves, "But we don't have any bread!"
Jesus knew what they were saying, and he said to them, "You of little faith, why are you arguing among yourselves about having no bread?"
Have you not yet understood? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered from the fragments?
Do you not remember the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered from the fragments?
"Why don't you understand that I wasn't talking to you about regular bread, but I was warning you to guard yourselves from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
Then his disciples understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter confesses that Jesus is the Christ
When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that I, the Son of Man, am?"
His disciples asked him, "Then who are you? Are you Elijah?"
And he said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
So Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.
And I say to you that you are Peter, #Peter. 18:16 From the Greek "Petros," meaning "rock." And on this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of Hades, #Gates_of_Hades. 18:16 That is, the power of death. Shall not prevail against it.
And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Then he strictly warned his disciples that they should tell no one that he was the Christ. Jesus speaks about the necessity of his death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.
But Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you!"
Then Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to come with me, they must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me."
For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it.
What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, yet loses his soul? What can a man give in exchange for his soul?
For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.
Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Jesus, with Moses and Elijah.
After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John, and led them up to a high mountain by themselves.
While they were there, the appearance of Jesus changed; he began to shine like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.
Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared before the disciples and were speaking with Jesus.
And Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
As Peter was speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were terrified and fell to the ground with their faces down.
So Jesus came and touched them and said, “Rise, have no fear.”
And when they looked around, they saw no one but Jesus.
As they came down from the mountain, Jesus instructed them, "Do not tell anyone about what you have seen until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
And his disciples asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?" #Elijah ... First. 10:17 Elijah was one of God's prophets around 850 BC. The Jews expected his coming based on Malachi 4:5-6.
Jesus replied, "Yes, Elijah is coming to restore all things."
But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands."
Then his disciples understood that he was speaking of John the Baptist. Jesus casts out an evil spirit from a boy.
And when they had returned to the multitude, a man came to Jesus and fell on his knees before him.
He said, "Have mercy on my son, O Lord, for he is epileptic and suffers greatly. He often falls into fire or water.
And He brought him to His disciples, but they could not heal him."
Then Jesus said, "O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you?" And He said to the man, "Bring your son here."
So Jesus commanded the unclean spirit to come out of him. And it came out of him immediately.
Then his disciples came to him privately and asked, "Why could we not cast it out?"
Jesus answered them, "Because of your little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
But this kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting." Jesus foretells His approaching death.
As they were walking along in Galilee, Jesus said to his disciples, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men.
And they will kill him. But on the third day he will rise again." The disciples were very saddened. Temple tax
When Jesus entered Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma tax came to Peter and said, "Does your teacher not pay the two-drachma tax?"
So Peter answered him, "Yes, we pay." And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes, from their children or from strangers?"
Then Peter answered and said to Him, "Explain this parable to us." So Jesus said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old."
But lest we cause them any trouble, go to the lake and cast your line. Then take the first fish you catch and open its mouth. You will find a four-drachma coin inside it. Take it and give it to them for me and for yourself."
