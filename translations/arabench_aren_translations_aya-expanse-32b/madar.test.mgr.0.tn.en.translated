"Y'all write." or "You all write." (The exact translation depends on the context, but "y'all" is a Southern US English pronoun equivalent to "you all".) Note: The input text seems to be in a mix of Arabic and a dialectal form, where "يعيشك" is Arabic for "long live" or "may you live", but it's not clear how it fits in the sentence. It might be a command or an encouragement to write, but the direct translation doesn't make perfect sense in English without additional context.

"Kafkayef" does not translate directly into English as it appears to be a made-up or slang term in Arabic. However, it seems to be a combination of two words: "Kafka," which is the name of the famous writer Franz Kafka, and "kayef," which could be a colloquial form of "mufajja'a," meaning "tortured" or "afflicted." So, a possible interpretation in English could be: "Kafka-like" or "Kafkaesque," referring to the themes of torture, alienation, and bureaucratic absurdity often found in Kafka's works.

Note: "Tanner" is an old-fashioned term for a sixpence coin, which was worth 5 cents in the context of the British pre-decimalisation currency system. However, in modern English, it's not commonly used and the term "sixpence" would be more familiar. The translation maintains the original wording for the sake of accuracy but be aware that the word "tanner" might not be readily understood by native English speakers today.
The Arabic phrase "لاعشية عيشك" translates to "May your life be without evening" in English. However, this is a poetic or literary expression and might not make literal sense in everyday English.
