The genealogy of Jesus Christ (Luke 3:23-38)
This is the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:
Abraham begat Isaac. And Isaac begat Jacob. And Jacob begat Judah and his brethren.
And Judah begat Pharez and Zerah of Tamar; and Pharez begat Hezron; and Hezron begat Aram.
And Aramm begat Aminadab. And Aminadab begat Nahshon. And Nahshon begat Salmon.
And Salmon begat Booz of Rahab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse.
And Jesse begot David the king. After this, David begot Solomon from the woman whom Uriah had taken.
And Solomon fathered Rehoboam, and Rehoboam fathered Abijah, and Abijah fathered Asa.
And Asa begat Jehoshaphat. And Jehoshaphat begat Joram. And Joram begat Uzziah.
And Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah.
And Hezekiah begot Manasseh, and Manasseh begot Amon, and Amon begot Josiah.
And Josiah took Keniah and his brothers when the Jews were exiled to Babylon.
After the exile in Babylon was over, Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel.
And Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor.
Uzzur begat Zadok. Zadok begat Achime. Achime begat Eliud.
And Eliud begat Eleazar. And Eleazar begat Matthan. And Matthan begat Jacob.
And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
And so there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the deportation to Babylon, and fourteen generations from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah. The birth of Jesus Christ (Luke 2:1-7)
Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit.
My brother, Youssef decided to break up with her to stay away from her without disgracing her, because he was a pious man.
And he was still pondering these things when an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
"You are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."
And all of this happened in fulfillment of the speech of Allah, which He conveyed through the Prophet who said:
# Isaiah 7:14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. (Which means 'God with us')
And when Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took his wife to his house.
But he did not sleep with her until she gave birth to a son, and he called his name Jesus.
The judgment of the wise.
When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They said, "Where is the king of the Jews who has been born? For we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was perturbed, as was all Jerusalem.
And the chief priests and the scribes sought where the Christ would be born.
They answered him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:
# Micah 5:2 "But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, too small to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days."
Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared.
Then he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search for the child. When you find him, come and tell me so that I, too, may go and worship him."
After hearing the king's words, they went. And as they were on their way, behold, the star they had seen in the east went before them until it came and stood over the place where the child was.
And when they saw the star, they rejoiced greatly.
And they entered the house and found the child with Mary, his mother. Then they knelt down and worshiped him, and they opened their treasures and offered him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
And my Father warned them in a dream not to return to Herod, so they took another route and went back to their country. The flight into Egypt.
After the wise men had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child to kill him."
Then Joseph got up, took the child and his mother by night, and departed for Egypt.
# It is 11:1; Ex 4:22 And he dwelt there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt have I called my son." The slaughter of the infants in Bethlehem
When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he became furious. He gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the wise men.
My brother, the thing that the prophet Jeremiah said has come to pass.
# Isaiah 31:15 "In Ramah there was heard a voice wailing and weeping bitterly; Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted, because they are no more." Return from Egypt to Nazareth
And when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
And they said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and return to the land of Israel, for those who sought to kill him have died."
My brother stood up, took the child and his mother, and returned to the land of Israel.
When they heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, they were afraid to go there. Being warned by God in a dream, they went to the region of Galilee.
And he went to a city called Nazareth, and dwelt there: so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.
The Gospel of John the Baptist (Mark 1:1-8; Luke 3:1-18; John 1:19-28)
In those days John the Baptist came to the wilderness of the Judean region, proclaiming a message of repentance.
And he said, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!"
# Isaiah 40:3 And this is the voice of him who cries in the wilderness, "Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight!"
And John was clothed in camel's hair, and had a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
And people were coming to him from Jerusalem and from all over Judea and from the region beyond the Jordan.
And they confessed their sins, and were baptized in the Jordan River.
When he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to be baptized, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Do things that show what you've learned.
Do not say in your hearts, "We are the children of Abraham." I tell you, God can raise up children of Abraham from these stones.
The axe is now placed on the tree trunks, the tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
"I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to take off his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
"Waving the winnowing fan in his hand, he cleans the threshing floor and gathers the wheat into the barn, but the chaff he burns with unquenchable fire." - The Baptism of Jesus (Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21-22)
And Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
But John prevented him, saying, "I have need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"
Then Jesus answered, "Let it be so now, for it is proper for us to fulfill all righteousness." And John consented.
And when Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
"Jesus was tempted by the devil" (Mark 1:12-13; Luke 4:1-13)
And the Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan.
My brother fasted for forty days and forty nights until he became hungry.
Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the highest point of the temple. "If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down."
# 8:3 Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"
And they raised their voices in praise to the holy city, and stood on the edge of the temple's roof,
# Mark 9:11-12 And they asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?" He replied, "Elijah does come first, and restores all things; and how is it written of the Son of man, that he should suffer many things, and be set at nought? But I say unto you, that Elijah is indeed come, and they have also done unto him whatsoever they would, even as it is written of him."
Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Jesus' response in English, from the Bible, Matthew 4:7)
He mocked them bitterly and set them on a very high mountain, behind which lay all the kingdoms of the world and the glory therein.
And they said, "We will give you this entire thing if you prostrate before our idols."
# Matthew 6:13; Mark 8:33 Jesus answered, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'"
And the devil left him and departed. And angels came and ministered to him. Jesus preaches in Galilee (Mark 1:14-15; Luke 4:14-15)
And when Jesus heard what John had said, he withdrew from there to Galilee.
And leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali,
So that what the prophet Isaiah said might be fulfilled:
# Isaiah 9:1-2 The land of Naphtali and the land of Zebulun, toward the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations, the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them a light has shined.
A voice cries out: "In the wilderness, prepare the way for the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground shall become level, the rugged places a plain. Then the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken."
And from that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus calls the first disciples (Mark 1:16-20; Luke 5:1-11)
As Jesus was walking along the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
He told them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
And over time, they left their nets and followed him.
As he walked along, he saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedes, and his brother John, in a boat with their father Zebedies, mending their nets, and he called them.
And some of them went away in boats to follow him. Jesus was teaching and proclaiming the good news, and healing every disease and every weakness among the people (Luke 6:17-19).
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the Kingdom of God, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
And He spread His message throughout Syria. People brought Him the sick, those afflicted by various diseases and ailments, including those possessed by demons, epileptics, and the paralyzed, and He healed them.
And a great many people followed him from Galilee and the Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and the region beyond the Jordan.
The Sermon on the Mount (Luke 6:20-23)
And Jesus went up into the mountain, and sat down there. And his disciples came to him.
And he began to teach them, saying:
"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
Cheers to the sad ones! May they find solace.
Here is the translation of the provided text: "Good health to the good people! They are the ones who will inherit the earth."
"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied."
Health to those who pity them! They will be pitied.
Here is the translation: "Good for them with pure hearts! They are the face of God for others to see."
Good for them for reconciling people! They are truly children of God.
"Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
Here is the translation of the provided text: "I stand with you when people mock you, torment you, and say all the nasty things about you, all because of me!"
"Rejoice and leap for joy, for your reward is great in heaven. That is how they persecuted the prophets before you." Salt and Light (Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34-35)
"You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden.
"No one lights a lamp and puts it under a bowl; instead they put it on a stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house."
"Let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven." - The Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:16)
"It should not cross your minds that I have come to abolish the Sharia and the prophets. I have not come to abolish them, but to complete them."
Verily, I tell you: Heaven and earth will pass away before even the smallest letter or dot of the Law passes away, until all things are accomplished.
"Whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever keeps them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
"I tell you, unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
# Exodus 20:13; Deuteronomy 5:17; 16:18 "What was said to your ancestors: 'Do not kill; and whoever kills must be brought to judgment.'
But I tell you, do not swear by the temple or by the gold that is in it. Do not swear by the altar or by the gift that is on it. Do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. Rather, let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,' 'No.' Anything beyond this comes from the evil one. And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be children of your Father in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
"Therefore, when you are offering your gift at the altar, if you remember that your brother has something against you,"
Leave your offering before the altar and go first reconcile with your brother, and then come and present your offering.
If someone complains about you, reconcile with them immediately when you're on your way to court, so they don't complain about you to the judge, the judge tells the police officer, and you end up in jail.
Here is the translation: "I'm telling you the truth: You're not getting out of here until you pay the last penny."
Deuteronomy 5:18 - "You have heard what was said to your ancestors: 'Do not murder.'" (English Standard Version) Note: The original text seems to be a mix of Arabic and potentially another language or dialect. The translation provided assumes the intention is to convey the equivalent meaning from the Bible verse in English. The Arabic phrase "ما تزناش" is not a direct translation of the Hebrew or English Bible verse text, but it is interpreted as conveying a similar meaning of "do not murder."
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
"If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell." (Divorce, Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11-12; Luke 16:18)
Zephaniah 2:1-4 (English translation): "Gather together, gather together, O unwanted one, Before the decree takes effect, Before the day passes like chaff, Before the Lord's fierce anger comes upon you, Before the day of the Lord's wrath comes upon you. Seek the Lord, all you humble of the land, Who have carried out his decrees; Seek righteousness, seek humility, Perhaps you will be hidden On the day of the Lord's anger."
But I tell you, anyone who divorces his wife for any reason except sexual immorality and marries another woman commits adultery." - The Oath
# Exodus 19:12; Leviticus 30:2; Deuteronomy 23:21 "You shall not swear by falsehood, but shall fulfill what you have vowed to the Lord."
But I tell you, do not swear at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God,
# Isaiah 66:1; Acts 7:49; Psalm 48:2 Neither in heaven nor on earth is there a place where his feet may rest, nor is there any place in Jerusalem for the Most High to dwell.
And don't swear by your head, because you can't even restore a single white or black hair.
"Let your speech be 'Yes, yes' or 'No, no'; anything more than this comes from the evil one." (Luke 6:29-30)
# Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21 "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'
But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.
And if he likes to fight with you to take your jacket, let him take your burnous too.
If someone forces you to walk a kilometer with them, walk two with them.
"If anyone asks you for something, give it to them, and if anyone wants to borrow from you, do not turn them away." Love your enemies (Luke 6:27-28, 32-36)
You have heard that it was said, "Love your neighbor and hate your enemy."
As I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
"Be children of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous."
What reward do you deserve if you love those who love you? Isn't it those who collect taxes who should do this?
What did they decide other than you? If you don't surrender, it's only your sisters who will suffer. Don't those who don't know God do such things with their own hands?
You must be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
The translation of "الصدقة" into English is "charity" or "alms."
"Be careful not to do good deeds in front of people to be seen by them. Otherwise, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven."
"When you give to someone in need, do not boast about it as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, so that people will praise them. I tell you the truth, they have already received their reward."
As for you, when you give charity, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
"But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you." (Luke 11:2-4)
"When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by people. Truly I tell you, they have already received their reward."
As for you, when you pray, go into your inner room, close the door, and pray to your Father who is unseen. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
And don't keep repeating empty words like other nations who think that God will hear them when they say a lot of words.
Don't be like them, because your father knows what you need before you even ask for it.
The translation of the provided text from Arabic to English is: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name."
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who wrong us.
We did not expose ourselves to the trial, and from evil, we were saved.
"And if you forgive people their wrongdoings, then Allah will also forgive you your sins in heaven."
"But if you do not forgive others their transgressions, neither will your Father in heaven forgive you your transgressions." - The Book of Matthew (King James Version)
"When you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so that people will know they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have already received their reward."
As for you, when you fast, comb your hair and wash your face.
"When you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you." (Luke 12:33-34)
"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
"Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." (Luke 11:34-36)
The eye is the lantern of the body. Therefore, if your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.
"But if your eye is unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!" (Luke 12:22-31; 16:13)
No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.
"Isn't it that I tell you not to worry about your lives, what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your bodies, what you will wear? Isn't life more than food, and the body more than clothing?"
"Look at the birds of the sky, how they do not sow or reap or gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?"
Who among you thinks they can add even one hour to their life?
And why do you worry about clothes? Look at the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin.
As I tell you: Not even King Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these!
If God dresses the cannabis plant in such a chemical way, then why does cannabis grow today only to be thrown into the oven's fire tomorrow? How much more so should He clothe you, whose faith is weak!
That's why you should not worry and say: "What should we eat? Or what should we drink? Or what should we wear?"
All these things are what people who do not believe are seeking, but your Father in heaven knows what you need.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
That's why you shouldn't think about tomorrow, because tomorrow is the day to think about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Do not judge others (Luke 6:37-38, 41-42)
Don't judge people so that you won't be judged.
The judgment you pass on others will be passed on you, and the measure you use will be used against you.
Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye, but do not perceive the plank in your own eye?
And how can you tell your brother, "Let me remove the speck from your eye," when your own eye has a beam in it?
You hypocrite! First, remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
"Do not give what is holy to the dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet and turn and tear you in pieces." Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. (Luke 11:9-13)
Here is the translation of the provided text: "Ask and you shall receive, seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you."
For whoever asks receives, and whoever seeks finds, and to whoever knocks it will be opened.
Who among you, if their child asks for bread, would give them a stone?
"If someone asks for a fish, do you give them a snake?"
"If you, being evil, know how to give good things to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him?"
"But do to others as you would have them do to you. This is the law and the prophets." (The Narrow Door, Luke 13:24)
Enter through the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter by it.
"How narrow and difficult is the way that leads to life, and few are those who find it." (The Parable of the Tree and Its Fruit, Luke 6:43-44)
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
"You know their yield. Does a thorn bush bear grapes, or a bramble bush bear figs?"
A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A fine tree does not bear bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear fine fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
"Then you will know them by their fruits." (Luke 13:25-27)
"Not everyone who says, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven."
On the Day of Judgment, many people will say to me: "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and cast out demons in Your name, and do many wonderful works in Your name?"
And I will say to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of iniquity.' (Luke 6:47-49)
"Whoever hears my words and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
The rain poured, the floods came, and the wind blew fiercely against that house, but it did not fall, because its foundation was built on rock.
Whoever hears my words and does not act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
"And the rain poured, and the floods came, and the wind blew upon that house, and it fell; and great was its fall."
As Jesus finished speaking, the people were amazed at his teaching.
Because he knew them as one with authority, not like their book.
The leper is healed (Mark 1:40-45; Luke 5:12-16)
When Jesus came down from the mountain, a large crowd followed him.
And a leper came to him, knelt down, and said, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean."
And he stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I will; be clean." And immediately the leprosy left him.
# 14:2 And Jesus said to him, "Tell no one; but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them." The servant of the centurion was healed. (Luke 7:1-10; John 4:43-54)
And Jesus entered Capernaum, and a centurion came to him, imploring him, and saying,
Oh sir, my slave is lying paralyzed in the house, suffering greatly and unable to move.
And Jesus said, "I will come and heal him."
But the water carrier answered him: "Sir, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof. Only speak a word, and my servant will be healed.
"I am a man with authority; I have people who obey me and soldiers whom I command. I tell one man, 'Go!' and he goes. I say to another, 'Come!' and he comes. And to my servant, 'Do this!' and he does it."
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly, I tell you, no one in Israel has greater faith than this."
"Many people will come from east and west and sit at the table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven."
But the children of the kingdom are to be cast out into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Jesus said to the centurion, "Go, and let it be done for you according to your faith." And the servant was healed at that very moment. Peter's mother-in-law was healed (Mark 1:29-34; Luke 4:38-41).
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Touch her hand, brother, and you'll feel the warmth. She got up and started working on it.
On that evening, as the sun was setting, many people possessed by demons brought them to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word, and healed all the sick.
# Isaiah 53:4, and this thing happened in order to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah said: "He took our infirmities and carried our diseases." Jesus and the world (Luke 9:57-62)
And when Jesus saw that a great crowd was following him, he ordered his disciples to get into the boat and go ahead to the other side.
And one of the scribes came up and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
And Jesus said, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
And another of his disciples said, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
As Jesus said, "Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus Calms the Storm (Mark 4:35-41; Luke 8:22-25)
When Jesus got into the boat, his disciples were amazed.
A strong wind blew on the lake, so that the waves covered the boat. But Jesus was asleep.
And his disciples came to him and woke him up, saying, "Lord, save us! We are perishing!"
And Jesus said to them, "Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?" And he got up and rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.
And the people were amazed, saying, "Who is this, even the winds and the sea obey him!" The demons were cast out and the herds of pigs drowned. (Mark 5:1-20; Luke 8:26-39)
And Jesus went to the other side of the region of the Gadarenes. There two men who were possessed with demons met Him as they were coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass by that way.
And they cried out, saying, "What have we to do with thee, thou Son of God? Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?"
There were many sheep grazing in a distant place.
The devils conjured him, saying, "If you come out of us, send us to the people of truth!"
He said to them, "Go!" So they left and entered the valley, and they all went down the valley from the edge of the mountain to the sea and drowned in the water.
They released the prisoners and entered the city, telling everything about the two men who were possessed by demons.
My brother, all the people in the city came out to meet Jesus. They begged him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a paralyzed man (Mark 2:1-12; Luke 5:17-26)
And Jesus went into the boat and passed over, and came into his own city.
Then they brought to him a paralytic lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
And a group of Jewish writers said in their hearts, "This man has blasphemed!"
But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?"
Which is easier to say: "Your sins are forgiven," or "Get up and walk?"
"But so you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins..." He then said to the paralytic, "Get up, take your mat and go home."
My brother got up and went home.
And when the people saw what had happened, they feared and praised God, who had given such authority to man. Jesus called Levi (Mark 2:13-17; Luke 5:27-32).
As Jesus passed by, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. He said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and followed him.
When Jesus was reclining at the house of Matthew, eating, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat with Jesus and His disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
# He said to them, "The disciples of John the Baptist and the disciples of the Pharisees fast and pray, but yours do not. When the bridegroom is with them, the guests cannot fast, can they? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days." (Mark 2:18-22; Luke 5:33-39)
Then John's disciples came to Jesus and asked, "How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast."
No one tears a patch from a new garment to mend an old one; otherwise they would ruin the new garment. And the patch from the new one would not match the old garment.
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost as well as the skins. But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins. (Mark 5:21-43, Luke 8:40-56)
While Jesus was still speaking, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him, saying, "My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live."
And Jesus arose and followed him, and so did his disciples.
And there was a woman who had been suffering from a blood disorder for twelve years. She came up behind him and touched the tassel of his cloak.
She thought to herself, "If only I could take his place, I would be cured."
Jesus and his disciples said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you." And at once the woman was made well.
When Jesus arrived at the house of the Jewish leader, he saw the group playing flutes and the people making a commotion.
He said, "Back off! The girl isn't dead, she's just sleeping."
When the people left, he entered, grabbed the girl by the hand, and she got up.
And the news about this thing spread throughout all that region. Jesus healed two blind men.
As Jesus passed by, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Son of David, have mercy on us!"
When Jesus entered the house, the two blind men came to him. He asked them, "What do you want me to do for you?" They answered, "Lord, we want to see."
Then Jesus touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith let it be done to you."
And their eyes were opened. And Jesus charged them, saying, "See that no one knows!"
But they went out and spread the news about him throughout the whole region. Jesus Heals a Leper.
And when the two blind men were leaving, a group brought him a demon-possessed man.
Jesus drove out the demon and the mute began to speak. The people were amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!"
As for the Pharisees, they said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." Jesus had compassion on the people.
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
When he saw the people, he felt sorry for them because they were anxious and tired like sheep without a shepherd.
He said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
"If not, ask the master of the harvest to send his servants to his harvest."
The twelve apostles (Mark 3:13-19; Luke 6:12-16)
And he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases, and sent them out to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
And these are the names of the twelve apostles: the first, Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
"And Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;"
And Simon who zealously protects his country, and Judas Iscariot who will betray Jesus. Jesus sends out the twelve apostles (Mark 6:7-13; Luke 9:1-6).
Jesus sent out these twelve and commanded them, "Do not go into any town of the Samaritans, and do not enter any city of the Gentiles.
But go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
And you, do not go around saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand,' for the kingdom of heaven is within you.
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those with leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you received, freely give.
"Do not take with you any gold or silver or copper in your belts,"
Neither a belt nor two pairs of shoes nor sandals nor a stick, because the servant deserves what you eat.
And whatever city or village you enter, inquire who is most worthy in it, and enter their homes until you leave.
When you enter a house, greet the people inside.
If the people in that house deserve it, let your greetings reach them. But if they don't deserve it, your greetings will come back to you.
"If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your message, shake the dust off your feet as you leave that house or town."
"Truly I tell you, on the day of judgment the people of Sodom and Gomorrah will be treated less severely than you." (Mark 13:9-13; Luke 21:12-17)
"Hani sends you greetings, like a flock of sheep in the midst of wolves, unless you are awake like serpents and fair like doves."
They will hand you over to the Jewish council, and you will be flogged in their synagogues.
And do not mock the rulers and kings on my account, so that you may bear witness before them and before other nations.
When they hand it over to you, don't think about how to speak or what to say. At that moment, the words you need to say will come to you.
"It's up to you, you're not the ones talking, but go tell your father to speak on your behalf."
A brother will hand over his brother to death, a father will hand over his son, and children will turn against their parents and kill them.
And everyone will hate you because of my name. But he who stands firm to the end will be saved.
When they persecute you in one city, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
The pupil is not greater than his teacher, nor is the servant greater than his master.
"A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his household?" - Fear of the Lord (Luke 12:2-7)
"So don't be afraid of them. Nothing hidden will remain undisclosed, and nothing concealed will remain unknown."
Whatever I tell you in the dark, speak it in the light. And what is whispered in your ear, shout it from the rooftops.
"And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell."
My brother, aren't two birds sold for a franc? They wouldn't fall to the ground unless your pocket in the sky knows about them.
Not even a single hair on your head is unnoticed.
Don't be afraid, you're better than many birds!
"Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge them before my Father in heaven."
"But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven." Jesus and the World (Luke 12:51-53, 14:26-27)
"Don't think I came to bring peace to the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword."
I came to distinguish between a boy and his father, a girl and her mother, and a daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law.
Enemies are man's stepping stones to success.
Whoever loves their father or mother more than me doesn't deserve me. And whoever loves their son or daughter more than me doesn't deserve me.
And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
"For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it." (Mark 9:36-41)
"Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me."
Whoever accepts a prophet because he is a prophet will receive the reward of a prophet. And whoever accepts a righteous man because he is righteous will receive the reward of a righteous man.
"He wouldn't even give one of these kids a glass of cold water because he's my student, I tell you, his wage isn't wasted."
Disciples of John the Baptist (Luke 7:18-35)
And when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.
And John heard in prison about the works of Christ, so he sent his disciples to him.
And they said: "Are you the one who is coming, or should we wait for another?"
Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you have seen and heard.
# Isaiah 35:5-6; 61:1; Luke 4:18-19: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news preached to them.
And health to him who doesn't doubt it!
When John's disciples had gone away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John, saying, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
So what did you go out to see? To see a man wearing expensive clothes? It's the ones who wear expensive clothes in the palaces of kings!
So what did you go out to see? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
# Matthew 3:1; Mark 1:2: "This is what is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah: 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.'"
"Truly I tell you, among those born of women, no one has arisen greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power, and forceful people lay hold of it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
And if you want to believe it, it's Elijah who will come.
"Whoever has ears, let them hear!"
What kind of generation are we? They're like children sitting in the market, calling out to each other:
"We played music for you, but you didn't dance, and we sang for you, but you didn't cry."
When John eats nothing and drinks nothing, you say, "He has a demon."
"When Jesus came to the village of the Samaritans, he was tired from his journey. He sat down by a well, and a Samaritan woman came to draw water. Jesus said to her, 'Give me a drink.' (His disciples had gone into the village to buy food.) The Samaritan woman said to him, 'You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?' (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.) Jesus answered, 'If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.' 'Sir,' the woman said, 'you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his flocks and herds?' Jesus answered, 'Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I shall give will never thirst. It becomes a spring of water welling up to eternal life.' The woman said, 'Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.' He told her, 'Go, call your husband and come back.' The woman replied, 'I have no husband.' Jesus said, 'You are right when you say you have no husband. The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have said is quite true.' 'Sir,' the woman said, 'I can see that you are a prophet. Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.' 'Woman,' Jesus replied, 'believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews. Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.'" —The Unrepentant Cities (Luke 10:13-15)
And Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent.
He said, "Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works that were done in your midst had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
As I tell you: The state of the cities of Tyre and Sidon will be better than yours on the Day of Judgment.
And you, Capernaum! Will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades. For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today.
"But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you." Jesus rejoices (Luke 10:21-22)
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father, that was your will.
Father gave me everything. No one knew who the son was, and no one knew who the father was, and everyone chose the son to show him off.
"I will relieve you of your fatigue and heavy burden."
Mock my scale and learn from me, for I am kind and my heart is humble. You will find comfort in your souls.
"My scale is not accurate, and my load is light."
Saturday (Mark 2:23-28; Luke 6:1-5)
At that time, Jesus was going through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and his disciples were hungry. They began to pluck and eat the heads of grain.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
# I Samuel 21:1-6; Isaiah 24:9 Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him?"
How did he enter the house of the Lord and eat the bread of the offering, which was not lawful for him or those with him to eat, but was lawful for the priests to eat?
# Verse 28:9-10 My brother, haven't you read in the law how the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are blameless?
As you say: There is one here greater than the temple.
# It is 6:6; Matt 9:13. If you had known what this verse means: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice," then you would not have judged me.
And Jesus said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?" (Mark 3:4) The man with the withered hand was healed on the Sabbath (Mark 3:1-6; Luke 6:6-11).
And Jesus went to that place and entered their synagogue.
Now there was a man there whose hand was withered. And they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" so that they might accuse him.
Jesus said to them, "If one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
Man has such a high value compared to the animal! That's why it's permissible to do good deeds on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand!" He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored, just like the other one.
Just as the Pharisees went out and plotted against Jesus, seeking ways to kill him, Jesus is the servant chosen by God.
Jesus knew this and left that place. A large crowd followed him and he healed all of them.
And he ordered them not to inform anyone about him.
And this thing came to pass, fulfilling what the prophet Isaiah had said:
# Isa 42:1-4 "Behold my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations."
Neither does he sweat nor does he cry, not even a single person in the streets hears his voice.
A reed that doesn't break, and a wick that doesn't extinguish. Even if it takes time, truth will prevail.
"That the people may have hope in His name. Jesus and Beelzebul" (Mark 3:20-30; Luke 11:14-23, 12:10)
At that time, a blind and mute man possessed by a demon was brought to him. Jesus healed him, and he began to speak and see.
And all the people were amazed, and said, "Is this not the son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man drives out demons only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself cannot stand."
If the devil drives out the devil, he will be divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
"If Anna and I go out in the streets with Beelzebul, with whom will your disciples go out? That is why they will judge you."
But if you go out by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has indeed overcome you.
"How could someone enter the house of a strong man and take his belongings, unless they first overpower the strong man, and then take the things in his house?"
He who is not with me is against me, and what does not gather with me scatters.
That's why I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to people, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"And whoever says a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come." (The Gospel According to Luke 6:43-45)
"Either let the tree be beautiful and its fruit be beautiful, or let the tree be ugly and its fruit be ugly. The tree is known by its fruit."
You snakes, how can you say nice things when you're evil? The tongue speaks what's in the heart.
A good person brings good things out of their good treasure in their heart, and an evil person brings evil things out of their evil treasure in their heart.
Our saying: Every idle word that people speak, they will be accountable for on the Day of Judgment.
"By your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned." The Pharisees asked for a sign (Mark 8:11-12; Luke 11:29-32).
At that time, some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Jesus, "Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you."
He replied to them: "An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
# Jonah 1:17 And just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
# Jonah 3:5 The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
# I have come to stir up the world; II Chron. 9:1-12; and the queen of the south will rise up with this generation at the judgment and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and here is one greater than Solomon!" The Return of the Disowned (Luke 11:24-26)
When the evil spirit leaves a person, it wanders in places without water, seeking rest, but finds nowhere to rest.
At that time, he said, "I want to go back to my house where I came from." And when he returned, he found it empty, clean, and organized.
"Behold, he is not clean that goes out of a man, but he that enters into a man. For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: all these evil things come from within, and defile the man." - Mark 7:20-23 (KJV) "But he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it." - Luke 8:21 (KJV)
While Jesus was still speaking to the people, his mother and brothers arrived and stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone said, "Your mother and brothers are outside and they want to talk to you."
But he answered the man who spoke to him: "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"
And he stretched out his hand toward his disciples and said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers.
"Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
Like a farmer (Mark 4:1-9; Luke 8:4-8)
And Jesus went out from the house in that day, and sat by the lake.
A lot of people gathered around him, until he got into a boat, and all the people stood on the shore.
And he told them many things in parables, saying, "A farmer went out to sow."
And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and ate them up.
Another seed fell on rocky ground with little soil. It sprouted over time because there wasn't much soil.
But when the sun rose, it burned and withered because it had no veins.
Another seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it.
Another seed fell on good soil and sprouted, some bringing forth a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.
"Those who have ears to hear, let them hear!" Why did Jesus speak in parables (Mark 4:10-12; Luke 8:9-10)?
At that time the disciples came to Jesus and said, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
And he answered them, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given."
He who has will be given more, and he will have abundance. But he who does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.
That's why I speak to them in parables, for they look without seeing and listen without understanding.
# Isa 6:9-10; Mark 8:18; John 12:39-41; Acts 28:26-27 were fulfilled in them, the prophecy of Isaiah which says: "You will indeed hear, but never understand, and you will indeed see, but never perceive."
The hearts of this people have dried up, they have closed their ears and shut their eyes, so that they may not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their hearts, and thus return to me for healing.
But you only have eyes for her and ears for her.
"I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it." (Interpretation of the Parable of the Sower - Mark 4:13-20; Luke 8:11-15)
"So listen to what is meant by the proverb of the farmer:"
When anyone hears the word of the kingdom of God and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in his heart. This is what is sown on the path.
But what is sown on the rocky ground is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.
But he has no veins within him; let him be patient until the time comes when there is hardship or persecution for the sake of the word, and then he will fall.
But the seed falling on the thorny ground represents those who hear the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful.
But what is sown on the good soil are those who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold." (Mark 4:20) Note: The text you provided is in Arabic and contains a reference to a parable from the Bible (Mark 4:1-20), comparing different types of soil to different responses to the word of God. The translation maintains the original formatting and punctuation.
And Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field."
But while the people were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went away.
And when the grain had sprouted and had produced the stalk, then the tares appeared as well.
The farmer's servants came to him and said, "Master, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?"
He told them, "One of my enemies did this." The servants said to him, "So shall we go and gather the thorns?"
As he said: "No, so that you don't uproot the wheat when you are gathering the darnel.
"Let the wheat and the tares grow together until the time of harvest, and at that time I will say to the reapers, 'Gather the tares first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat and store it in my barn.'" (Like the mustard seed and the yeast - Mark 4:30-32; Luke 13:18-19)
And he gave them another parable, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field."
She was the smallest of all the seeds, but when she grew up, she became the largest of all the greenery, and she became a tree, to the extent that the birds of the sky come and nest in her.
He told another parable to them, "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until it was all leavened."
Jesus spoke all these things to the people in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable.
# Gen 78:2 This is what the prophet foretold: "That my mouth might utter the hidden secrets, and that my tongue might speak the mysteries from the creation of the world." - Interpretation of the Parable of the Tares
At that time Jesus left the people and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the tares."
Answer them, "It is the Son of Man who sows the good seed.
The field is the world, and the good seed are the children of the kingdom of God, and the tares are the children of the wicked one,
The enemy who sowed them is Satan, the harvest is in the end times, and the reapers are the angels.
And just as the tares are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of the age.
Anna, the Son of Man, I will send my angels, and they will gather the evildoers and those who work wickedness in my kingdom.
They'll throw them into the midst of the fire, where there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
"And at that time the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let those who have ears listen!" It is like treasure hidden in a field—when a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls.
Having found a precious piece of gold, he walked, sold everything he had, and bought it.
The kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and gathered together many kinds of fish.
When they were full, the fishermen took them to the shore, sat down, put the good fish in boxes, and threw away the bad ones.
And thus it will be at the end of time: the angels will come and separate the evil from among the righteous.
They'll throw them into the midst of the fire, and there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth. "The new and the old"
Jesus said to his disciples, "Do you understand all these things?" They answered, "Yes."
And he said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure things new and old."
And when Jesus had finished this parable, he went away from that place.
And Jesus began to teach in their synagogues, and was praised by all. And they were astonished, and said, "Whence has this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? And aren't his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
"Don't all the girls here have brothers? So where did this man get all this stuff from?"
And so they complained about him. Then Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home."
And He did not perform many miracles among them, because they did not believe in Him.
The Death of John the Baptist (Mark 6:14-29; Luke 9:7-9)
At that time, when King Herod heard the news about Jesus,
And he said unto his disciples, "John the Baptist is come again, and therefore worketh he these miracles."
And Herod the tetrarch having heard (of him) (and) said, "This is John the Baptist; him I beheaded; he has risen from the dead."
Because of John, they said, "It is forbidden for you to take her."
And they wanted to kill him, but they feared the people, because they considered John a prophet.
But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before him, and pleased Herod.
That's why he promised her and swore to give her anything she asked for.
As she had been instructed by her mother, she said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter!"
And the king was sad, but he had to give her what she asked for, because of the oath he had sworn and the guests.
And someone sent, cut off John's head in prison.
They cut off his head, placed it on a plate, and gave it to the girl, who then took it to her mother.
Then his disciples came and carried away his body and buried it, and went and told Jesus. Jesus took the five thousand men (Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-14)
When Jesus heard this, he departed from there by boat to a secluded place apart from the city. But when the people heard about it, they followed him on foot from the city.
When Jesus landed, he saw a large crowd; he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
In the evening, his disciples came to him and said, "The day is almost over, and this place is deserted. Send the people away so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus said, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
They said to him, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish."
Jesus said, "Bring them to me."
And he commanded the people to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
And they all ate and were satisfied. They even shook their fists at the full basket of leftovers.
And the people who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children. Jesus walks on the water (Mark 6:45-52; John 6:15-21)
And then he ordered his students to get into the boat and row to the other side of the lake ahead of him, until he sent the people to go.
After sending the people away, he went alone to the mountain to pray. When the sun set, he was still there alone.
By that time, the boat was far from the shore and was being overwhelmed by the waves because the wind was against it.
And before dawn Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.
The disciples were terrified when they saw him walking on the water, and they cried out, "It's a ghost!"
But Jesus spoke to them at once. "Take heart," he said, "it is I. Do not be afraid."
And Peter answered him, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water, and came to Jesus.
As the wind grew stronger, he became afraid and began to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!"
And Jesus stretched out his hand and caught him, and said unto him, "O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?"
And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.
And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!" Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases (Mark 6:53-56).
And Jesus and His disciples came to the region of Gennesaret.
And when the people of that country recognized Jesus, they spread the news about Him throughout the entire region and brought to Him all those who were sick.
And they asked him to let them touch even the hem of his garment. And all who touched it were healed.
The traditions of the elders (Mark 7:1-13)
Then the Pharisees and scribes of the Jews came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying:
"Why don't your students respect the customs of the elders? And why don't they wash their hands when they eat?"
Reply to them: "And why don't you obey God's commandment and cling tightly to your traditions?"
# Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16; Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9 For God said, "Honor your father and your mother," and, "Whoever curses his father or his mother must die."
As you say, if someone says to their father or mother: "What I used to help you with, I have given it to God, it is not necessary for him to honor his father."
And thus you have made the word of God of no effect by your tradition.
You hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying:
# Isaiah 29:13 This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
"They worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men." What defiles a person is not what goes into their mouth, but what comes out of it (Mark 7:14-23).
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand..."
It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles a person.
His disciples came and asked him, "Do you know what the Pharisees meant when they heard this?"
Reply to them: "Every tree that my Father has not planted will be uprooted."
Stay away from them! They are blind men leading blind men. If a blind man leads a blind man, they will both fall into a pit.
As Peter said, "Explain this parable to us."
Jesus said, "How long will you keep not understanding?"
Brother, don't you see that anything that goes into the mouth ends up in the stomach, and then comes out of the body?
But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person.
From within the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, and unbelief.
These are the things that defile a person. But eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person." The faith of the Canaanite woman (Mark 7:24-30)
And Jesus went about in all the region beyond the Jordan, and from the region of Tyre and Sidon.
Then a Canaanite woman from that region came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon."
But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying, "Send her away, for she is crying out after us!"
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
As she came and sat down before him, she said, "Sir, help me!"
And I replied: "It's not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
She said: "Yes, sir! Even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table."
Jesus answered her, "Woman, your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you desire." And at that very moment, her daughter was healed. Jesus healed many people.
And Jesus went away from there, and walked by the Sea of Galilee. And he went up into a mountain, and sat down there.
Many people came to him, bringing with them the lame, the maimed, the blind, the mute, and many others, and he placed them before him, and he healed them.
And the people were astonished when they saw the mute speaking, the lame walking, the paralyzed cured, and the blind seeing. They glorified the God of Israel. Jesus fed four thousand men (Mark 8:1-10).
Jesus called his disciples and said to them, "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may faint on the way."
And the disciples said to him, "Where in this desolate place will anyone have enough bread to feed all these people?"
Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They answered, "Seven, and a few small fish."
And Jesus commanded the people to sit down on the ground.
And he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
And they all ate until they were satisfied, and they collected seven large baskets full of leftovers.
The clan consisted of four thousand men, not counting the women and children.
After he sent the people away, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magdala.
The signs of the times (Mark 8:11-13; Luke 12:54-56)
Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him, asking him to show them a sign from heaven.
And Jesus answered them, "When it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'
In the morning you say, "It will rain today, because the sky is dark red." You know how to interpret the state of the sky, but you don't know how to interpret the signs of the times.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And he left them and went away. The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees (Mark 8:14-21)
When the students reached the other shore, they forgot to bring bread with them.
Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
And the disciples discussed among themselves and said, "That's because we don't have any bread."
But Jesus knew their thoughts and said, "You of little faith, why do you argue among yourselves and say, 'We have no bread'?
"Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves that were distributed to the five thousand, and how many large baskets full of leftovers you collected?"
"And the seven loaves of the four thousand, how many large baskets did they fill?"
How is it that you do not understand that I am not speaking about bread? Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees!
At that time they understood that he was telling them to beware of the teaching of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, which was like leaven for bread. Peter testified that Jesus was the Messiah. (Mark 8:27-30; Luke 9:18-21)
When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered him, "Some say you are John the Baptist; others say you are Elijah; and still others say you are Jeremiah or one of the other prophets."
He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
And Jesus said, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
And I tell you: You are Peter, which means a large rock, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
At that time, he commanded his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus speaks for the first time about his death and resurrection (Mark 8:31; 9:1; Luke 9:22-27).
"And Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes of the Jews, and be killed, and on the third day be raised."
And Peter shook Jesus and cried out, "Lord, be merciful! This cannot happen to you at all!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
At that time Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to follow me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me."
He who wants to end his life loses it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.
What is the benefit of a person if they gain the whole world but lose their life? Or what is the one thing that a person can trade their life for?
"I tell you, on that day the Son of Man will be revealed in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will reward each one according to their deeds."
I tell you the truth: There are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Jesus reveals his spirit to his disciples (Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36)
And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up to a high mountain by themselves.
And He changed their form before them, and their faces became bright as the sun, and their skin as white as light.
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here; if you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And while he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
Upon hearing this, the students fell to their faces and were very afraid.
But Jesus came and touched them and said, "Get up, do not be afraid."
And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus alone.
And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, "Tell no one about what you have seen, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
And the disciples asked him, "Then why do the scriptures of the Jews say that Elijah must come first?"
Answer them: "Indeed, Elijah is coming, and he will fix everything."
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. For if the miracles had been performed in Sodom which were performed in you, it would have remained until today. But I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.
And at that time his disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy possessed by a demon (Mark 9:14-29; Luke 9:37-43)
And when Jesus and His disciples came to the people, a man approached Him and fell on his knees before Jesus, saying:
Oh Lord, have mercy on my son. He is convulsing and suffering greatly, always falling into fire and water.
"And I brought it to your students, but they couldn't fix it."
And Jesus answered and said, "O faithless and perverse generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to Me."
Jesus cast out the demon, it came out of him, and the boy was healed at once.
At that time the disciples came to Jesus in private and said, "Why could we not cast it out?"
He said to them, "Because of your little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
# 17:21 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: "This kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting." Jesus speaks again of his death and resurrection (Mark 9:30-32; Luke 9:43-45).
When his disciples were gathered in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men,
"They will kill me, and on the third day I will rise again." They were greatly distressed. Jesus pays the temple tax.
When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma tax went to Peter and said, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
He replied, "Yes, that is right." But Jesus, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "Why are you testing Me? Bring Me a denarius to look at." They brought one to Him, and He said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?" They said to Him, "Caesar's." And Jesus said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
Peter said, "I am from Bethany." Jesus said, "You are not from here, you are free people of the land."
"But we don't want to cause them any trouble. Go to the lake, cast your line, and catch the first fish you get. When you open its mouth, you'll find enough silver coins to pay my taxes and yours. Take it and pay our taxes."
