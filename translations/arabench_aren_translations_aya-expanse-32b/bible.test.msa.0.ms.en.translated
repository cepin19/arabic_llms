Who is the greatest?
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Then Jesus called a little child to Him, and stood him among them.
He said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
"Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me." - A warning against stumbling blocks.
"But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea and drowned!"
Woe to the world because of the stumbling blocks that must come, but woe to the person through whom they come!
"So if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you! It is better for you to enter eternal life crippled or lame, than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away from you! It is better for you to enter life with one eye, rather than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell." - The Lost Sheep
Jesus said, "Beware of despising any of my simple disciples. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven."
For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.
"What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go to look for the one that went astray?
Truly I tell you, he will rejoice over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not wander astray.
Even so your Father in heaven does not want one of these little disciples of Mine to be lost. Make peace with your brother.
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.
But if they will not listen to you, take one or two others along with you, that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses. #Two or three witnesses. 16:18 See Deuteronomy 19:15.
If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a pagan and a tax collector.
Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Truly I tell you, if two of you on earth agree as touching anything that they shall ask, it will be done for them by My Father who is in heaven.
For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them." - Forgiveness without boundaries.
Then Peter came to Jesus and asked him, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
So Jesus said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind." This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like it: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets. *Matthew 22:37-40* **Note:** The original text you provided seems to be a verse from the Bible, specifically from the Gospel of Matthew, with a commentary. The translation above reflects the meaning of the verse, which emphasizes loving God and one's neighbor as the greatest commandments, fulfilling the requirements of the Law and the Prophets. The numbers "seventy times seven" (seventy times) are a figurative expression indicating an unlimited number of times, conveying the idea of boundless forgiveness and love.
Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants.
And when he had begun to settle his accounts, there was brought to him one who owed him ten thousand talents. #A huge amount. 24:18 Literally: "ten thousand talents or quintals, which is equivalent to about 300,000 kilograms of the coins used at that time."
As he did not have the means to repay the debt, the master decided to sell the debtor, along with his wife, children, and all his possessions, and use the proceeds to settle the debt.
Then the servant fell on his knees before the king and pleaded with him, saying, "Give me time, and I will pay you the whole debt."
The lord took pity on him, forgave him the entire debt, and let him go.
As he went, he found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a small amount of money. He seized him by the throat and started to choke him, saying, "Pay me what you owe me."
So the servant fell down at his feet and pleaded with him, saying, "Be patient with me, and I will pay you."
But he refused, and took him and threw him into prison until he should pay back all his debt.
When the other slaves saw what had happened, they were very sad, and went to tell their master everything that had occurred.
His master called him and said to him, 'Wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.
Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?
And his master was very angry, and delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all his debt.
So will My heavenly Father also do to you, if each of you does not forgive his brother from his heart.
Unity in marriage.
After Jesus had finished speaking about these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan River.
And a great crowd followed him, and he healed them there.
And some Pharisees came to Jesus, testing him, and said, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?"
Jesus replied, "Have you not read that at the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female'?" (Genesis 1:27, 5:2)
Then he said, "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh." #leaves ... one flesh. 5:19 From the Book of Genesis 2:24.
"Therefore they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate."
They said to him, "Why then did Moses command that a wife be given a certificate of divorce and be sent away?" - See Deuteronomy 24:1.
Jesus answered them, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard, but from the beginning it was not so.
Therefore I say to you, whoever divorces his wife (unless for sexual immorality) and marries another, commits adultery."
So his disciples said to him, "If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry."
Then Jesus said to them, "Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it is given by God."
There are men who cannot marry because they were born unable to marry. There are men who cannot marry because people have taken away their ability to marry. And there are men who have chosen not to marry for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this teaching, let them accept it." Jesus welcomes children.
Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray. But the disciples rebuked them.
Then Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Then Jesus laid his hands on them, and departed from that place. **The obstacle of wealth**
And a man came up to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?"
Jesus answered him, "Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. But if you want to enter eternal life, keep the commandments."
The man said, "Which commandments?" Jesus replied, "Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal.
"You shall not bear false witness, honor your father and your mother." ›"You shall not kill ... and your mother." 19:19 From the Book of Exodus 20:12-16, and the Book of Deuteronomy 5:16-20. And ›"Love your neighbor #your neighbor." 19:19 Referring to the Gospel of Luke 10:25-37, we understand that the neighbor refers to every human being in need of help. Also ›"Love yourself #love ... yourself." 19:19 From the Book of Leviticus 19:18.
And the young man said to him, "I have kept all these commandments. What do I still lack?"
Jesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all you have and give to the poor. You will then have treasure in heaven. Come, follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he had great possessions.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
I tell you again that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.
When his disciples heard this, they were astonished and asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Then Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Then Peter said to him, "Behold, we have left everything and followed you. What then will there be for us?"
Then Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life with God."
For many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
Like the workers of the vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
And he agreed with the workers to pay them a dinar for each day, then sent them to work in his vineyard.
And the owner of the vineyard went out about the ninth hour, and saw some men standing idle in the marketplace.
So he said to them, "Go, you also, into the vineyard, and I will give you what is right."
So they went to work in the vineyard. He went out again around noon, and then at three in the afternoon, and hired more workers.
And about the fifth hour he went out again, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, and said to them, 'Why are you standing here all day idle?'
They said to him, "No one has hired us." He said to them, "You also go into my vineyard."
At the end of the day, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, "Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last and ending with the first."
So those who came at the eleventh hour received each a denarius.
Then those who were hired first came, and they thought that they would receive more; but each of them also received one denarius.
So they took it and began to complain against the owner of the vineyard.
And they said, 'The last ones hired worked only one hour, and you paid them as much as you paid us, even though we worked all day in the hot sun!'
The owner of the vineyard said to one of them, "Friend, I am not cheating you! Didn't you agree to work for one denarius?"
Take your wages and go. For I wish to give to the one who worked the last hour the same wages I gave to you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with what I own? Or are you jealous that I'm on good terms with others?
"So the last will be first, and the first will be last." Jesus predicts his death and resurrection.
As Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside and spoke to them privately:
"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and they will condemn him to death..."
"They will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked, flogged, and crucified. But on the third day he will be raised from the dead." Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.
Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.
Then Jesus said to her, "What do you want?" She said to him, "Command that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom."
Jesus said, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup I am about to drink?" They answered, "We can." (Matthew 20:22, Mark 10:38) Note: The phrase "the cup" is a metaphor for the suffering and death that Jesus was to endure. The reference to "the cup" is also found in verse 23.
He said to them, "You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit at my right and left is not mine to give; rather, it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
When the ten remaining disciples heard this request, they became very indignant with the two brothers.
Then Jesus called them and said to them, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise power over them.
But it shall not be so among you. Whoever would be great among you must be your servant.
"And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your servant."
So the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." Jesus Heals Two Blind Men
And as they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
And there were two blind men sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us."
The people rebuked them and told them to be silent, but they shouted all the more: "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
So Jesus stopped and called them, and said, "What do you want Me to do for you?"
They said, "Master, open our eyes."
Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed him.
The king lives.
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
And he said to them, "Go into the village that is before you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me.
If anyone says anything to you, tell him: 'The Lord needs them, and he will return them soon.'
This happened in order that what the prophet had said might be fulfilled:
Say to the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your King is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
So the disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.
So they brought the colt and its mother, and placing their cloaks on them, Jesus mounted.
And most of the people spread their cloaks on the road. But others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
And the multitudes that went before him, and that followed, cried out, saying, Hosanna: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord! 9:21 "Hosanna" is a transliteration of the Hebrew word "הוֹשַׁעְנָא" which means "Save now." Here, it is likely a cry of praise to God and His king, Christ. Repeated in verse 15. Blessed is the Son of David! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord! Long live the King in his majesty!
And when Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was moved, and the people asked, "Who is this man?"
And the multitudes that went before him, and that followed him, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest. Jesus in the Temple
Then Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer' #my_house … prayer. 13:21 From the Book of Isaiah 56:7. But you have made it a 'den of robbers!' #den_of_robbers. 13:21 From the Book of Jeremiah 7:11."
And some blind and lame people came to him in the temple courtyard, and he healed them.
And the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that he did, and the children crying in the temple, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" And they were indignant, and said to him, "Do you hear what these are saying?"
Jesus replied, "Yes, and have you not read that out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise?"
Then Jesus left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there. Faith's Power
As Jesus was going out early in the morning, he was hungry.
And he saw a fig tree by the wayside, and came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves only. And he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And immediately the fig tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and asked, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"
He replied, "I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what I have done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' it will be done."
And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive if you have faith." - Doubts about Jesus' authority.
Jesus went to the temple courts and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. They asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Then Jesus asked them, "But who do you say that I am?"
"Where did John's baptism come from? From heaven or from men?" And they argued with each other, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"
And if we say we are of men, we fear the people: for they all hold John as a prophet."
Therefore they answered Jesus and said, "We do not know." So Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." Like the two sons.
Jesus said, "What do you think of this story: A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work in my vineyard today.'"
The son replied, "I don't want to go." But he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to his other son and asked him the same thing. The son answered, 'Yes, sir, I will go,' but he did not go.
"Which of the two did the will of his father?" They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
For John the Baptist came to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe him. And even though you saw what they did, you did not repent and believe in him. You are like the son of the vineyard owner.
Listen to another parable: A man planted a vineyard and put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a tower. Then he leased it to the vinedressers and went into another country.
And when the time came to gather the grapes, he sent his servants to the farmers to get his share of the grapes.
But the peasants caught his slaves, beat one of them, killed another, and stoned another.
So the owner sent more slaves than the first time. But they were treated the same way by the farmers.
Finally he sent his son, saying to himself, "They will respect my son."
But when the peasants saw that this was the owner's son, they consulted among themselves and said, "This is the heir; let us kill him so that we can seize his inheritance."
So they seized him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
So what do you think the owner of the vineyard will do to those farmers when he returns?
So they said to him, "He will destroy those wicked tenants with disaster and give the vineyard to other farmers who will give him the fruit in season."
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read the Scripture: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"
Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it.
"Whoever falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, and on whomever it falls, it will crush him."
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables, they realized he was speaking about them.
So they tried to seize him, but they feared the people, who considered Jesus a prophet.
Like a wedding feast.
And Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son.
And the king sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast, but they did not want to come.
So the king sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “Behold, I have prepared my banquet; my oxen and fattened calves are killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.”’
But the guests paid no attention and went their own ways. One went to his field, another to his business.
As for the rest, they seized the king's slaves and beat and killed them.
Then the king was angry and sent his army, who killed those murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy.
Therefore go to the intersections of the streets, and invite everyone you find to the wedding feast.
So they went out into the streets and gathered all they found, both good and bad, so that the wedding hall was filled with guests.
When the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
So the king said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?' But he was silent.
So the king said to his servants, "Bind his feet and hands, and cast him out into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"For many are called, but few are chosen." The Pharisees were trying to entrap Jesus.
So the Pharisees went and plotted how they might entrap Jesus in what he said.
So they sent their disciples to him, along with some of the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are sincere and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by others, because you pay no attention to their status.
So tell us your opinion: Is it right to pay taxes to the emperor, or not?
But Jesus knew their evil intentions and said to them, "Hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency you use." They brought him a dinar.
He said to them, "Whose is this image and inscription on the denarius?"
They said to him, "Caesar's." Then he said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
When they heard his answer, they were astonished. They left him and went away. The Sadducees, who came to trap Jesus, were left with no reply.
On that day, some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him:
"Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies and leaves no sons, his brother shall marry his wife, and they shall have a son who shall be regarded as the brother's son.' See Deuteronomy 25:5-6."
So there were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died. Since he had no children, the second took her, and died.
And it happened to the brother and the second and the third, and even the seventh.
And after they all died, the woman also died.
"Who among the seven will be your wife on the Day of Resurrection? For you have married them all."
Jesus answered them, "You are mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures, nor the power of God."
Understand that in the eternal life after the resurrection of the dead, people neither marry nor give their daughters in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
As for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God said?
"I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." #I am ... Jacob. 32:22 From the Book of Exodus 3:6. "God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
When the people heard this, they were amazed at his teaching. The greatest commandment.
When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
And a scholar of the law asked him a question to entrap him, saying:
Teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the law?
Jesus said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind." #Love the Lord ... your mind. 37:22 From the Book of Deuteronomy 6:5.
This is the first and greatest commandment,
The second commandment is like the first: "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18) Referring to the Gospel of Luke 10:25-37, we understand that the neighbor refers to any person in need of help.
"The whole law and the prophets hang on these two commandments." - Jesus Christ, Son of David
And while the Pharisees were gathered around him, Jesus asked them:
"What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" The Pharisees replied, "He is the son of David."
He said to them, "How then did David call him 'Lord' when he was inspired by the Spirit, saying,
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."
"If David calls him Lord, how can he be his son?"
No one could answer him anything, and no one dared to ask him any more questions after that.
Jesus criticizes the religious leaders.
Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to His disciples.
So he said, "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.
Therefore, do and observe all things whatsoever they tell you, but do not do as they do; for they say things and do not do them.
They burden people with heavy loads, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to follow them.
"All the righteous deeds they do, they do to be seen by people. They show off their piety, increasing the size of their phylacteries. #Their phylacteries. 5:23 Some Jews would write certain passages from the Scriptures and place them in small leather pouches, then tie them with cloth bands to their forehead or left arm, thereby displaying their great piety, and lengthen the fringes of their garments."
They love to sit in the best seats at feasts and in the front seats in the synagogues.
And they love it when people greet them with special salutations in the markets, calling them: "O Teacher."
But you are not to be called 'teacher,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
Do not let people call you 'Rabbi,' because you have one Rabbi, and you are all brothers.
The greatest among you must be your servant.
For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven; you yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those who are trying to enter go in.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Therefore you will receive the greater condemnation.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.
Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated!'
You foolish blind men! Which is greater, the gold in the temple, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
And you say, 'If someone swears by the altar, it is not binding, but if someone swears by the gift that is on the altar, it is binding!'
Oh fools! Which is greater, the offering on the altar, or the altar that makes the offering sacred?
For if anyone swears by the altar, he swears by it and by everything on it.
If anyone swears by the temple, he swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.
If anyone swears by the sky, he swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.
Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin. 23:23 These were plants whose seeds were used in cooking as spices, and they also had some medicinal uses. And you do the same with the rest of your possessions. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have done these without neglecting the others.
Oh ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel!
Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and self-indulgence.
You blind Pharisees! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, so that the outside also may be clean.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean.
So you also outwardly appear righteous to others, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you say, "If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken part in the killing of the prophets."
By this, you confirm that you are the descendants of those who killed the prophets.
So complete what your forefathers started.
"You snakes! How can you escape the judgment of hell?"
Therefore, I tell you that I will send you prophets, wise men and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town.
Therefore you shall be accounted for the blood of every innocent person shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah the son of Berechiah, #Abel ... Zechariah. 35:23 The first and last to be killed according to the time and text of the books of the Old Testament. (See Genesis 4:8, 2 Chronicles 24:20) He who was killed between the temple and the altar.
Truly I tell you, this generation will be held accountable for all these crimes. Jesus warns the people of Jerusalem.
"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you by God! How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing."
Behold, your house will be left to you as a desolate place!
For I say to you, you shall not see Me again until you say, 'Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!' #Blessed ... the Lord. 39:23 from Psalm 118: 26.
Jesus predicts the destruction of the Temple.
And Jesus went out of the temple, and was going his way; and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.
So Jesus said to them, "Do you see all these buildings? Truly I tell you, not one stone will be left on another; all will be thrown down."
While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
Then Jesus answered and said to them, "Take heed that no one deceives you."
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and they will deceive many.
You will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not alarmed. For these things must happen, but it will not be the end yet.
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes and famines.
But all these will be but the first pangs of childbirth.
"They will deliver you up to tribulation, and will kill you. And you will be hated by all nations because of My name.
At that time, many will abandon the faith, and they will hand one another over to the authorities, and they will hate one another.
False prophets will arise and deceive many.
And because of the increase of wickedness, the love of many will grow cold.
But he who endures to the end will be saved.
And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached throughout the whole world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.
"When you see the 'desolating sacrilege' (the desolator) - #desolating_sacrilege. 15:24 See the book of Daniel 9:27, 12:11, and also Matthew 11:31. This is what the prophet Daniel referred to, standing in the holy place - let the reader understand this statement."
"Therefore, when you see the 'abomination of desolation' spoken of by Daniel the prophet standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains."
Nor does he who is on the roof come down to take anything out of his house.
A worker in the field does not return home to take his cloak.
How difficult were the conditions of pregnant and nursing women in those days!
But pray that your flight will not be in winter, or on a Sabbath.
For then there will be a great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be.
Even if God had not decided to shorten those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of His chosen people, God will shorten those days.
If anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There he is!' do not believe it.
For many false Christs and false prophets will arise, and they will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect of God.
I told you everything before it happened.
Someone may say to you, ‘Look, the Christ is in the desert,’ do not go out there. Or, ‘He is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it.
For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the Son of Man appear.
Wherever you find the corpse, you will also find the vultures.
And immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with great power and glory.
And He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather those He has chosen from the four corners of the earth, from one end of heaven to the other.
Learn from the fig tree. As soon as its branches become tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
Even so, when you see all these things, you know that the time is near, at the doors. 33:24 Compare with the Gospel of Luke 21:31.
Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. Only the Father knows.
But no one knows the day or the hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark.
For they did not know when the flood would come and take them away. So also will it be in the day when the Son of Man comes.
At that time, two men will be working in the field; one will be taken, and the other left.
And two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
So be vigilant, for you do not know when your Lord will come.
Make sure that if the homeowner knew what time of night the thief intended to come, he would wake up and not let him rob his house.
Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. The good servant and the evil servant.
"Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom the master will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the proper time?"
Blessed is that servant whom his master finds doing his duty when he comes.
I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his property.
As for the wicked servant, he says to himself, "My master is delaying his coming."
So he began to beat his fellow servants, and he began to eat and drink with the drunkards.
Then the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know.
So He will punish him and place him with the hypocrites, where people will weep and gnash their teeth.
Like ten girls.
Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them are stupid, and five are smart.
So the foolish ones took their lamps, but they did not take extra oil with them.
As for the wise virgins, they took extra oil in their pitchers with their lamps.
So the bridegroom tarried, and all the maids slept and were refreshed.
But at midnight there was a cry: 'Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.'
Then the maids awoke and trimmed their lamps.
And the foolish said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
Then the wise virgins answered, saying, "We cannot, because there will not be enough for us and for you. Instead, go to the dealers and buy oil for yourselves."
While they were going to buy oil, the bridegroom arrived. The wise ones were ready, and they entered the wedding feast with him. Then the door was shut.
Finally, the rest of the girls came and said, "Master, Master, open the door for us."
But he said to them, "I tell you the truth, I do not know you."
Therefore you also must be ready, because at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man will come. (This is similar to the parable of the three servants.)
The kingdom of heaven is also like a man who was about to go on a journey. He called his servants and entrusted his possessions to them.
So he gave five bags of gold to one, two bags to another, and one bag to the third. He gave each according to his ability. Then he immediately went on a journey.
So the one who had received the five bags of gold began to invest in trading with them right away, and he gained five more bags.
And the one who took the two bags acted like the first, and gained two more bags.
As for the one who took one bag, he went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money in it.
And after a long time, the master of these slaves returned and began to settle accounts with them.
Then the one who had received the five bags came forward, brought five more bags, and said, 'Sir, you gave me five bags; here are five more that I have gained.'
And his lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord.'
Then the one who had received the two bags came and said, "Sir, you gave me two bags, and here are two more that I have gained."
And his lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord.'
Then he who had received one bag came and said, "Master, I know that you are a hard man; you reap where you did not sow, and gather where you did not scatter seed.
I was afraid of you, so I went and hid your bag in the ground. Take your money.
So his master answered him, 'You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not scatter?
So why didn't you deposit my money in the bank, and when I returned, I would take my money with interest?
So take the bag from him, and give it to the owner of the ten bags.
For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
As for that worthless slave, throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers.
"And when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all his angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne.
Then all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
Then he will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.'
Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father. Inherit the kingdom that has been prepared for you since the creation of the world.
For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you welcomed me.
I was naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and you visited me. I was in prison, and you came to me.
The righteous will ask him: "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?"
And when did we see you as a stranger and shelter you, or naked and clothe you?
And when we saw you sick or imprisoned, we visited you.
Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.'
Then the King will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his angels.
For I was hungry, and you gave me no food; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink.
'I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.'
The wicked will answer him, "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not provide for you what you needed?"
Then the King will say to them, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.'
And so the wicked will go to eternal punishment, but the righteous will go to eternal life.
The Jewish leaders are planning to kill Jesus.
After Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,
You know that after tomorrow is Passover, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the hands of his enemies to be crucified.
The chief priests and the elders of the people had assembled in the palace of the high priest Caiaphas.
And they planned to arrest Jesus by deceit and kill Him.
And they said, "We should not do this during the feast, lest there be a riot among the people." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
While Jesus was in the town of Bethany, in the house of Simon the Leper,
A woman came to him with an alabaster jar full of precious ointment, and she poured it on his head as he was at table.
When his disciples saw this, they were indignant and said, "Why this waste?"
It was possible for this perfume to be sold for a large sum of money that would be given to the poor.
So Jesus knew what they were discussing, and he said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good deed for me."
You will always have the poor among you, #the_poor ... always. 11:26 See Deuteronomy 15:11. But I will not always be with you.
I poured perfume over my body to prepare it for burial.
I tell you the truth, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her." Judas Iscariot betrays Jesus.
Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,
And he said unto them, "What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you?" And they counted unto him thirty pieces of silver.
From that moment on, Judas began to look for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. At the Passover meal.
On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?"
So Jesus said to them, "Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to Me, and if anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying them?' say, 'The Lord has need of them.'"
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.
And when the evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with his twelve disciples.
As they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
So they were sad, and began to ask him one by one, "Is it I, Lord?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me.
"The Son of Man is going according to what is written about him, but woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born!"
Judas, who was about to betray him, asked, "Is it I, Teacher?" Jesus replied, "You have said so." - The Last Supper
And as they were eating, he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “Take; this is my body.”
Then he took a cup of wine, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from this, all of you."
For this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
And I tell you, I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of my Father."
After that, they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus predicts Peter's denial.
Then Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away because of me tonight. For it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'"
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
So Peter answered him, "Even if everyone loses faith in you, I will never lose faith."
So Jesus said to him, "Truly I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
And Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. And all the disciples spake likewise. Jesus prayed alone.
Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to feel sorrowful and troubled.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
Jesus withdrew from them a little and knelt down, praying, "Father, if it is your will, take this cup away from me; yet not my will, but yours be done." #Matthew 26:39 (NIV) The cup refers to the cup of suffering and pain, repeated in verse 42.
And he came to his disciples, and found them sleeping. Then he said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
"Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
And he withdrew again and prayed, saying, "Father, if this cup cannot pass from me unless I drink it, your will be done."
Then he returned again, and found them asleep; for their eyes were heavy.
So he left them and went away again to pray a third time, saying the same words again as before.
Then he returned to the disciples and found them sleeping. "Could you men not keep watch with me for one hour?" he asked them. "Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak."
Rise up, let us go. Behold, he who betrayed me draws near." The arrest of Jesus
While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large mob armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
The traitor had given them a sign, saying, "Whomever I kiss is the wanted man; seize him."
So he went up to Jesus and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Then Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you have come for." So they came up and seized Jesus and took him into custody.
Then one of those who were with Jesus put his hand to his sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
So Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you not realize that I can call on my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?
But, if they did, how would the books that proclaimed that these things would happen this way be fulfilled?
At that moment Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out against me with swords and clubs as if I were a criminal? I used to sit daily in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me."
But this has happened to fulfill what the prophets wrote." Then all the disciples deserted him and fled! Jesus before the Jewish leaders
Afterward, those who had arrested Jesus led him to the house of Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had gathered.
But Peter followed him at a distance, and entered the courtyard of the high priest's house. He went in and sat with the guards to see the outcome.
And the chief priests and all the council sought for false witness against Jesus, to put him to death.
But they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two men came forward,
And they said, "This is the man, #This man. 61:26 Jesus, for his enemies avoided speaking his name! He said, 'I can destroy the temple of God and build it in three days.'"
So the high priest stood up and said, "Will you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
Then Jesus said to him, "You have said so. I am. And I say to you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the power of God, and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? You have now heard the blasphemy."
So what judgment do you render? They answered, "He deserves death."
Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists and slapped him.
And they said to him, "Prophesy to us, Christ, who hit you?" Peter denies Jesus.
Meanwhile, Peter was sitting in the courtyard outside. So a servant girl of the high priest came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean."
But Peter denied it before everyone, saying, "I don't understand what you're talking about!"
Then he went out to the gateway, and another servant girl saw him and said to those who were there, "This man was with Jesus the Nazarene."
Then Peter denied it again, and swore, "I do not know this man."
And after a little while those who stood by came and said to him, "You are truly one of them, for your accent betrays you."
Then he began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man!" And immediately a rooster crowed. (Mark 14:71, NIV)
Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.
Jesus before Governor Pilate
And on the next day, the chief priests and the elders of the people came together, and consulted that they might kill Jesus.
They bound him, led him away, and delivered him to Governor Pilate. Judas killed himself.
When Judas, who had betrayed Jesus, saw that Jesus was condemned to death, he repented and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
And he said to them, "I have sinned by delivering an innocent man to be killed." And they said to him, "What is that to us? See to it yourself."
So Judas threw the pieces of silver in the temple and left, and went away and hanged himself.
So the chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money."
So they decided to buy Potter's Field with it to bury the strangers.
And to this day, the field is known as the "Field of Blood."
And so was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken by the prophet Jeremiah: "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price at which the children of Israel valued him.
"And they paid its price, thirty pieces of silver, as the Lord commanded me." #They took... the Lord. 10:27 See Zechariah 11:12-13 and Jeremiah 32:6-9. Jesus before Pilate.
And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said, "You have said so."
And when the chief priests and elders complained about him, he said nothing.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear all these accusations that they are making against you?"
But Jesus gave no answer to any of the accusations against him, to Pilate's amazement. Pilate failed to release Jesus.
And it was the governor's custom at the feast to release to the crowd a prisoner whom they would choose.
And there was a famous prisoner, a man named Barabbas. #Barabbas. 16:27 Or "Jesus Barabbas" as some Greek manuscripts have it.
So when the people were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Jesus which is called Christ, or Barabbas?
For Pilate knew that the chief priests had delivered Jesus unto him through envy.
Now as Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him this message, “Have nothing to do with that righteous Man; for last night I suffered greatly in a dream because of Him.”
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for the release of Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
Then the governor asked, "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" And they answered, "Barabbas."
Then Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said to him, "Let Him be crucified!"
Then Pilate said to them, "Why? What has he done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify him!"
When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood. It is your responsibility."
And all the people said, "His blood be on us and on our children."
Then Pilate released Barabbas to them. He ordered Jesus to be flogged and handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
Then the governor's soldiers led Jesus to the governor's palace, and they gathered the whole battalion around him.
They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, #They clothed him ... with purple. 27:28 a sign of mockery, since this was the color of a king's robe.
And they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand. And they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”
Then they spat on him, took the reed from his hand, and began to strike him on the head.
When they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him. Jesus on the Cross.
And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the country, and laid on him the cross to carry behind Jesus.
And when they came to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, the place of a skull,
They offered Jesus wine mixed with a bitter substance to drink. When he tasted it, he refused to drink it.
When they had crucified Jesus, they divided his clothes among them and cast lots for his garments.
Then they sat there guarding him.
And they put up over his head the written charge against him: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
And Jesus was crucified with two criminals, one on his right and one on his left.
And the passersby were reviling him, shaking their heads.
And they said, "You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"
The chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him and said,
He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him!
He trusted in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him. For he said, 'I am the Son of God.'
And the two criminals who were crucified with him also reviled him with similar words. The death of Jesus.
And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
Around the third hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" that is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" #Eli ... sabachthani. 27:46 from Psalm 22:1.
When some of the bystanders heard this, they said, "He is calling Elijah!" #CallingElijah. 47:27 The word "Eli" in Hebrew and "Elo" in Aramaic resemble the name "Elijah," which is that of a well-known prophet who lived around 850 BC.
Then one of the bystanders ran and got a sponge; he filled it with wine, put it on a reed, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The rest said, "Let's wait and see if Elijah will come to save him!"
Then Jesus cried out again in a loud voice and breathed his last.
And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. 51:27 The veil that separated the Most Holy Place from the rest of the Jewish temple. The Most Holy Place represented the divine presence. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split.
And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;
And when Jesus had risen, those bodies came out of their graves, entered into the holy city, and appeared to many.
As for the Roman officer, #Roman officer. 54:27 literally "centurion." And the guards who were guarding the body of Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the other events, were very terrified and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
And there were women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joses, and Salome, who also followed him and ministered to him when he was in Galilee.
Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. #Zebedee's sons. 27:56 James and John. They buried Jesus.
And when the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple.
So Joseph went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered that the body be given to him.
So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
Then he laid it in its new tomb, which he had hewn out of the rock, and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and went away.
And Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there, opposite the sepulcher, watching the burial of Jesus.
And on the next day, after Friday had ended, the chief priests and the Pharisees met with Pilate,
And they said unto him, Master, we remember how that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.
So he gave orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day, to prevent his disciples from coming and stealing the body, and then claiming to everyone that he had been raised from the dead. That would be a worse deception than the first one.
So Pilate said to them, "Take soldiers and go and make sure of everything by your knowledge."
So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting guards.
The translation of "قيامة يسوع" into English is "Resurrection of Jesus."
After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to the tomb.
And at that moment there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, approached the tomb, rolled back the stone that was at the door, and sat on it.
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow.
So the guards were very afraid of him and became like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid; I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
He is not here, for he has risen just as he said. Come and see the place where he was lying.
Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Behold, I have told you."
Then the women left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy, and ran to tell Jesus' disciples what had happened.
Suddenly Jesus met them and said, "Greetings." The women came up to him, took hold of his feet, and bowed down to him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me."
As the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
So the chief priests and the elders came together and discussed the matter, and they decided to give the soldiers a large sum of money.
And they said unto them, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.
If this news reaches the governor, we will convince him and keep you safe.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus spoke to his disciples.
And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
And when they saw him, they prostrated before him, though some of them had doubts.
So Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age."
John the Baptist
This is the beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
For it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah, "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way."
A voice cries out in the wilderness: "Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight his paths."
John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness and calling on people to be baptized as a sign of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the country of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him, and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
His clothing was made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
And he declared, "After me comes a man who is greater than I am, and I am not worthy even to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandal.
"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." - Jesus' Baptism
In those days, Jesus came from the town of Nazareth in the region of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
And in that moment, as he emerged from the water, he saw the heavens open, and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in the form of a dove.
And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased." - The Gospel of Matthew (English translation of the Arabic text provided)
Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him. Jesus chooses some of his disciples
After John was arrested, Jesus went to the region of Galilee and began preaching the gospel of God.
And he said, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in this gospel."
As he walked along the Galilean lake shore, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting their net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
So Jesus said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men."
So they left their nets at once and followed him.
Then he walked a little further, and saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John in their boat, mending their nets.
Then Jesus called them, and leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, they went after Him. Jesus casts out an evil spirit.
Then they went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.
So they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.
In the synagogue there was a man with an unclean spirit. The spirit cried out,
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!"
Jesus rebuked him and said, "Be silent and come out of him!"
So the unclean spirit, after tearing the man and throwing him into convulsions, came out of him with a shriek.
And they were all amazed, and began to say to one another, "What is this new teaching? With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him."
And the news about him spread throughout all the region of Galilee. Jesus healed many.
Then they left the crowd and went with Jacob and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
And Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever. And they told Jesus about her.
So he came near and took her hand and made her rise. And the fever left her, and she began to serve them.
That evening, as the sun was setting, they brought to him all who were sick and those who were possessed by demons.
So all the people of the city were gathered at the door of the house.
Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. But he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Preparing to proclaim the gospel.
And in the early morning, while it was still dark, Jesus went out alone to a secluded place to pray.
So Simon and those who were with him went out to look for him.
When they found him, they said to him, "Everyone is looking for you!"
So Jesus said to them, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so that I can preach there also. That is why I have come."
So he went throughout all the region of Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. Jesus heals a leper.
And a leper came to Jesus, kneeling down and beseeching him, and saying, "If you choose, you are able to make me clean."
Jesus, moved with compassion, reached out his hand and touched him, saying, "I do want to. Be made clean."
The leprosy left the man, and he became clean.
Then Jesus sternly warned him and sent him away.
He said to him, "See that you tell no one anything, but go, show yourself to the priest, and make the offering that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." 44:1 According to the law, it was the priest who determined when a leper was considered clean. And he was to present the offering for his cleansing as Moses had commanded. 44:1 See the Book of Leviticus 14:1-32. Then all will know that you have been healed."
But the man went away and began to publicize the news of his healing far and wide, so that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. Instead, he stayed in secluded places, and people kept coming to him from all directions.
Jesus heals a paralytic.
And after some days, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and the news of his return spread abroad.
And the crowd gathered around him until there was no longer room for them, not even near the door. And he was preaching the word of God to them.
So they brought to him a paralytic, carried by four men.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging out the tiles, they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
And some of the scribes were sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
"Why is this man speaking in this manner? He is insulting God with his words! Who but God alone can forgive sins?"
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Why do you entertain such thoughts in your hearts?"
Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'?
But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." So he said to the paralyzed man,
I say to you, rise, take up your bed, and go to your house!
So he got up immediately, took up his pallet, and went out in front of everyone. They were all amazed and glorified God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!" And Levi followed Jesus.
And again Jesus came to the lake. And a large crowd gathered around him, following him on the way.
As Jesus walked along, he saw Levi, also called Matthew, sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples. For there were many who followed Jesus when he called Levi.
When the Pharisees and teachers of the law saw him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they asked his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners." A question about fasting.
It was the time of the Pharisees and John's disciples for fasting. Some people came to Jesus and asked him, "Why do John's disciples and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
So Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast.
No one tears a patch from a new garment to mend an old one; for that patch would shrink and tear the old garment, and the tear would be worse.
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost and the skins are ruined. New wine calls for new wineskins. Jesus: Lord of the Sabbath
On a Sabbath day, Jesus was going through some fields, and His disciples began to pluck the heads of grain as they went along.
Then the Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!"
He said to them, "Have you never read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and his companions?"
He entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the priest, and ate the showbread, and gave also to those who were with him. Although it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat that bread. #26:2 See 1 Samuel 21:1-6.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
And so the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath as well.
Jesus heals on the Sabbath.
Jesus went again into the synagogue, and there was a man there whose hand was withered.
And some people were watching him closely, to see if he would heal him, so that they might find a reason to accuse him.
So he said to the man with the withered hand, "Stand up and come forward!"
Then he said to them, "Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath? To save a life or to kill?" And they were silent.
Then Jesus looked around at them in anger and was saddened by their hardness of heart. He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand," and he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
So the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the followers of Herod to find a way to kill Jesus. Many were following Jesus.
And Jesus with his disciples went to the lake of Galilee, and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea.
And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from the region beyond the Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude came to him, because they heard what great things he did.
So Jesus asked his disciples to prepare a boat for him, so that the crowds would not crush him.
Since Jesus had healed many, all who had any sick with them came to him, hoping to touch him.
And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.
He strongly warns her not to reveal who he is. The choice of the twelve.
Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they went to him.
And Jesus chose twelve men and named them apostles, to be with Him and to send them out to preach.
And he gave them authority to cast out demons.

And Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. The power of Jesus was from God, and Jesus returned to the house.
And the people came to him again, bringing their sick and those possessed by demons. And he healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed around him to touch him. And as many as touched him were made well. And wherever he went, into villages or cities or fields, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment. And all who touched him were made well. And he sternly charged them that they should not make him known. But the more he charged them, the more zealously they proclaimed it. And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."
When Jesus' family heard about this, they came to take him home with them, for the people were saying, "He is out of his mind."
As for the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem, they said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul!" and, "By the prince of demons he drives out demons." #Beelzebul 22:3 One of the names of the devil.

For if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
A house divided against itself cannot stand.
