The genealogy of Jesus Christ (Luke 3:23–38)
This is the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:
Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren.
And Judah begat Pharez and Zarah, of Tamar; and Pharez begat Hezron, and Hezron begat Ram.
And Aram had Nahor, and Nahor had Terah. And Terah had Abram, Nahor and Haran.
And Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab. And Boaz begat Obed of Ruth. And Obed begat Jesse.
And David took Solomon from her, whom he begat of Uriah.
And Solomon begat Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begat Abijah, and Abijah begat Asa.
And Jehoshaphat begat Jehoram. And Jehoram begat Ahaziah.
And Azariah begat Joatham. And Joatham begat Ahaz. And Ahaz begat Hezekiah.
And Hezekiah begat Manasseh. And Manasseh begat Amon. And Amon begat Josiah.
And Josiah begat Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time when the deportation to Babylon took place.
And after their exile, in Babylon, Jehoiachin fathered Shealtiel. Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel.
Zerubbabel begat Abiud; Abiud, Eliakim; Eliakim, Azor.
And Azor had Sadoc. Sadoc begat Achim. Achim begat Eliud.
And Eliezer begat Rebekah. And Rebekah begat Jacob.
And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
Thus there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile in Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Christ. The birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: Luke 2:1-7
And this is how Jesus Christ was born: Mary, his mother, was betrothed to Joseph, and before they lived together, she was found with child through the power of the Holy Spirit.
Yousef, her fiancé, decided to leave her without exposing her, as he was a God-fearing man.
And he was thinking about this, when behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit."
And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins."""
And all of this came to pass so that the words spoken by the Lord, on the tongue of the Prophet, might be fulfilled:
# Isaiah 7:14 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. (which being interpreted is, God with us).
When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel had commanded him in his dream, and brought his wife back home.
And he did not sleep with her until she gave birth to a son, and he named him Jesus.
The School of Wisdom
When Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in the land of Judaea, during the reign of King Herod, wise men from the East arrived in Jerusalem.
They said: "Where is the King of the Jews who has been born? We saw his star in the east and have come to pay him homage."
And when King Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
And the chief priests and the scribes inquired of them, saying, Where is the place where this child is to be born?
They answered him: "In Bethlehem of Judaea, for thus it is written by the Prophet:
# Micah 5:2 As for you, O Bethlehem of Ephrathah, you are but a small village among thousands in Judah. Yet a ruler of Israel, whose origins are from of old, will come from you on my behalf; his goings forth are from long ago, from ancient times.
But Herod called together the wise men secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and search diligently for the young Child; and when you have found Him, bring me word, that I also may come and worship Him."
After they had heard the king's words, they set out. And behold, as they went, the star which they had seen in the east went before them, until it came and stood over the place where the young child was.
And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy;
And they entered the house and saw the Child with Mary His mother. They prostrated themselves and fell down before Him; and opening their treasures, they presented to Him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
And in a dream God warned them not to return to Herod, so they departed for their country by another way. Flight into Egypt
And when the wise men had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to destroy him."
My brother, Joseph, woke up, shook the baby, and set off for Egypt in the night.
# He was eleven days old when Herod died. Thus was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called my son." The slaughter of the infants at Bethlehem
And when Herod saw that he was mocked by the wise men, he was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.
Behold, the thing that the prophet Jeremiah spoke came to pass:
# Jeremiah 31:15 *In Ramah there was weeping and mourning and great lamentation.* *Rachel was weeping for her children and refused to be comforted, for they were no more.* *The return from Egypt to Nazareth.*
And when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
And they said: Arise! Shake off the dust, and return to the land of Israel. For those who sought his life have perished.
My brother picked up the child, shook him, and returned to the Land of Israel.
As Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as king over Judea, Joseph feared him. An angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and told him to go to the region of Galilee.
And he went to a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, that he should be called a Nazarene.
The Proclamation of John the Baptist (Mark 1:1–8; Luke 3:1–18; John 1:19–28)
And in those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea.
And he said: «Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!»
*Isaiah* **40**:3 Behold, I will send My messenger, and he will prepare My way before Me. And the Lord, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to His temple, Even the Messenger of the covenant, in whom you delight. Behold, he comes, says the *Lord of hosts*.
And John's clothing was made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
And people were coming and going from Jerusalem and all Judea and the region around the Jordan.
And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against Me, even that they went after idols, and served them.
And when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them: "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Do things that show them you're the one.
Do not say in your hearts: "We are the children of Abraham." I tell you, God is able to raise children of Abraham even from these stones.
The axe is already laid at the tree trunks. The unproductive trees will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
Anna I baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
And he shook the stalk of the plant, and the ripe grain fell into his hand. He scattered the chaff, and the wind carried it away. The wheat he gathered into his granary, but the chaff he burned with fire that never goes out." John's baptism of Jesus (Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21-22)
And Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
John would not let him, and said, "I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?"
But Jesus answered him, "Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting that we fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented.
And when Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
And a voice from the sky said: "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness. And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.
And the Holy Ghost came down upon Him, and straightway the Spirit driveth Him into the wilderness.
My brother fasted forty days and forty nights until he was hungry.
Let these rocks become bread.
# Matthew 4:3 Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"`
And they shook the place where he was, and brought him to the edge of the temple; and as they were letting him down,
Psalm 91:11-12: > They said, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down, for it is written, 'He will give His angels charge concerning You,' > and, 'On their hands they will bear You up, Lest You strike Your foot against a stone.' "
Jesus answered, "It is also written, 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
Shaking Heaven's vault and placing it above a high mountain. Behind it are all the kingdoms of this world and the glory within them,
They said: "We shall bestow upon you this whole thing, if you can, for a whole month, cause your mounts to bow down to the ground and prostrate yourself before us."
Deuteronomy 6:13; Matthew 8:33 And Jesus answered him, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
And the Spirit immediately drove Him into the wilderness. And He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and He was with the wild beasts, and the angels ministered to Him. Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit; and news of Him spread through all the surrounding district.
And when Jesus heard it, He withdrew Himself into the region of Galilee.
And he departed from Nazareth and came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the seashore, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:
To fulfill the word of the Prophet Isaiah:
# Isaiah 9:1-2 The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, By the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles!
The people who sat in darkness saw a great light; Those who sat in the land of the shadow of death, Upon them a light shone.
And in those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And immediately, coming up from the water, He saw the heavens being torn open, and the Spirit descending on Him like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, "You are My beloved Son, in You I am well pleased." And immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness. And He was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan; and He was with the wild beasts, and the angels were ministering to Him. Now after John had been taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of heaven is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel." As He walked by the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. And He said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men." Immediately they left their nets and followed Him. And going on from there He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them, and immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him. And He went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity among the people.
And Jesus walked by the Sea of Galilee, and saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers.
And He saith unto them, Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.
And their nets broke at the same time, and they followed him.
He was walking along and saw two other brothers, Jacob, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John, in their boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets.
And He came down with them and stood on a level place; and a great multitude of His disciples were gathered together, and a great number of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were healed. And all the multitude sought to touch Him, for power came forth from Him and healed them all. (Luke 6:17-19)
And Jesus went round all the cities of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and healing every disease and every infirmity among the people.
And he healed people all over Syria. Those who were afflicted with various diseases and ailments came to him, and those who were possessed by demons, and epileptics, and paralytics; and he healed them.
And many followed Him from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.
The Sermon on the Mount (Luke 6:20–23): > "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. > Blessed are you who hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. > Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh. > Blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of Man. > Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven. For so their fathers did to the prophets."
And Jesus, the Scout, went up on the mountain, and sat down; and his disciples came unto him:
And he began to teach them, saying:
Health to the poor in spirit! For theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.
Health to the sorrowful! May they find comfort.
Health to the good ones! They're the ones who will inherit the earth.
Health to the hungry and thirsty for justice! Their hunger and thirst shall be satisfied.
Health to those who show mercy! May they be merciful.
Health to those whose hearts are pure! May they see the Face of God.
Health to those who reconcile people! May they be called the children of God.
Health to those who suffer for justice's sake! The Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.
Health to you when people taunt and torture you, and say all the bad things about you! It's all on my mind!
Rejoice and leap for joy, for your reward is great in heaven. For so they persecuted the prophets before you." Salt and Light (Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34-35)
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt has lost its taste, how can its savour be restored? It is no longer good for anything, and is discarded, trodden under people's feet.
You are the light of the world. No city built on a mountain can be hidden.
And no one lights a lamp and puts it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on a stand and it shines for all in the house.
Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.
What's in your minds is not why I came to set aside the Shariah and the Prophets. I did not come to do that, but to fulfill them.
I swear by Allah: The sky and the earth will never deviate from the truth, not even by a single letter or a dot, until the Day of Judgment. Not a single law will be changed until everything is fulfilled.
Whoever obeys and teaches these least commandments, and leads others to do the same, will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever disobeys and teaches others to disobey will be called least in the kingdom of heaven.
"Truly I tell you, if you have not a more righteous attitude than that of the scribes and the Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven." Cheating.
You shall not murder; anyone who murders shall be put to death.
Ama Ana Rani naglikum: Whoever cheats his brother shall be judged by the court, and whoever says to his brother: 'You are foolish', shall be judged by the Jewish council, and whoever says to his brother: 'You are a beast', shall enter the hellfire.
When you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,
Present your offering at the altar, and as you go, be reconciled to your brother. Then come and offer your gift.
And if someone complains about you, you should make amends with them quickly before going to court, otherwise they might complain to the judge, the judge will ask the police about you, and you'll end up in jail.
"I tell you the truth: you won't leave here until you've paid the very last cent."
# Deut 20:14, Exod 20:18 "You shall not covet."
Behold, I will transport you, O ye who gaze upon women, desiring them, into the very hearts of those whom you lust after.
If your eye makes you sin, pluck it out and cast it away, for it is better that you lose one of your members, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
"If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed than to have two hands and go into hell. (Matthew 19:9, Mark 10:11-12, Luke 16:18)"
Deuteronomy 24:1-4 "When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house."
As Anna Rani says: "He who divorces his wife on grounds other than adultery, compels her to commit adultery. And he who marries a divorced woman, commits adultery himself."
# Leviticus 19:12; Numbers 30:2; Deuteronomy 23:21 "You shall not swear falsely by My name, and so profane the name of your God; I am the LORD.
Oath not by the heaven with its exalted Throne,
# Isaiah 66:1; Acts 7:49; Psalm 48:2 Not on earth has he found a place for his dwelling, nor is his tent set among men.
And don't swear by your head, for you cannot even return a white or black hair.
Let your 'Yes' mean 'Yes,' and your 'No,' 'No.' Anything more than this comes from the evil one. (Luke 6:29-30)
# Leviticus 21:24; Numbers 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21 "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
As Anna told you: Don't get revenge when people do bad things to you. But if someone strikes you on the right cheek, offer them the other one as well.
Whoever wants to fight you and take you away, let them take your burnous too.
If one forces you to walk a kilometer with them, walk two.
Give to everyone who asks of you, and from one who takes away your goods do not demand them back. Love your enemies. (Luke 6:27-28, 32-36)
"Love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy."
Ama Ana naglikum: Habu aadmaikum wa saliu min ajli llati yadhalimufikum,
To be sons of your Father in heaven. For He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
What's the pay if you love those who love you back? Why isn't this done by those who collect taxes, huh?
What have other people concluded about it, if you haven't received it yourselves? Don't those who are unaware of God do such things with their own hands?
You need to be perfect, just as your Father in Heaven is perfect.
Charity
Beware of practicing your righteousness before men, to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father in heaven.
When you give to the needy, do not announce it with a trumpet, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and the streets, to be honored by others. I tell you the truth: They have received their reward.
As for you, when you give, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
Let your charitable deeds be done in secret, and let your left hand not know what your right hand is doing. And may your Father who sees in secret reward you. (Prayer - Luke 11:2-4)
And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that others may see them. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.
O you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
And do not keep repeating empty talk like other nations, who think that their many words will be heard by God.
Don't be like them, because your parents know what you need before you even ask for it.
Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name.
Let your kingdom come, let your will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who wrong us.
We didn't venture into it, and we were saved from evil.
And if you forgive people their faults, your heavenly Father will forgive you yours.
"But if you do not forgive others their faults, neither will your Father in Heaven forgive your own." Fasting.
And do not wear your fasting as a garb of pride and self-righteousness, like the hypocrites, who display a glum countenance to show others that they are fasting. I tell you the truth: they have received their reward.
O you, when you are fasting, comb your hair and wash your face,
"Take heed that you perform not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise you have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. And when you fast, be not as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward." (Riches, Luke 12:33-34)
Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust can destroy, and where thieves do not break in or steal;
"Wherever your treasure is, there your heart will be also." Nour el-Badan (Luke 11:34-36)
The eye is the lantern of the body. If your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye is unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how deep is that darkness!" God or Money (Luke 12:22–31; 16:13)
"One cannot serve two masters; he will either hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money."
Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?
Behold the birds of the sky: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of much more value than they?
Who among you can add even one hour to his life span?
And why think about clothes? Look at the thorns of the Bougaroun tree, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin.
Ama Ana neqlekum: Even King Solomon in all his majesty never wore anything as exquisite as this!
If God wears cannabis this chemically, surely it's you who should fear being clothed in the flames of Hell, for your faith is weak!
That's why you shouldn't worry and ask yourselves: 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'
The things which you desire, those who are not believers seek them also. But your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you openly.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
That's why you shouldn't think about tomorrow. Tomorrow will think about itself. Each day has enough evil of its own.»
Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned. Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven. Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.
Do not judge others so that you will not be judged.
> The judgment you pass on others will be passed upon you, and the measure with which you measure will be measured back to you.
Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye, but don't notice the board in your own eye?
How can you tell your brother: "Let me remove the speck from your eye", when there's a plank in your own eye?
O hypocrite! Remove the plank from your own eye first; then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them underfoot and turn and maul you. (Luke 11:9-13)
Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.
Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened.
Whoever among you gives their child a stone when they ask for bread?
Do they ask for a whale and are given a snake?
If you evil ones know how to give good things to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. That is what the law and the prophets teach. The Narrow Gate (Luke 13:24)
Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and those who enter through it are many.
As the narrow and difficult path that leads to life is, few find it. "(The Tree and Its Fruit - Luke 6:43-44)
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravening wolves.
Their harvest betrays them. Does the bramble bring forth the grape, or the thorn the fig?
Not every tree that appears fruitful bears good fruit, nor every apparently barren one lacks it.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.
Not every tree bears good fruit; cut such trees down and throw them into the fire.
"But you will say, 'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.' He will reply, 'I tell you, I don't know you. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity!'" (Luke 13:25-27)
> Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in Heaven.
On the Day of Judgment many will say to Me: "Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in Your name? And cast out demons in Your name? And do many mighty works in Your name?"
And I say unto you, *'I never knew you*: *depart from me*, ye workers of iniquity!'**." (Luke 6:47-49)
The one who listens to my words and acts upon them will be like a wise man who built his house upon stone.
The rain fell and floods came, the wind blew hard on that house, but it didn't fall, because its foundation was built of stone.
And he who hears My words and does not act accordingly is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
And it rained, and there were floods, and the wind blew on that house, and it fell, and there was no trace of it left.»
And when Jesus had finished speaking, the people were astonished at His teaching.
On his own authority he taught them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.
The leper's malice (Mark 1:40-45; Luke 5:12-16)
When Jesus came down from the mountain, a large crowd followed Him.
And a leper approached and bowed down before Him, saying, "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean."
And they said, "We love you!" And behold, his leprosy was cleansed.
# Matthew 14:2 And he said, Go and shew the ruler of the synagogue, Let my son be loosed; for he is sick nigh to death.
And Jesus entered Capernaum. Now a centurion's servant was sick, and lay at the point of death.
"My lord, my slave is lying paralyzed in the house; he's suffering greatly and can't move at all."
And Jesus said: «I will come and heal him.»
My master Mia's reply was: «My lord, I am not worthy of you coming into my humble abode. But say the word and my servant will be here in an instant.»
Queen Anna Rajel, I have a king, and I have an army that rules with me. I say to one, "Go!" and he goes. To another, "Come!" and he comes. To my slave, "Do this!" and he does it."
When Jesus heard it, he was amazed, and said to them that followed: "Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
Many will come from the east and the west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
As the children of the kingdom are destined to roam the dark, the night will be filled with their sobs and the howls of the years to come.**
And Jesus said to the centurion, "Go your way; let it be done for you as you have believed." And the servant was healed in that very hour. Peter's Mother-in-Law Healed (Mark 1:29-34; Luke 4:38-41)
When Jesus entered the house of Peter, He saw Peter's mother-in-law lying sick with a fever.
He touched her hand and the heat seemed to vanish from her body. She got up and stopped serving him.
That very evening, as the sun set, many people who were possessed by demons were brought to him, and with a word he drove out the evil spirits. He healed all the sick.
Sure, this is the translation of the text: # Isaiah 53:4: Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. Jesus and the World (Luke 9:57–62)
And when Jesus saw a great multitude coming toward Him, He gave a command to His disciples to have the people sit down by the sea.
And one of the scribes came up and said to Him, "Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go."
And Jesus said, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
And another of the disciples said: "Lord, let us first go and bury my father."
And Jesus said, "Let us go across to the other side." And as they got into the boat, the storm arose. And he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion. And they woke him and said to him, "Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?" And he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. And he said to them, "Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?" And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, "Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
When Jesus stepped into the boat, his disciples followed him.
There came a fierce storm on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but He was asleep.
And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying: "Master, Master, we perish!"
And Jesus said to them, *Why are you so fearful? O ye of little faith?* And he rose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.
And the people were amazed, and said: «Who is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?» The casting out of demons, and the healing of the sick. (Mark 5:1–20; Luke 8:26–39)
And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a great multitude gathered around Him; and behold, a ruler of the synagogue came, and fell down at His feet. And when he saw Him, immediately the spirit convulsed the man, and he fell on the ground and wallowed, foaming at the mouth. And Jesus, speaking to the spirit, said to it, "Come out of the man, unclean spirit!" And He asked him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Legion" — because many demons had entered him. And they begged Him earnestly not to command them to go out into the abyss. Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the mountain. And they begged Him, saying, "Send us into the swine, that we may enter them." And at once Jesus gave them permission. And the unclean spirits, having come out, went into the swine; and the herd, about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and were choking in the water.
And they shouted: "What have we to do with You, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?"
There were many allies grazing in a distant place.
And the devils implored him, saying: 'If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.'
He told them: "March!" And they walked and entered the caves. All the caves' inhabitants left them from the mountain edge to the sea and drowned in the water.
They escaped and entered the city and told them about everything, and about Ali who ran away from the two men possessed by demons.
Oh my brother, the people of the city came out to meet Jesus. They begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus Heals a Paralytic (Mark 2:1-12; Luke 5:17-26)
And Jesus got into the boat, and crossed over, and came to His own city.
And people brought him a paralytic lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven."
Some of the Jews said in their hearts, "This man is a blasphemer!"
But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said: "Why do you think evil in your hearts?
Is it easier to say: "Your sins are forgiven"? or to say: "Rise and walk"?
And He said, «You shall know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.» Then He said to the paralytic, «Rise, take up your bed and go home.»
Go to his place, dude.
And when the people saw what Jesus did, they were afraid, and they glorified the God who had given such authority to men. Jesus called Matthew (Mark 2:13-17; Luke 5:27-32).
As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. He said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
When Jesus was at the house of Matthew, sitting at the table, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat with him and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to His disciples, "Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
# He is 6:6 Go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have come to call not the righteous but sinners." (Mark 2:18-22; Luke 5:33-39)
John's disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Why is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The day will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then, on that day, they will fast.
There's no one who can patch up an old garment with new cloth, because the new cloth will shrink and pull from the old garment, making the tear even bigger.
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be ruined. Rather, new wine must be put into fresh wineskins. And everyone who has been drinking old wine does not immediately want new, for he says, 'The old is good.' "Little children and women were bringing him gifts and touching him; and a hemorrhaging woman, who had been suffering for twelve years, came up behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak. For she said to herself, 'If I only touch his garment, I will be made well.' And immediately her hemorrhage stopped, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. And Jesus, turning about and seeing her, said, 'Daughter, take courage; your faith has made you well.' And the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth. And he said to her, 'Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.' (Mark 5:21–43, Luke 8:40–56)
When Jesus spoke to them, a ruler of the synagogue came and knelt before Him and said, "My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live."
And Jesus rose and followed him, and so did his disciples.
A woman who had been suffering from a flow of blood for twelve years, came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His garment.
She thought to herself: «It would serve him right if he got a taste of his own medicine.»
The house of Jesus and his scouts said to her: "Your faith has healed you, daughter. Go in peace." And the woman was cured at once.
When Jesus arrived at the house of the Jewish leader, He saw the flute players and the noisy crowd,
He said: "Back off! She's not dead, she's just asleep."
When the people left, he entered, grabbed the girl by the hand and she got up.
The news about this spread throughout that whole region. Jesus healed two blind men.
As Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, "Son of David, have mercy on us!"
When he entered the house, two blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord."
And Jesus put his hands on their eyes, and said unto them, According to your faith be it unto you.
And their eyes were opened. Then Jesus sternly warned them, «See that no one knows!»
And they went out and preached the news everywhere in that region. Jesus healed every disease and sickness.
When the two blind men left, a group of people brought them a parrot, which was possessed by a demon.
Jesus cast out the demon, and the mute man spoke. The people were astounded and said, "We have never seen anything like this in Israel!"
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the prince of demons." Jesus healed many people, so that they might have the evidence of the sight; for he would not entrust himself to them, because he knew what was in a man's heart.
And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and healing every disease and every infirmity among the people.
When people saw them, they took pity on them, for they looked weary like sheep without a shepherd.
And He said to His disciples, "The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
Do not ask the Lord of Fortune for his servants to aid your Fortune.
The Twelve Apostles (Mark 3:13–19; Luke 6:12–16)
And he called his twelve disciples unto him, and gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.
These are the names of the Twelve: Simon, to whom He gave the name Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
And Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
Simon who loves his country, and Judas Iscariot who will betray Jesus. Jesus sends out the twelve (Mark 6:7-13; Luke 9:1-6).
Jesus sent out the twelve with these instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.
Go and find the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
And you, go and tell the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.
Do not carry gold or silver or copper in your belts,
Not a purse, nor a pair of trousers, nor sandals, nor a staff; for the servant is not worth it.
And whenever you enter a town or a village, search for a worthy person there, and stay at his house until you depart.
As you enter the house, greet the people inside.
And if the inhabitants of that house deserve it, let your greeting reach them; but if they do not deserve it, let your greeting return to you.
And if anyone will not receive you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or that city.
Mark ‏13‏:‏9‏-13: > "But be on your guard; for they will deliver you up to the councils, and you will be beaten in the synagogues. You will be brought before governors and kings for My sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles. And the gospel must first be preached to all the nations. So when they bring you before these authorities, do not worry about how or what you should speak. For it will be given to you in that very hour what you should say; for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child; children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death. You will be hated by all for My name's sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved." Luke ‏21‏:‏12‏-17: > "But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for My name's sake. It will turn out for a testimony to them. Therefore settle it in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer; for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict. You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers, relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death. And you will be hated by all for My name's sake. But not a hair of your head shall be lost. By your patience possess your souls."
We send you forth like sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
Beware, for the people want to kill you, thinking you have to do with the Council of the Jews; and they will also scourge you in their synagogues.
And you shall make them a diadem of honor for the sake of your masters and kings.
When they hand you the microphone, don't think about what to say or how to say it, because at that very moment, your speech will seize up.
For your sake, it's not you who are speaking, but the spirit that possesses you.
The brother betrays his brother to death; the father, his own son; and children rise up against their parents and put them to death.
And all the people will hate you because of My name. But not a hair on your head will perish.
And when they persecute you in one town, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish visiting all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
The student is not greater than his teacher, nor the servant greater than his master.
Is it not enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master? If they call the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they slander the members of his household! (Luke 12:2–7)
Do not fear them. Nothing hidden will remain undisclosed, and nothing secret will go unknown.
What you have to say in the dark, say it in the light; what you hear whispered, proclaim it from the housetops.
And fear not when they kill the body, and are not able to kill the soul. But fear Him when He is able to destroy both the soul and the body in Hell.
Isn't it two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them falls to the ground without your Father knowing.
Rahu until your hair's width is accounted for.
Don't worry, you're better than many others!
Whoever does not acknowledge Me before men, I will also not acknowledge him before My Father who is in heaven.
"Whoever denies me before men, I will also deny before my Father in heaven. Jesus and the World (Luke 12:51-53; 14:26-27)"
It never crossed my mind to come bring peace on Earth, I didn't come to bring peace but a sword.
I came to distinguish the son from his father, the little girl from her mother, and the daughter-in-law from her mother-in-law.
And one's enemies are a man's companions.
The one who loves their father or mother more than me does not deserve me. The one who loves their son or daughter more than me does not deserve me.
And he who takes up not his cross and follows Me is not worthy of Me.
"He who gains his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake and the gospel's will gain it. For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Mark 9:36-41"
The one who receives you receives Me, and the one who receives Me receives the One who sent Me.
The one who accepts a Prophet's invitation, does so out of pure intention. He will have the reward of a true believer. And he who accepts a righteous man's invitation, does so out of a righteous heart. He will have the reward of a righteous man.
And whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is My disciple, truly I tell you, he will never lose his reward."
The disciples of John the Baptist (Luke 7:18–35)
When Jesus had finished giving instructions to his twelve disciples, he left that place and taught and preached in the towns of the vicinity.
And John, while imprisoned, heard of the works of Christ, and sending two of his disciples, he said unto him, Art thou he that should come?
They asked: "Is it you who's coming, or should we expect someone else?"
Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you have seen and heard."
# Isaiah 35:5-6; 61:1; Luke 4:18-19 The blind will see, the lame will walk, the lepers will be cleansed, the deaf will hear, the dead will be raised, and the poor will have the gospel preached to them.
«His health is impeccable, no doubts about it!»
When Jesus' disciples had gone, he began to speak to the crowds about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?
What did you go out to see? A man in expensive clothes? Those who wear expensive clothes are in the palaces of the kings!
What did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, more than a prophet.
# Malachi 3:1; Mark 1:2 Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, Who shall prepare Your way.
I tell you the truth, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.
All the prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
And if you wish to believe, it is Elijah who shall come.
Let the one who has ears, hear!
What generation are we in, anyway? They're like kids in a marketplace, shouting at each other:
We played you a tune and you didn't sway, we sang you a song and you didn't cry.
John's eating and drinking, and you say, 'He has a demon.'
Come, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die. And He said: "A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, who stripped him and beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead. By chance a priest was going down that road; and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side."
And Jesus began to rebuke the cities wherein most of his mighty works had been done, because they repented not.
And he said: «Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
As Anna tells you: The state of Tyre and Sidon will be better than yours on Judgment Day.
And you, Capernaum! Do you want to be raised up to heaven? You shall be cast down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.
"And I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you." Jesus sighed. (Luke 10:21-22)
Jesus spoke at that time, saying, "Father, Lord of heaven and earth, I thank You that You have hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them to babes.
Yes, Daddy, that's how you wanted it.
Dad gave me everything. No one even knew the son and no one even knew the father and whoever the son chose, the father would show him to him.
I'll take the burden off your shoulders, guys. Your load is heavy.
Shake the balance of my belongings and learn from me, for I am kind and my heart is humble. And you will find peace in your souls.
"My path is not a heavy one, and my load is light."
Saturday (Mark 2:23–28; Luke 6:1–5)
At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and as they walked along they began to pick the heads of grain and eat them.
But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to Him, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
# Matthew 21:1-6; Luke 24:9. Jesus said to them, "Have you never read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and his men?
How did he enter the house of the Lord and eat the bread of the Presence? It was not lawful for him or his men to eat it; yet it was lawful for the priests to eat it.
# Surah ‏28‏:‏9‏-10 Why didn't you read in the scripture about how the priests in the Temple broke the Sabbath commandment and how no one blamed them?
As I tell you: There's One here greater than the Temple.
# 6:6 He is ‏9:13. And if they had known what that verse meant: "It is mercy I desire, not sacrifice." You would not have condemned the innocent.
"Behold, Anna the Queen, the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath." The man with the withered hand was healed on the Sabbath day (Mark 3:1–6; Luke 6:6–11).
And Jesus walked from that place, and entered their synagogue.
And there was a man with a withered hand. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"—hoping to find a reason to accuse him.
Jesus said to them, "Which one of you, having a sheep that falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, will not take hold of it and lift it out?"
And man's worth is much greater than his possessions! That is why it is permissible to do good on a Saturday.''
And Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand!" And he stretched it out, and it was restored to health just like the other.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted how to kill Jesus. Jesus on his part went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and there he remained. And many came to him. And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?" He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ." They asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" He answered, "No." They said to him then, "Who are you? We must give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?" He said, "I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord," as the prophet Isaiah said."
And Jesus, knowing this, withdrew from there. And many followed Him, and He healed them all.
And he ordered them not to inform anyone about him.
And this is so that what the Prophet Isaiah said comes true:
## Isaiah 42:1-4 > Behold! My Servant whom I uphold, My Chosen One in whom My soul delights! I have put My Spirit upon Him; He will bring forth justice to the nations. > He will not cry out, nor raise His voice, Nor cause His voice to be heard in the street. He will not break a bruised reed Or quench a smoldering wick; He will faithfully bring forth justice. > He will not grow faint or be crushed Until He has established justice in the earth; And the coastlands will wait expectantly for His law.
He neither roars nor shouts, not a soul in the streets hears his voice.
A staff that doesn't break Marda's disease, and a fuse that doesn't put out the smoke. Even when it makes right prevail.
And the peoples may have hope in His name. Jesus and Beelzebul (Mark 3:20-30; Luke 11:14-23; 12:10)
And at that time, a man who was blind and demon-possessed came to Him, and Jesus, after spitting on the man's eyes, healed him and he could both see and speak.
And everyone marveled, saying: "Is this the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "It is by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that he drives out demons."
And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them: Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:
If the devil casts out the devil, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?
And if Anna goes out with Beelzebub, who will your students go out with? That's who will judge you.
But if in the Spirit you are putting to the test who is speaking, you are not in the flesh.
And how would one enter the house of a strongman and take his belongings, unless the strongman's arm was twisted first? Only then could one take the items from his house?
The one who's not with me is against me, and who doesn't gather with me scatters.
That's why I tell you, all sins and blasphemies will be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"And whosoever shall say a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemies against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven. Neither in this world, nor in the world to come." The Tree and its Fruit (Luke 6:43-45)
"Let the tree be splendid and its yield splendid too, or let it be poor and its yield poor as well. The tree is known by its fruit.
O sons of Lfa'i, how can you speak of good things when your hearts are evil? The tongue speaks only what the heart contains.
The radiant human brings forth radiant things from their radiant heart, while the despicable one exudes despicableness from their despicable heart.
Their words, light as air, will come back to them on Judgment Day.
"By your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned." The Pharisees demanded a sign from heaven. (Mark 8:11-12, Luke 11:29-32)
At that time certain Pharisees and scribes said to Jesus, "Master, we wish to see a sign from thee."
And he answered them: "An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
# Jonah 1:17 Just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
# Jonah 3:5 And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they called a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least.
# I Kings 10:1-10; II Chronicles 9:1-12. The Queen of the South shall rise up in the judgment against the men of this generation and shall condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, a greater than Solomon is here! (Luke 11:24-26)
When the unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and finds none.
That time he said: "I want to go back to the house I left." And when he returned, he found it empty, cleaned and organized.
And when Jesus' mother and his brothers had come to him, they could not reach him because of the crowd. And he was told, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you." And he answered them, "My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it." Now it happened that as he was going on his way, a man ran up and knelt before him, and said to him, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and your mother.'" And he said to him, "Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth up." And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, "One thing you lack: go, sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me." And shocked at the saying he went away sorrowful, for he was one who owned much property. And Jesus, looking around, said to his disciples, "How hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!" And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." (Mark 3:31–35, Luke 8:19–21)
And while Jesus was still speaking to the people, behold, His mother and brothers stood outside, seeking to speak with Him.
There's someone saying: "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside; they want to speak with you."
And he answered the man who spoke to him: «Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?»
And He stretched out His hand towards His disciples, and said, "Here are My mother and My brothers!
«Whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother.»
Like a sower went forth to sow. (Mark 4:1-9; Luke 8:4-8)
And Jesus went out early in the morning of that day, and stood by the shore of the sea: and the people came unto him: and he taught them.
A lot of people gathered there and when he appeared in a boat, everyone rushed to the shore.
And he told them many things in proverbs: "The peasant went out to sow.
And when he sowed, some seed fell among the rocks, and the birds came and devoured it.
Another seed fell on stony ground, with very little soil, and it sprang up quickly, because it had no depth of earth.
When the sun rose, it burned and dried up; it had no veins.
And another seed fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked it.
Another seed fell into the rich soil of Bahia and bore fruit; some brought forth bitter waters, others sixty, and others thirty.
«Let the one who has ears, hear!» Why does Jesus speak in parables? (Mark 4:10-12; Luke 8:9-10)
At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Why do You speak to them in parables?"
And He answered them, "To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been granted.
The one who has, will be given more and will have an abundance. But the one who does not have, will have even what they do have taken away.
That's why I speak to them in proverbs; they look but do not see, they hear but do not understand.
# Isaiah 6:9-10; Mark 8:18; John 12:39-41; Acts 28:26-27 > For *Isaiah* said, > "Hear, but you shall not understand; > See, but you shall not perceive. > For the heart of this people has grown dull, > Their ears are hard of hearing, > And they have shut their eyes; > Otherwise they might see with their eyes, > Hear with their ears, > And understand with their heart and return."
The people of this kind have dried up their hearts, shut their ears and eyes, so that they neither see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their hearts, and they will return to me so that I may heal them.
As for you, may your eyes remain healthy in order to see, and your ears in order to hear.
'I tell you the truth: many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see, but did not see it; and to hear what you hear, but did not hear it.' The Parable of the Sower (Mark 4:13-20, Luke 8:11-15)
Now, listen to what the meaning of the parable of the peasant is.
When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown on the edge.
But the one who sows in the ground full of rocks is the one who hears the word, and immediately receives it with joy.
As he has no veins inside him, he waits a little. When the time of trial or persecution for the word comes, he fades away with time.
But the one who sows in the midst of thorns is the one who hears the word, yet the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
But he who received the seed into stony ground is he who hears the word, and immediately with joy receives it; yet he has no root in himself, but endures only for a while; and when temptation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he falls away. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, but some fell into good ground and yielded fruit: some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty." The Parable of the Sower.
And He said, "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
When people were asleep, the enemy came, sowed tares among the wheat, and left.
And when the seed had grown and produced wheat, there was also tares among it.
And the servants of the Owner of the Earth said: "Our Lord, did You not sow excellent seeds in Your earth? Then how is it that darnel has grown therein?"
He told them: "One of my enemies has done this." His servants replied: "Shall we not go and gather the thorns?"
As he said: "No, don't reap the wheat while you're gathering the darnel.
Let both the wheat and the weeds grow together until the harvest. At the time of the harvest, I will tell the reapers, 'First, gather the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.' As for the mustard seed, it is the smallest of all seeds, but once it grows, it becomes the largest plant. It's like a tree, and birds come and perch in its branches." (Mark 4:30-32, Luke 13:18-19)
And he gave them another parable, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field.
«She is the smallest among all the seedlings, but when she grew up she became the tallest among all the greens, and even turned into a tree, so much so that the birds of the sky come and nest in her.»
Another parable he told them was this: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large batch of flour until it worked its way through the dough."
Jesus spoke to the people in parables. He never spoke to them without using a parable.
# Psalm 78:2 His mouth was like a fountain of life, And the very lips of knowledge. He spoke the mysteries of God.
At that time Jesus went into the house, and his disciples came to him privately, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the tares."
Tell them: "It is Anna, the Son of Man, who planted the radiant seed."
And the field is the world; and the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;
And the enemy who sowed them is Satan; the harvest is the end times, and the reapers are the angels.
And just as the chaff is blown away and consumed by the fire, so will it be in the end of days.
Anna, Son of Man, I will send My angels, and they will gather out of My kingdom all causes of sin and all lawbreakers.
And they shall cast them into the midst of the fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
And the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear!" Like a treasure hidden in a field, and a pearl of great price, and a dragnet cast into the sea, and drawing in all kinds of fish.
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found, and hid; and for joy over it he went and sold all that he had, and bought the field.
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found a precious gold nugget, sold all his possessions and bought it.
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a net thrown into the sea, which gathered fish of every kind.
When they were full, the fishermen dragged the boats back to the shore. They placed the good fish in boxes and threw away the bad ones.
Thus it will be in the End of Days: The angels will come and separate the evil from the righteous.
They will cast them into the midst of the fire; there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth. The new and the old.
And Jesus said to His disciples, "Do you understand all these things?" And they said to Him, "Yes."
And He said to them, "That is why every scribe who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure things new and old."
And when Jesus had finished this parable, He departed from there.
And when he began to teach them in their synagogue, they were astonished, and said: "Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these miracles?
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? And aren't his brothers called James, Joseph, Simon and Judas?
«Are all his daughters with us? Where on earth did this man get all this from?»
And they were offended at Him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country and in his own house."
And he didn't perform many miracles there because they didn't believe in him.
The Death of John the Baptist (Mark 6:14-29; Luke 9:7-9)
At that time King Herod heard news of Jesus,
And he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him."
And John was imprisoned because of Herodias' spite against him. For Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
Because of John they said: "Shame on you for taking her."
And they wanted to kill him, but they feared the people, because they regarded John as a prophet.
And when Herod's birthday came, Herodias' daughter danced before the company, and pleased Herod
That's why he promised her and swore to give her anything she asked for.
As her mother had instructed her, she said to Herod, «Grant me the head of John the Baptist on a platter!»
And the king felt sad. He had given his word about the thing she desired, and he had sworn an oath in front of his guests.
And Herodias held a grudge against John, and wanted to kill him. But she could not, for Herod feared John, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him speak he was greatly perplexed, yet he liked to listen to him. So the king, though vexed, yet for the sake of his oath, and to please the guests, commanded that John's request be granted. And he had John beheaded in the prison.
They brought his head on a plate and gave it to the girl. Oh my, she was thrilled!
And John's disciples, who had come to take his body, removed it and buried it; then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed five thousand men. (Mark 6:30-44, Luke 9:10-17, John 6:1-14)
When Jesus heard this, He left the place in a boat and went to a deserted place by Himself. But when the multitudes heard it, they followed Him on foot from the cities.
He descended from the Malfūka, saw many people, had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
In the evening, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a lonely place, and the day is almost over. Send the people away so that they can go to the surrounding villages and buy themselves some food."
Jesus said, «Let the children come to me. Do not stop them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these.»
"We have only five loaves of bread and two fish."
Jesus said, «Bring them here to Me.»
And he commanded the people to sit down on the grass. Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven he blessed and broke them, and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
And they all ate their fill. They shook out two bags full of leftovers.
And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children. Jesus Walks on the Water (Mark 6:45–52; John 6:15–21)
And exactly after that, he ordered his students to get into the boat and row ahead of him to the other side of the lake. He himself would send the people back when the time was right.
And after the people sent forth, he went up alone to the mountain to pray. And when the sun had set, he was alone there.
At that time, the boat was quite far from the shore and the waves had overcome it, as the wind was against it.
And Jesus came to them, walking on the sea.
The disciples were terrified when they saw him walking on the water, and exclaimed: «It's a ghost!» They were scared stiff.
And Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid."
And Peter answered him, "Lord, if it is you, bid me come to you on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
Ama, afraid of the strong wind, was scared of capsizing, and cried: «Lord, save me!»
At that moment Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of the man, and said to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
And the wind died down as they set sail in the boat.
And they prostrated themselves before Him and said, "You are the Son of God!" He healed those who were sick. (Mark 6:53-56)
And Jesus and His disciples came to the region of Gennesaret.
When the people of that land came to know Jesus, they spread the news all throughout that whole region. They brought all the sick people to him.
They asked him to let them touch the hem of his garment. And all who touched it were healed.
Customs handed down by our ancestors (Mark 7:1-13)
And the Pharisees and the scribes came from Jerusalem to Jesus, saying:
"Why don't your students respect the traditions of the elders? Why don't they wash their hands before eating?"
Answer them: "Why don't you obey God's commandment and stick to your own traditions?"
# Lev 20:12; Deut 5:16; Lev 21:17; Num 20:9 God said: > 'Honour your father and your mother, or face the death penalty.'
As you say, if someone tells their father or mother: "The help I gave you, I gave it to God. I don't owe you anything, you don't deserve any respect."
And with your traditions you make void the word of God.
O hypocrites, Isaiah prophesied correctly about you, saying:
# Isaiah 29:13: This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.
"Void is the worship they offer Me, and their teachings are but commands of men." What makes a man unclean (Mark 7:14-23).
And Jesus called the people unto him, and said unto them, Hearken and understand:
Not that which goes into the mouth defiles a man, but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man."
And His disciples came and said to Him, "Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?"
Tell them: "Any tree that my Father above did not plant will be uprooted."
Keep them away! The blind are leading the blind. And if a blind man is leading another blind man, both will fall into a pit.»
Ama Peters said: "They interpreted this parable for us."
And Jesus said: "Still you do not understand?"
O brother, why doesn't anything that enters the mouth go straight to the belly and then out of the body?
As the need arises from the mouth, it comes from the heart, and that's what defiles a man.
<strong>From the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, and blasphemy.</strong>
These are the things which defile a man. But to eat with unwashen hands doth not defile the man." The faith of the Canaanite woman (Mark 7:24-30)
And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.
And a Canaanite woman from that region came and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffers terribly."
He didn't answer her a single word. His disciples came and begged him, «Give her what she asks for, so she'll leave us alone! She's following us, crying!»
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
She fell at his feet and said, «Master, help me!»
And he answered: «Should we take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs?»
She said: "Why yes, sir! Even dogs eat what falls from their master's table."
Jesus answered, "Woman, your faith is great. Let what you desire be done for you." And her daughter was healed instantly. Jesus healed many people.
And Jesus walked by the Sea of Galilee. He went up on the mountain, and sat down there.
And many people came to Him, bringing the sick, and those who were afflicted with various diseases and pains: the blind, the lame, and the paralyzed. And He healed them.
And they were amazed, and said, Behold, he taketh up the blind men; and the halters walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the dumb speak. And they glorified the God of Israel. And Jesus, when he had called the people unto him, said unto them, I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest haply they faint in the way. And there were with him about five loaves, and two fishes: and he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave to the disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all. And they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.
And Jesus called His disciples and said to them, "I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now continued with Me three days, and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."
And the disciples said: "How shall we get bread enough in this wild place to fill so great a multitude?"
And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.
And Jesus said to the people, "Let them sit down."
And the seven loaves and the fishes he divided among the disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitude.
And they all ate their fill. They even shook out seven large baskets of leftovers.
The Alaouites numbered four thousand men, not including women and children.
And after the people had launched the boat, he got in and went to the region of Magadan.
The signs of the times. (Mark 8:11-13; Luke 12:54-56)
The Pharisees and the Sadducees came to test Jesus, and they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
And Jesus answered them, "In the evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather; for the sky is red.'
In the morning you say: "It's going to rain today, the sky is dark red." You know how to interpret the sky, but not the signs of the times.
A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah." Then He left them and departed. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees (Mark 8:14-21)
Connected the students to the opposite shore, forgot to bring bread.
Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students discussed with one another and said: «That's why we have no bread.»
But Jesus, aware of this, said, "You of little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves that you have no bread?
Didn't you guys understand? Don't you remember the five loaves of bread that fed the five thousand, and how many large baskets of leftovers there were?
And the seven loaves of the four thousand, how many large baskets full were taken up?
How can you fail to understand that I am not speaking of bread? Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!**
Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees, said Jesus. Peter answered him, saying, Thou art the Christ. (Mark 8:27-30; Luke 9:18-21)
When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered him: "Some say you are John the Baptist; others, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
He asked them: "Who do you say I am?"
Simon Peter answered, «You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.»
And Jesus said: "Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father in heaven.
And I tell you: you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
Here are the keys to the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven.»
At that time He instructed His disciples that they should tell no one that He was the Christ. Jesus first prophesied His death and resurrection. (Mark 8:31; 9:1; Luke 9:22-27)
And at that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes of the people, and be killed, and on the third day be raised up.
And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, "Far be it from You, Lord; this shall never happen to You!"
But Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are an obstacle in my path, because your mind is set on human things, not divine things."
At that time Jesus said to his disciples: "If anyone wishes to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.
Those who want to finish their life, will lose it; those who lose their life for my sake, will find it.
What is the use of a man if he were to gain the whole world but lose his own soul? And what could a man give in exchange for his life?
Queen Anna Son of Man will come with my angels in the glory of my Father, and then I will reward each person according to what they have done.
Behold, I tell you the truth: there stand here those who shall not taste death till they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Jesus shows His Spirit to His disciples ( Mark 9:2-13 ; Luke 9:28-36 )
And after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John, his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain apart.
Their faces shone, and their countenances were as the sun; and their hair was white as wool.
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters here: one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah."
And while he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said: «This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to Him!»
As the students heard this, they fell on their faces in great fear.
And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.
And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.
And when they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying: "Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is risen from the dead."
The students asked: "But why do the Jewish books say that Elijah must come first?"
Tell them: "Elijah indeed cometh, and he shall restore all things."
Behold, I send you prophets, and some of them they will kill and some they will persecute, that the blood of all the prophets, shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation, from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.
At that time the disciples understood that He was telling them about John the Baptist. Jesus healed a boy who was possessed by an evil spirit. (Mark 9:14-29; Luke 9:37-43)
And when Jesus and His disciples came to the people, a man came up to Him, knelt down, and said:
O Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is tormented and suffers greatly. He often falls into fire and water.
«And I brought it to my students, but they couldn't see it.»
And Jesus answered and said: "O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? Bring him here to Me."
And Jesus rebuked the devil; and the devil departed out of him: and the child was cured that very hour.
At that time the disciples came to Jesus privately, saying, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"
He said to them, "Because of your little faith! For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you."
There are ancient texts in which this verse is found: As for this kind, it cannot come out except by prayer and fasting. Jesus again foretells His death and resurrection. (Mark 9:30-32; Luke 9:43-45)
When the disciples were gathered together in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, Behold, I tell you in advance, The Son of Man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:
And they will kill me, and on the third day I will rise again." Don't be so worried! Jesus pays the Temple tax.
They went to Capernaum, and when the tax collector came to the temple, Peter said to him, "Does your teacher pay the temple tax?"
He answered, "Yes." When they had gone back inside, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "From whom do kings of the earth collect customs or poll tax? From their own sons or from strangers?"
Peter said, "From the region of Phoenicia." Jesus said, "Truly, the children of this region here are free."
As we don't want to cause any trouble, go to the lake, cast your line, catch any fish that bites, and when you open its mouth, you'll find a silver coin which will be enough to pay for both of us. Take it and pay both our taxes."
