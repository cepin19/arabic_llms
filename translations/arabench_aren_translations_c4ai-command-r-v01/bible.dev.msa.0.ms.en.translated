There were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile, and fourteen from the exile to Christ. The birth of Jesus Christ.
The birth of Jesus Christ happened this way: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to a man named Joseph. But before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.
But Joseph, being her husband, was a righteous man, and intended to keep her respectability; therefore he intended to dismiss her gently.
And while he thought about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because the child she carries is from the Holy Spirit."
You shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."
This has been done so that what the Lord spoke by the prophet might be fulfilled.
Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
And when Joseph woke up, he did everything that the angel of the Lord had commanded him. He took his wife into his home.
But he knew her not, till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.
Wise Men from the East
And when Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, in the days of King Herod, behold, there came wise men from the east unto Jerusalem;
They asked, "Where is the newborn king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
So King Herod was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
Then Herod called together all the chief priests and teachers of the law, and he asked them where the Christ was to be born.
They said to him: "In the city of Bethlehem in the land of Judah; for thus it is written by the Prophet:"
«You, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.»
So Herod called together the wise men secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and search diligently for the young Child, and when you have found Him, bring back word to me, that I too may come and worship Him."
Then the wise men listened to the king and departed. And lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over the place where the young Child was.
And they were sore afraid, and yet were glad.
And they entered the house and saw the Child with Mary His mother, and they fell down and worshipped Him. Then, opening their treasures, they presented to Him gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.
Then God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod, so they departed for their country by another way. Flight into Egypt
And when the wise men had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Arise, take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod will seek the Baby to destroy Him."
So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and went to Egypt.
And he remained there until the death of Herod. This took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son." #from … my son. 15:2 Hosea 11:1. Herod slaughters the Bethlehem children.
And when Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the wise men, he was furious. He ordered the execution of all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity aged two years and under, corresponding to the time he had ascertained from the wise men.
Then that which was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah came to pass:
A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted for their loss. *The Return from Egypt.*
After Herod's death, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream in Egypt.
And he said unto him, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.
So Joseph got up, took the Child and His mother, and went into the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in his father Herod's place, he was afraid to go there. And being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the region of Galilee;
And he dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, that he should be called a Nazarene. #Nazarene. 23:2 After Nazareth, the city. Also akin to the Hebrew for "branch" in Isaiah 11:1, referring to the promise of the Messiah's Davidic lineage.
John the Baptist
In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
He said: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
And this is John the Prophet spoken of by Isaiah the Prophet, who saith: "A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, Make straight his paths."
John was clothed in camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist; and he ate locusts and wild honey.
At that time the people of Jerusalem, all Judea, and the whole region around the Jordan came to him, and he preached to them.
And he was baptizing them in the Jordan River after they confessed their sins.
When John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Produce fruit that befits repentance.
Do not boast, saying, 'We are Abraham's descendants.' For I tell you, God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
Behold, the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be hewn down, and cast into the fire.
I baptize you in water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire.
He shall carry his sheaves in his arms, and shall gently shuffle his grain into the barn; the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.**The Baptism of Jesus**
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
But John tried to stop him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?"
And Jesus answered him, "Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness." Then he suffered him.
Then Jesus was baptized by John in the Jordan River. And as He was coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens opening, and the Spirit of God descending upon Him like a dove alighting on Him.
A voice came from heaven, saying, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased."
Jesus' experience.
And the Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan.
And after Jesus had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.
So the tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread."
But Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.' "
Then the devil took him to the holy city, Jerusalem, and stood him on the pinnacle of the temple.
And he said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Jesus answered him, "It is also written, 'You shall not test the Lord your God.' "
Then the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.
Then he said to him: "All this I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me."
Then Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.' "
Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him. Jesus begins his ministry in Galilee.
And when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, He withdrew into Galilee.
But he himself went not into the city of Nazareth, but came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:
This has been done so that what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled:
The land of Zebulun and Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, the Galilee of the Gentiles.
The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them a light has shined.
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near." Jesus called to himself his first disciples.
As Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the lake; for they were fishermen.
Then He said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men."
They untied their nets at once and followed him.
Then Jesus moved on from there and saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, repairing their nets. Jesus called them,
They immediately left the boat and their father, and followed Him. Jesus taught and healed them.
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
The news about him spread throughout Syria, and people brought to him all those who were ill with various diseases, those suffering from evil spirits, epileptics, and paralysis victims. Jesus healed them all.
A large crowd followed Him from Galilee, and from the ten towns, Jerusalem, Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.
Jesus' Teaching
And when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a hill, and sitting down, his disciples came to him.
And he began to speak and teach them, saying:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Congratulations to the mourners, for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. #TheyShallInheritTheEarth. Psalm 37:11 suggests this may refer to a future spiritual inheritance.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, #for righteousness' sake. 6:5 Literally: «To the upright.» For they shall be filled.
Congratulations to the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
Congratulations to those with pure hearts, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are the persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Congratulations when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely claim that you have done evil, because of Me.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted?
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt has lost its taste, with what can it be seasoned? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet.
You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.
For no one lights a lamp and puts it in a hidden place or under a bushel. Instead, he sets it on a stand, so that those who come in may see the light.
So let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven." Jesus and the Law of Moses
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
Verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
For this reason, whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever obeys them and teaches others to do the same will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. fury
"You shall not murder. #Do not murder. Exodus 20:13, Deuteronomy 5:17 Says the Lord. Whosoever kills shall be tried by the court.".
But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.
So if you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you,
So leave your gift there at the altar, go and be reconciled to your brother or sister, and then come and offer your gift.
Settle with your opponent quickly while you are on the way to court. Otherwise, he will hand you over to the judge, the judge will give you to the officer, and you will be thrown into prison.
I tell you the truth, you shall not get out of there till you have paid the very last penny. Adultery.
"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' #Do not commit adultery. Exodus 20:14, Deuteronomy 5:18."
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
Therefore, if your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.
And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, rather than that thy whole body should be cast into hell. Divorce.
"It has also been said: 'If a man divorces his wife, he must give her a certificate of divorce.' Deut. 24:1. 31:5."
But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is put away doth commit adultery. <section></section>
You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.' #Do not break an oath. 33:5 See Leviticus 19:12, Numbers 30:2, and Deuteronomy 23:21.
But I say unto you, Swear not at all.
Do not swear by the heavens, for it is the throne of God; nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
Do not swear by your head, for you cannot make a single hair black or white.
If you want to say ‹Yes,› say ‹Yes.› And if you want to say ‹No,› say ‹No.› Anything more than this comes from the evil one. #evil. 37:5 Satan. Resistance to evil.
"Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. #An eye for a tooth. Matt. 5:38 Ex. 21:24; Lev. 24:20."
But I say unto you, Resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
And if anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him have your shirt as well.
If anyone forces you to go with them one mile, go with them two.
If anyone asks you for anything, give it to them; and if anyone wants to borrow from you, do not turn away. Love your neighbors as yourself.
"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' #Love your enemies. Leviticus 19:18."
But I say unto you, Love your enemies, pray for them which persecute you;
Thus shall you be the children of your Father which is in heaven. For he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
If you love only those who love you, what reward do you deserve? Even the tax collectors do that.
And if you greet only your brothers, what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Bidding
Beware of practicing your righteousness before men, to be seen by them, or else you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
For when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
That your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. Prayer.
And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
> And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking.
Therefore do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
Therefore pray like this: *Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name*.
Let your kingdom come, let your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. #evil. 13:6 Satan (the Devil). For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.
If you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Fasting.
And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.
But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
So that people do not notice you are fasting. Your Father, whom you cannot see, sees this. Then your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you. God or money.
Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
"No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. #Money. 24:6 Literally 'Mamona.' An Aramaic word meaning 'wealth,' here used in its negative sense, representing a god served by men instead of God. Put God's kingdom first."
Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Behold the birds of the sky, for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of much more value than they?
Who among you can add one hour to his life when he is anxious?
Why do you worry about what to wear? Look at the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin.
But I tell you, not one of them was dressed like one of these, not even Solomon in all his splendor.
If God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?
So do not worry about tomorrow, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'
These are the things the Gentiles seek after: and your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of them all.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
Do not worry about tomorrow, for each day has enough troubles of its own. Tomorrow will have troubles enough of its own.
Judging others.
Do not judge others, so that God will not judge you.
For he will judge in the way you judge, and will measure with the measure you use.
Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye, but fail to notice the log in your own?
How can you say to your brother: 'Let me remove the speck from your eye,' when there's a large plank in your own eye?
O hypocrite! First cast out the beam from your own eye; and then you will see clearly to cast out the mote from your brother's eye.
Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine. For they will trample them underfoot, and turn and tear you to pieces.
Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.
For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.
Who among you, if his son asks for a loaf of bread, will give him a stone?
Or if he asked for a fish, would He give him a dead one?
You, despite your evil, know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more then will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him! The Golden Rule.
>As you would have others treat you, so you must treat them. This is the essence of the Law of Moses and the Prophets. The way to Heaven and the way to Hell.
Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there are who go in by it.
The gate leading to life is narrow, and the road is full of troubles; only a few can find it. Beware of false teachings.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
For every good tree brings forth good fruit; but the corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.
And every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
By their fruits ye shall know them.
Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in Heaven.
Many will say to Me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and cast out demons in Your name, and do many wonders in Your name?'
Then I will tell them plainly: I never knew you. Away from me, you workers of evil! The wise and the foolish.
Whosoever heareth these my teachings, and doeth them, shall be likened unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock.
And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.
And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
And it rained, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.»
And when Jesus had finished speaking, the people were astonished at His teaching.
For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
Jesus heals a leper
Then Jesus came down from the mountainside, followed by a large crowd.
And a leper came to him, and intoning, said: «Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.»
And Jesus, stretching out His hand, touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed." And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
Then Jesus said to him, “Don’t tell anyone what has happened. Go and show yourself to the priest, #Go...to the priest. 4:8 The priest was the one who decided when a leper was clean. and offer the sacrifices commanded by Moses for your cleansing,” he said, “as a testimony to them.” The faith of a Roman centurion
And Jesus entered Capernaum. Now a centurion had a servant who was sick and about to die.
He said: "My lord, my servant is very ill. He lies at home, unable to move and in great pain."
So Jesus said to him, "I will go and heal him."
The officer replied, "Sir, you deserve to step into my house. Just say the word and my servant will be healed."
For I myself am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. I say to this one, ‹Go!› and he goes; and to another, ‹Come!› and he comes; and to my servant, ‹Do this!› and he does it.»
When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to them that followed him, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
I say unto you, Many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
But those who were meant to inherit the kingdom will be thrown outside into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.»
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go; let it be done just as you believed." And the servant was healed at that very moment. "He took up our infirmities"
And when Jesus came into Peter's house, He saw Peter's mother-in-law lying sick in bed, having a great fever.
And He touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and served Him.
And that evening they brought to him many who were possessed with demons; and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all the sick.
This took place so that what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled: "He took our infirmities and bore our diseases." Following Jesus.
And when Jesus saw a great multitude about him, he gave commandment to pass over to the other side.
And a teacher of the law said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus rebuked the storm,
And Jesus got into the boat, and His disciples followed Him.
Then a furious storm arose on the lake; the waves were breaking over the boat. But He was asleep.
They approached him and woke him up, saying, "Master, save us! We are perishing!"
And Jesus said to them, *Why are you fearful, O ye of little faith?* And he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.
And they were amazed, saying, &ldquo;What manner of Man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?&rdquo; And when He had come into the boat, the wind ceased. And the men marvelled, saying, &ldquo;He is certainly mad.&rdquo; And He rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm. And He said unto them, &ldquo;Why are ye fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?&rdquo;.
Then Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gerasenes. Two men who were possessed by demons met him as they came out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.
And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?
And a large herd of pigs was grazing at a distance from them.
Then the unclean spirits begged Him, saying: "If You cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of swine."
So Jesus said, "Go!" And the evil spirits came out of the men and entered the pigs. And the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and perished in the waters.
The shepherds fled to the town and told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed.
So the whole town came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their district.
Jesus heals a paralytic.
And Jesus entered into a ship, and passed over the sea to his own city.
Then some people brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Son, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven."
So some of the teachers of the Law said, «This man blasphemes.»
Then Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?
Is it easier to say: 'Your sins are forgiven' or 'Rise and walk'?
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"—he said to the paralytic— "Rise, take up your bed and go to your house."
So he got up and went to his house.
And when the people saw this, they were filled with awe, and praised God, who had given such authority to men. Matthew 9:8
As Jesus passed by, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, "Follow Me!" So he arose and followed Him.
And while he was at dinner at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard it, He said, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick."
Go and learn what this means: *I desire mercy, not sacrifice.* **Hosea 6:6 13:9** "I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners." A question about fasting.
Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast so often, but your disciples do not fast?"
And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.
No one patches old cloth with a new piece of cloth, for the new patch would shrink and pull away from the old cloth, making the tear even worse.
<b>Mark 2:22</b> <i>And no one puts new wine into old leather bags. If he does, the wine will burst the bags, and both the wine and the bags are ruined. No, new wine must be poured into fresh bags.</i>
While Jesus was still speaking, a ruler of the synagogue came and knelt before him. "My daughter has just died," he said, "but come and place your hand on her, and she will live."
So Jesus got up and went away with the synagogue ruler, and his disciples followed him.
There was a woman who had been suffering severe bleeding for twelve years. She came up behind him and touched the fringe of his clothes.
She thought to herself, "If I only touch his cloak, I shall be made whole."
And Jesus, turning about, saw her, and said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole: and the woman was made whole from that hour.
And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, He saw the minstrels and the people making a tumult.
He said, "Get thee hence. The maid is not dead, but sleepeth." And they laughed him to scorn.
And when the people were put outside, Jesus went in and took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
And the fame of Jesus spread throughout the whole region. He healed two blind men // and cast out an evil spirit.
And when Jesus had departed thence, two blind men followed Him, crying, and saying, Son of David, have mercy on us.
And when Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to Him. And Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" So they said to Him, "Yes, Lord."
Then He touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith let it be done to you."
And the blind men recovered their sight. Then Jesus warned them sternly, “Make sure no one knows about this.”
But they went and spread the word throughout that whole region.
And as they went, some men brought to Him a man that was dumb and demon possessed.
And Jesus cast out the spirit: and the man who had been dumb spake. And the multitude marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the prince of demons, Beelzebul. #Beelzebul; the prince of demons. By whomsoever sinne the devil, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand? The harvest truly is plenteous,"
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
And when Jesus saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd.
So Jesus said to the disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth harvesters into his harvest.
Jesus sends out his disciples
And when He had called unto Him His twelve disciples, He gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.
These are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother,
Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas the Twin, Matthew the tax collector, James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus,
Simon, who is also called **the Zealot**, #Zealot. 4:10 A member of a Jewish political party that opposed Roman rule, called the **Zealots**. And Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus.
Jesus sent out the twelve with the following instructions: “Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.
But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
And they proclaimed that the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You received without paying; give without pay.
Do not carry in your belts any money, whether of gold or silver or copper,
Do not take a bag, an extra garment or an extra pair of shoes or a staff. A worker is worth his keep.
And when you enter a town or village, search out a worthy person there, and stay at his house until you depart.
And when you enter a house, greet its people.
If the people of the house are worthy, then your greeting will reach them. But if they are unworthy, it will come back to you.
If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your message, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet.
Verily I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city. Jesus warns of the woes to come.
Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
Beware of men, for they will deliver you up to their councils, and flog you in their synagogues.
They will hand you over to the rulers and kings for my sake, as a witness to them and the Gentiles.
And when they arrest you, don't worry about what to say, for the words will be given to you at that time.
Remember, it is not you who will speak, but it is your father's spirit who will speak through you.
"A brother will betray his brother to death, a father will betray his son. Sons will rise against their parents and have them put to death."
And all will hate you because of Me. But he who stands firm to the end will be saved.
And when they persecute you in one city, flee to another. Verily I say unto you, ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man come.
No disciple is above his teacher, nor any servant above his master.
Let the disciple become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they call the head of the house Beelzebul, #Beelzebul, **what will they call the rest of the household? Fear God, not people.**
Fear them not, for nothing is hidden but shall be revealed, and nothing concealed but shall be known.
For all that you say in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you whisper in ears proclaim on the housetops.
Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
Don't two sparrows sell for a penny? Yet not one falls to the ground without your Father's consent.
But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
Fear not, for ye are of more value than many sparrows. Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.
Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.
Whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny before My Father who is in heaven. Christ is Lord.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I came to bring division: a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
So a man's enemies will be those of his own household!›
"For he who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me, and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me."
Whoever does not take up his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me.
Whoever tries to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it.
Whoever welcomes you welcomes me. And whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
Whoever welcomes a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet's reward. Whoever welcomes a righteous person because they are righteous will receive the reward of the righteous.
And whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones, because he is My disciple, truly I tell you, he will never lose his reward."
John the Baptist and not Jesus
When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he moved on from there to teach and proclaim the message in the towns of Galilee. Jesus and John the Baptist.
And while John was in prison, he heard of the works of Christ: and sending two of his disciples, he said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or look we for another?
And he asked: "Art thou He Whom we await, or are we to look for another?"
Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you have seen and heard:
Behold, the blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news preached to them.
"Congratulations to those who have no doubts about their belief in me."
And when the disciples of John had left, Jesus began to speak to the people about John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?
Why did you go out? To see a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.
So why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
This is he of whom it is written: ‹Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, to prepare thy way.›"
I tell you the truth: Among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom has been subjected to violent attack, and violent men have been trying to seize it by force.
For the law of Moses and the Prophets prophesied until John.
If you want to accept the prophets and the Law, John is the Elijah who was prophesied to come. #Elijah . . . his coming. 14:11 Elijah was one of the prophets around 850 BC. The Jews expected him to come again, as stated in Malachi 4:5-6.
Let him who has ears, hear.
What does this generation resemble? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to their companions:
We played for you, but you did not dance. We sang for you dirges, and you did not mourn!
John came, who neither ate nor drank wine like the rest of them. People said about him: «He has a demon.»
Then came the Son of Man, eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds." Jesus warns the unrepentant cities.
Then Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent of their sins.
And he said: «Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you that it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
And you, Capernaum, do you think you will be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to the depths! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.
But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you." Jesus is the source of comfort.
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned, and revealed them to little children.
Yes, my father, for you were pleased with doing this.
The Father has given me all things into hands. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son, and he to whom the Son wills to reveal him.
Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you. #Yoke. The yoke is a wooden instrument placed on animals to aid in carrying heavy loads. It is a Jewish symbol for the Law. Learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."
Jesus: Lord of the Sabbath
At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.
Then Jesus said to them, "Have you never read what David did when he was in need?"
He entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which neither he nor his companions may do, for it is reserved for the priests alone.»
Have you not read also the law of Moses, how the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?
But I tell you, there is something greater than the temple here.
And had you known what it means, 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice.'* Hosea 6:6, 7:12. You would not have condemned the guiltless.
For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath." Healing on the Sabbath.
Then he left that place and went to their synagogue.
And behold, there was a man who had his hand withered. And they asked Him, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"—so that they might accuse Him.
So He said to them, "Suppose a man has a sheep, and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath day; will you not lay hold of it and pull it out?"
„Man is more important than the sheep. So doing good on the Sabbath is lawful.“
Then Jesus said to the man with the withered hand, "Stretch forth thy hand." And he stretched it out; and it was restored whole, like to the other.
So the Pharisees went and plotted how to kill Jesus. Jesus: God's chosen servant.
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, withdrew Himself from thence. And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them all;
And he ordered them not to reveal his identity.
This has been done so that what the prophet Isaiah said would come true:
Behold my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall declare judgment to the Gentiles.
He won't argue with anyone or shout. No one will hear his voice in their streets.
He will not break a bent reed, nor quench a smoking flax until he leads justice to victory.
And all nations will put their hope in Him." Authority of Jesus.
Then a man who was demon-possessed and blind and mute was brought to him. And he healed him, so that the mute man spoke and saw.
And the people were amazed, and said: "Can this be the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This fellow casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them: "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and a house divided against a house falls.
If the devil drives out devils, how shall his kingdom stand?
If I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the Kingdom of God has come upon you.
How can anyone rob a strong man's house? They must first tie him up. Then they can rob his house.
"Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters."
Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven.
Whoever speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. The fruit shows the truth.
To bear good fruit, plant a good tree. A poor tree yields poor fruit, for a tree is known by its fruit.
O you offspring of vipers, how can you speak good things, being evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
For the good man brings out of his good treasure what is good; and the evil man brings out of his evil treasure what is evil.
But I tell you that on the day of judgment people will have to account for every careless word they speak.
Your words will decide whether you are innocent or guilty." The Jewish leaders demand proof.
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from You."
And he answered them, This evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.
Just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment and condemn this generation, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And now one greater than Jonah is here.
The Queen of the South shall rise up in the judgment against this generation and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.
Then he says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' So he goes away and finds his house empty, swept, and put in order.
Then he goes and brings seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they dwell there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So shall it be also with this wicked generation.** **The disciples are Jesus' family.
While Jesus was speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and His brothers stood outside, seeking to speak with Him.
Then someone said to Him, "Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, desiring to speak with You."
And Jesus answered, "Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?"
Then he pointed to his disciples and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers.
"For he who does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother."
Like the sower
On that day, Jesus left the house and sat by the lakeside.
And great multitudes came unto him. And he went up into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
He spoke to them in many parables, saying: "A sower went out to sow.
And as he sowed, some seeds fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured them.
Some of the seed fell on rocky ground where there was not much soil. And since it had no depth of earth, it sprang up quickly.
But when the sun rose, it withered, for it had no roots.
Some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it.
And other seeds fell into good soil and produced fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.
Let anyone who has ears hear." Hearing and understanding.
The disciples came to him and asked, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
Jesus answered them, "It is given unto you to know the mystery of the kingdom of heaven, but unto them it is not given."
For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.
That is why I speak to them in parables. Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not understand.
And thus the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled in them: *You will indeed hear, but never understand; you will indeed see, but never perceive.*
The mind of this people hath been blinded, and their ears are dull of hearing. They have shut their eyes; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
Verily I say unto you, Many prophets and righteous men have desired to see what ye see, and have not seen it; and to hear what ye hear, and have not heard it. The parable of the sower hath a meaning.
So listen to the parable of the sower.
When someone hears the message of the kingdom and doesn't understand it, the evil one comes. #evil one. 19:13 The devil. (Also in v. 38) He takes away the seed sown in their heart. This is what's meant by seed sown along the path.
But the one that fell on the rocky ground is like someone who hears the word, and immediately receives it with joy.
But since he has no root in himself, he lasts only a short time. When trouble or persecution arises on account of the word, he quickly falls away.
But the one that fell among the thorns stands for those who hear the word, yet the worries of life, and the lure of wealth choke the word, and it bears no fruit.
"But the one who received the seed on good soil is the one who hears and understands the word and *does* bears fruit, and produces: once a hundredfold, once sixty, and once thirty." A parable of the Wheat and the Tares.
And He told them another parable, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
But while men slept, the enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.
And when the wheat grew and formed ears, the weeds grew too.
Then his servants said unto him, ‹Master, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares?›
The man answered: «My enemy did that.» His slaves asked him: «Shall we go and uproot it?»
The man replied: 'No, because when you uproot the weeds, you may also uproot the wheat.'
Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.** Mustard and leaven.
Then Jesus told them another parable: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and planted in his field.
«It is the smallest of seeds, but when it grows, it becomes the largest of garden plants; it becomes a great tree, so much so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches.»
He told them another parable: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large batch of flour until it worked its way through the dough."
Jesus spoke all these things in parables. He spoke to them in parables, because he was fulfilling what had been spoken through the prophet: "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world."
This is what God has spoken through the Prophet: "I will open My mouth in parables, and utter things kept secret since the world began."
Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
And he said unto them, The Son of man is the sower of the good seed.
And the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one.
And the enemy that sowed them is the Devil. The harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
"And as weeds are gathered and burnt with fire, so shall the end of the world be."
For the Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all lawbreakers,
Then they cast them into the fiery furnace. There men will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. The parable of the treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and out of his joy went and sold all he had and bought the field.
The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
And when he found a very precious pearl, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it. As a fishing net.
The kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered fish of every kind.
When the net was full, the fishermen hauled it ashore. They then sat down and began sorting the catch, putting the good fish in baskets and discarding the bad.
This is what will happen at the end of the world: the angels will come and separate the evil ones from the righteous.
Then the wicked will be cast into the blazing furnace. **There** will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
And Jesus asked his disciples, "Do you understand all these things?" And they said, "Yes."
He said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure things new and old." Jesus goes to His hometown.
And when Jesus had finished speaking in parables, He departed from there.
And when he came to his hometown, he began teaching them in their synagogue, so that they were all amazed, and said, «Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?
Isn't he the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary? And aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas?
Do not all his sisters dwell with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?
And this was a stumbling block to them, and Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country and in his own house."
He didn't perform many miracles there because of their lack of faith.
Herod hears about Jesus
At that time Herod the ruler of Galilee #ruler of Galilee heard about Jesus.
So he said to his servants, "It is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him." The Death of John the Baptist
Herod was the one who arrested John and put him in prison, because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
For John said to Herod, 'It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.'
That is why Herod wanted to kill him, but he feared the people, for they regarded John as a prophet.
But on Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced before him and his guests, and she delighted Herod so much,
He even vowed to grant her whatever she wished for, no matter what it was.
But her mother had instructed her what to say, and she replied, "Bring me here John the Baptist's head on a platter."
The king was sad, but, true to his word, he granted her request, also out of respect for his guests.
So he sent and had John beheaded in prison.
Then he brought his head on a platter and gave it to her, and she gave it to her mother.
Then came the disciples of John, and took up his corpse, and buried it; and went and told Jesus. When Jesus therefore heard that, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities. And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick. When the evening was now come, his disciples came unto him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals. Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat. And they said, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. He said, Bring them hither to me. And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.
And when Jesus heard it, He departed by ship to a desert place apart. And when the multitudes heard it, they followed Him on foot out of the cities.
And when he came down to the beach, he saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
In the evening, his disciples came to him and said, «This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding villages and buy themselves some food.»
But Jesus said unto them, Give ye them to eat.
So His disciples said to Him, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish here."
So Jesus said to them, "Bring her to Me."
He ordered the people to sit down on the grass. Then Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. He gave them to the disciples, and they distributed them to the people.
And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.
And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children. Jesus walks on the sea.
Then Jesus told the disciples to get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.
And when he had sent them away, he went up on the mountain to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.
The boat had reached the middle of the lake, and the waves were crashing into it violently, as the wind was blowing against the vessel's direction.
And a little before it was day, Jesus came unto them, walking upon the sea.
When his disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified. "It's a ghost!" they said, and cried out in fear.
Then Jesus spoke to them at once. "Take courage! It is I; don't be afraid."
Peter replied, "Lord, if it's really you, tell me to come to you on the water."
And He said, &quot;Come.&quot; So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, "Lord, save me!"
And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
And when Jesus and Peter had gotten into the boat, the wind ceased.
And those who were in the boat worshipped Him, saying, «Truly You are the Son of God.» And when they had come ashore, they saw a great multitude, and they were greatly compassionate and healed many.
And when they had crossed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.
And the people of the region recognised Him, and brought to Him all who were ill;
And they begged Him that they might only touch the hem of His garment. And as many as touched were made perfectly whole.
God's law and man's traditions.
Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to Jesus and asked him,
"Why do your students break the traditions we inherited from our ancestors? They don't wash their hands before eating."
Jesus answered them, "Why do you break God's command because of your tradition?
And God commanded, saying: *'Honour thy father and thy mother.'* #Honour … thy mother. Exodus 20:12, Deuteronomy 5:16. *And:* *'He that curseth his father or his mother, let him die the death.'* #Let him die … the death. Exodus 21:17.*​*
But you say: ‹If anyone says to father or mother, "I cannot help you; I have devoted all I have to God," they are released from their duty to help their father or mother.›
And you neglect the commandment of God because of your tradition.
O hypocrites, Isaiah prophesied truly concerning you, saying:
This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.
Their worship is in vain, for they teach as doctrines the commandments of men.
And Jesus called the people unto him, and said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:
It is not what enters a man's mouth that can defile him, but what comes out of his mouth; this is what defiles him."
At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?"
Jesus answered: "Whatever is not planted by my Father in heaven will be rooted up."
Let them alone: for they be blind, and leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.
Peter said, "Explain this parable to us."
Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me:
Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth goes into the stomach, and is then excreted?
But what comes out of the mouth, comes from the heart, and it is this that makes a person unclean.
For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander.
These are the things which defile a man, but to eat with unwashen hands doth not defile the man." Jesus helps a foreign woman.
And Jesus departed thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.
And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David: for my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.
Jesus did not answer her a word. Then His disciples came and implored Him, saying, "Send her away, for she is crying out after us."
He said: "I have been sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
But the woman came and fell at his feet, saying, "Lord, help me."
Jesus answered her, "It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs."
She said: "Yes, master, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered her, "O woman, your faith is great. Be it done for you as you desire." And her daughter was healed instantly. Jesus heals many.
And Jesus left that place, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.
A large crowd came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the paralyzed, the mute, and many others who were disabled. They placed them at Jesus' feet, and he healed them all.
And the people were amazed, and said, It is a wonderful thing to see: behold, the blind see, the dumb speak, the lame are made whole, and the sick are healed: and they glorified the God of Israel. Jesus feeds more than four thousand.
Then Jesus called his disciples and said, "I have compassion on these people, because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may faint on the way."
His disciples asked him, "Where can we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?"
And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.
Then Jesus told the people to sit down on the grass.
And he took the seven loaves and the fish, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to the disciples to set before them; and the disciples gave to the multitude.
And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.
And the number of those who ate was four thousand men, besides women and children.
And when Jesus had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the boat, and came into the region of Magadan.
The Jewish leaders question Jesus
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus to test him, demanding that he show them a sign of his divine authority.
Jesus answered them, "At evening you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.' "
In the early morning you say: ‹It will be a stormy day, the sky is so red and threatening.› You are good at interpreting the signs of the weather, but you don't understand the times in which you live!
This evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.
And Jesus' disciples went across the lake, but they forgot to take bread.
And Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
Then the disciples began to say to one another, "We have no bread."
Then Jesus, knowing what they were thinking in their heart, said to them, "You of little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves that you have no bread?
Did you not yet understand? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered of the fragments?
Do you not remember the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets full of fragments ye took up?
Why don't you understand that I was not talking to you about ordinary bread? I was warning you to beware the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.**
Then His disciples understood that He did not speak to them about leavening in bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter's Confession of Christ.
And when Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
His disciples answered: "Some say you are John the Baptist; others, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
So He asked them, "But who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.
And I tell you, you are Peter, #Peter. <18:16> From the Greek "Petros", a rock. On this rock I will build my church, and the gates of #the gates of <18:16> Hades will not overcome it.
And I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Then He strictly charged the disciples that they should tell no one that He was Jesus the Christ. Jesus speaks of His death.
From that time on Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes. He must be killed and on the third day be raised.
But Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, "Far be it from You, Lord; this shall never happen to You."
Then Jesus said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are an obstacle to me. You think not as God does, but as human beings do."
Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.
Whoever wants to save their life will lose it. But whoever loses their life for me will find it.
What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.
Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
Jesus with Moses and Elijah
After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John, his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
And as they stood there, His appearance changed, and His clothes became white as light.
And suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared before the disciples, and were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here! If you wish, I will put up three shelters here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to Him!"
And when the disciples heard it, they fell flat on their face, and were very afraid.
Then Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.
And when they looked around, they saw no one else but Jesus.
And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, "Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead."
And His disciples asked Him, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?" #Elijah...first. 10:17 Elijah was one of the prophets, who lived around 850 B.C. The Jews were expecting him to come, based on Malachi 4:5-6.
Jesus answered them, "Yes, Elijah is coming and will restore all things.
But I say unto you, Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. So also shall the Son of man suffer of them.
At that time the disciples understood that He spoke of John the Baptist. And Jesus, having called a young child to Him, set him in the midst of them,

«I have brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him.»
And Jesus said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? Bring your son hither.
Then Jesus, moved with compassion, commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the boy; and immediately the boy was cured.
Then the disciples came to him privately, and said, «Why could we not cast him out?»
Jesus answered them, "Because of your little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
But this kind is only cast out by prayer and fasting.** Jesus prophesying His death
And while they stayed in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.
And they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised to life again." The disciples were filled with grief. Temple tax
And when Jesus entered Capernaum, He came to Peter, and Peter asked Him, "Does Your tax-exaction reach the two drachma tax?"
Peter answered, "He does." Then Peter went into the house. And Jesus spoke to him first, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes, from their sons or from strangers?"
Peter answered, "The tax collectors receive it from the Gentiles." Jesus replied, "Then the children are exempt.
But lest we cause them a problem, go to the lake, cast your fishing line, and take the first fish that bites. Open its mouth, and you will find a four-dirham coin. Take it and give it to them, on my behalf and yours."
