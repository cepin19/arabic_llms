Chapter I. The Ancestors of Jesus Christ
These are the names of the ancestors of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham:
Isaac son of Abraham, and Jacob son of Isaac, and Judah and his brothers,
And Judah begat Pharez and Zarah, of Tamar; and Pharez begat Hezron, and Hezron begat Ram,
And Aram the son of Shem, and Nahor the son of Terah, and Nahshon the son of Amminadab,
Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab; Boaz the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth; Obed the father of Jesse;
And Solomon's son was Rehoboam, whose mother was Naamah the Ammonitess.
And Solomon the son of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the son of Abijah, Abijah the son of Asa,
And Asahel the son of Abijah, and Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, and Ben-Hahadil the son of Ohad.
And Azariah begat Joatham, and Joatham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah,
And Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh begat Amos; and Amos begat Josiah;
Josiah was born to Jekoniah and his brothers in the land of their captivity, Babylon.
And when the Jews returned from Babylon, Jechoniah begot Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel;
Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the son of Neri, and Neri the son of Melchi,
And Azur the son of Sadok, and Sadok the son of Achîam, and Achîam the son of Eliud,
And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;
And Jacob is the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, who was the mother of Jesus, who is called the Christ.
All the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations. The birth of Jesus Christ.
Thus was the birth of Jesus Christ: Mary, his mother, was betrothed to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Luke.
And Joseph, her husband, was a righteous man and he wanted to protect her; so, he decided to secretly divorce her.
And while he thought about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because what has been conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins." Luke.
And all this came to pass, that it might fulfil the saying of the Lord by the mouth of the Prophet,
The estate shall be fruitful, and shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
And when Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him: he took Mary as his wife,
But she did not enter the temple court; instead, an angel of the Lord appeared to her, and a light shone upon the holy place where she was. When the angel had gone from her, Mary said to herself, "Let me think of a way to approach my kinswoman Elizabeth and greet her. And so it was, that when Mary arose and had come to the house of Zechariah, she greeted Elizabeth. Luke 2:22-24
Chapter Two The astronomers came to see Jesus.
And Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod: and, lo, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying,
Kaisolo: «Where is the king of the Jews who has been born? We saw his star in the east and have come to pay him homage».
When King Herod heard this, he was perturbed, and so was everyone in Jerusalem.
And he called together the chief priests and all the scribes who interpreted the Law, and he asked them, "Where did the Christ have to be born?"
And they answered him: "Bethlehem in Judea, for thus it is written by the Prophet:
And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'
And Herod sent them secretly to the wise men, saying, "Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I also may come and worship him."
And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and search diligently for the young Child; and when you have found Him, bring me word, that I also may come and worship Him."
And when they heard the king's command, they departed. And the star, which they had seen in the east, went before them until it came and stood over the place where the young Child was.
And they didn't just spot the star, they were overjoyed.
When they entered the house, they saw the child with Mary, his mother, and they prostrated themselves and worshipped him. They opened their treasures and presented to him gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.
And having been warned by an angel in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed for their own country by another way. Joseph took Mary and the Child and departed for Egypt.
And behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said to him, "Arise and take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the Child to destroy Him."
And Joseph took the child and his mother by night, and went up to Egypt.
And it came to pass, that what was spoken by the Lord on the word of the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son, was fulfilled. Herod slew all the children that were in and about Bethlehem, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.
When Herod saw that he had been deceived by the wise men, he became very angry, and sent and slew all the male children in Bethlehem and its vicinity two years old and under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men.
Thus saith the Lord, as spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:
<font color="8B0000">From Ramah can be heard the wailing, </font><font color="8B008B">the loud lamentation</font><font color="8B0000">. Rachel weeping for her children, </font><font color="DAA520">refusing comfort</font><font color="8B0000">, for they are dead.</font> <font color="8B008B">The family of Jesus returns from Egypt.</font>
And when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
Get up, take the child and his mother and return to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead.
And Joseph took the child and his mother, and brought them into the land of Israel.
But when Archelaus began to reign in Judaea in place of his father Herod, Joseph feared a return there. God warned him in a dream, and he withdrew to the remote region of Galilee.
And he came to his own city, and taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man had this wisdom, and these mighty works? Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things? And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house. And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them. And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went about among the cities round about, and taught: and he returned to Capernaum.
Chapter Three John the Baptist Prepares the Way
And behold, John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Say to them, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Matthew
This is the man to whom the prophet Isaiah referred when he said: *A voice of one calling: "In the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him."*
John's clothing was made of camel hair, with a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
And people came to him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.
And they deliberately put their hands on the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
When John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them: "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Repent with your good deeds.
And don't start thinking with your heads: Abraham's wife is barren. I tell you: God is able to give children to Abraham from this very stone. John.
And now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
And he saw the Spirit descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: and lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
And then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
But John objected, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?"
And Jesus answered him, "Suffer it to be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed him.
And Jesus, being baptized, went up straightway out of the water; and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him.
And a voice came from heaven, saying, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased." Matthew 12:18, 17:5; Mark 1:11; Luke 9:35.
Chapter IV: Satan Tempts Jesus
And the Spirit led Jesus forth into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. Hebrews
He fasted for forty days and forty nights, and afterwards he was hungry.
And the devil, who had been testing him, said, "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread."
And Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'"
And thereafter the devil took him up into the holy city of Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple;
Throw your head down, if you are indeed a child of God, for it is written in the Book of God: "God will command His angels about you, and they will lift you up, so that your foot will not strike against a stone."
And Jesus answered him, "It is written again in the law of Moses: 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'"
And after Satan's ascent to the highest mountain, he saw the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said: "I will only give it to you if you prostrate to me and worship me."
And Jesus answered him, "Be gone, Satan! For it is written, 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only'."
And after this, Satan left Him alone. And behold, angels came and ministered to Him. Jesus went about all Galilee, preaching...
When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he returned to Galilee. Matthew
And he left Nazareth and dwelt in Capernaum by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali. John.
Thus shall what the Prophet Isaiah said come true:
"The lands of Zebulun and the lands of Naphtali, By the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, The Galil of the nations, who are not Jews!"
The people who sit in darkness have seen a great light, and for those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death, a light has dawned.
And Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Matthew 4:17 Jesus called his first disciples.
As Jesus was walking along the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the lake; for they were fishermen.
Then Jesus said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men."
And the clock's rooster escaped through their window nets and followed him.
And after a while he saw two other sons of Zebedee, James and John, sitting in a boat mending their nets. And immediately he called them;
And they left the boat and their father, and followed Him. Jesus taught and healed them.
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. Matthew
His fame spread throughout all Syria, and people brought to him all who were sick, suffering from various diseases and torments: those possessed by demons, those afflicted with paralysis and epilepsy, and he healed them all.
And many crowds followed Him, from Galilee, and the Ten Cities, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and the other side of the Jordan.
**Chapter Five: Jesus' Sermon on the Mount**
And when Jesus saw the multitudes, He went up on the mountain; and after He was seated, His disciples came to Him.
And he began to teach them, saying:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Happiness to those who keep it, where God will comfort them.
The meek shall inherit the Earth.
Those who are hungry and thirsty for the obedience of Allah, will be satisfied.
Those who show mercy will be shown mercy, for God will have mercy upon them.
Happy are those whose heart is pure, for they shall see God.
Happiness to those who help people live in bliss, for they shall be called the children of God.
Happy are those who suffer persecution for doing what is right, for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to them. 1 Peter 3:14
And the only response that you get from the world is, "They're nothing but a bunch of fools! What a waste! 1 Peter 4:14
Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you." Acts 7:52 The salt of the earth and the light of the world.
"We are the salt of the earth; but if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet. Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34,35"
We are the light of the world, a city on a hill cannot be hidden. John
And he does not put the lamp under the bushel basket, but on the lampstand, so that those who enter may see the light. Mark
Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. 1 Peter 2:12
I did not come to abolish the law of Moses or the Prophets. I did not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
And we declare to you the sky and the earth will pass away, but not a single letter, not a single dot of the Law will pass until all that it promises has been fulfilled. Luke.
The one who does not put into practice any of these least commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever obeys them and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
And I tell you this: unless your righteousness exceeds that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven."
You have probably heard the old adage: "Do not kill, and whoever kills must be punished."
But I tell you: If anyone among you is anxious about a brother or judges his brother, he shall be subject to the great court. And whoever says to his brother, 'You fool!' shall be liable to the flames of Gehenna.
Or else bring your gift and place it on the altar, and remember that your brother has something against you; leave your gift there before the altar, and go and be reconciled to your brother first.
Let your gift stay before the slaughterhouse and go and make peace with your brother first. Then come and give me your gift.
Make peace with those who have quarrelled with you; neither of you will remain on the road to the courthouse. Before you reach the judge, the judge will hand you over to the officer, and the officer will throw you in jail.
"I'll give you a piece of advice: you won't leave here until you've paid every last dirham you owe." Corruption.
I heard him say: Don't spoil it.
But I tell you: anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
But if your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you, for it is better that you lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
But if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed than to have two hands and go to hell. Matthew 18:8; Mark 9:43 Divorce
And he said: "Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce. And let it be a witness between you."
But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery." Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11,12; Luke 16:18; 1 Corinthians 7:10,11
And I heard it again from your ancestors: "Even if you vow not to comb your hair, fulfill your vow to the Lord with what you have".
And I say unto you: Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: nor by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.
nor on earth, where his feet may stand; nor in Jerusalem, the city of the great King.
And don't swear by your head, for you cannot bring back a single hair, black or white.
But if your speech is yes, let it be yes; and if no, let it be no. Whatever is more than these is of the evil one.
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
But I tell you: Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.
And if anyone sues you in court to take your tunic, let them have your cloak as well.
Or one thing that annoys you, walk with it two thousand steps.
"If someone asks you for something, give it to them, and don't turn away someone who wants to borrow from you." - Buyou Ediyankum
"Hear this, my son: Choose your close friends and hate your enemy."
But I say unto you: Love your enemies, and pray for those who despitefully use you.
To be the sons of your Father in heaven. He makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
If you only want what likes you, what merit is there in that? Isn't that what taxmen do?
Or do you only give to your brothers. How are you better than others? Even those who worship idols do the same.
"Iwa kono kamelin, kama baqim eli fe smaa kamel."
Chapter 6: Charity
Beware not to do your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them, or you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
And if you intend to give charity, do not make a trumpet call about it as the hypocrites do in the mosques and in the streets, to be praised by people. I tell you the truth: they have received their reward from men.
But if you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
«In order for your charity to remain a secret, it is the One in Heaven, the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing, Who will reward you». The Prayer.
"When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites who love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that others may see them. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward. Luke."
When you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites who love to stand and pray aloud in the synagogues and on street corners so that others may see them. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.
"Be not like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him."
Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name.
And Your Kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven.
The bread that sustains us today is our rice.
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And we saved ourselves from falling into the experience, and we escaped from Satan.
If you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will forgive you yours.
But if you do not forgive people their mistakes, neither will the One in Heaven forgive you your mistakes." Fasting
"Except their silence, they do not frown like the hypocrites who frown to show people they are fasting. I'll tell you the truth: those people have taken their reward from the people."
But before the net, anoint your hair and wash your face,
"When you're walking among people and you want them to see that you're fasting, remember that your true reward lies in the secrets of your heart, and in the secrets that are known only to God. He is the One who will reward you." Heavenly Treasures.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal. Jacob.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust can destroy, and where thieves do not break in or steal;
"Wherever your treasure is, there your heart will be also". Nur ud-Din.
The eye is the lamp of the soul. If your eye is healthy, your whole being will be full of light.
But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!" God and Mammon.
Not even one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. Do not worry.
And based on this, let me tell you: Do not worry about your livelihood; what you eat or drink, or about your body and what you wear. Is life not more important than food, and the body more important than clothes?
Behold the birds of the sky, they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of much more value than they?
Who among you can add a single hour to his life?
And why do you trouble yourselves with clothes? Look carefully at the roses in the garden, how they grow. They neither toil nor spin.
But I'll tell you the truth: even Solomon himself, in all his glory, never wore anything close to these roses.
O you who have disbelieved! Is it not better for you that the promise of Allah should come to pass, which is better than all riches, The spring of the garden which you see today, and tomorrow it is cut up and cast into the fire, being replaced by another like it, is it not easier for Him to replace you with a better people?
And because of this, never ask them: What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or What shall we wear?
> Way even those who don't know God ask for all this, and You in Heaven know we need all these things.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
"Don't carry your burdens into the next day, leave the worries of tomorrow for tomorrow. Each day has enough worry of its own."
Chapter Seven: May No One Judge Another
Judge not, lest ye be judged.
When the rulers rule, he rules over you; and when the bell tolls, it tolls for thee. Mark.
Why do you see the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye, but don't notice the log in your own eye?
How can I tell my brother, 'Let me remove the straw from your eye, when there's a log in your own'?
Oh, you hypocrite! Get that stick out of your eye, then you'll see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
Do not give the sacred thing to dogs, lest they tear you apart and maim you. And do not throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them underfoot.**Request**, **seek** and **knock**.
They ordered and took. They searched and found. They knocked and it shall be opened.
The road that one asks for will be given, the one who seeks will find, and the door will be opened for the knocker.
Who among you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
Who asks for a fish, he shall receive a whale.
Eva, if it's you who aren't doing a good job giving your children good things, how could the One above not give good things to those who ask for them?
"Do to others as you would have them do to you. Luke 6:31 The narrow gate."
Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who go in by it.
How narrow is the gateway, and how rugged the road that leads to life; few find it." A tree is known by its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravening wolves.
My way is to know them by their fruits. Can you pick grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
A good tree yields good fruit, and a bad tree yields bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.
Not every tree bears good fruit, so it gets cut down and thrown away. When?
"By their fruit you will recognize them." Matthew 12:33 We must do the will of God.
Not everyone who says to Me: "Lord, Lord!" will enter the Kingdom of Heaven; but only the one who does the will of My Father in Heaven.
For you is the day. Many will say to me: O sir! Is it not in your name that we prophesied? In your name we drove out demons? In your name we performed many miracles?
I'll tell them: I never knew you! Get away from me, you hypocrites!! Two faced people.
The way of the man who listens to my words and acts on them is like a wise builder who constructs his house upon the rock.
And when winter fell and the streams overflowed, a strong wind struck the house. It did not collapse, for its foundation was built of rock.
Whosoever hears my words and does not act upon them is like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand.
«And when winter fell and the streams overflowed, a strong wind struck the house, and its tiles held fast, for its mortar was strong».
And when Jesus had finished these words, the people were astonished at his teaching; Mark.
It was as if he were teaching them like a person with authority, not like the scholars of their religious law.
Chapter Eight: Jesus the Charioteer, a Brave Man
And when Jesus came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him.
And a leper approached and bowed down before him, saying, "Lord, if you wish, you can make me clean."
And behold, a man reached out his hand and touched Jesus, saying, "I want to be clean." And immediately the leprosy left him.
And Jesus said to him, "See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." And when he had gone out, he began to proclaim it much and openly, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter the city, but was outside in desolate places; and they came to Him from every direction.
And when Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him,
<b>Master</b>, I have a servant at home who is <b>paralyzed and suffering greatly in bed.</b>
He says to Jesus, "I'm coming to see Him."
The military leader answered: "I do not deserve for you to enter under the roof of my home, but just say one word and my servants will recover."
«Even I have someone who rules over me, and I have soldiers that I rule over. I say to this one: Go! and he goes. I say to another: Come! and he comes. I say to my slave: Do this! and he does it.»
And when Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to those who followed Him, "Assuredly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!
Many will come from the east and the west, and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. Luke.
"As for those who should have been in the Kingdom, they will wander in darkness outside. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Matthew.
And Jesus said to the centurion, "Go; let it be done for you according to your faith." And the servant was healed at that very moment. And Jesus healed many of the people who were sick, besides raising Jarius' daughter.
And when Jesus entered Peter's house, He saw Peter's mother-in-law lying sick in bed with a fever.
And Jesus, having taken her hand, called, saying, "Little girl, arise." And immediately the fever left her, and she rose and waited on them.
And when evening came, many people affected by various forms of insanity were brought to him, and he healed them all by merely speaking a word.
Thus was fulfilled what Isaiah the Prophet had said: "He took our infirmities and bore our diseases." How then shall we, who follow Jesus, escape?
And when Jesus saw the multitude, He commanded His disciples to go to the other side of the sea.
He approached one of the religious scholars and said to him: "My master, I will follow you wherever you go."
And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
One of his other disciples said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus answered him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead." And Jesus went away.
And Jesus, getting into a boat, crossed over the sea; and His disciples followed Him.
And a great windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking over the boat so that it was already filling up. Jesus was in the stern, asleep on a pillow.
And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying: "Master, we perish!
He says to them: «Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?». Then he got up, and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
And the men marvelled, saying: "Who is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?" When Jesus had cast out the devils from the possessed man of the country of the Gadarenes.
When Jesus had crossed over to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes, two men who were possessed by demons met him, coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.
They started to mock and joke: "What's between us and you, O son of Allah? Did you come here to torment us ahead of time?"
The single halal butcher shop was located in a nearby spot.
The lunatics desired Jesus and said: "If You do not cast us out, send us into the herd of swine".
He told them: "March!" and they walked into it, and the whole piece of bread crumbled and fell from the edge of the mountain into the sea, where it sank.
And they escaped unhindered and went to the city and told everything that had happened, and what had befallen the men who were possessed with demons.
And the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to depart from their region.
Chapter Nine Jesus the Paralytic Healer
And Jesus got into the boat, and crossed over the sea, and came to His own city.
And they brought to Him a man who was sick, lying on a bed; and Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, "Son, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven you."
Some of the scholars of the Shariah have it in their minds: "This man speaks the words of disbelief!".
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said: "Why do you think evil in your hearts?
Is it easier to say: "Your sins are forgiven", or is it to say: "Rise and walk"?
"But I will show you that mankind has authority on earth to forgive sins." He said to the paralytic, "Rise, pick up your mat and go home."
And the man struggled and walked to his home.
When the crowds saw what had happened, they were afraid, and they revered the glory of God, which was displayed in Jesus' choice of Matthew.
And as Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax booth. He said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and followed him.
And after He got into the boat, He crossed over, and came to His own city. And behold, they brought to Him a man sick with the palsy, lying on a bed. And Jesus, seeing the faith of them, said to the paralytic, "Son, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven you." And some of the scribes were sitting there, reasoning in their hearts, "Why does this Man speak thus? He blasphemes! Who can forgive sins but One, even God?" But Jesus, immediately knowing in His spirit that they thus reasoned within themselves, said to them, "Why do you reason about these things in your hearts? Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Arise, take up your bed and walk'? But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins" - He said to the paralytic - "I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house." And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went out before them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, "We never saw it like this!"
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
And when Jesus heard it, He said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.
Iwa Seyrou, learn the meaning of these words: "I want mercy, not the sacrifice. I'm not calling out for those who fear God, but for the wrongdoers." The question is about fasting.
Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?
And Jesus answered them, "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast."
Not even one would patch an old garment with a new piece of cloth, since the patch would only shrink and make the tear even bigger.
And no one ever serves the new wine in old skins, for if he does, the new wine will burst the skins and both wine and skins are lost. Rather, new wine is served in fresh skins, and both are preserved." The daughter of the president and the woman who touched Jesus' garment.
And when Jesus heard it, he said unto him, One only is my daughter dead, but lo, she is risen again.
And Jesus went forth with his disciples.
And a woman, who had an issue of blood which had afflicted her for twelve years, and had spent all her living upon physicians, and could not be healed of any, came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.
She thought to herself: "I'll only touch his belongings and that will make me feel better."
And Jesus, turning about, and seeing her, said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole: and the woman was made whole from that hour.
And when Jesus had come to the official's house and saw the flute players, and the crowd making a commotion,
He told them: «Get out of here! The girl is not dead, she's just asleep!», and they laughed at him.
And when He had gone out, He took the girl by the hand, and the maiden arose.
The news of it shall spread to all the ends of the earth. Jesus is Lord over the blind.
And when Jesus had passed on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, "Son of David, have mercy on us!"
And when he entered the house, the blind men came to him. And Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord."
And Jesus said to them, "According to your faith be it done to you."
And they were casting out devils, and anointing with oil many that were sick, and healing them. And Jesus charged them, saying, "Speak not of it to any man."
But they went out and started spreading the news all over the place. Zizon Kitchevy.
And they brought to him a man who was blind and insane.
When Jesus had driven out the spirits, the mute man spoke. And the crowds were amazed, saying, "Such a thing has never been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the prince of demons." Matthew 10:25, 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15 The Persecution of Jesus
And Jesus, as His custom was, was going to the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and He stood up to read. He was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when He had opened the book, He found the place where it was written: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, Because He has anointed Me To preach the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to the captives And recovery of sight to the blind, To set at liberty those who are oppressed; To preach the acceptable year of the Lord." And He closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. And the eyes of all who were in the synagogue were fixed on Him. And He began to say to them, "Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing." Luke 4:16-21
And when he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Mark.
And he said unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few. Luke.
"Iwa asked the mill owner to send the harvest to his mill."
Chapter Ten: Jesus Sends Out the Seventy-Two
And after calling His disciples near, Jesus gave them authority to cast out demons and heal every sickness and disease.
These are the names of the Twelve Apostles: first, Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
And Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus,
Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Him.
And He sent them out, instructing them, saying, "Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into a Samaritan village;
But go to the sheepfolds, the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
And as you go, preach, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is at hand."
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.
Do not carry in your pockets any gold, silver or copper coins,
No stipend, no fancy clothes, no boots, no staff, for the workman is worth his food. 1 Corinthians 9:14; 1 Timothy 5:18
And the city, nor the roundabout you entered, ask anyone who is worth hosting you, and stay with them until you leave on your own.
And if you enter a house, greet the inmates.
And otherwise, the inhabitants of the House deserve your greetings. Your greetings will reach them. And if they do not deserve them, your greetings will return to you.
Or they wouldn't have accepted you into any house or city; they would not have listened to your words. Out you go, shake the dust from your feet! It's over.
Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you. For it is given unto you, that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

And when they give you their hands, don't push them away, not knowing how or what to say, because then they will ask you what to say.
Since it is not you who will be speaking, but the Spirit of your Father who is in heaven, he will give you the words to say.
Mark 8:31​ And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
And they'll gawk at me because of my name. But whoever remains steadfast until the end, them I will win over. When?
But whenever they persecute you in one town, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.&quot;
The student's path is not better than his teacher's, nor the servant better than his master. Luke.
The disciple is not above his teacher, nor the servant above his master. If they have called the master Beelzebul, how much more shall they call those of his household! (Matthew 9:34, 12:24, Mark 3:22, Luke 11:15)
Fear not, for that which is hidden shall be revealed, and that which is veiled shall come to light. Mark.
And that which I told you at night, speak of it in the day. And that which you heard in secret, proclaim it from the housetops.
Fear not those who kill the body and can't kill the soul, but fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in Hell.
Look! Pigeons for sale at one dirham each! And not a single one of them will fall to the ground unless the buyer wishes so, even those up in the sky.
And we even count every hair on your head.
Don't worry, you're much better than many birds.
Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.
But if we suffer for it, we'll also reign with him. 2 Timothy 2:12
It's not for you to decide whether I came to bring peace on Earth. I didn't come to bring peace but a sword.
I came to distinguish between the boy and his father, the girl and her mother, and the bride and her grandmother.
They will become wild humans, real owners of the house.
The one who cherishes their father or mother more than me, does not deserve me. The one who cherishes their son or daughter more than me, does not deserve me.
And he who does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Matthew.
Whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it. Matthew 16:25; Mark 8:35; Luke 9:24, 17:33; John 12:25 Reward.
The one who welcomed you welcomed me, and the one who welcomed me also welcomed the one who sent me. Luke.
Whoever welcomes someone with the intention that the Prophet would have approved, will receive a reward akin to that of the Prophet's. Likewise, whoever welcomes a God-fearing person, knowing them to be such, will receive a reward akin to that of a God-fearing person.
Whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is My disciple, truly I tell you, he will never lose his reward.".
Chapter 3: John the Baptist sends his disciples to Jesus
When Jesus had finished giving these instructions to his disciples, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea,
When John heard in prison what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to ask him.
<b>Gal said:</b> «Is it you who's coming or shall we wait for someone else?»
And Jesus answered and said to them, "Go and report to John what you hear and see:
The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
«And bliss to him who never doubts.»
And when His disciples had gone away, Jesus began to speak to the multitudes about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
Did you at least see a man wearing fancy clothes? Because those who wear fancy clothes live in kings' palaces!
<b>What did you go out to see? Is it a prophet? I tell you it's more than a prophet.</b>
And this is what Allah says in His Book: *Behold, I am sending My messenger ahead of you, to show you the way.*
For I say to you, Among those born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist; but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. Luke
<em>The prophets of old spoke of the law of Moses and the prophets up until the time of John the Baptist.</em>
But if you are willing to accept it, John the Baptist is Elijah, who was to come. Matthew
Ewa, listen up, you guys!
But what will this generation be like? It's like some kids sitting in the back seat of a car, shouting and calling each other:
We puffed up the lira for you, but you didn't get carried away. We sighed for you, but you didn't shed a tear!
John's way was rough and dry, and he neither ate nor drank, and they said, "He is possessed by a demon."
And the son of man is born, eating and drinking; and they say: Behold a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! And wisdom is justified by her deeds." Woe to the blogger who doesn't repent.
And the clock's rooster began to crow, Jesus said to the recorded people among whom He had done many miracles, more than among the others, because they had not repented.
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. # 11:21 Sitting in sackcloth and ashes: To demonstrate their repentance.
But I tell you: the punishment for the photographer and Sidon will be lighter than yours on Judgment Day.
And you, Capernaum! Do you want to be exalted up to heaven? You shall be thrust down to Hades. For if the miracles had been performed in Sodom which were performed in you, it would have remained to this day.
And I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you." Matthew 10:15, Luke 10:12 Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned, and revealed them to little children.
O Father, so be it done.
The Father has given Me everything; and no one knows the Son except the Father; and no one knows the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal Him. John 3:35; John 1:18; 10:15.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Shake the yoke off yourselves and learn from me, for I am wise and humble, and you shall find rest for your souls.
«My workload is light and my pregnancy is easy».
Chapter Tanakh teaches on the Sabbath.
And He said to them, "It is not for you to know the times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth." Now when He had spoken these things, when they were watching, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. And as they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel, who also said, "You men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you saw Him go into heaven."
And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.
They replied: "Haven't you read about what David did when he and those with him were hungry?"
How he entered the House of God and ate the bread they serve to God, which neither he nor the others with him were supposed to eat, except for the clergy themselves.
Did you not read in the Torah that the priests in the House of God break the Sabbath and yet are guiltless?
But I tell you: Here is one greater than the temple!
And if you understood the meaning of the verse which says: 'I want mercy, not sacrifice', you would not have judged those who are blameless.
«For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath». Jesus healed on the Sabbath.
And he walked from the place he was at to their house of prayer.
One man's hand was paralyzed. They kept questioning him, asking: "Is healing permitted on the Sabbath?" They were trying to find fault with him.
And he answered them, "Which one of you who has a sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?" Luke.
"A human is worth much more than a sheep! That's why doing good deeds is halal even on a Saturday".
Jesus said to the man whose hand was paralyzed, "Stretch out your hand!" And he stretched it out, and it was restored, healthy like the other.
And the Pharisees went out and plotted how to kill Jesus. Jesus was God's chosen one.
And when Jesus heard it, He departed from there by boat to a deserted place by Himself. But when the multitudes heard it, they followed Him on foot from the cities. And when Jesus went out He saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion for them, and healed them all.
And he recommended them not to inform anyone about him.
For the word of the Prophet Isaiah to come true:
Behold my Servant, whom I have chosen, my Beloved, in whom my Soul delighteth: I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall shew the Gentiles the truth.
I won't argue or grumble, no one will hear my voice in the alleys.
A broken qasaba will not be concealed, and a smoking fuse will not be put out, until the truth prevails.
«And in his name the nations will put their hope.» Jesus and Beelzebul.
And some people brought to Jesus a man who was blind and demon-possessed. And He healed him, so that the blind man could see and speak.
And the crowds marveled, saying: «Isn't this Joseph's son?»
And when the Pharisees heard it, they said, "It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that he casts out devils." Matthew 9:34; 10:25
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them: "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If a demon is casting out a demon, the demon is divided and becomes an adversary to himself. How then will his kingdom survive?
Or I with Beelzebub cast out devils? Whose sons therefore do cast out devils, they will judge them.
But unless I am by the Spirit of God, I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
How could someone enter another's house, steal their belongings without tying them up first, and then rob their entire house?
"Whoever is not against us is with us, and whoever does not gather with us, scatters." Mark 9:40
That is why I tell you: All sins and blasphemies will be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"He who speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but he who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this world or in the hereafter." Luke 12:10 The tree and its fruit.
They planted a good tree, its fruit will be good too. They planted a bad tree, its fruit will be bad. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
<b>O you tricksters! How can you utter any good speech when you yourselves are not good? The mouth speaks what the heart is full of.</b>
A kind person brings forth good things from the good treasure within their heart, while a wicked person brings forth wicked things from the wicked treasure within their heart.
And remember: Every idle word that people speak, they will have an account for it on the Day of Reckoning.
Since you speak, judgment will be passed on you, either you are for Him or against Him». The scholars of the law and the Pharisees wanted to see a sign.
And some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying: "Master, we would see a sign from thee."
And he saith unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.
For as Jonah was in the whale's belly three days and three nights, so shall the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
The people of Nineveh will rise up in judgment against this generation and will condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here.
And the Queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
The national road that drives out the jinn from people goes to places without water. It seeks rest but doesn't find it.
Keewol: Let's go back to the house I left, and when I return I find it empty, cleared out and locked up.
"And kimchi and kids together bring seven kinds of madness, worse than the devil himself. When they enter, they settle in, and that person becomes completely different from who they were before. That's what will happen to this generation that does evil, too." Jesus' brothers and sisters,
And when he was talking to these groups of people, his mother and siblings came and stood outside, wanting to talk to him.
He is told by one of those present: "Here's your brother and his friends outside wishing to speak with you." This verse is not found in many old manuscripts.
And Jesus answered him, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
And he waved his hand towards his students, saying: «These are my sons and my brothers.
«Those who do God's will up in the sky, they are my brother, my sister and my mother.»
Chapter 31: The Farmer's Tale
And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. He said this, and departing, he went out, and hid himself by the sea.
And the multitude gathered together unto him, so that he entered into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore. Luke 5:1-3
And he began to say to them in parables: "A man went out to sow."
And when he planted them, some fell on the path and the birds came and ate them up.
And they fell like ripe olives onto a stony ground with not much soil. Since the soil wasn't soaked, they sprouted quickly.
And when the sun rose, it scorched them, and because they had no root, they withered away.
And they fell like raindrops in the middle of the thorns. When the thorns grew up, they suffocated them.
And they fell on good ground and yielded a crop: some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.
"If anyone has two ears, let him hear!" The purpose of the muezzin is to call out the adhan and invite the community to the mosque.
And his disciples came to him and said, "Why do you speak to the people in parables?"
He tells them: 'I will give you the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven, but not them.
For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.
And I was speaking to them in metaphors because as soon as they see, they don't see; as soon as they hear, they don't hear or understand.
And the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled in them, which saith: Though hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive.
When the heart of this people has grown hard, their hearing is dull, and their eyes are closed, so that they may not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear. Luke.
<h1>You are lucky indeed: many prophets and righteous people wished to see what you see, and they did not, and to hear what you hear, and they never did.</h1>
"Now listen to the message this man is sending:"
The one who hears the words about the Kingdom of God and doesn't understand them, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. That's what's meant by the seed falling along the path.
And whoever sows in the stony ground, this is he that heareth the word of God, and anon with gladness receiveth it;
But the word of God does not dwell in his heart firmly, and his faith lasts only a short time. When troubles and persecution arise, he quickly falls away from the faith.
And the one planted among thorns is the one who hears the word of God, but the worries of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
But the one sown in the good earth, this is the man who hears the word and understands it; he indeed bears fruit, and produces, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty." The parable of the weed in the midst of the wheat.
And Jesus said unto them, The kingdom of heaven is like a man which sowed good seed in his field:
When people were asleep, the enemy came, sowed tares among the wheat, and left.
And when the blade sprouted and produced grain, then appeared the weeds also.
And the servants of the master of the house come and say to him: 'Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Then how does it have darnel?'
He answers them: This is the enemy who did this. His servants reply: Would you like us to remove him?
And he answered them: No! So that the wheat will not be burned along with the chaff.
The thistles grow among the wheat until harvest time. Then we say it's time for the harvesters to come and gather the wheat, tying it in sheaves to be burned. They collect the thistles separately, taking them to my storehouse. The parable of the mustard seed and the parable of the yeast.
He told them another parable: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and planted in his field.
«And yet, she is all heart; when she grows up, she'll be a tree towering above the saplings. Even the birds of the sky will come to nest in her branches.»
And he spoke another parable unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
And all this Jesus did, teaching in the synagogues, and no one laid a hand on Him; for His hour had not yet come.
In order for the words of the Prophet to come true: "It is through the madman that we speak and tell of all that has been hidden since the day the world was created." The meaning of this parable is like a mirror.
And when the crowd was dismissed, Jesus went into the house. Then His disciples came to Him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the tares among the wheat."
And he answered them, saying: "It is the Son of Man that soweth the good seed."
And the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;
And the enemy that sowed the tares is the devil; and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
And as tares gather and are burned in health, so it will be in the end of the world:
He will send his angels and gather from his kingdom all those who lead others into sin and all who do evil.
And they throw them the spear of health, for indeed, where else would the wailing and gnashing of teeth be.
But those who obey Allah shine forth like the sun in the realm of Baham. So, anyone with ears, let them hear!** The parable of the treasure, the jewel and the web.
And again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found, and hid; and for joy over it he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.
And the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls,
«When he found a very precious gemstone, he sold everything he owned and bought it.»
And again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind.
And when they had spent their lives, the fishermen took her out beside the sea, and after stripping her, they placed the good parts in the baskets and threw away the rest.
Thus it shall be at the end of the age: the angels shall come forth and separate the evil from among the righteous.
"O Vermiou, the cities between Al-'Afiyah and Al-Zubaydah, where then shall be the wailing and gnashing of teeth?" The new and the old treasure.
And Jesus said to His disciples, "Do you understand all these things?" And they said to Him, "Yes."
He tells them: "Indeed, the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure store new things and old". Nazareth did not accept Jesus.
And when Jesus had finished all these sayings, He departed from there.
And he returned to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as was his custom, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read. And the book of the prophet Esaias was delivered unto him. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the Gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down: and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his name Joseph, and aren't his brothers called James, Joseph, Simon and Judas?
Who are these guys living in our city? Where did all this come from?**
And they did not receive Him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house." John 4:44 .
And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God. And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles; And it came to pass, that he was in a certain city, and behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus, fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And Jesus putting forth his hand touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him. And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. And the fame of him went abroad into every place of the country.
Chapter Fourteen: The Death of John the Baptist
And for your sake, Herod the ruler heard about Jesus,
He tells his servants: «This is John the Baptist, whom I raised from the dead. That is why these miraculous signs accompany him.»
Herod had John the Baptist arrested and imprisoned at the request of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. (Luke)
Since John said to him: «It is not lawful for you to marry her.»
And he sought to kill him, but feared the people, for they held him as a prophet.
At Herod's birthday party, Herodias' daughter performed a dance that delighted Herod.
And that's why he swore to give her what she asked for.
And she said, "Herodias, that's what I want. Bring me the head of John the Baptist on a platter!"
And the King felt sad, but since he had sworn an oath in front of the people present, he ordered that her wish be granted.
And he sent him who beheaded John to prison.
And they brought it in a tray and gave it to the girl. She took it to Maha.
John's disciples came and took the body and buried it; and they went and told Jesus. Jesus said, "Bring the five loaves here to Me."
When Jesus heard this, He left the crowd and went into a lonely place by Himself. And when the people heard it, they followed Him on foot from the towns.
And when he stepped out of the boat, he saw a large crowd of people, and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
When evening came, his students approached him and said: "We're managing out here in the wilderness. Why don't you tell the people to go to the villages and buy food for themselves?"
But Jesus said to them, "They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat."
He told them: "All we have here are five loaves of bread and two fishes".
I'll show them! I'll bring them here!
And he is commanding the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, and blessed God. And he broke the loaves, gave them to his disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.
They all ate their fill of the food, then gathered twelve bundles filled with loaves of bread.
They were the five thousand, not counting the women and children. Jesus walked on the water.
And Jesus commanded his disciples to get into the boat, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
And when he had sent them away, he went up to the mountain to pray. And he remained alone there until evening.
And the students' boat drifted far into the middle of the sea, overwhelmed by the waves, as the wind was against them.
And in the morning, Jesus came to his disciples walking on the sea.
When the students saw him walking on water, they were terrified and shouted: «It's a ghost!», and fled in fear.
Be of good cheer, it is I; be not afraid!" said Jesus to them.
And he saith unto Peter, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.
And Jesus said: «Come!» And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when he saw the wind was strong and he started to drown, he cried out: "Save me, my master!"
And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him, and said to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
And when they got into the boat, the winds died down.
And those in the boat worshipped Him, saying, "Truly You are the Son of God." And when they had come ashore, they saw a great crowd, and a certain man came to Him, falling down at His feet, saying, "My son is very sick; please come and lay Your hands on him, that he may be healed."
And when Jesus and his disciples had crossed over to the other side of the sea, they came unto the land of Gennesaret.
They called him the healer of the land, and all the people of the two Qaways knew of him. They brought him their sick.
And they asked for him to perform, even though he was only a little boy. Whoever touched him was healed.
<h1>Chapter XV<br>Discussions on the Habit of the Shehu</h1>
And behold, some of the Pharisees and scribes came down from Jerusalem, and said unto him,
"Why don't your students follow the tradition of the elders? Because they don't wash their hands before eating."
But he answered them, "Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?
He who sells his father or his mother must be killed.
But we say: whoever says what their father didn't say: that's what I'm here to help you with, I've given it as a gift to God.
It is no longer his duty to take care of her. This is how you twist the words of God so you can follow your tradition.
O hypocrites! Behold, Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you, saying:
Some people praise me only with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
"And to no avail do they worship Me, teaching as doctrine the commandments of men." The things that make people bind themselves.
And he called out to the assembly, saying: "Hear me, all of you, and understand:"
It's not what enters a man's mouth that makes him unclean, but what comes out of his mouth; that is what makes him unclean."
Then the disciples came and said to Him, "Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?"
And he answered them, saying: "The trees that you did not plant, whose fruit you did not harvest, will supply your needs.
Let them alone: for they be blind, and blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. Luke
Peter said: "He explained the meaning of this parable to us!"
And he replies: "What, you still don't understand?"
Didn't you know that whatever goes into one's mouth goes down into the stomach, and then comes out?
And that which comes out from the mouth, comes out from the heart, and it is that which makes a person human. When.
Since from the heart come evil thoughts: murder, adultery, both physical and verbal, theft, false witness, slander.
«That's what makes a person human, but eating with unwashed hands doesn't make a person unclean». The faith of the Canaanite woman.
And Jesus went out from there and came into the region of Tyre and Sidon.
And a Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is tormented severely by a demon."
But he didn't answer her even with a single word. His students moved closer and said: "Send her away, since she's following us and bothering us!"
And Jesus answered them, "My Father has sent Me not but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
But that woman's hen pecked him and prostrated herself, saying: «Help me, my lord!»
And he answered: "It's unthinkable to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
The woman replied: "Yes, my lord! But even the dogs eat from the alms that fall from their masters' tables."
And Jesus answered her, "Woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you desire." And her daughter was healed instantly. Many were made well.
And after these things Jesus walked by the Sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.
And many people came to Him, bringing with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they laid them down at His feet; and He healed them.
And the crowds were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the lame being restored, the crippled walking, and the blind seeing; and they praised the God of Israel. Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me now for three days, and have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away hungry."
And Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, "I feel compassion for these people, because they have remained with Me now three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."
And they ask the students: "Where in this desolate place could we possibly find enough bread to feed such a large group?"
Jesus asked them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."
And Jesus said to the people, "Let the children be seated on the ground."
And He took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to His disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitude.
They all ate their fill of the meat, and seven of them carried the bags full of the remaining bread.
There were 24,000 people eating, excluding women and children.
And when Jesus had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when even was come, he was there alone.
Chapter Sixty-Eight: Signs of the Times
Then some of the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus, testing Him and demanding that He show them a sign from heaven. Matthew
But he answered them, "When evening comes, you say, 'The weather will be fair, for the sky is red.'
And in the morning they say: "Today will be rainy, because the sky is red and hazy". You can interpret the weather, but not the signs of the times!
An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah." Then He left them and departed. Matthew 12:39; Luke 11:29 The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
And when the students reached the other side of the sea, they had forgotten to bring the bread.
Beware, and keep yourselves from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Luke.
They're telling tales: "Say that stuff because you didn't bring any bread with us."
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said unto them: Why reason ye, because ye have no bread?
Didn't you understand it yet? Don't you get the five loaves of bread shared among five thousand people? How many baskets full of leftover bread did you collect? When?
And you didn't think about the seven loaves that fed four thousand people? How many baskets of leftovers did you collect? When?
How could you fail to understand that I was not talking to you about bread? Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!**
And the hour is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering service to God. They will do this because they have not known the Father, nor understood my teaching. I have told you these things so that you may understand: I am not speaking of all the world, but of those whom the Father has given me; they are the ones who love me, and whom I love. I have made your name known to them and will continue to make it known, so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them and that I myself may be in them." Peter testified that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God.
And when Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
And they answered him, "Some say John the Baptist; others, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets." Matthew
Who am I in your eyes?
And Simon Peter answered and said: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!" John.
And Jesus said to Simon: "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven."
And I tell you: you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the power of death shall not conquer it.
And I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in Heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in Heaven." Matthew
And Jesus instructed his disciples, "Do not tell anyone that I am the Messiah. He also began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again."
From that time onward, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go up to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.
Peter pulled him aside and started scolding him: "Never, my master, would such a thing happen to you!"
He looked around and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men."
He tells his disciples, "Whoever wants to follow me must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me.
For he who wants to save his life will lose it, but he who has lost his life for My sake will find it. Matthew
Who benefits from a life of solely pursuing earthly gains? What can one give in exchange for their life?
And the path shall be shown forth by the angels to every man, and he shall be rewarded according to his deeds.
<b>And I give you the right: There are those present here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.</b>
Chapter 17 shows Jesus in all His glory.
And after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain apart.
And his shape changed before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his garments became white as light.
And Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "How good it is that we are here! If You wish, let us make three tabernacles here: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And when he was partaking of the glory, a voice came out of the cloud, saying: &ldquo;This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found delight.&rdquo; 2 Peter 1:17,18
When the students heard this, they fell on their faces in fear.
And Jesus came to them, and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.
And they lifted up their eyes, and saw no one else but Jesus only.
And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, "Tell no one the vision until the Son of Man is risen from the dead."
His students asked him: "Why do the religious scholars say that the coming of the prophet Elijah is a prerequisite?"
And he answered them, saying: "In truth, Elijah Gigi is the first and will fix everything."
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of Man will suffer at their hands." Matthew
And the clock's dick made the students understand that he was talking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus, the messiah, is born.
And when Jesus and His disciples had come to the place, behold, a certain man came up to Him, kneeling down to Him,
Please help him, my lord. My son is suffering greatly and often falls ill and gets hurt.
«I served it to my students, but they couldn't see it.»
And Jesus said, «O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? Bring him hither to me.».
And Jesus arose, and took the young man by the hand, and lifted him up; and immediately the devil came out of him, and the young man was cured.
The disciples came near Jesus and asked him privately, "Why couldn't we drive the demon out?"
He said to them: "Because of your little faith! I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
And this kind of insanity can only be cast out by prayer and fasting.[# 17‏.21 This verse is not found in many ancient manuscripts: Matthew 21‏:21; Mark 11‏:23; 1 Corinthians 13‏:2 Jesus foretells his death and resurrection once again.]
And His disciples were gathered together in Galilee, and Jesus said unto them,
And they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised." The students were very sad. Jesus paid the temple tax.
When Jesus came to Capernaum again, the tax collectors approached Peter and asked, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
And He answered and said to them: "Yes, he pays them." When He had come into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying: "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes? From their own sons, or from strangers?"
And Peter answered: "The outside." Jesus said to him: "Then the children are free from this tax.
But so as not to cause them any trouble, go to the sea, cast your line, and when you catch the first fish, open its mouth and you will find four dirhams inside. Take them and pay for both of us.''
