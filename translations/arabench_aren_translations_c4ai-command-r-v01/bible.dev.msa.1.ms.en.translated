The birth of Jesus Christ happened this way: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph. But before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.
And Yusuf was her husband, and he being of those who are as-Sâdiqîn, He intended to keep her secretly, but Allah intended every thing (that was to happen).
But as he considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit."
And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.
All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying:
Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel (which means, God with us).
When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him. He took his wife.
And she gave birth to her firstborn son; and she wrapped Him in cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
The Visit of the Magi
And Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod: and, lo, there came wise men from the east unto Jerusalem;
Saying: "Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East, and have come to worship Him."
When King Herod heard this, he was perturbed, and so was Jerusalem.
Then Caiaphas the high priest stood up among them, and asked them, "But where do you want the Christ to be born?"
And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,
And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.»
Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.”
When they heard the king's command, they set out, and lo, the star which they had seen in the east went before them until it came to rest over the place where the Child was.
When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
And they came to the house, and saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and fell down and worshipped Him. And opening their treasures, they presented to Him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Then having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed for their own country by another way. Flight to Egypt
And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.
So he arose, and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt.
And he was there until the death of Herod, that what was spoken of the Lord by the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, "Out of Egypt have I called my son."
Then, when Herod realized that he had been deceived by the Magi, he became furious. He ordered the execution of all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old or younger, corresponding to the age indicated by the Magi.
Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:
A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, she refused to be comforted because they are no more.</p> <p>Return to Nazareth.
When Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt.
Saying, Arise, take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.
And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee.
And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea.
Saying: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
For this is he of whom it is written: "A voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord; make His paths straight.' "
And this John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.
Then the people from Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan, came unto him,
And they were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.
When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Produce fruits meet for repentance.
And do not think to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you, God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
Now the axe is laid to the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water for repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
Who has his winnowing fork in his hand, and will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and gather his wheat into the barn; but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire." The Baptism of Jesus Christ.
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
But John prevented him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me!"
And Jesus answered him, "Let it be so now; for thus it is fitting that we should fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed him.
And when Jesus was baptized, immediately He went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to Him; and He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and alighting upon Him.
A voice came from Heaven, saying: "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
Jesus faces the temptation
Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
And after fasting forty days and forty nights, he was finally hungry.
And the tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
And he answered and said: "It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God."
Then the devil took him to the holy city, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple;
And he said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: on their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Jesus said to him, "It is also written, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'"
Then the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.
And he said unto him: All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
Then Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only'."
Then the devil left him. And behold, angels came and ministered to him. Beginning of his ministry in Galilee.
When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he left for Galilee.
And he departed from Nazareth, and came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,
The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.
The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them a light has shined.
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." The Calling of the First Disciples.
And as he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
Then He said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men."
For time left the windows and followed him.
Then He passed on from there, and saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And He called them.
And straightway the ship was at the land whither they went. And when they were come out of the ship, straightway there met them out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, Who, when he saw Jesus, fell down before him, and cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not. For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit. And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many. And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding. And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits, when they were come out, went into the swine: and, behold, the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (and were about two thousand;) and they perished in the waters. And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils. And, behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought that he would depart out of their coasts. And he, entering into the ship, returned back. And the man, out of whom the devils were departed, besought him that he might be with him: howbeit Jesus sent him away, saying, Return to thine house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.
And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity among the people.
His fame spread throughout Syria. They brought to him all who were ill and afflicted with various diseases and torments, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptic and paralysed; and he healed them.
And great multitudes followed Him from Galilee, and from the ten cities, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and from beyond Jordan.
<h1>The Sermon on the Mount - The Beatitudes</h1>
And when the crowds saw it, they went up on the mountain; and when Jesus was seated, His disciples came to Him.
Then he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven: for so they persecuted the prophets that were before you. Ye are the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its taste, with what can it be seasoned? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.
And they kindle not a light, and place it not in a vessel with cover, but they place the lamp upon a stand, that it may give light to all that are in the house.
Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. Fulfill the law.
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
For whoever keeps and teaches these, the least of the commandments, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and the Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Wrath.
"You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.' "
And I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.
So if you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,
So leave your gift there at the altar, and go and be reconciled to your brother. Then come and offer your gift.
Be quick to settle matters with your adversary while you are on the way to court; otherwise, your adversary will hand you over to the judge, and the judge will hand you over to the officer, and you will be thrown into prison.
Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt not depart hence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing! Fornication.
You have heard that it was said to the ancients, "You shall not murder".
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one part, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. Divorce.
And it is said: Whosoever divorces his wife, let him give her a writ of divorce.
But I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is put away doth commit adultery. Section.
You have also heard that it was said to those of old, "You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn."
But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:
But neither by the earth, for it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
Do not swear by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black.
But let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,' 'No.' For whatever is more than these is from the evil one. Revenge.
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
And I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat also.
Whoever walks with you a mile, walk with them two.
Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away the one who wants to borrow from you. Love your enemies.
You have heard that it was said: 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'
And I say unto you, Love your enemies. Bless them that curse you. Do good to them that hate you. Pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;
That you may be children of your Father in heaven, who causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?
And if you greet only your brothers, what do you do more? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.
Charity
Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.
When you give to the poor, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward!
But when you give to charity, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
That your alms may be in secret. Your Father who sees in secret will repay you in the open. Prayer.
And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward!
But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
When you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard because of their many words.
Do not be like them. Your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
"Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name."
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us.
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.
If you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will forgive you.
If you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Fasting.
And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so as to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.
But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
So that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. Treasures in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal;
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
The lamp of the body is the eye; if therefore your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light.
And if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money. God takes care of us.
Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
Behold the birds of the heaven: they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
And who of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his height?
And why do you worry about clothes? Look at the lilies of the field, how they grow! They neither toil nor spin.
But I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.
For if the grass in the field, which is today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, God clothes it; will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
Do not be anxious, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'
For these are the things the nations seek. Your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Condemning others
Judge not, lest ye be judged.
For with the judgment you pronounce, you will be judged, and the measure you give will be the measure you get.
And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log in your own?
How can you say to your brother: 'Let me remove the speck from your eye,' when you yourself have a wooden beam in it?
You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye!
Do not give what is holy to dogs, or toss your pearls before swine, lest they trample them underfoot, and turn and maul you. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.
Is there any among you who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
And if he asks for a fish, will he give him a live one?
For if you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you, for this is the law and the prophets. The narrow gate.
Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there are who go in by it.
Narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leadeth unto life: and few there be that find it! The Tree and its Fruit.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
You shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
Thus every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Then by their fruits ye shall know them.
Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in Heaven.
Many will say to Me on that day, 'Lord, Lord!' But I will say to them, 'Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness.'
Then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
And everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock.
And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.
And everyone who hears these words of mine, and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
And it rained, and the rivers came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, and it fell—and great was its fall!"
When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching,
For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
The healing of a leper
And when he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
And behold, a leper came and worshipped him, saying, "Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.".
And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.
And Jesus said unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. The centurion's faith.
And when Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, begging Him,
And he says: «My lord, my servant lies at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.»
And Jesus said unto him, I will come and heal him.
The centurion answered and said, "Lord, I am not worthy for You to come under my roof, but just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.»
When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
And I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
And the sons of the kingdom will be cast into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go; let it be done for you as you have believed." And the servant was healed at that very moment. The Healing of Peter's Mother-in-Law and Others
When Jesus came to Peter's house, He saw Peter's mother-in-law lying sick with a fever.
And when he had taken her by the hand, the fever left her, and she arose and ministered unto them.
And when the evening came, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, *He hath taken our infirmities, and bare our diseases*. The price of discipleship.
And when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave a commandment to pass over unto the other side.
And a scribe came and said to him, "Master, I will follow you wherever you go."
And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
And Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead. Calming the Storm.
And when he had entered into the ship, his disciples followed him.
And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves; and he was asleep.
So his disciples came and woke him up, saying, "Master, Master, we're going to drown!"
And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.
And the people were amazed, saying: "What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!" Cast out devils.
And when he came to the other side, into the country of the Gadarenes, two men met him who were possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.
And behold, they cried out, saying: "What have you to do with us, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"
And a great herd of swine was feeding not far from them.
So the demons begged him, "If you drive us out, let us go into the herd of pigs."
So he said to them, "Go." And they went out and drove the demons into the pigs; and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the waters.
And the shepherds fled, and went their way into the city, and told all things, and what was come to pass also of the infants which were found lying in the stall.
And the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged that He would depart from their region.
Healing of a paralytic
So he entered the boat and crossed over to his own city.
And behold, they brought to Him a man who was paralyzed and lay on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Son, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven you."
And some of the scribes said: "This man blasphemes!"
And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Why reason ye in your hearts?
Whichever is easier, to say: 'Your sins are forgiven', or to say: 'Rise and walk'?
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"—he said to the paralytic— "Rise, pick up your bed and go home."
And he got up and went to his house.
And when the crowds saw it, they were astonished, and glorified God, Who had given such power unto men. Matthew's Gospel
As Jesus passed by, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth. He said to him, "Follow me," and he rose and followed him.
And while he was at table in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came, and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard it, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.
Go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners." Question about fasting.
At that time the disciples of John came to him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast so often, but your disciples do not fast?"

While He was speaking these things to them, behold, a ruler came and bowed down before Him, saying, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live."
So Jesus arose and followed him, and so did his disciples.
And a woman who had been suffering from haemorrhaging for twelve years, came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His garment;
For she said to herself, "If I but touch his garment, I shall be made whole.".
And Jesus, turning about, and seeing her, said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.
And when Jesus came to the house of the ruler, and saw the minstrels and the people much disordered,
He said to them, "Step aside, for the girl is not dead, but sleeping." And they laughed at him.

And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly charged them, saying, "See that no one knows."
But they went out and spread his fame throughout all that land. Healing a mute.
And behold, as they went out, they brought to Him a man who was dumb and demon-possessed.
And when the devil had finished every temptation, he left him. And behold, angels came and ministered to him. And when the people saw him walking about in the temple, they were astonished, and said, "Behold, the man concerning whom the scribes said, 'He will not die.' "
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the prince of demons!" Few are those who are saved.
And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity.
And when the multitudes saw it, they were struck with fear, and glorified God, Who had given such power unto men.
Then He said to His disciples, "The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
So ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers for his harvest.»
Sending of the Twelve
Then He called His twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.
The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
Philip, Bartholomew. Thomas, Matthew the tax collector. James, son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus
Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot who betrayed him.
These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not.
But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
As you go, preach this message: "The kingdom of heaven has come near."
Heal the sick. Cleanse the lepers. Raise the dead. Cast out demons. You received without paying; give without pay.
Do not store up gold or silver or copper in your houses.
And neither staff nor scrip, nor shoes, nor even a change of clothes, for the worker is worthy of his food.
And whosoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who therein is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.
And when you enter the house, greet him.
If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.
And whoever will not receive you or hear your words, go out into the street and shake off the dust from your feet.
Verily I say unto you: the lot of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment shall be endured more tolerably than that of that city.
Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;
And you shall be brought before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them and the nations.
When they bring you to the mosque, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. For it will not be you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
And a brother will deliver up a brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death.
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
And when they shall put you out in this city, flee ye into another. For verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.
The disciple is not above the teacher, nor the servant above the master.
It is enough for the disciple to be as his teacher, and the servant as his master. If they have called the Lord of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household!
Fear them not: for nothing can be hid which shall not be revealed; neither any secret that shall not be known.
What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.
Do not fear those who kill the body, but are unable to kill the soul; rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.
And not a hair on your heads is left uncounted.
So don't be afraid! You are better than many sparrows!
For everyone who acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.
But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven.
Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.
For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
And a person's enemies are the members of their own household.
Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.
Whoever receives you receives Me, and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me.
Whoever accepts a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and whoever accepts a righteous person as such will receive the reward of one who is righteous.
And whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly I tell you, he will not lose his reward."
John the Baptist and not Jesus
When Jesus had finished giving instructions to His twelve disciples, He departed from there to teach and preach in their cities. Jesus and John the Baptist.
And when John heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,
And he said unto him, Art thou the Christ? or shall we look for another?
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:
The blind receive sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news preached to them.
And blessed is the one who does not fall away.
And when the two disciples heard it, they followed Jesus. And Jesus, turning and seeing them following, said unto them, What seek ye? And they said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou? He saith unto them, Come and see. It was about the tenth hour. They went therefore, and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour. One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ. And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone. The next day Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me. Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel. Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these. And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' houses.
But what went ye out to see? Prophets? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.
For this is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and the violent take it by force.
For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.
Let him who has ears to hear, hear.
Who is this generation like? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their friends,
And they say: We played for you, but you did not dance! We sang for you, but you did not weep!
For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say: He hath a devil.
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' Wisdom is justified by her deeds." Woe to the cities that refuse to repent.
Then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his mighty deeds had been performed, because they did not repent.
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
But I say unto you, that Tyre and Sidon shall be more tolerable in the day of judgment than ye.
And you, Capernaum raised up to heaven! You shall be brought down to Hades. For if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained to this day.
But I tell you that it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you." A rest for the weary.
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned, and revealed them to babes.
Yes, Father, for such has been Your good pleasure.
<html> <body> <p dir="RTL">كل شيء قد دفع إلي من أبي، وليس أحد يعرف الابن إلا الأب، ولا أحد يعرف الأب إلا الابن ومن أراد الابن أن يعلن له.</p> </body> </html>
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
"For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
Lord of the Sabbath
At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
The Pharisees, when they saw it, said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.
And he said unto them, Did ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and his men;
How did he enter the house of God and eat the bread of the Presence, which is lawful only for the priests to eat?
Have ye not read in the Torah that the Priests in the Temple profane the Sabbath, and yet are guiltless?
But I say unto you, There is here one greater than the temple!
If you but knew what I know: I crave not a sacrifice, but mercy! You would not have condemned the innocent!
For the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.
Then he left and came to their synagogue.
And if a man has his hand shrivelled, they will ask him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day?" so that they may accuse him.
So He said to them, "Which one of you, having a sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?
And man, how superior he is to the sheep! For it is praiseworthy to do good deeds at all times!
Then He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and it was restored as whole as the other. The Believer in God's Power.
When the Pharisees left, they plotted together to kill him.
And Jesus, knowing it, withdrew Himself; and many, following Him, He healed them all.
And he recommended to them that they should not make him known;
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,
Behold my Servant, whom I have chosen, my Beloved, in whom my soul delighteth: I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall shew the Gentiles the truth.
He neither quarrels nor cries out, Nor is his voice heard in the streets.
A bruised reed He will not break, and a dimly burning wick He will not quench, Until He brings justice to victory.
And on His name shall the Gentiles hope." Jesus and Beelzebul.
Then a man who was both blind and mute was brought to him. Jesus healed him, so that the mute man spoke and saw.
And the whole multitude was amazed, and said: "Is this the Son of David?"
But the Pharisees, hearing it, said, "It is by the prince of demons that he casts out the demons."
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:
If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then shall his kingdom stand?
And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore shall they be your judges!
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the Kingdom of God has come upon you!
For how can someone enter a strong man's house and rob his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will rob his house.
For he that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.
For this reason I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven; neither in this world, nor in the world to come.
Make the tree good, and its fruit will be good. Or make the tree bad, and its fruit will be bad; for a tree is known by its fruit.
O you children of snakes! How can you speak good things, being evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart.
But I tell you that every careless word that people speak, they shall give an account for it in the day of judgment.
"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned." Jonah's verse
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from You."
And he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.
For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And behold, something greater than Jonah is here!
The Queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here!
When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he walks through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.
Then he says, 'Return to the house from which you came forth,' and it returns to a house vacant, swept, and garnished.
Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they go in and dwell there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So shall it be also with this wicked generation.**.</p>
While he was speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, asking to speak with him.
And someone said to Him, "Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak with You."
And he answered and said to him that told him: Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?
Then He stretched out His hand toward His disciples and said, "Behold My mother and My brothers!
For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.
Like the Sower and its interpretation
On that day Jesus went out of the house and sat down by the sea.
So a great multitude came together unto him, that he entered into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
He spoke to them in parables: "A sower went out to sow.
And as he sowed, some fell along the path; and the birds came and devoured it.
And the last fell on the stony places, where it had not much earth: and forthwith it sprang up, because it had no deepness of earth:
But when the sun came up, it was scorched, and because it had no root, it withered away.
And some fell on thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked it.
And the one fallen on good ground, these are the ones who, hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and bearing fruit, endure.
Let anyone who has ears to hear, hear.
So the disciples came to him and asked, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
And he answered and said unto them, Unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:
For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he seemeth to have.
For this reason I speak to them in parables: though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand.
For in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says: 'You will indeed hear but never understand, and seeing you will see but never perceive.'
For the heart of this people has grown dull, and their ears are hard of hearing; they have closed their eyes, so as not to see with their eyes, or hear with their ears, or understand with their heart, and be converted, and I would heal them.
But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
Verily I say unto you, Many prophets and righteous men have desired to see what ye see, and have not seen it; and to hear what ye hear, and have not heard it.
So listen, everyone gathered here, to what's like the story of a sower.
Whosoever heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, the wicked one cometh, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.
And that which is planted in the stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;
But he has no root in himself, and endures only for a while. When tribulation or persecution arises because of the Word, immediately he stumbles.
The one sown among thorns is he who hears the word, but the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
But the one sown on good ground is the man who hears and understands the word, and finally bears fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</b>.</i>
He gave them another parable, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
And while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat, and went his way.
And when the grain began to grow and bear fruit, then appeared also the weeds.
Then the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, "Master, didn't you sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?"
And he said unto them, A foe hath done this. And the servants said unto him, Wilt thou that we go and gather him up?
He said: "No, lest in gathering the darnel you should also uproot the wheat."
Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. **The parable of the mustard seed and the leaven.**
He gave them another parable, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field;
She is the smallest of all the seeds, but when she has grown she is the largest of the shrubs; and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the sky come and nestle in her branches."
He told them another parable: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large batch of flour until it worked its way through the dough."
All this Jesus spoke in parables to the crowds, and without a parable He did not speak to them,
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, *I will open my mouth in parables, and I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world*. The Parable of the Wheat and the Tares.
Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
And he answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man.
And the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one.
The enemy that he has planted is Satan. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels.
As the tares are gathered and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
And the Son of Man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all scandals and them that work iniquity;
And they will cast them into the furnace of fire. There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. The parable of the treasure and the pearl, and that of the dragnet.
Also, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and from joy over it he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.
Also, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls,
And when he found it, he went and sold everything he had, and bought it.
The kingdom of heaven is also like a net thrown into the sea, gathering fish of every kind.
When it was filled, they drew it ashore, and sitting down, they sorted the good fish into baskets, and the bad they cast away.
Thus it will be at the end of the world: the angels will come forth and separate the evil from the righteous.
And they will cast them into the furnace of fire. There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all these things?" They answered, "Yes, Lord."
He told them, "That is why every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old."
And when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.
And when He came to His own country, He taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said: "Where did this Man get this wisdom and these mighty works?
Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
Are not all his sisters with us? From where then has this one gotten all this?"
And they were taking offence at him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honour, except in his own country and in his own house."
And few forces were raised there for their lack of faith.
Beheading of John the Baptist
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report about Jesus,
So he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why these powers are at work in him."
For Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
For John said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
And when he would have killed him, he feared the people, for they held him as a prophet.
Then Herodias' daughter danced in the middle, and pleased Herod.
Then he vowed, by the most sacred of oaths, to grant her any wish she desired.
She had learned it from her mother, and said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist."
The king was grieved, but for the sake of the guests who had been invited, he ordered that the feast should be served.
So he sent and had John beheaded in prison.
And he brought his head on a platter and gave it to the maidens, and the maidens brought it to their mother.
Then his disciples came and took away the body and buried him. And they went and told Jesus. The Feeding of the Five Thousand.
When Jesus heard, He withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by Himself. But when the multitudes heard it, they followed Him on foot from the cities.
And when Jesus went out, He saw a great multitude; and He was moved with compassion toward them, and healed their sick.
When evening came, his disciples approached him and said, "This is a deserted place, and the hour is now very late. Send the crowds away so that they may go into the surrounding villages and buy food for themselves."
And Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.
They said to him: «We have here only five loaves and two fishes.»
So he said: "Bring her to me here."
And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass. And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.
And the eaters were about five thousand men, besides women and children. The Miracle of the Walk on Water.
And Jesus constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
And when the crowd was dismissed, he went up onto the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
And the ship was in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.
And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.
When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, "It is a ghost!" And they cried out for fear.
Then Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid."
Peter replied, "Lord, if it's really you, tell me to come to you on the water."
And He said, "Come." And Peter got out of the boat, and walked on the water to come to Jesus.
But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid. And beginning to sink, he cried, saying, “Lord, save me!”
Immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him, and said to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
And the wind ceased when they were in the ship.
And those who were in the boat worshipped Him, saying: "Truly You are the Son of God!"
And when they had crossed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.
So the men of that city recognized him, and they sent into all that district and brought to him all who were sick,
And they asked him that they might only touch the hem of his garment. And as many as touched were made perfectly whole.
The Pure and the Impure
Then came unto Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying;
"Why do your students exceed the traditions of the elders, for they do not wash their hands when eating bread?"
And he answered and told them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?
For God said, Honour thy father and thy mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.
But you say, 'Whoever tells his father or mother, "Whatever benefit you might have received from me is Corban" ' — that is, a gift devoted to God — 'has no need to honor his father or mother.'
You have nullified the word of God through your tradition!
O hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied well about you, saying:
This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.
"And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men."
Then He called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:
It is not what enters the mouth that makes a person unclean, but what comes out of the mouth—this makes a person unclean."
At that time his disciples came unto him, and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?"
And he answered and said: Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.
Let them be. They are blind men leading blind men. And if a blind man leads a blind man, they both fall into a pit.»
Peter said to him, "Explain this parable to us."
And Jesus said: "Do you not understand even now?"
Do you not yet understand that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and is expelled into the latrine?
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these defile the man.
For out of the heart come evil thoughts: murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander.
These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands doth not defile the man." The faith of the Canaanite woman.
Then Jesus departed from there and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
And a Canaanite woman from that region came out and started shouting, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is tormented severely by a demon."
He didn't say a word in reply. His disciples came and asked him, "Send her away; see how loudly she's wailing!"
And he said: I am sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Then she came and worshipped Him, saying, "Lord, help me!"
And he said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.
She said: "Yes, my lord! And the dogs also eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table!".
Then Jesus answered her, "Woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you desire." And her daughter was healed instantly. The Feeding of the Four Thousand.
Then Jesus departed thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down.
So a great multitude came to Him, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they laid them down at Jesus' feet; and He healed them.
So that the crowds were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.
And Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have now been with me for three days, and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."
His disciples asked him, "Where can we get enough bread in this desolate place to feed such a crowd?"
And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.
And he ordered the multitude to sit down on the grass.
And the seven loaves and the fish he took, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitude.
And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.
And the eaters were four thousand men, besides women and children.
Then he dismissed the crowds and got into the boat; and they went to the other side toward Magadan.
Ayatul Qurbani
The Pharisees and the Sadducees came to him to test him, and asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
And he answered them, "When it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather; for the sky is red.'
In the morning: today it's winter, for the sky is red and lowering. O hypocrites! Ye know how to discern the face of the sky; but the signs of the times ye cannot read!
An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet." Then he left them and departed. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
When his disciples came to the other side, they had forgotten to bring bread.
And Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
So they said to each other, "We have no bread."
And Jesus said unto them, Why take ye thought for things pertaining to the flesh? having no leaven.
Do you still not understand? And do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
And of the seven loaves, how many baskets full of fragments did you take up?
How is it that you fail to understand that it is not about bread that I said to beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees?
Then they understood that He did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter's Confession of Christ.
When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, "Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?"
They answered, "Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
He asked them, "But who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!"
And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.
And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
And I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Then He charged the disciples that they should tell no one that He was Jesus the Christ. Jesus foretells His death and resurrection.
From that time Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day.
But Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, "Never, Lord! This shall never happen to you!"
Then he turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things."
Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me."
For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.
For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
Then the Son of Man will come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward everyone according to their deeds.
Verily I say unto you, That there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
The Manifestation
And after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain apart.
And his appearance changed before them, and his face shone as the sun, and his garments became white as snow.
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here! Let us make three tabernacles: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And as he spoke, a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, saying: "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him."
When the disciples heard this, they fell down flat on their faces, filled with fear.
So Jesus came and touched them, and said, "Arise, and do not be afraid."
And they lifted up their eyes, and saw no man, save Jesus only.
And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, "Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is risen from the dead."
His disciples asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.
But I say unto you, Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. So also shall the Son of man suffer of them.
Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them of John the Baptist. Healing the demon-possessed boy.
And when they came to the multitude, a man came to Him, kneeling down to Him, and saying,
Saying: "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and suffers severely; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water."
And when they had brought him to Your disciples, they could not cure him."
And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? Bring him hither to me.
And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was cured from that very hour.
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, "Why could we not drive it out?"
And Jesus said to them, *Because of your unbelief. For verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.*
But this kind is only cast out by prayer and fasting.
And as they stayed in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men."
So they killed him, and on the third day he rose again." They were very sad. Temple Tax.
When they arrived at Capernaum, those who collected the temple tax came to Peter and asked, "Does your teacher pay the half-shekel tax?"
He said, "Yes." When Jesus entered the house, He preempted him, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do earthly kings collect customs or poll tax—from their own sons or from strangers?"
Peter said, "To the Gentiles." Jesus answered, "Then the children are free."
But lest we should offend them, go to the sea and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give for me and thee.
