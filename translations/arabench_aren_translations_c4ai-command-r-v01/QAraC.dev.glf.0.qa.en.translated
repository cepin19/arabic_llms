I'm saying the words you don't want to understand, Saleh.
Any problems? Look inside, open your mind, see the world around you, see what the world is doing.
If my brother is my uncle, then
And he who does not wish to develop himself and those around him.
Oh Saleh, don't be stubborn!
No, no, no, no, it's not my problem.
She walks down the road.
And so it passes, two plucked dates.
And you're dead to me.
Will you eat or not?
No eating.
He agreed.
This is my mother's place of residence.
I wanted him.
This is our chance! Our old cars and their models are embarrassing.
Try it, give it a shot. After a while, it'll be fine.
These are ordinary and well-known matters.
The bull is the only one who has no personality.
Yes, by Allah, I am afraid.
It's you who's getting on my nerves, Mom.
The budget is at his disposal.
What is this project he's working on?
Akbar's Government Project
Underneath and what became apparent.
I have the right to take.
You're in a ministry, and he's in another.
O mother, have you forgotten?
A day in the garage
That means: I am.
I consider myself a contributor with them.
Can't become nothing if the project doesn't show up. Oh well.
And I have nothing to do with it.
That means I'm also contributing.
Supposedly we're all supposed to take.
This government's project
He does understand your son, that bull.
I understand him.
Good luck, kick it away!
This is a government project.
This is your chance.
It doesn't fit like your jellied oil.
The Chinese are really good to you.
Take your bite and shove it down your throat.
Ariel was in his hiding place.
I myself have heard it with my own ears
They say the government's projects are well-known.
One third of it is suction.
His son, Saloum.
Going to Souq Waqif
One palm tree: 18 arials.
They put it in the budget.
And eighty ariels, each one a shekel.
They said we didn't do anything.
Do you want to go with him?
I seek refuge in God from Satan.
I feel like his head is starting to hurt a little.
Inshallah my dear.
Ahuh is the head of the committee and everything is under his control.
The most important thing is don't forget about us.
Our quarter is where we're at.
And we must be together.
This government's project is an opportunity.
Of course, Ali.
And we can't do without you
No recommendations needed, Ali.
Inshallah everyone who will be part of the project's crew.
This is a certainty.
Last night me and the guys were chatting.
We are from your side, you
The preachers are confident in the project committee.
Afraid of Saleh, the head of the committee
They say that
I bring you good tidings, O Ali.
And reassure the gang.
That's true, Abu Faha.
May Allah reward you with goodness. But you didn't tell me.
Then don't forget, O Sa'oot.
No no
Inshallah everything goes smoothly.
Let him agree, this rascal Saleh.
It's all yours.
My mother brought me up well.
It can happen, it's possible.
As long as you're with us in the department, that means you're contributing to the project.
But the most important thing is that it's between us.
Just cooked some rice and meat in front of you
I have to eat.
Honey and health.
There's something about you.
If every now and then you keep zoning out like this
We don't pay.
In this case, we'll never finish.
Or any inquiries, just ask.
We support and help each other.
How can we claim our share?
A reasonable child.
Written on it
Then it's not just us who will take.
Each contributor to the project demands their due.
Why not?
Don't be scared, Saleh.
We set the budget.
The land plots he bought today and registered in his name.
Met her after.
He tells her he won't buy it.
Where are you getting this talk from?
Connected to me today.
Tell your brother to call me.
Tell him the best.
Tell your brother ASAP!
See the second earth
The shoes I bought him yesterday.
They agreed to sell it.
Tell him to call, and if he wants it, I'll register it under his name.
He wants to buy it with his own money.
And our right.
And we consider ourselves contributors with him.
Even if we're not contributing
The biggest lump goes down your throat in one go.
Never subtract from the right of your brother and the right of your mother with you.
I didn't come to brag about you
We are also contributors to the project and we have the right to demand our rights.
Tell her, tell her.
Oh, it's true. Sultan refused yesterday when I asked him.
But I didn't let him.
And you're mistaken if you don't set aside an amount for their project.
First stage
You're no less than others.
Members of the Committee who are present
I hear him talking to them on the phone
We're letting in our brothers and friends
I know this is the government's project.
We don't want a lump sum.
Miras Al Mal
Yes, my brother Sultan can join us for the meetings.
Because the members of the committee
Project budget
Just what is required.
You've done your best.
Oh Allah, may He protect you. Amen.
Your brother-in-law.
Do you like it?
They serve us on the project.
Let's remember some.
We fairly distributed the tasks.
It's you, Saleh.
And I've got the limestone, bricks and concrete on my side.
And the rest of the things are electricity and water, leave them to me.
Hello everyone
Claim your share.
And I swear by Allah.
Sometimes I say I'll take a lump sum.
And I say
Let it be a ratio.
It's all right, Saleh, it's all right.
Take whatever you want, the way you want it.
The most important thing
Hey, we too.
This week's icon
Each one decides the amount in their heart.
For example,
After two days, he felt the same.
He wants another 1000 more.
Why come back, I ask.
And what's your opinion on the matter?
I'm with you
Even after the shareholders,
Jablou nahbkum shaglkum ma 3likum
Do you have halal orphans?
O O O O O O O Increase the budget! Make it bigger!
May God bless you with abundant fortune!
He entered this place.
What's this? This is my dad's project.
O Sultan!
O Sultan, my brother!
That still makes him a contributor, doesn't it?
This is the last name
Your friend Saud put how many names?
Is it Ismāʿīl? He says it'll benefit them.
Should I put it in the group of ratios or the fixed amount?
Don't put it with the trash.
How many are you putting in? Put in twenty thousand.
I bus
Even here they wrote a note.
It's one of the kids from our neighbourhood.
That's Saud's list, it's longer than Abdulaziz's.
They are all included in the first phase budget.
Jackie like this, it's not bad luck.
A baggy baggy the list that mom sent me
The one who every two hours calls and adds people at their convenience
May Allah prolong her life, but haha haha.
My dear son
And if you let her go, she's sick, poor and pitiful.
The woman is back, she has nothing.
Oooh, Allah, guide You; I have time, but this is the last one.
Tell him his farming pulled a muscle.
These moments 're enough to suffocate me.
All I need is a place to live, a hospital and a job.
80,000 Ariary
You are the apple of my eye.
Only he makes you expensive.
O Allah, guide him, he put her name on the list.
Hussainiya Hussainiya Bint Hilal
Why are you giving it to her out of your own pocket?
Reassure him and tell him that from the second stage, nothing is left.
80,000
Oh my dear, they will install her a new heart.
Tell him, tell him to increase it by two thousand. After that, I'll buy gifts for the girls.
I'll tell you two thousand.
My many antennas are for me.
O Husayniyyah, daughter of Ahlal
I can ruin you in front of your friends
Oh, my God!
I have a lot of work.
I'll talk to you later.
Thus, they increased the number of those who eat from the platter.
The infrastructure withstands.
Don't forget me again.
Write the number you want
My mother is back.
You and your conscience.
I am the Chairman of the Board.
And I say you deserve the million.
They decide tomorrow the project will commence.
Inshallah we will soon receive the first ball of yarn.
We want to know how much.
At once or in installments.
Why her, of all people? She's more conceited than any of us.
In a moment of suction, please keep quiet. The committee is now waiting for them to arrive.
Oh God, He said, "Oh God, oh God." He told you to be quiet, so be quiet.
Truly, you have no shame nor do you imagine.
If I hear one voice
To cut off his tongue, cut it off
Yeah, they're taking their time.
Do you know that this is also real money, not just like that?
It was beautiful.</>
Fifty million
My jink is a little bit of gel
In the end, you're the boss.
We don't want any trouble.
We adopt the budget.
As you described the project, Professor Saleh, I perceive it to be a vital and important venture.
And may God protect you, not just for this generation, but for many more to come.
Yes Yes
Tomorrow is the inauguration of the first stage of the project.
We would like to thank you for your presence and congratulate you.
I welcome
On this occasion
United Nations
Where is our project? We want our project!
Where do you think we are?
I have no idea where we are.
It's not his day.
Anti-Maglev officials spoke and the crowd applauded.
We are at the official opening. What's up with you?
That means you're in the project now.
We're in the project.
And the Nasar people are very foolish.
And this box, I have no idea why they put it here.
It's not my job to work in the toolbox.
This box's infrastructure, God bless you.
The official opening of the World Beaches
Shufiij for the third millennium
Wallahi ma adri ech qalati
Indeed, all praise be to Allah, pride comes before a fall.
John knows why they removed me.
Just let him park his car.
Haliey, I'm baffled.
But when she told me
No one brought me anything.
I saw her with my own eyes, and she had a huge farm.
Thank God you're comfortable.
And you're chilling in your house.
Why the cruelty, father? Don't let anyone play with your mind, Oh sheikhah Munira!
Thank your lucky stars, Munira, that you have brothers like Rashid, Saad and Saqr.
They're afraid for your share and invest it for you
I've got two tickets for the show.
Her brothers don't give her the Arial that her father's share entails.
We are not familiar with such matters.
This is our legitimate right.
This is a matter of trust. You don't trust us.
I don't know how.
I didn't like what my brother Rashid said.
He goes and returns with this pay I get every three months.
This is my gasoline.
Everyone keeps telling me
You don't trust us.
The talk of inheritance and money must be clear.
And ever since you became a dad, you've been uncomfortable.
You know what you're doing to people.
And this is from Salama, the poor thing.
Who would believe she's an heiress to millions?
Among her siblings
Money ruins the world
Surely, the truth is the truth, and this is the Law of Allah.
And then what?
We are establishing the company.
We invest in lands, real estates and monies.
No problems, no headaches.
She says she was walking towards the ground.
It's way too much for her.
To be the nail in the coffin.
Any story.
Your sister has started digging.
This is the story.
This one is planning to make a scene.
<b>Zen ma naa neh oteehah aaflos</b>
You are a gifted falcon.
We need to find a solution, Rashid.
It's all in my head.
What's this?
My share of my father's inheritance
Those who give me charity every three months
Everything is known.
Forty thousand never change.
Why don't they invest with real money?
Hollow hollow hollow hollow
Why him and not others?
It's obvious.
They said to increase it so she'd be happy and keep quiet.
Edit all your talk, edit it.
They're giving it to me drop by drop.
If I saw their womenfolk
The Almalath comes in various shapes and colors.
And it's forbidden for me to live even half their lives.
They are begrudging me my father's halal earnings!
Did you mean: إِنْ حَدَّثْتُكِ
This is your right.
By religion and by law
I feel like they're ripping me off and lying to me
I'm not comfortable with their method anymore.
Oh God, who knows what might happen in this world.
They tortured me, they made me sick, oh my mom.
They do not know that there is accounting and punishment.
And Allah will surely reward them for eating up the unlawful wealth.
And endure, O my mother, if you bring up the topic of courts
They sure do multiply, by God!
From our abundance or from our numerous population
That's why I'm telling you, Mom.
Huda Ishoih
Each one has a building that could be called a sky scraper.
All I want is my right.
I want my son to build me a mosque before I die
I want to give charity to these poor people.
Oh my son, may you be safe.
Put the saddle in your saddle bag, Mom.
And do not inform them about the course of the trials.
And it's not invalid.
Do you know why?
In these times
McCool has every right.
Yay asks the accountant.
You're the one who asks the accountant.
Reply to them.
I am not not I am means God bless you all I mean I came here for you guys
The door I entered from
Don't disgrace your face.
Open the door that fell apart.
No no
Yes, Falcon.
Saad Haram
Don't make a fuss, Munir.
Your share in the company and real estate is fine with us.
Six hundred
She has always been quiet.
Sure, this is her sleek train.
And your sister is kind.
The jinn are sitting around me.
A known and specified legal share
She tells you to take 60,000 or go to hell.
It is not right of them.
Expect anything, Munira.
Aboy Company
Eight buildings
Real estate and homes
He says he'll give me 100,000
What do you expect to give up?
No, Munira.
They keep cutting you off and you expect me to give in? I told you I won't.
You have the right, Mom, to know everything about the lands and the money. It's not up to them.
Only the company.
You're their partner.
Right now they're chasing you out of the company.
I tell you, no one can stop me.
Look at what he said.
Your father's company
You can't see it.
I'll tell you, let me log in.
There's no need.
His mother's name is Shenahi.
Yeah, he's extending his tongue out at us. We'll cut his tongue out.
We apologize.
My brothers Saad and Saqr will enter my office. I will explain the situation to them, as they don't know what's going on.
Come in, please.
See what brother Nasser is drinking.
May Allah bless you.
mā ghayru t t t t t
You make a story for us.
Discovers a gem to her collection.
Discovers she has four hundred thousand lovers, not forty.
Oh Allah, calculate it with me.
Ninety-six months.
And this story strikes me as a three sixty.
Eleven million five hundred and twenty thousand
It's all good, my friend.
He's banging his head against the float.
I'd thank him, I'd tell him.
These are our dirhams.
All the youth look like this who inherited.
Hello, all is forgiven. The company is your company, and only good things have resulted.
We're here.
This accountant is Samir.
<b>Get anything brother Nasser wishes for</b>
The whole company is at your command.
Feel free to take a shower and make yourself at home. Don't hesitate to ask for anything.
No harm done to you.
It's all yours.
Phone booth
And roll over all the files.
It's supposed to have over ten million.
It does not make her pee herself.
She says she's innocent.
Her father has left.
Four buildings
I thought they had three plots of land.
All the earth is greater than second.
In God we trust, father.
It's haram what they're doing.
I do not accuse them.
I've done all I can, Uncle Salman.
My only recourse is to sue them in court.
I'll delete these two annoying pages.
The case has been adjourned.
Endure, Dad, oh Nasser
It brings up the topic of the court.
Oh, you're so truthful! You've left your bed, and the doctor is looking for you.
Rise up, O people of Salama!
Come on, my soul, let's fetch your stone.
He heals the diseases of the believers.
He didn't tell me.
Excuse me, who?
Ooh, I remember you, I knew you, I knew you!
Yes Yes Yes Yes
Regarding what, brother?
Don't you worry, cheers!
He's killing himself right now , he knows about the millions .
Hopefully, this Abdullah they sent will be able to do it.
That's Rashid's best friend.
He's known him well for years.
Do you believe it, Munira?
Even Abdullah advised me not to.
Chase after them!
Beware of them, and them beware!
Try to take as much as you can from them
Do you know Abdullah Shiquli?
It's not people's malt that they live up to seventy or eighty years.
Our courts have leaned in favour of people living for at least two hundred years.
May Allah have mercy on her soul.
May God have mercy on her soul.
Our population has reached 400,000.
The issue will take ten years or more.
They have to arrest us so that we can go to court
This is it.
It's a boy!
May Allah help you.
Hello, my old friend from our school days.
This world is worthless.
And I'm coming with you for the best.
And you, Mashallah, you come from a famous and large family.
And the real deal.
Ava ya Rashid, we're quarters.
Do it willingly.
Don't you dare say a word, or else!
Oh come on, no more of this nonsense.
Are you doing it or how is it now?
She bought a set from the jewelry exhibition for ninety thousand.
Where did she get it from?
They spoil their wives with money.
And depriving their sister of her lawful right
Do you still have hope, Nasser?
You and them argued with you.
Yesterday when I talked to him in the mosque.
Let me as I told you.
Arab kids and famous ones at that!
Why not?
But after I say
O Allah, make this gathering blessed with these radiant faces.
O Allah, grant us understanding of the Qur'an, and make it a means of guidance and light for us in this life and the Hereafter.
Hear you
Do you have another topic besides the inheritance issue of my sister?
He scolded her.
Go, oh LaLa, don't get upset.
It's nothing to me.
And I have been begging and pleading with you for months, but you remain stubborn.
No, it's fine, don't worry about it.
Tomorrow morning I'm going to court.
Hollow Hollow
Hello Hello
Don't pay any attention to her.
I'm going to court tomorrow.
The day after tomorrow the day after tomorrow
To give you a chance to see what you're doing.
Goodbye.
You only get what you take by force.
And their reputation was harmed.
Let's see what they decide.
I'll be happy tomorrow.
We will see each other in court.
Tell her to postpone it until tomorrow and we'll go together.
This is what.
May Allah sanctify your tongue.
I was told why.
You want to go to court and sue us?
So that you can get your share of the inheritance.
She said.
Your world has become sweet.
Your world has been distinguished.
Why did I tell you after the day after tomorrow?
As soon as you leave, head for the courthouse. Park your car in the parking lot.

This is today's **Al Rayah** newspaper.
Here's a great article!
Only the writer, apparently a Dr.
I'll give you a hint.
Let him get out of the situation he's in.
It's haram by God.
He has four kids and owns a real house.
It's understandable; he puts those around and beneath him first.
A poor adventurer in this project.
The person I never expected to do business with is Bo Waleed.
Eat, eat, the new trader's kids, Bu Waleed.
My love, would you like me to get you something?

Go on, get up, get moving. Grab some fruits, lots of fruits.

Congratulations! The project is worth it, Abu Walid. Well done!
Arrangers of the quarter excellent accountant
Thank you, Dad.
Dad, we've become big shot merchants. I want you to build me a room of my own.
Joe Shataleb has no entrepreneurial ambitions.
Inshallah, I will get you a BlackBerry Bold.
Let's forget about your requests.
Our condition is the same as other people.
Instead of this dump we're living in
Let's pay off the debts first, then everything will be fine.
Oh, it's evident you're very delighted, Abu Waleed.
He now eats more than before.
A trader of his caliber.
My father the merchant lives.
The project's blessings.
Give the guys their due.
My Lord is He who will give you safety.
I met one of them Japanese.
My God is on the table, and I gave him my place. He gave me a catalogue as a gift.

He didn't tell me until it was too late.

It's always like this.
These halls are full of computers.
Tap him on the cinema.
I want a sports stadium
This is magic.
They were amazed and readily agreed.
I borrowed a little from the bank, some from my wife's family and a bit from myself. I also sold a plot of land that I owned. Thank God.
You are Madam Chair, now that the committee has approved.
Jean placed the order with the factory now that the Ministry has approved it.
Throughout the email factory.
Leen is calling you.
It's za'atar
There's nothing, God knows. I'm sitting in my office waiting.
The secretary has contacted me, my friend.
And ten travellers.
It's all up to you.
My application has been processed.
The committee has approved it.
Why are you not what I'd expect, what's going on?
I'm not a manager, you're the boss!
Why don't you go to him so he can sign it and we can finish this.
It's not in his hand to do anything.
Not all employees are like this.
Each one is a mercenary in his own keffiyeh, like you're saying "a sail in the wind".
Thank God
And I was really worried about them, I tell you.
inshallah finished
This Bu Fahad, no one knows when he's coming or going. He does as he pleases.
Chasu yi khui.
Afterwards Atrooh got the money.
I really need to quickly finish the transaction, I have no idea what to do.
Oh my, I'm scared the manager might inquire about you.
He says he's sick, he says anything.
Even I am waiting for Bu Fahd.
Okay then, if you're the secretary, what's the solution?
Give me your number
It's not the secretary, no, no, don't go, it's not the secretary, what's wrong with you?
Don't call , you're scaring the group . They're thinking it's the secretary .
We're still waiting for Abu Fares.
Daddy's girl, I'm tipsy, let's pray.
These are full-time. This one too.

The working week starts next week at the university.
And if I don't register with them or they don't accept me, I'll just have to wait for the next semester.
Dad, it's been three months, I can't waste them.
Hey, empty-headed Booj, I'm doing my best.
Here I go, returning them. Here I go, returning them.

And I'm sitting at home.
Dude, you don't understand!
Connect only at lunchtime
Hi, this is the fourth time you're calling me.
Why don't you understand?
I know you need the money
But Inshallah, this week Bin Fahad will sign the transaction.
They shall pay him the first instalment.
I really don't know what to tell you, sis.
He woke up suddenly.
And he walked through the night, talking to himself.
And if Bu Fahd falls.
God willing.
That's why.
This week Fahad has to sign the transaction.
Abu Fahaad, this is the paper that needs a signature.
Dad, keep going for one more day.
He travels a year.
And one who abandons people's interests.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah how?
Now is good.

Give me the phone. Give the phone.
With you is the secretary, Bo Faisal.
I wanted to tell you that I love you.
I'll definitely go visit Fahaad tomorrow, God willing.
As soon as it's available to you.
Bring it on!

My brother, you've never been like this before

At least so you can feel it.
And if it becomes moderate.
I bring you back to your oath.

Fifteen boxes of printing paper
Breaking my heart, by God!
The manager is rewarded.
He brought him with him.
I heard about the factory you're at.
He will lose a large amount if his transaction is not completed and signed today.
If the director goes and leaves.
<b>Behold, O mankind</b>!
And if the manager asks about him
Don't worry, we'll take care of it. Let him go, it's a pity.
Uncle Walid
I'm leaving, but I'll wait for a call, God willing.
O mankind!
God help him.
Hold on a second, guys. Hold on a second, guys. Hold on a second, guys.
And I don't know why the guy from the office is taking some stuff and leaving.
Look at Bu Fahd
No one move!
Do not sit.
Wait for Bu Faisal.

You really didn't hold back, Abdul Aziz.
You really didn't hold back, Abdul Aziz.
It is it.
We did our part.
They will also continue the march.

After this long life and exhaustion
It all means running in running.
You need to rest, Abu Sa'id.
After he left your place over here, my wife invited me out.
On the occasion of the retirement
Please have a coffee and a sweet treat, my friend.
He's finally letting me go, Dad.
It looks like you're eager for the khunfروش, oh father of Saeed.
Don't you worry!
The khunfarooosh is ready.
Yay yay Inshallah, from my eyes. Goodbye.
O woe is me, the Khanfroush is ready and waiting!
I will finish all the paperwork for you now, God willing.
Your chance you'd better grab it today
He told me their manager is traveling.
And why was I created?
Even moving around is a chore.
Zeen sent no one.
Thus, you are now officially free.
May Allah bless you.
Now it's finally time for some rest.
You did your best, Abu Abdulaziz. Goodbye.
My book is finally done!
There is no job.
Does that mean you're not engaged, Dad?
For your sake, I'll do it.
Human Resources
Thank you, thank you. Goodbye.
My daughter threw a party to celebrate her son's success.
He brought me cake.
My boat, I can't.
I have a transaction and I want my father to do it for me.
Zahrat Abتزعل
Tired, Mom.
My dad quit his job.
May Allah be with him. Indeed, now.
He has worked a lot; let him rest now.
Let him rest.
He told me to make him a khnifroush.
I did it and prepared it.
The text translates to: It has been signed.
Fear Allah in this old man. Have mercy on him. Have mercy on his old age.
Now it's your turn.
Tomorrow it will be eaten.
The poor guy wants to rest.
You've humiliated this old man!
This is it when he comes back
Tired.
Do not ask me about them.
Don't make me dance to their tune.
I was planning to take the bank transaction with me to work.
And he is threatened. Woe to him who's late!
Of course, my dear sister.
Your job is to trust me.
I'm so angry because of her and those small, beady eyes of hers. Goodbye.
Bō Saʿīd
This is it, every day we're sending you somewhere.
May good fortune smile upon you, Ya Sa'eed!
It's haram, oh its scent!
Up my nose
Khanafirush khanaf
Main Ashdak
No, I'm at the branch next to the market.
And its spirit.
I won't go to the branch in the market anymore. They say it's not there anymore, I'm sure of it.
Inshallah Ya Allah with peace
I have a sunburn.
The sun shines bright.
I entered my neighbour's house.
The maid recognized me.
She asked me, "What's wrong with you?"
May Allah guide you.
La la la, I'm not in the mood for your nonsense, O Saeed!
Mom, where's Dad now?
From Al-Luwayh
This is also not what any bank would tell you.
They said his papers were incomplete.
Tell him to take a taxi.
Mom, we had a meeting with the director.
The important thing now is how my father is doing. Hopefully, he's doing okay.
My head slightly aches.
Here I am telling you in front of him
Let your dad rest.
Poor old Saeed.
They must adhere to the attendance policy. Following these reports, documents will be drawn up detailing their actions.
Hi, how are you?
O father of Shahin
You could say I retired, but I didn't retire.
How do you mean?
Those years are long gone.
It is written that we shall suffer.
Your children are real men.
We are obliged to help them.
And the poor souls tell me
You don't know what you're talking about.
Now, the young men who don't have fathers can't finish their transactions.
His job returned as his job differed.
In this job, it lets you clock out.
May Allah reward you with goodness.
Oh, I thought you were just the coffee guy!
Where is my father, Saeed?
In the spirit of consummating the deal, my son Saeed is ready.
At this ministry, they serve coffee.
Taking her, I would go to the lands, if God helps me.
Goodbye.
Oh mom, what's wrong with you? I'll see you later.
It's better for you.
Here I warned you.
Because I hear you say it's for Saeed.
Your father is sick.
I couldn't care less about you.
My father will complain to you if you don't tell me.
I don't see him keeping quiet.
And he speaketh
You've disgraced it, you've ruined it. Have some fear of God in this currency.
Your screaming woke me up. What the hell is going on?
Dad, you were a government employee, and you know what an inventory is all about.
Ha ha ha ha ha They write this first.
Now after the truth, now hey, what do you do?
Dad, tomorrow is the last day for application submissions at the Development Bank for loans.
La la la who says?
Dad, it's enough now.
He told you a short story and you believed him.
He tells you he has an inventory committee.
Shablage
Hi, how are you?
His soul galloped to finish his transaction.
There's nothing, there's nothing, there's nothing.
He who went out in silence returned speechless.
I talk to him, he doesn't reply.
No shame whatsoever.
Your father's reaction is completely understandable.
If you're happy with it like this.
May Allah reward you with the best. You didn't fall short.
It was supposed to call you.
Why does he connect with his mattress?
Dear and precious Dad
You've always been helpful to us.
Wipe them on me.
Let him be on me.
That's it, Dad.
Honoured and exalted.
Chitter-chatter
Thank you very much.
Dad, I love you.
May Allah reward you with goodness.
We have decided from this day forward.
We conduct our transactions ourselves.
You have done more than enough, may God reward you. Thank God.
But the one who surrenders to you, Dad
Consider it the last one.
Just can't be.
Call me now
I'm not going to the Minister's. Dad, I'm not going.
The minister will be angry with you.
It's not right that you should go before him. No, no, no. This is unacceptable. The Minister comes first above all else.
I don't know what to say, Dad. I don't want to bother you.
Don't tell me and I won't tell you.
Your transaction is processed and considered complete.
I'm on my way to finish Saeed's transaction for you.
And the one who brought you up
Consider it the last transaction you'll ever have to handle for me.
What you command, Dad.
But your son had to sign this paper.
It means I'll get them tomorrow.
Honestly, I recommend you get it today.
And if the transaction isn't entered upon them,
I'll see you in two months.
La la la, I'll make him sign it and send it back.
La la la, it's all good.
Call him, please. Just two minutes.
And I dedicate it to you.
It means: Do you not know Saeed?
I haven't asked for permission.
And the answer was Morocco.
No, all of them are with him.
Where are you?
He tells me he's at Saeed's.
I'm waiting for my shift to end.
Okay, Dad.
Yay, I cleared your papers myself!
John, take care of your children.
Do you have any children?
I love my uncle.
Please come in, my uncle.
You've done your best.
There's no use.
I will leave you.
Go to the nursing home.
I don't want to tell them where I'm going
What are you telling them, Abu Sa'id?
I'm writing them something else.
All praise be to Allah.
Yesterday he left prison.
No, by Allah, my sister.
We're done with all this talk.
Don't you ever speak on the radio or television.
May the hell take him, it's all just nonsense.
O Allah, guide him and put him on the right path. Hopefully.
Bye, my dear sister. May God protect you.
‏ It's the prison shower.
I was travelling yesterday.
O my sister, what can I say to you?
He called once on that show they call "Al-Mils".
And the woman spoke to the man.
The one over there is Khalid Jasim.
And he said: "Enough of this gibberish!"
My yacht's back, listen to them, his colleagues are talking about him at work.
He was talking about the government.
Oiled money flows.
Mother, mother, what's happening to this boy?
Not one of its quarters.
Those who were delighted in him and telling him to do thus and such.
They all disowned him.
He is the One true God, may He guide him.
And I'm back, my sister. Allow me to depart, as I have a cook awaiting me.
You are most welcome.
Come, Dad.
Come and sit.
Enough of this nonsense, my dear son.
Oh God, dad, I'm so tired and sick.
This is me lying in the hospital
You don't deserve it, by Allah's mother.
I don't want what happened to you to happen to you.
Dad, I told you that.
What is it, Mom?
And he kept shouting.
I won't keep you.
Oh Dad, this time I got away with it.
Here I am telling you
It's all right, Mom.
Forget about it.
Nonsense.
Why did the manager get fired?
Haram, after all these years you come today and tell me it's Funchinack.
You don't understand the talk, Saleh.
Nonsense.
Give us only one.
Order, O Saleh!
And you're the kind of person who doesn't let these things bother you.
You are, mashallah, keenly interested in public affairs and critical.
Not easy.
We only crossed out one guy.
And you are one of them.
It's not you I'm talking to.
Goodbye.
Mr. Salih
But hopefully, my uncle Bou Munira doesn't know.
O my father, I invoke your soul in this harsh winter.
From where does it rain?
If you ask me
Tell him to get to work.
I told you, Befana.
I asked his mother and she said he's working.
It's necessary.
Her mother must go in.
This is what we're doing with it now.
Our daughter got involved with him.
The one you're ordering / instructing to do
I'll give him a two-week deadline.
But if it doesn't work, by God, I will pull on his ears and take him to court and make him divorce her.
Let's have coffee now, shall we?
You're only buzzing like a fly because you have something on your mind.
Mom, honestly.
I want to go out.
Don't look up.
I know you want to go away.
Your heart eats you up over coffee
I want to talk and ramble.
Oh God, your boredom has put me to sleep, oh God.
Go look for a job tomorrow morning.
Inshallah I will rise in the morning
Mom, I told you I quit. I swear I've given up that habit.
That's it, I swear.
Mom, to be honest, I'm feeling a bit upset.
And I won't mention the nonsense about Bsnaa.
Jank asmakh
It's not just the old gibberish.
Where are you, my friend? It seems like you're on silent mode. How about treating us with one of the oldies?
We heard, we heard enough of your nonsense. We heard.
Nonsense.
Nonsense.
Saleh is present.
Saleh is lying down.
Did my son do something wrong without me knowing?
We only care about the fact that Saleh is in the coffee shop.
Sure, the Arabic text translates to: "I hope it's not difficult for you"
Oh mom, fix this.
Because there were people existing
You're Nadine, right?
Don't waste your time with me.
If a wheel fell off by the door, I'd grease its axle.
But the fault is not with you.
The blame lies with those who didn't put you in your place.
My son and the bread of my handiwork, I know you well, very well indeed.
You're like this pack of cigarettes.
Should I talk or should I not? Should I say or not say? I say: enough of this nonsense.
Here I am telling you
It's being broadcasted.
And it's not valid, we've had enough of nonsense.
Professor Saleh, you are a very patriotic man.
We can't keep you busy.
But what can we do?
Oh God, forgive us.
Hello Saleh, how are you?
John, you're precious to us, please don't exhaust yourself.
No, by Allah!
Oh brother, I wait for you every day to say: Enough chit-chat!
You are a brave person, you're not afraid of anything!
And if you're ever going to Islam her, tell her.
I swear by Allah, it's done.
O Sa'dah, say it, and may the one who delivers you from this nonsense be blessed.
Oh God, the Riyal has reached an all-time low, pleading with you now, just one, just one for his sake.
Awesome, my brother!
What's important now, in the meantime.
Regarding the job
The job is yours. You truly deserve it; you're a valuable national asset.
We were calling you to inform you.
Oh, you guys are so embarrassing in front of everyone!
Are you serious?
Everywhere I go, they tell me there are no vacancies.
Poor things. They want to keep me busy, but there are no jobs available.
And now how will you and your mother manage financially?
Don't forget after
Four kids have
Allāh is Kind.
Don't lose hope, my love.
Keep hope in your heart.
And I don't stop
You have to go look for a job.
So my dad doesn't create problems for us.
I'd do anything for you, Munira.
And I repent, I will no longer say "enough of this nonsense".
That's enough nonsense.
You know what I'm doing these days
I told you so.
Only may God guide you, Abu Fahad.
Don't you listen?!
I'll go and tell the Minister about all the horrible things he's doing.
Rabat Minister
Sure, I get it this way.
You're right.
That's it.
What's being kept quiet.
You know, there's a rumor going around that you're being replaced. They're saying you're out.
I'm looking for a way to get rid of it.
I don't want anyone to think I'm involved in the matter.
Your idea is valid.
I keep thinking about him.
The way that removes Sultan from your path
Have you heard about Saleh's Saleh, not just nonsense?
May God protect you. This is from our neighborhood.
Based on the context, the best translation for the provided text is: Built upon it.
You have deprived us of your voice, brother Saleh.
No, Saleh.
I'm one of your biggest fans.
Masha'Allah, Saleeh is doing great!
inshallah soon
He comes back and you hear his voice, and you're delighted.
BoFahd himself asks about you
But say, O Salih.
Why did you stop?
And God knows, some psychological and health issues too.
Just being honest.
You are considered a freedom fighter.
It's been a while since we heard from you
O Allah, O Allah, O Allah, I beg You, O Salih, come to my aid!
Just once, for my sake.
I want to hear it from your lips.
Saleh says it's OK.
La la ya jamâa, it's really tough, seriously, it's tough.
What's up with you?
Real, please.
Abdulrahman Ana Qate'
Then you didn't tell me you were looking for a job.
This is your chance.
The real deal would love to hear you say that. Go to his office the day after and ask for the job.
And if they split open your chest
Trust me, I want what's best for you.
Do you know how?
That's it. We don't want to get up. Go back to your home.
No, no, no. We don't want it.
Hold on, my friend, please. Shhhhh. Let me clarify that first.
That's it, we've had enough.
Gas Gas
Now, if I were to return as I did last time, of course, I've stopped doing that, but last time I did,
For example, Shihab means Boo Boo Boo BoFahad loves to hear.
Sure, I know there are many problems and issues.
What does he prefer to hear, or rather enjoy? Protests, I guess. Say what you think.
Per the contract.
As per his responsibilities
87 cm
The work is ruined, basically.
Until he stops talking to me
Why did the employee do such a thing?
Where seventh seventh.
Up until he cuts me off
VII. His Excellency the Minister
Why the employee?
When the Ministry moved to its new location
He inherited cars from his brother.
Let's stop the nonsense, guys.
And we're so glad you're back with your voice, we didn't want you to cut us off again.
Oh, the people I hold dear, indeed. Last time.
And I honestly cut it off.
Mom, you didn't say it was over.
And you prevented him
O my daughter!
This guy's name is Basna, he talks rubbish. I'll expose him on air.
I only heard it said.
I suspect that someone within the ministry is the one who leaks him the information.
The sky roars with fury.
The sky roared in response.
The minister's attendants are present.
I don't care
My whole time is for the Ministry, may it be blessed.
I heard it, may his life be long.
Oooh, wallahi I said it just for you.
He didn't give me face.
He didn't talk to me
Abdulrahman, go and do some work!
He didn't talk to me
Indeed, you are a poor soul, Saleh.
So sad.
I am the secretary of Bu Fahd.
And he knew the whole story.
The group exploited your specified target.
And unfortunately, they conveyed it to him.
And you know who's behind all this.
Abdulrahman Ould Frejgem
It's him who planned all of this.
It's impossible for Bu Fahad to concern himself with you.
One day, you'll do to him what happened to Sultan.
Madame, you are famous about me.
It's impossible for anyone to employ you.
I want to go to court to get divorced.
I found the solution.
We are now the best community in the world
Flawless
We don't have it.
There are no flaws whatsoever.
We are comfortable.
What's the connection?
Even if someone who knows you tells you to take a turn.
Because it's the system.
He gets his rights more than the stranger
We rely not on the stranger.
We don't have it.
Your effort is flawless, we have no flaws. We have imperfections.
And (he is) not one of the Major Ones.
He'll make you sit at home.
There's nothing like that here.
Best regards
Saleh Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Bahahiri
Famous for his Saleh Bsainat gibberish.
My dinner
I was running, then I turned and my shirt tore.
I saw a new talk show yesterday. She looked amazing.
Saw a kid wearing the new shirt we just bought from Villaggio
This is just a little sail boat.
And this is not a kind gesture.
And I put it in my conscience.
O Notary, when you saw the beauty of that boy, you were burnt with desire for him.
It's not up to him.
Why is it difficult, Walid's T-shirt?
His pocket is stuffed, but he's wearing a new T-shirt. I'm jealous! Tell your dad to buy you one.
ashja'if nafsak
Why tear the T-shirt of Walid?
To tell you
Don't make me pick you up and stick you on the boat.
I say to my brother Sultan
Why don't you give him a strong punch like this and smash his face in?
Don't do this, you little kid. This is not for you.
This is a child, this is a child.
O you, little child
And he wants good people to visit him and be polite.
They don't let him.
The price of your words, O Sultan, and about the nonsense.
My world as a child was school, I was a kid.
You've always been conceited.
Bring up your children properly
And if you're not up for the job of parenting and not competent enough,
I still respect myself
And I don't want to make a mistake and embarrass him in front of his wife.
Older brothers, you are most welcome!
And I swear if you let those damn troublemakers from "Taqua" enter again, I will have him do something about it.
He has only himself to blame.
The time I'm wasting with you
Respect yourself, please.
Let's go there, she's waiting for us.
They didn't reply.
Where have you been, times of old?
And pure intentions
Oh Allah, with Your forgiveness and well-being
My brother didn't find anything more than this with you.
La la la, that's the biggest thing!
Give me everything in your hand and come here ASAP!
Oh, the calamity that has befallen us!
Just tell me exactly what's going on, Dad.
Mr. Ahmed, I need to ask you to forgive him. There's an issue at home that needs my presence.
Baggy pants are out.
This is the work of a hateful person, whose heart is diseased, filled with malice and hatred.
This is this the action of a Sultan.
Where can he get all these clothes tailored?
My new clothes, I haven't enjoyed wearing them. May God take revenge on them.
I have to show him.
I'm telling you, sit!
If I went at the time of the Pinker, he would say I was a kid and other such things.
What's your opinion?
You are Walid, my love. You know how to ride a bike.
I know.
My darling son
I say
Just tell me.
Where did Mum put the scissors?
Under the bed
May God destroy their livelihood, as they destroyed his.
But I see it.
I won't keep quiet about it.
This guy's crazy!
The most important thing now
And what it changes
But this computer thing, I'm involved with it deeply.
I promise I won't tell anyone.
Our son Adoul Al Yahal broke their computer and we didn't know.
My soul is with Nadia, my soul is with Nadia, may her stomach be filled with air, both hers and his.
Get rid of the nonsense, Fahed.
Soul, soul, go look for your quarter soulmate, go and laugh at someone else.
I tell you to retract.
Go ahead and laugh, my dear Fahoode.
I welcome you warmly.
Time of the calm hearts
And pure intentions
In Yahl
It's not me who goes looking for his friends
Laugh at others, Oh Sultan!
In order to falsely accuse me.
Scissors
Respect yourself.
Help me, Abdul Rahman! Dad, come quick!
It's your turn, Fahd and Sultan.
Oh dad, every day they're like this, they argue.
I don't know
A session like this
We're supposed to sit her down.
To examine our deeds.
And the works of those who came before us
And what we shall become.
We take the lessons learned.
And we learn.
O great peace-maker, Jenkum.
As big as a camel.
Do you have children?
Understands nothing.
His role model is his father, not you guys.
His role model is his dad.
O Sultan!
And you, Fahad.
And I am your older brother
Because of me
He paid the price of the computer.
Now, when you extended your hand to him,
We have reconciled.
That's not why I'm giving him my hand. I just want him to let go.
I'll shut up Abdulrahman's nagging.
Where are you going?
By God, I won't let him!
You made the tea yesterday
Look, don't be scared
If you're a real man, step out the door, I'm talkin' to you.
You didn't say that Abdulrahman made you buy some.
But by God, if he doesn't enter his room, I will break it down to pieces!
This is your brother.
It's not natural.
Your brother is not normal.
Right now, I'm having tea.
Fahd is on his head.
Shhh, be quiet, you guys! They're playing around, they have no shame!
Oh, you little kids! That's enough, Dad, that's enough!
Oath, by Allah I will show you, I will definitely show you.
O فلاه, O يمه, O فلاه! What a huge nose she has!
My mother's blood.
My heart flutters with this screaming.
O Allah
Let us be.
And Allah, it's embarrassing.
And I gather you and make peace among you.
He won't spare any effort for them.
One day they will fix them at night.
It didn't have time, mom.
And upon him.
And Mashallah to him
The text you provided is Arabic. Here is its translation: "The validity of the elegant"
But oh, my dear mother.
May God guide you.
You're supposed to cheer up.
It's not hot, oh mother of firewood.
May good things happen to you, Oh Lord.
Go ahead, Abdulrahman.
I wanted you to be my helper, but you've become a pharaoh.
You, oh father, may God guide you.
Two behind each other
Spread out Spread out
You've humiliated us, may God guide you.
Our neighbor Saad is watching and laughing at us.
O Officer, you've been calling us, calling us, and we're telling you…
Don't mind him, the officer banned him.
Delete all three of them.
Please.
O brother, you don't come to me, and I don't come to you.
The officer banned it, I swear I saw them from above.
The officer has banned him.
Up above, way up high.
My brother was right about him.
Please, you have all signed that your children will not do it again.
Thank you very much.
Welcome brother, please come in.
Banned by the officer How could they possibly walk by I'm certain.
Hear me.
I didn't want to tell you this in front of them
This is Abdul Rahman, their older brother.
Deputy Assistant Secretary
The second is their middle brother, the Chairman.
Soul, take two Panadol and relax.
The officer banned any pendulums.
You have two Panadols here.
Oh, oh May God suffice me against my enemy
God suffice me against the enemy.
May Allah suffice against the enemy. They played a game with me.
Ooh la la la, what's this story all about?
Can you get from there to here?
This is the hand of 'Ouda; it's just like his father's. He got a flat tire yesterday and is now changing it.
Do you really mean it?
He's a well-born and respectful young man with good manners.
This is the daughter of the poor.
Even if
Right now he'll catch up with you.
Oh, he never takes his eyes off you.
May God shower His blessings upon you.
Oh, hey, calm down. We'll get our chance.
Why did she look at you when you walked by?
It's fate.
You look and she looks at the same time.
Yes, there's definitely something.
Well, I notice too when I browse through.
I feel like she's thrilled inside. There's a joy and happiness in her.
Give me a pen, dude.
Take my notebook.
I swear I don't know her name.
Overly romantic.
Oh, you're in the twenty-first century now!
Indeed, you're going completely bonkers.
The truth is...
Since when have we had this discussion
Sure!
From today onwards, I plan to dedicate myself to you.
But you really need to rest a bit now.
My grandfather especially after yesterday's outdoor filming in the desert.
My brother, may God protect us, I told the secretary: "No press encounters, no TV, not even contracts."
Let me be free for the family for a while.
May Allah be with you.
Even while you're busy
The first thing on my mind
I have her number, I'll call her today.
I'm late for it.
They bought the villa and have been living in it for a few days now.
Gar in TV series and acting
Umm Abdul Aziz says they are poor and modest people.
Their share is theirs, and we have no share in it.
Good morning, my dear uncle.
Hopefully, it's a good thing and not a bad one.
Oh dad, this car keeps calling us every other day.
It appears the battery is dead.
It's all good, no need to worry. I've got the tools and will fix it for you ASAP!
May Allah reward you with goodness.
We're here! We're here! My dear uncle.
Peace be upon you.
Yes, Walid is right.
Release me from tomorrow, I will look for an apartment there so I can visit you every day.
Tell me straight, what do you want?
Okay, Dad.
Please come in.
Just Walid, that's all.
Rashid Abdullah
The same name
Dad's got his groove back.
Omg!
I was thrilled to find out that Rashid Abdullah, the actor I adore, turned out to be Yarna.
Everyone praised him.
They say he is humble and kind.
Yalla before Dar, indeed yes.
I only take pictures with him.
For the quarter at work to believe me
I can't believe our house is attached to Rashid Abdullah's house, the actor.
Talk to him, talk to him so he'll believe.
Go ahead and explore the world!
What we see on TV
And I hope to see him.
Thank God it's out, praise God.
They want galabiyahs with wide sleeves, I have them.
I'm here, but give me a moment, guys. I'm not used to it yet and haven't quite gotten the hang of it.
You have been informed.
Yes, by Allah, he didn't hold back. May God reward him with the best.
Peace be upon you.
Some employees are being transferred to the new branch of the Ministry of Health.
They didn't tell you they're coming back.
I haven't heard their names.
But what I heard is definitely true.
And Bou Ali's name is with them.
My name is Ana.
But we still don't exactly know who we will be transferring.
I am Winnie the Pooh, and Winnie the Pooh says: "I can't smoke. God saves you, I can't."
Dad, can you or can you not? This is work.
The committee is still studying the subject.
But if she chose you,
We were blessed with your visit, Abu Walid.
Thank you, thank you, Abu Ali!
Brother Rashid, Al-Somooh is back. He said the furniture is all yours.
We are neighbours today.
His people
This is from your good stock, Abu Walid.
May Allah reward you, my brother Rashid.
I've heard a lot about your kindness.
May God spread love.
But oh my daughter
I'm ready to help you find the nicest and most affordable furniture that suits you both.
When did it come back, to be honest the furniture is quite old.
We need to change it.
inshallah
Hey sis, I told you that before.
If you need anything
Consider me like your sister.
May my eyes not shed tears of sorrow.
Where have you gone, my love?
Yesterday she texted me, I forgot to reply.
No, my love, I don't want to tire you out.
Not more.
Bye, God be with you. I'll call later.
Honestly, I was talking to her.
These people are not our type.
They're the rich ones, and we're over here.
Mom, it's not your fault.
Hello, Mom!
You guys just watch me for a bit.
And I'll give you the signal when to ask for her hand in marriage.
I told you
Don't worry, it's not on you.
My darling, you tell me he's your fiancé.
I put the dinner in the living room
If I wanted to have dinner
Now I'll have the driver take her to university, God willing.
And then didn't we agree that we're family?
I'll buy a car.
And soon, God willing.
I contacted her to thank her.
They love doing good. Yes indeed.
Yes, by God's truth, you are right, Dad.
Even if our family members don't behave like that.
And my name is definitely with them.
Are you sure?
Oh, the woes that befall us!
I have no idea right now. My head's spinning from this news. I don't know how to react.
Soul soul soul soul soul soul May it be you, hopefully, hopefully good. Thank you very much. May God reward you. May God reward you.
The best of outcomes, Oh father of Ali.
The committee met today.
And here is the list of names of those who will be transferred: Adhkhane.
My name is Weham.
The manager should promote you.
I don't think it's any use, Oh Ali, I don't think it's any use.
He told me he has no hope.
The Great Artist
Consider your name crossed off the list.
Thank you, you didn't hold back, Abu Salem.
Please come back.
I'd love to take a picture with you to show the kids.
Oh, my children, relax now.
May God keep them with you, inshallah.
Can I have a picture of the artist, please?
At your command, God willing.
Please, be my guest. Please.
Ava aleik, ava aleik, hāẓir.
You and those dear to you.
Tell me a day or two before.
Oh dear oh dear, hurry up Mom!
Get ready get ready it's on
What's wrong with you, you nitwit?
I agree.
My mother's khal.
Oh Allah, their souls!
Just come back, my son.
I don't want them to feel like we're poor and struggling.
You have to glitz it up
Where should I get my fashion items and fancy clothes?
It looks like you've got me into trouble with the folks.
What's up with you staring at the jewelry? I've never seen you like this.
It's not mine.
The right is mine, or Ali's.
Umm Ali is looking for a wife for her son, Ali.
You want nice clothes and a little jewelry.
As she said, she wants to show them that they are respected and well-off people.
Oh oh Mashallah!
She's got this.
Masha'Allah, her hair has grown so long and turned a lovely shade of blue!
Mā shāʼ Allāh, may I say.
Masha'allah, you're a queen, Queenie!
You still need to prepare.
Because they say let my dad come to meet her father
Of course I won't go out dressed like this.
My first choice is my new gorgeousness.
Oh, mom, go easy on the woman's belongings.
Um Walid didn't hold back; she gave them all her belongings.
EE
It's time we became like them.
Why his mother doesn't go and look for a bride for him?
Just those women
Now I have to go and see the men.
May Allah protect you as well.
The only thing remaining is God keeping you safe, the coat.
The good folks did their part.
They didn't hold back, we stayed in the past.
When I come back I'll take the set from you to complete it.
Alleves for you.
I'll give you a hand, my dear brother Rashid. Should we go with the jacket or the overcoat?
Just come and take a look first.
This needs to be closed.
Aha, it does amuse me.
The dress looks good on you, but take a look.
This is Allah protecting you.
The left hand inside the besht.
My heart is threatened like this.
The *besht* comes from beneath like this.
Allāh Allāh
Oh, what a delight!
The walk The walk feels a bit heavy.
O say
That's so extra, you're a millionaire!
May they give it to you, God willing, in seconds.
The left sank thus, the right this colour.
I know my friend Aisha lives there.
What's wrong with her?
Do you know what I want to tell you?
You keep telling me that you're my friend, that we'll never part.
My brother will go and ask for your hand in marriage.
Tell the truth, Rafshtaj, don't say anything to her brother and embarrass yourself.
<html> <body> <p> <br>These days, people keep throwing hollow speeches at me. For the past few days, Suad kept telling me that she wants you to marry her uncle, and today it's for her brother.</p> </body> </html>
They want to take my girlfriend.
I was looking
The most important thing is that they know the relationship between us.
They don't know, we're just colleagues.
That's it, kid.
They must know from tomorrow onwards.
Why did Walid refuse?
I scream.
You reject my son Waleed.
The actor is more honorable than you, you hypocrites.
You guys
Do you emulate your entire life?
It's not your turns.
Be of service to people.
You attract people.
You wear the costume of acting in front of God and His creation.
The coat I wore on TV
Me, not you guys
My accessories, gold and jewellery.
I played the role of
You have married
Sure, the translation is: <menzer shenu>
One walks ahead of his wife.
His house is two stories.
Straight ahead, neither to the right nor to the left.
My brother, he reminds me of that guy you always talk about, the one who's with you in the office.
Come with him, a boy and a girl.
He walked like that, why?
As he says
God help him, oh really.
Walk straight, don't stop.
Poor guy has no personality at all.
He's laughing happily.
She sews us clothes.
No no, it's not nice when you're sitting there like that.
His cuteness is like this, walking and while you're standing, get up, stand up!
I'm begging you, Khamis, I'm begging you.
I'm off to the city.
I want you a little.
Where are you going? Sit with us for a while.
His wife messed him up.
You seem to like it this way.
O, Khamis!
Switch off the TV and if you see a presenter, ignore her.
I'm scared that he'll create problems for me.
I swear to God I'm working.
I'm sitting, by God I'm sitting with Salem, my work buddy.
Haja
The line is blocked. Iodine Iodine.
The phone is ringing off the hook, causing me problems at home.
Now you're saying that your friend Ikmen is only sitting with us because you didn't leave him any other choice.
That means, "Oh God, now, now it might arrive. God willing. The package, may it arrive safely."
and banishes you after
You're not the first one to fire.
La la la la, la ma ma qader ya khay.
May my mother rest in paradise.
My mother recommended me to
She told me not to divorce her.
La la la, I can't, it's impossible!
I'm looking for something you're into.
La la la Kh kh kh khlek khlek
You're totally not normal.
Don't come to me with you.
Tell me, I want to understand what's going on.
La la la, Mom! I absolutely do not allow you to say such things!
Salem is definitely one of the best young men we have in the area.
He tells you he's divorced.
He keeps telling me we're divorced. Finally! Finally, it's over. What the hell am I supposed to do now?
It's looking like you're officially an idiot, Khamis.
Let me go, let me go and the one who delivers you
A kid was sitting and chatting with me about our childhood memories.
May Allah guide you.
The poor one hurts the heart.
I received a message from the Minister's office, it's important.
May God guide you when you give.
La la la, nothing, nothing.
I'll take it, I'll deliver it to him.
For the meeting tomorrow with the incoming women's delegation
Women's delegation
What's wrong with you? Why aren't you sleeping today?
Al Salem.
I am your brother Khamis
Yes, I am serious and God is my witness.
O my brother, indeed.
Scratch my name off the list, mate, I won't be attending.
How do we cross out your name?
The only one who can remove your name is His Excellency the Minister.
Oh, brother, this is a meeting at the Ministry.
Official meeting
I need
Safe Safe Safe
Tell me the truth.
It's the one I was talking to and you were hiding behind the tank.
Safe and sound, safe is Allah safe.
As long as you need me, I'll be here.
Are you saying or how?
It's me, Ali.
It's not me, it's Khamas.
That's not what I thought, to be honest.
And I'm casual too.
She suspected me, mate, that I was talking to someone.
The life is sweet.
And if he hands you over, it's Salim who'll contact you.
And the one who converts to Islam so that I may give charity.
It's he who told you to call.
You mind your business.
Mind your own business or else you'll see what I'm capable of.
I complain about you.
‎ Hey, you.
How can you live with someone whose tongue is so sharp?
Let's start the meeting now.
Hassan will ask Khamis to come.
Let's discuss the real estate budget first.
Please come in.
Inshallah I'll find it.
He told her as soon as he saw the women, he was scared.
I've gone around the whole ministry and you're tucked away here
Oh dear, oh dear, everyone's waiting for you in the boardroom.
I can't sit with the women.
O Khamis, how does your wife know?
I'm afraid she'll call.
Ball makes you doubt me? Come on, bro, you don't understand!
<h1>Iron and Michelle will make me go back home</h1>
Your wife will only call at this hour.
Of course you as a large company
This project which your company is implementing for our Ministry
One of the largest projects in the ministry's history
O people, what's with the shaking table?
May you live a long life, this table is not me.
Please reply.
Who's with me?
Sorry, I'm not available.
My phone is broken.
Just a moment, I'll tell you.
It's actually because he fainted from fear of going back home.
O brother!
She told me, "If you keep working with those women, don't come back home."
That's why he submitted a request at the Ministry to be transferred from our department.
He himself told me that the Minister approved his transfer request. He did exactly what he wanted. What more could he ask for?
O my brother, what is this thing, his wife!
This is Yinnon.
I have so much I want to tell you, O Khamees, but with whom shall I share my stories?
I tell you, he's not sane.
And now what will you do, isn't your wife and children coming tomorrow?
I have no idea what to do.
And you fulfilled her request, why aren't you letting you go back home and see your children?
Because she wants to officially confirm.
Sure, here's the translation: Give her the papers.
That's exactly what I did. I sent her brother the paper.
Because she saw the Minister's signature and verified it.
Inshallah we will agree, and if you agree, inshallah tonight we can go back home.
My brother and this is the Minister's signature.
After the two clashes
Tomorrow he'll start working in the new department.
That means tomorrow he's off to a new job, not the one he had.
O Lord, guide me towards this section, You who can deliver me.
O Allah, may He protect you. This is the visa of the Minister.
Nothing, nothing. That's on your right hand.
Yes indeed, Allah is most gracious.
Please, this computer is ready.
Saad, Abdul Qader and Mashallah are a big office. Yes indeed.
Goodbye.
How to request a transfer
My brother, the whole department is full of women.
Madam Ya'at
No one can make this decision again but the Minister himself.
You have to continue working until the minister comes back.
O brother, you agree with your female colleagues.
And call them by their male names so your wife doesn't recognize them.
I left two more for the new employee's rights.
The new employee
The Minister's office has sent us a real madman for us to deal with.
It's really happening.
And his shape makes him look like a real old-school ladies' man.
They just tell his wife that she's insanely jealous.
Gharham 'Amya
Poor devil. He's not got two pennies to rub together.
But he asked us, if his wife called, to keep quiet about it and not say a word.
Is Abdelkader the one with you in the office?
This won't be too much for you, it's up to you whether you see it that way or not.
My son just called, saying my wife is bringing me to the office.
What are you doing?
Right side, first door.
This is the Care Office.
With the five ladies.
Hi six employees
It's here, I'm connected, it's continuing.
It's not my thing to pull these stunts.
This is my wife; she's jealous of me.
Because I'm sweet.
Now may God guide you, Sultan.
We just want to know how far we've gotten.
My uncle what happened was that my brother and I, Falcon, were at the bank yesterday.
Sure, from this aspect the project is...
Peace be upon you
My brother, I have an important meeting at work.
Oh my God, go to the kitchen quickly, please!
Now I'm dressed, I'm leaving.
It's supposed to be in the kitchen
We don't have any women here. The men are not obedient, let's go.
And the scorpion, when angry, is enough to ward off its sting.
These are essential for rain. Look, look.
See, Uncle.
Aisha, if anyone wants to convert to Islam, tell the secretary to inform the employees.
He tells them that the meeting scheduled for today has been postponed until tomorrow.
Inshallah we will do our best.
They issue these orders.
And woe betide us if we don't carry it out.
They should know you're the big boss.
Responsibilities and Communications
In their eyes, a woman is only a servant.
I have never seen people who despise women as much as them.
These people still live the way they did back in the old days.
Come on, don't go to work, go to the kitchen and make some tea.
Where are the servants?
The second one has been missing for a week
Even the servants are not spared from their insults.
They're right to be fed up.
God be with you.
The bank's observations are minor.
The one who is coming
My uncles are something, I mean what do they mean?
The villa complex loses all its charm without a garden.
Garden hose
My sister wants to have your opinion on the subject before I go.
My dear Fatoum, I have to go. I'm already late for work.
Okay, come on, tell me what's up.
Are you telling me or should I go?
And play it at school
Back to the Women's Union Committee
The school chose me to play with them in the team.
You're crazy!
Now you tell me you're going to the selection.
Do you know what your brothers and parents would do to you if you told them this?
It's all your own fault.
This is us warning you.
I'll just say hi, it's been ages since I saw you, Dad.
Oh, damn! Year after year, I don't see you.
Did you marry him or not?
O Allah, guide him.
Whoever takes one who is neither learned, nor holds a certificate, nor knows anything, may God guide you.
No no no, it's not a fault of Real that he's uneducated
And then there's Khamis, son of the scorpions.
He bit him.
No, we only take one unit at a time at our level.
The scorpion is like him.
God be with you.
What should I do, Aisha?
When the Minister travels, all transactions are transferred to me.
<font color=blue>Mustafa</font> <font color=red>is the</font> <font color=blue>head of the Resources Management department</font>, <font color=red>his secretary</font> <font color=blue>Amira</font> <font color=red>will see you tomorrow.</font>
But the guests from the Ministry have arrived today.
The program's on your computer.
And now I'm all yours, Aisha.
Hello Mary.
Let's go! Hurry up, come on, let's go now!
I'll tell you, Aisha.
This mess is solely down to these brothers.
What's happening?
My love, we need to apply cold compresses so your face doesn't swell up.
We warned her and said: Don't tell them!
She said to them, "Go beat her up and punch her."
Do you know, if I told them I hated them?
I've been annoying you for a long time, huh?
You play Ava's Ball.
Next time, I'll break necks.
Know who's talking to you
Scorpion's Sting
The text you provided appears to be Arabic. Its translation would be: It's very big.
O my uncle, it wasn't me who hit Sultan, it was only a tap.
O tower of speech!
I chose Economics and Political Science
I honestly chose Graphics because this major is in high demand these days.
Architectural engineering
It's not your turn.
You took your chance
Greed is not good, I tell you.
Tamer, you scorpion!
She hit it, broke it, smashed her earrings, and knocked out her teeth.
They led me to her.
Come over here, I have some kahwa for you.
Do you go on missions?
You studied Architectural Engineering.
Please feel free to do so.
To make sure.
Sultan and Saqr, I've talked to them.
They have no objection to you marrying her.
I want it now.
Our son Khaled deserves it.
I'll arrange a meeting with them and let you know, God willing.
Your nomination within the delegation
I understand your circumstances.
But give yourself a chance for tomorrow.
I'm telling you the truth.
You're very interested in her.
Your nomination comes from above.
He spoke the truth.
My brothers, I know them.
It's impossible that they agree.
I'm surprised at them.
Their installments on my salary
I am the one who supports the household.
Don't tell me to travel with you anymore.
It's not our intention to marry her this week.
What do you say?
Thursday the idiot who doesn't even have a middle school certificate
Marry him and travel with him.
O God, grant me knowledge.
And God knows they're doing wrong.
If they reject her, they will slaughter her.
Dad, I've told you many times.
Where do you go?
From tomorrow, from tomorrow, God willing.
Don't you worry, I'm a Scorpio, born to Scorpio parents.
Even if it's just a simple walk, it's fine.
I don't want to marry Khamis.
And oh, my soul, to the kitchen!
Put them in the living room.
Tonight's match is Real Madrid vs. Barcelona.
Inshallah they don't beat us, Valencia.
I'm talking to you from reliable sources
Devoted and passionate about her work.
What do you think about what just happened?
We fought, we didn't do anything.
We have to go to work against our will.
Please take your seats at the desks.
Thank you so much!
Tallest Man
Pour it there.
The Minister sought
May Allah protect and prolong her life.
Please, Your Highness, please.
Good evening, O Minister.
Yes, Your Highness.
I washed the T-shirt.
Soul of the coffee maker, Captain Imad's spirit
And at the same time after
We're travelling to China after tomorrow. We have a game there.
Hi Captain Nesib, let me introduce you to my sister Mary.
Where are you going, my dear brother? I'm going to my father's farm.
You're an idiot.
I don't know your left from your right, you want to become a minister.
Inshallah, stay safe.
To my aunt.
My soul is the only one with Wusu in it.
Representative Contacts
Just a while ago, Mushail called me.
Her chalk's vertical line continued.
Haram 'aleyk dowr Nawf klash mayasli7 7aqq Mashael
Noof is a sixteen-year-old girl.
And Maysha'al Ya'trauli means the Roaring Twenties
Why don't you take Mary's role?
It suits her better.
Nove's role is thirty.
Get your oil out of this mess they put us in the committee.
This is a problem, I'm sure it won't stay quiet.
And he'll stand still for us on the one.
He's talking to you about art, family values and meaningful art, but the content is so vague.
This is one of the things he set up for us in the committee.
The Minister is the one who formed the committee.
Me, you and Hamed can definitely pull it off, but haak.
La la la la la la la Impossible
Because there is originally no proof that it is mine or Alhamd's
Even if he goes to the Ministry of Economy and asks
Once he finds our names.
May God protect her, the company is registered in the name of Hamud's wife.
From this aspect, I don't worry.
Then rest assured, for the chairman is not I.
The final decisive word will be mine.
Everything's fine, Dad. Come on in, come on in!
I talked to them and agreed on everything.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, hello Professor Rashid, please come in.
And as you know, this meeting is convened to decide on the approval of the series "Rape of Conscience".
Wahwah is produced by the Modern Arts Touch Institute
Sweet, Strange, Brave, Action TV Series
I'm with Hamed.
Honestly, the series has a really great storyline.
I'm with you, Hamad.
And what delighted me even more was when the mother took the pistol and killed her neighbor.
She went to grab the gun, but it was in the car.
You don't know that this is her son's car. It's action time when the police arrive to search it.
Her son from school
The cartoon blew its tires.
John gives him that powerful shot and the cartoon flies away, entering the mother's room through the window.
Here's the surprise!
Oh, this shot! This is the shot where Cartoon Dash enters the Mother's Chamber.
It's beautiful that a local company has advanced to this level of work.
We must encourage them and take their hand.
Oh, brother Rashid, we haven't heard your opinion yet!
You've left it to my brother Rashid, have you?
With all due respect to your opinions and impressions of the series called "Rape of Conscience".
And rape of the values of humanity
And absurd surprises
A Man and a Half in every episode
The text you requested: <h1> Episode After Next </h1>
Written Series without Social Awareness
It does not bear a meaningful message that elevates society.
The tears are falling, so you have to cry, viewers.
Rashid, please.
You said your opinion, Ali said his. I've given mine; now Mr. Rashid will give his.
It's obvious from the ongoing.
I smell an agreement between you.
Sorting things out.
There are people who understand this; it's their specialty. Others couldn't care less about the subject.
I reject this series.
I'm afraid he'll land us in trouble and create problems for us.
Don't pay any attention to him.
I can't do anything.
I carry out my word.
John gives me the jacket and says, "This is from Mama Samira."
I don't know what's going on.
I don't believe you, Nasser.
Oh, it's the new series we told you about, we're gonna shoot it soon.
The man who they know raped their daughter
There's so much goodness between us.
The first good thing is, of course, this beautiful ring on your hand.
I tell you how.
In the name of Hameed's wife who sent you the ring.
And of course, his husband's role was to adjust the matters and issues.
His share of the work is 5%.
Sweet roundabouts.
I've never seen the series *Rape of Amane the Stray*. It sounds really good though!
By the way
What the hell is going on? Is it rape? Rape!
Any rape of dreams.
Why are all the names so similar?
For example, last year most of the series were about girls.
There are over eight and even ten girls in the series.
Dorge mazmon.
We have many torches
Oh oh, your luck has risen after the clash.
Hello Omar
It's all good, it's all good.
Sorry, my love. I have to go to work. What's up, Mary?
Have a quick breakfast and leave.
He says he wants to see me about something urgent and important.
I have to go.
What I know is that Rashid went and met the Minister.
He says he sat with him for half an hour.
These people will betray you.
I tell you to complain about us, you say it's fine.
What happened now is that the Minister's office has contacted me and said they're requesting me.
And he's afraid that the Minister will accept it.
I'm meeting the Minister.
The real Yan expresses his point of view in the series.
Not more.
This is indeed the case, Your Highness.
But first of all, as the Minister's messenger, I would like to make one thing clear, and this is not in my nature, to talk about a fellow artist who is not present.
May Allah protect you, Rashid. Everyone knows he has this trait.
He's envious of everyone around him.
All material interests
But he's a specialist.
Just leave it to God, not everyone who comes along should be consulted on technical matters.
Especially television works
Conscience Rape Series. May God Bless You, the project we are working on.
A bold masterpiece.
At the Gulf level, God willing, we will have a media scoop.
and an enormous spread
This is definitely your area of expertise, and you know more about it than I do.
The condition is ephemeral like an evanescent vision.
And raise our name above
But what the journalist Abdelhamid wrote, wrote, wrote.
One actor commented:
The series contains unethical appeals.
He deplores the decline in moral and artistic taste in the work.
By Allah, this is bold speech and strong criticism.
Your group will be in big trouble if Abdulhamid the journalist gets on their case.
And if their words reach the officials,
These are smart people who know how to manage.
Here's the gang.
We want to create a private website for ourselves.
We put in here all the company's activities.
The company's name is Asma.
From today onwards, you are the Media Advisor.
The series is called "Rape of Conscience", produced by Mercury Art Production.
A quantum leap in Arab drama
For its noble thought and values
It's a series aimed at developing the community.
It's the journalist Abdelhamid himself who has been criticizing them for the past few days
It's reasonable to shift one hundred and eighty degrees.
How does Abdulhamid allow himself to do this?
The journalist Abdulhamid and his ilk
Don't worry, Mr. Hamid.
He asked me about the series and I told him it's hitting big across the Arab world.
God hears you.
My artistic feeling tells me our series is going to hit it big!
That one, we don't know where to put it.
And this one here puts his bag down, he's leaving.
Let's get started.
You all bring up these things in your series that we have never seen in our lives nor heard of.
What's written is clear from its heading.
Your authors are all hallucinating.
It's all the same to me whether it happens or not.
Your series is bad, bad.
What's your opinion on the matter?
It seems like he's crying a lot, dad.
And we base ourselves on silly series.
Not everyone can understand it at first glance.
**In subtle threads and dimensions, this work requires focus to grasp its intended message.**
By the way, this work is politically motivated.
It is haram to expose people to this.
What's wrong with you guys?
The one who sees you like this would say you're eating 'sam.'
Last night Ali and I were at the Souq Waqif.
And we're sitting in a coffee shop
He didn't give me face.
What's your opinion on the matter, Nasser? If His Excellency the Minister gets angry, it's a big problem.
In one week he makes us all stay in our homes.
Oh God, the series Adaalat is so bad. Everyone who has seen it says it's a failure.
I hear that Rashid is planning to go to him.
And he's definitely telling him: "I told you this series is a failure, trash, and has no action."
Oh my god, guys!
Let's leave it at that.
And the Sphenisci, Nasar of Aspendus,
Hear me, Eli.
From now onwards, I want no topic posted on your page that criticises the series.
Please, Eli.
I reviewed the topic a few days ago; there was no criticism of the work, only insults directed at it.
Please don't make me upset with you.
He plotted against him.
But I was only an opportunity.
I would never say such a thing.
To be honest, not a single message thanking me for the series has come my way.
Shu Shu, the unparalleled success.
Goodbye.
Allow me, Brother Rashid.
Should I believe you or the newspapers?
Conscience rape in the TV business
His longevity is praiseworthy, we agree he is a journalist.
Listen to the second newspaper, Ash-Shaykh Awn.
They agree with the people: Read! Read! in the page of the readers.
My heart stopped.
Just a moment ago they were telling me
Oh Dad, how fortunate you are! The Minister is pleased with you.
Honestly, Nasser,
Get ready for the Guilt Rape Part II
Oh no, my dear brother, this won't do.
The first and last TV series I ever wrote.
I'd rather work at the scrapyard than do this job.
Part Two After This Fiasco
And third and fourth
What's wrong with you? Why don't you want to be beneficial?
One of the guys is sitting in his majlis.
Here we go!
The wizard said
And onwards
We want a word on this occasion.
Praise be to Allah for success.
For the naysayers, the enemies of success.
I am surprised
How does a series win an award when it's awful and failed?
These are specialized people.
They are definitely given awards for things we can't see.
Prepare a second part for the series for us.
Inshallah Taa'ela
They called him a wizard, indeed he was a wizard.
Remorse's Rapist: Part II
I saw you standing with the Minister at the beginning of the ceremony.
After the TV festivals we agreed.
He's telling them there's still a Part Two to come.
Same thing.
The dirty money goes into the banks to be laundered and comes out clean.
These series I watch are crap, weak, despicable and ridiculous.
They enter them into Gulf and Arab festivals
So that they may wash it and present it as a prize, it becomes a refined drama in the eyes of the people. They clean it.
Is it reasonable? Why isn't it reasonable?
As long as the arbitration committees themselves are the ones producing the series
Peace be upon you.
And peace and mercy be upon you. Thank God you arrived.
Yes, we have a contract with them, but they want to lower the price.
Come to the office.
We're not a small bakery nor a couple of bakers selling our bread and rolls.
We are one of the world's largest bakery companies
It hasn't dropped a single dollar.
Do they want or shall we cancel the contract?
Enough of the contracts we signed yesterday.
With the European company
See you on the web.
What you see.
He did a great job, he did a fantastic job!
For the first time from home, it will be the world's first product.
This is what I brought, not the biggest rotis baker in the world.
I'm telling you
How's my coffee?
I'll disable you or you go to the kitchen and search for the remote for an hour. Sometimes it might even cut off your hand.
This bun is made with yeast.
The cheese has been put down, and it's getting eaten.
Ten loaves of bread and ten trousers
No, you're right, it's a rotisserie oven. How's a kid supposed to know that?
How to throw away Abu Nasser and the pest?
So, when one goes to work, they can tell their friend: I've fasted sixty.
Al-Nour Hospitals' Dough: Why Didn't They Go To Them Yesterday?
I know I'm asking why she didn't go yesterday.
The story, my esteemed one, is that the bakers and the supervisors, who are known as 'Al-Eqainin', oversee the whole process of baking the traditional bread.
Reply later to the bakers.
That's what happened, Your Grace.
What are you doing, shouting at him like this?
Sitting with this nonsense of football and not football is messing up my work.
Do you know your son loves football?
Is it wrong if he hired a few employees from the company to have some fun with them?
You have 400 employees in the company and that's why I'm taking you.
One Hud 'Asher Hadith considers them the main players.
And above them, he took four substitutes and two staff members. So, seventeen in total.
and the team's official spokesperson
I did this on this messenger.
But I'll manage until I develop, even though the fans, the audience, are considered the most important player on the field, the twelfth man.
Let him have his fun. Let Anton lead the way. He's delighted.
And we are people who have signed contracts with them.
Now, when he told you he wanted to play soccer, you longed for it.
O Leader! I hear your call and obey.
It's nothing.
Now he has brought in a few employees and makes them play in front of him, watching and amusing himself at their expense. It's not fun for him.
He doesn't hire employees.
Even if some of your friends are in need of employees lend them one, it's no trouble.
The Master Bakers
O mother, may God guide you, why do you take the important bakers away when they're so scarce?
The second time you hire employees, tell me.
No, no. Let Hamad review this deal for me.
Hamdi is in the hospital.
Why has no one come to you, Your Highness?
I finished work and got into my car to leave.
May God assist the one who's listening, may He extend the life of our helper.
I walked over it.
The goalkeeper told me the guy who usually plays with us can't make it tonight and we have an important match.
Kail Mayshono searched for a goalkeeper and we arrived at the stadium.
Time to dress up the goalkeeper!
I never played football nor held a ball.
This is a situation.
What cannot be ignored
And tomorrow we will find you a job to keep you busy. Enough wasting time, no more football and nonsense.
Let me tell you.
Dad, you want me to disband and delete the team.
Yes, that's right.
Dad, please, I'm begging you on my knees.
It's haram to let the team go and ruin the final match.
La la la, in this one too, it's for the boy.
Hello
Congratulations on your victory!
Professor Nasser, congratulations on winning the cup!
We wanted to know how you planned to win.
I've prepared the team mentally, physically and psychologically. The coach has done his best.
Inside your hotel
Congratulations to you all, and the party's on, as promised!
I think your dad looks happy
I'm afraid he's being polite and is too embarrassed to refuse.
Congratulations on your team's huge victory, Uncle Abu Nasser's Bakery, in the International Bakeries Cup!
This is the greatest victory.
May God bless you. May God bless you indeed no no no.
Photo without a jacket Hold on a second.
No.
There's a confusion about the besht.
There is no doubt that your care, attention and creative ideas were a major factor in this victory.
The coach's touchline.
But in the final, he played five-three-two.
And you, as a great athlete, know that changing the plan messes up the players, but Bakery Team didn't get messed up and performed a wonderful game.
The coach's strategy
As the top athlete in the international bakeries, Bu Nasser, what advice would you give to players?
Until the Day of Judgment.
Hello Hello
May you live long.
They were greeted by Hamad Sultan.
They are most welcome. They'd do us the honour of having dinner with us tonight.
Dinner is served.
May Allah bless you, Abu Abdulaziz.
A contribution to the private sector
The team spirit
Envy us now.
No one means anything.
O Abdul Aziz
The machinery agents we use in the factory
That's how it is.
This is the one you wished to meet.
The ball introduced me to him and I hinted at him.
Tell him, O father of Abdulaziz.
You've always been far from hatred.
And what's it got to do with you?
For your information, the ball is in his lap. I see it between us, just 50 cm away. That means I'm very close to it.
Abu Nasser hasn't arrived yet.
No, by Allah, he didn't come today either.
At a conference about sports injuries, the platinum sponsor must be present.
I haven't seen anything yet.
I saw the building behind the bakery that was supposed to be a workers' residence.
Hello, he's drowned in football.
As we promise you, our beloved viewers, before each game we meet and talk to a true sports icon.
This man whose great ideas inspire the bakery team
How's the International Bakeries team doing? We heard you're undergoing a comprehensive development.
Forever, it means working tirelessly on these desks.
A paltry sum. Just one million dollars for all my hard work?
Don't hold back, let loose a bit!
Heidi, it was your mistake, not mine. Brother Shahin,
My mistake.
It was my mistake.
But you didn't tell me the players are wanted in the Gulf.
Prices in the Gulf reach unbelievable levels.
The player's balance is 200,000.
He's getting three to four million dollars in the Gulf.
Understand me, Mr. Mas'oud, how?
I've sent a fax from here.
It's right in front of me and it's real.
My father bought four new players for the team, in addition to the latest batch of four players.
This is tri odd. He's got Billy and Ronaldinho in his pocket.
The number written on it is eight hundred and fifty.
Right, right my father only bought it for the price of God's safety from a Turkish club.
In the UAE they want it for AED 1,200,000.
Don't look at me like that.
Sure, we can inspect the goods.
Definitely.
The man's duck
All good.
I'll give you everything, it's guaranteed.
Ooh, you're so fat, Mashallah! That's so nice!
This is the pivot on which this right of abode rests.
The thirsty muscle
This mighty muscle is the player's most important asset; if it's damaged, they're useless.
You did your best.
Oils? Check. Club will deliver them to us. I mentioned we're the Alphas.
Shadaa'wa
Let's go, Hamdy.
In abundance, in abundance.
This is Allah's blessing, may He grant you prosperity.
Yes, I'll bring them from the Afreecian jungles. What can I do for them?
We feed them, we raise them, we train them, and then we beat them up on the fields.
I didn't ask for anything. I didn't ask for your nose, dude. Take it, Dad, take it. Do you have room in the car or shall I carry you in the back of the truck?
It wasn't a day they saw us pressing them.
The striker comes down to me.
Kākākanoua Makalali Dindī
The guns go down.
Cashew Macaca-caw-caw-caw-caw! This is supposed to be the one that comes down.
Our coach is a novice.
Inshallah on Mars
Inshallah on Mars
I don't like his style of narrating the match.
This walks on a line.
The game has its rules.
Inshallah soon, within a couple of days.
What's wrong with you? I can hear your voices from up here!
This barn was born in Spain.
He refuses to understand that the coach is a clueless idiot.
Listen, listen to what Mitsu has to say. Be my guest.
And he knows the attacker of Al-Kifah, Celluloticawa, is born in the penalty area, as Ahmad Al-Tayeb said. He also knows where to position himself.
No one will bother your head.
Keep away from me.
I know how to deal with this coach.
Why did the team regress?
The supposed current situation is making the International Bakeries' coaching staff consider changing the venue of the match.
Because the players don't play in their positions.
And the player TakulamaKakoKolaLalalo, this isn't his natural position. He needs to move to the place where he usually plays.
Coach Eger's word is right.
Coconali Hopuway Malalu
Inshallah Inshallah Inshallah
La la la la! What's going on in the stadium is simply amazing!
What's happening now should not exist between the team manager.
The team's coach
If there's anything to delay it until after the match
Right now, everyone's watching and everyone's seeing it on camera.
The ball is in the net Goal number four for Al Najah.
Isgl scores the fourth goal. He's the star of the game today.
This coach is stubborn.
He says: "Uncle Boonasser doesn't want you as a coach for his team."
And then what did you bring?
I'm watching the game on TV, you stay on the bench, do as I say.
O my son, don't do such things to yourself, it's not good.
Right now tomorrow we have a game how can we play without a coach?
What's up, pops?
Okay, Rashid.
Oh my dear mother, you've broken my heart. Tell me, what's wrong with you?
My mother, divorce me. Divorce me.
How can I divorce you?
Mother oh mother, my mother.
How do you let go when it's only been a month since you got married?
I swear to God, Mom, I have no idea!
It means "I'm leaving you, we're breaking up."
O my mom, O!
Oh my God, Mom! I swear I don't know what came over me. He suddenly told me to get up and go to your house.
He told me: "That's why he said he divorced you. You are divorced."
I really don't know what's going on with myself.
A month of married couples splitting up, what will people say about us?
I'm with you
And Allah, I will tell you the truth.
I didn't hear about his divorcing her until you told me now.
Stay seated for a minute and I'll be right back.
Her high morals
Barcelona Saturday
The gaze of Abdullah's eyes
Yani returned with a tear on his cheek.
He tells his mom he supports Barcelona. He adores this team so much.
Do you insult him and hurt his feelings?
He told me, "Mom, I left Barcelona. I told him it's over, let her go. I'll bring you a better one."
I tell him your daughter got divorced because she left FC Barcelona.
Just because of this, he's divorcing her? Are you serious?
I couldn't care less about you.
It's easy to wound feelings.
A wife accuses her husband of disloyalty.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
The girl who doesn't respect the world's differences doesn't belong with us.
This time she mocked Messi.
Problems between married couples happen, and we should assume they do.
Uniform allowance: AFN 1,000
The girls are so many , and I wish for one unit .
O daughter of men, heed my words.
But I really don't want to hear anything anymore.
And I said to you, kindly do not let this boy in, and I know him very well.
We told you not to enter.
Right now I'm getting angry at you
Don't you worry, Mom. Don't give it a second thought.
Uniform allowance: AFN 1,000
Why are you bothering me?
But every time her word comes to mind
Real Madrid is better than Barcelona.
Present, my love.
Poor thing, what's wrong with her?
Hi, this girl's name is Asmaa Mona.
I married Shahr and divorced.
And even if I go tell them, why did you ask? I'd die laughing.
Sure, we want what's best for you.
What kind of benefit could there possibly be, Mother, with a man who divorced his wife over a soccer team?
The hairdresser, whom I know, told me the whole story, Mom. Don't get me involved with him, I don't want to be in a mess with someone like that.
And you're canceling the authorization for these incompetent hairdressers.
Do you know how they are told that I do not agree?
Let her mumble and say whatever she wants.
Good oh!
Tell her, tell her, my daughter, not to cut off her livelihood.
If it's her destiny to be struck down, then let her be struck down.
But I will sever her livelihood and ours along with it.
This building
He never tells me no.
May Allah suffice me against this awful hairdresser, the one with the long hair and the chatter.
They just hear and spread the rumour.
Don't worry about her.
Understand her and tell her not to shut the door of goodness that's opening for us.
Ahwaa ya3ref eshloon ye2na3aha
You're not awake, are you? So now you believe the guy divorced his wife because she insulted Barcelona?
Get rid of your nonsense and don't go crazy.
Don't let the opportunity slip away from you.
And he gave it to her, that's the reason. There was something wrong with her that made him divorce her.
Listen to me, oh daughter of men, do not give up on Bu Burjien.
What's up the two towers
But those close to them are about to discover they're twins.
That's why they called him Shahin, father of two towers.
May God bless you.
Oh nonono, sweet thank you very much.
Oh, thank you very much!
His long life has already been requested, you have signed, and the money has already been spent.
Your Highness is not focused, and it's evident that you have many engagements. This has been going on since last month.
That was from the first wedding month. This is a whole new wedding. Abdullah divorced.
And before that he was married and divorced.
Yes, by Allah, this is the third wedding feast now.
And that's the story, my friend. Sum it up.
Oh, my friend, this is a tricky generation.
The View and the Counter-View
Bilmubārak bilmubārak ya yamma
Oh my, don't forget — the fur is yours, I put it on top of the bag.
So you can hold it in your hand while you're on the plane.
I've found Londoners.
Oh Dad, aren't you guys ever going to London?
Hello, Mom!
I'm done.
So she can come with us and do some shopping while she's at it
Malaysia Malaysia
Malaysia Take the fur with you
Goodbye, Mom.
She's fine now.
I don't know.
This is it, right in front of your eyes. Ask her, I don't know what's going on.
What's the matter with you, Mom? What's wrong?
She's so fine, I didn't even give her the time of day.
A girl from Ahia
It should be the honeyed month, gazing at you with her eyes, serving you with her hands and lips.
Is it conceivable that she's standing while you're pouring water?
Don't pick up the cup in front of you, it will make you drink.
Only she wasn't raised well.
My mother brought me into this world and she fed me with her own hands.
She's fine like this.
She looks really sad.
And this one is with who?
Hi, this girl's name is Mesa'al.
Poor thing, she's off on her honeymoon.
I won't get ahead of myself if I wait for you to make the first move.
May God bless you, thank you Auntie.
I would recommend your aunt to be your step-mother-in-law.
I only know that Mom booked our trip, but I don't know where we're going.
Hi Mom!
Mom, where did you book for us?
Because she wants to come with us.
There is no might and power except by Allah.
Why did he do that at the airport and why did he take the kids?
What happened between them?
Now you're asking me, how would I know what's going on between them?
And Allah knows the parting is hard.
Where's my money?
She's talking to herself in her room.
Now she tells us she's been calling him for two days, but his phone is switched off.
So far, all she's caught is a cold.
This is us waiting to see what's going on.
He's exhausted from the outside, poor thing, and just wants a place to rest.
Mom, every day I tell her to peel the apples for me and she never does. Every day she annoys me.
Then you know I don't like apples with their skins on.
What a beautiful apple peel.
I tell you.
You are divorced.
and once when needed
Go, the object of my sight!
I sacrifice myself for you.
O my mother, O Munira, what's wrong?
Why are you upset?
Say 'divorced' three times
Hush, the one who spares you.
My mother saw me at the disco in Spain and ran away.
It's true, he has no clue.
It's true, he's clueless.
She dances two or three dances.
Then may he who shoots my daughter marry her, I swear!
How do you let go?
Come where are you going?
Where are you going? I'm off to cool my liver with this shameless guy.
And it has a tail like a peacock's.
Adorned with gold, ruby, coral and diamonds.
And the daughters of the people are but a plaything for you and your son.
They don't even have mothers to mourn for them.
The ones you're ridiculing with her
And let loose against them whatever you wish.
I haven't drunk her water, but if she's divorced Barcelona, then let her go.
The one who's going to the dance hall
No shame whatsoever.
Minister's proxy, born Arabs and Muslims.
He was accused by his reputation and the reputation of his offspring.
Come closer and don't move.
Please have a little humanity.
My father's right.
Is there anyone selling a plot of land like this?
Bu Saqr, he took it by force from my father.
And why did your father sell her?
God guides you, Bin Saqr. If he sets his eye on someone, no one can tell him no.
Leave it to fate, my friend.
Hey there, come on in! Welcome, welcome!
O Allah, O Allah
Go for it Saad, regarding your project!
Put your hand on it.
Zayn, you didn't say last week that you were going to the office.
I told you, if you want your project to succeed, you gotta get cracking and grease the wheels.
Bousouq, this multi-millionaire with a long history of success.
There's no one in this world who doesn't eat.
This isn't an issue, don't worry. We'll feed him, fill his belly and stuff him so full he won't be able to move. The problem is how we're going to get him to eat.
You must know the key of Bo Saqr to open the doors for you.
Met him during Umrah, have greeted him several times.
No need to know, as long as you spray it'll work out for you, you just need to know the right opportunity.
I'll tell you, as soon as the secretary told me that Bu Saqr is waiting for you for dinner.
All along I knocked and waited.
This is Bou Saker, may God protect him, who cooks dinner every day.
O one dinar!
Does he like the gathering with his friends?
Oh, how beautiful it is to sit in this farm late at night
Oh, that's Bu Nasser, the car dealership just behind the complex.
May you live long, I'd like to get to know you.
Take the license
My son is the one who got the license.
May Allah bless you.
Congratulations on getting your license, Falcon.
May Allah bless you.
His Highness Sheikh
I beg you, don't make me wait for an answer. Say "done"!
Just say "done" and it shall be done.
A gift from me to him.
And the one who brought me here will not send me back.
My love.
That's normal? You just met him and told him what you wanted?
You're still not a novice.
Anytime, my dear Abu Nasser.
Tell me how you did it, then.
Fate has served me well.
And we were sitting with him.
Good luck to Waleed, may he get his license.
My gift is a falcon.
If about the car.
Manageable.
Get up, get up my world.
I got it.
He left the hospital.
I had my tonsils removed.
Of course, he'll make dinner.
The boy Salem deserves peace, Your Highness.
May you only be rewarded for your efforts and remain in good health. May you never encounter any harm or evil, God willing.
We met at the rosary shop.
I think, by God.
Oh my, we've grown up, we've forgotten.
They said the room where your son Shahin was, has become available.
I said I'd pay you a visit.
And I congratulate you, Islahame Shahin.
There's certainly goodness in you. Listen here, my tall friend, you're not leaving without having dinner with us.
I'm not in the mood for it.
You said it'd be done before.
On the occasion of the release of our dear Shahin from the hospital.
The tower in my building on the corniche
Done deal.
O mother, don't be stubborn!
I don't like trade nor am I inclined towards it.
Whoever, in these times, starts a business with no capital
In the agency of vehicles and loaders, but he says he gestures.
Love from God and people who love you because your father loves you.
Even the university
All the doctors love and cherish your father.
And three-quarters of them spend every night with him in the mealis.
May Allah be praised, your father is loved by everyone. You just need to nod.
O mother, people borrow from banks to start companies or businesses.
I'm sitting in the assembly.
The opening rent of the shop
Something new is coming.
This is the falcon that my eyes beheld yesterday. He told me to try them on.
Just took their agency contract yesterday.
That's how I roll.
And my mother said: "All the merchants love you. May Allah make His creation love you too."
Yes, Your Highness.
I'm on my way to the office now.
I saw a new supermarket.
They're getting it ready.
I really liked it a lot.
My mother is from Lahijan.
Congratulations Uncle Saqr, congratulations!
May God bless you.
In the name of God In the name of God
What does he come in and take it cool as ice?
It's you who can say "no" right now.
What's the story?
He says he's fed up.
Show him.
You don't know who his father is
My father, may he rest in peace.
He told me: "I am Qassim, a friend of Abbas. He said you have a business."
I have a baker, thank God I earn my living from him.
I don't like the name.
I didn't notice it.
No, my brother, the name is not nice.
Sure, that's a suitable name for Iranian bread.
I found him at Grand Hotel.
We call it the Grand Bakery.
Wait a sec.
Peace be upon you.
Peace and blessings of God be upon you, Oh long-living one.
Excellent Excellent What else do you need? Do you want anything else?
All praise be to God, everything is perfect.
I say Iyad, this is a new employee of ours.
She has sent two cars for repairs and needs to take mine because she's an advertising representative for a company and can't afford to be without a car.
You might still need your car.
No, actually I don't need the car today.
O Allah, it doesn't matter.
This is the era of science, knowledge and learning.
I agree with Dr. Rashid. One must arm themselves with knowledge, no matter the article.
Well done, Dr. Sami!
Long live your life, O King.
Studying and more studying.
You're all just dogs who can't read.
No studies, no trade nor economy.
He never read a book, not even a newspaper. He never held a sheet of paper in his life.
You all know who the Falcon is today.
Although I really didn't want to enter this field of business,
His uncle, Bou Nasser, is standing right in front of you. He's very much alive.
From the bottom of my heart
There are people who are naturally inclined towards business and entrepreneurship.
You're right, Doctor.
Inshallah, we will see you soon, Shahin, and you will meet your brother.
Inshallah, Allah is Kind.
Too late.
Of course, this is subject to upbringing.
Go ahead, Doctor.
Honestly speaking...
How did a guy who hated trading become such a great economist?
The one they consider an enemy today, if a hundred billionaires were to be counted, would be one of them.
Do you know, O father of Falcon?
Saker was chosen for the Order of the Knight of the Market.
Peace be upon you.
How are you, Nasser?
Muhammad called me and said that Bu Nasser is admitted in the hospital.
I heard that Saqr, son of Bosqr, is trying to get the car agency from his father.
The agency has slipped through your fingers.
So true, a world that never gets satisfied.
The father helped him get into the market
And it was what opened his eyes to trade.
Honestly, the doctor says his condition is very severe.
Just like that it won't do.
There's nothing that cannot be.
Shattered, he returned, or else supported—that's not my job. I tell you, divorce her, divorce her, I mean it!
In the 21st century
And we meet dear viewers, with one of the men of goodness and generosity in this state.
A man who knew the path of the seeker and the deprived.
Of course we have the founder and owner of the Saker Charity Association with us.
Of course, if we were to discuss this association, Your Highness.
We all know your noble goals, which you strive to spread throughout the world and to everyone.
Without any hypocrisy, or desire for reward or fame, God forbid.
Recently, we were able to deliver thirty camels to our brothers in Africa. Alhamdulillah, Lord of the Worlds.
Also now, praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, we are preparing for delivery.
Seven boxes of sweets for our children in Gaza.
Mā shāʼ Allāh, may Allah increase the likes of you.
We left the house, me and the missus.
But the lady spends half an hour inaugurating her new project.
And I'm waiting for her.
It does not contradict.
Oh my god, I really love spending time with you, it's so much fun!
May my offspring be prosperous.
My whole life
It seems like you want to waste my time.
And beyond the problems
<b>Zen khobz haaar khobz haaar</b>

Whoever wants to dive into diving wants exhaustion.
I need a man.
Vivace Souq Waqif
You deserve it! You deserve it! Congratulations! Congratulations!
May God bless you.
Masha'Allah, everyone loves you, Shahin. May this love be a gift from Allah.
I want to say one thing, but first you tell me: "Go ahead!"
On the occasion of my son Shahin's license, tomorrow he will go to the agency and choose the nicest, most expensive car as a gift from me.
The breeze blows over us from the valley's opening.
O love, carry me back to my homeland!
Hi Fadi
How's everything going, Anoud?
No no no no no
Now you tell me the dress will be ready in a week, then you message me it'll be ready in ten days. You're so unreliable!
You want him to have a bit more water.
And hopefully now I'll have a nice long chat with Al-Anoud and ignore you.
Why are there so many Nur's around us?
Don't be upset, the world is still turning and so is Anoud.
They still want more, Fadi. They're jealous of you.
Ooh, their words are so flattering! It's not like our people, who are jealous of me. They're jealous of you.
The important thing is, don't forget the subject.
My dress is ready.
Please come in, Fadi.
Thank you very much, my brother Fadi.
My brother Fadi will drop by next week to pick up the dress. See you later, goodbye.
I'll serve you right away.
Just send me the dress to the house.
No, I didn't like it.
Masha'allah, I went to Fadi's store today; the girls were coming and going.
Praise be to God, we have succeeded in this project.
It will be after.
My cousin Nasser.
Healed him after
See the envy.
We have never heard of such a thing in this bankrupt project. Where would he get the money from?
It's invalid. I'll delete it.
And when I first started trading
Are you sure?
Hear me out, brother.
And hopefully you're planning to keep quiet about it.
Seven in the morning
I will bring you breakfast
I'm on the lookout.
Just wanted to talk to you
I heard about you
I'm planning to enter into a business venture.
But I'm over here and all this talk is over there. God, guide my cousin's son.
Designing women's fashion is designing something like this, for instance.
He's lying to you.
I am a commerce major.
La la la la, no no no, it's just me.
Do you need a consultation? I'm here for you. If you need any help, I'm your man.
Thank you, thank you, my dear cousin, you're the best!
Oh God, forgive me, I'm leaving.
Please, my uncle.
Or the first time you tell me if you want an increase.
Oh come on, Fadi, please arrange the place, it's so crowded. I can see that.
The shop doesn't have enough stock.
I said you could have the shop right next to you. Go ahead and take it.
Oh, how I wish!
The shop this one right here is the merchant's.
Is there a guy named Khalifa Sultan Al-Saifi other than your cousin, Bin Nasser?
No, it's not there.
I come from the Ministry of Economy. I saw his name on a transaction at a friend's place. His name is Essam, he's handling his papers.
Women's Fashion Design
Sure.
I see the rental contract and his name is written on it.
Heal her, oh please heal her.
Heal her, heal her, heal her. There's an omen in her.
May your sick heart never tire.
My project has dried up. It's successful.
I said I'd ruin it for him.
This is an open market for everyone.
Shash Bo Nasser
He says it's fascinating.
And when I feel your pulse, I'll tell you what they say: They say you're planning to start a project.
Dad, I didn't lie to you.
And help one another in acts of righteousness and piety.
fستين dahieh, you and your stuff
But you're just not my type.
Dad, these are the provisions. Each one takes their provision.
Reach out your hand.
At your service, you are all welcome.
Bo Saleh has really taken it too far now.
In Beatpy reach out your hand
Open to everyone
You are my brothers
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
Lebanese designer
I'm once and ask me.
Know our women well, they die in Lebanese.
O madam, this is your appointment No no, this is it, there's none like it in all of Doha.
Madam, this is not worth it; look at this sweet talk and this piece they're selling for thirty to forty thousand.
I saw a mouse.
The suppression I carried out last year, when I brought the Lebanese carpenter.
Madam, I will make for you a wardrobe that Doha has never seen.
Joe wants to succeed.
What's up exactly?
Why don't you know?
Customers are the source
What do you think, uncle? Let's go somewhere else.
Ava Ava Ya Fadi
And they play with their souls at that hour
It means we lost. No.
We must confront it.
And our customers are coming back against their will.
Okay, you pay.
I won't pay a dime.
I'm ready to do anything.
But the most important thing is that it doesn't defeat me.
Here's the dress you chose it costs sixty thousand EGP.
Definitely, those mentioned by name.
This is a gift from the designer, Moni.
And I put on it a bit of crystal. There are only fifty of these pills in the whole world. This pill is very special and unique.
Of course there is no discount. Our prices are well-known and global.
No, definitely not. Who would even do such a thing?
Moment moment madam what's going on?
O Saad, help us! O Saad, help us!
Hey, they do this work.
Slaughter us, we have no customers left at all.
Heidi Asma Harb ya Abu Nasser
And we're not keeping quiet about it.
We must fight them as they fight us and respond to them.
Tomorrow I will take a selfie from the bank.
And I will kindle a war against them, and I will show them no mercy.
It wasn't brought by Nasser's father.
Check out the ad.
Check out the ad I posted
We're giving away two evening gowns for free with every wedding dress.
He has four four evening gowns, with each gown belonging to a wedding.
We have placed a quarter-page ad.
Joey is taking up the top half of the page.
My mother lit it up.
Do you believe it, Um Nasser?
It's been six days since a customer entered their shop.
And now, at the time of Asr, I'm telling you they didn't open it even once. They locked it.
And if you hear that his shop is up for sale
I'll slaughter him. I'll slaughter him.
Even unable to sit, he sat outside.
Go to him, drink your tea.
O God, where am I going and where is the way going? This is the problem.
You're someone who's against me, you have something against me.
This is Allah's blessing. Someone deliberately sprayed the store with this smell.
These are chemical substances.
Are you sure someone sprayed in the store?
You are cousins, not siblings. Act like adults, not children.
Yea at night, the smell in the shop is foul. This is disgusting.
I didn't buy that, the smell is coming from you.
On the mistake
You have signed a commitment with the police.
Don't hesitate.
This time around, it's me.
He has devised a diabolical plan.
With no one able to pin anything on me.
No, by Allah, all matters are perfectly normal.
That's what's confusing me.
I have no idea what's going on. This is the fourth day now with not a single customer entering the shop.
You made me show my face at the second store, may God guide you.
What does the doctor say?
I see the shop turning yellow, not a single customer has entered.
I don't know if she's bewitched him.
Harem and girls are strictly prohibited from entering the premises.
He says he cast a spell on the designer Saad, turning him into a monster.
It's not far off. Don't rule anything out these days.
Magic does exist, that much is certain.
Is Zain sleeping or sitting right now?
Go in, my brother, go in, I'm afraid the roof will collapse
You lost, Sultan. You lost.
My mother sewed it.
He's a beast.
Calm yourself, my brother, and do not distress yourself.
I don't know what she did.
My boyfriend has taught me a lot. They say his friends collect money for him and pay off his debts.
The designer who has
Not Lebanese
You told him, you told him.
Mā ma ma ma, you have no idea where it went.
Haste haste the stars are present and these supporting actors are playing their parts.
Contact the royal again; maybe he has an engagement.
AA ya Aam Ahmad
Oh, come on, Ahmed! Why are you sitting here and leaving the clown to bother me? What do you expect me to do about it? And where are the extras you said you'd bring today?
Get away from me, it'd be better for you. I've already contacted him and my head hurts from the mere thought of it. Even asking Professor Abdullah is giving me a headache!
First of all, don't shout because we are actors and we need to be relaxed and focus on our roles. Secondly, the guy has called more than once right in front of me. He's very calm.
Snow Snow Snow What do you say, Mr. Abdullah? What do you say?
O professor Abdullah, o que eu faço? Essa idiota da Waati vai acabar a cena e me deixar na mão!
Oh come on, guys! Oh you beautiful people, next, next!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on, professor. We wanna finish, but this extra who's supposed to shoot the scene after us isn't here yet.
It's nice that no one yells at you.
Do your work calmly and without shouting.
And this is our condition; all day we shout, trying to focus.
I found a solution for you.
What's your opinion on that? I'll arrange myself in a scene like that, and God willing, I'll get you an actor who can do the role justice.
It's true, he's going to work on one scene.
But this scene is the most important scene in the series
Please upload the pictures.
But if you're not ready, I'll disband today.
Oh God, above the youth!
What do you think about a Filipino guy?
You don't know Bu Waleed. He's always breaking up with people. He tells them he wants someone who gives off a "cabaret" vibe; someone who's straight out of a cabaret, and he's from Qatar.
My lord, we'll put a ghutra on him, no one will even notice.
Alaa, are you being serious? You just want to boil eggs like that. This is a professional production; please show some respect for the audience's intelligence.
You're right, Ala'a is putting everything on your head. If he distributed the tasks, he'd have an easier time.
Give me a moment so we can think. Reyam, you might remember someone from our group of friends like this.
Who's turn is it?
Remember Ahmad al-Wahid in the neighborhood of Asltah, his name is Saud Iknar
Saoud Akhnar, no one else.
Saud's words are like cans
The joker said he wanted a rich guy with prestige. She told him: "Dream on, buddy!"
My love, in the end, is just an extra. He's the one who gives him a wealthy and prestigious role.
But a little makeup, they put it on, wear a fancy robe and a nice thawb, and drive a fancy car.
Inshallah it will be beneficial.
How will we get to him, then?
I show them the way to their homes.
Peace be upon you.
Saïd Ouali
Kid from this place
Ahoy ahoy!
Yes, thank you Dad, you didn't hold back.
Now how about this ghutra, Mom? The only one that my uncle brought back from his travels.
Dad, you only have that one [dress] which you make me wear.
Dad, the key is inside the wardrobe, under my clothes.
My friends are waiting for me at the door, Dad.
Oh God, may He help you, Dad!
Today they'll put you inside and film you for TV.
Oh mom, they said I'm gonna be on TV, I'm one of the biggies!
Sit down, you mangy dog
Come here, O son of a bitch. I spit on you.
Spray Spray
Mom, he's crazy!
As quickly as possible, Mom. Phew, just in time!
Inshallah, Dad.
God willing, God willing, but they give you some money.
May Allah help you.
O Allah, I pray that You bestow Your blessings upon me.
I brought you Saud's cans Saud's laptop
Peace be upon you.
As-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.
This is not 'Abd bin Fāṭima.
Hello Hello
Hello Saud
This is who's going to do the scene.
i hope hope they'll give him a good part, and he'll do well, so that they'll give you a longer one next time
Tell me how your mother is doing
It's not that easy to catch the first corner
Shame! Shame! Go away, you Saudi.
You've started wearing glasses.
The slave has gone grey.
And I regret recommending you.
The brother we've chosen to play the role of Abu Abdulaziz
O you who reach the high places, hello! Welcome! Oh, welcome!
This is our exit, Professor Ghalaf Fazal.
The most important thing is that you don't fear the camera.
My brother, I fear only God.
Just relax and follow the director's instructions to the letter.
O brother, O brother, please, are you playing the part of a rich guy or what?
Come here, my boy. Come here, my boy.
I am talking to you
This is too light. We need someone heavy for this role.
Everything is acceptable to some people.
Ask me why I haggle over every single detail.
Dad, she's taking pictures. Listen, I'll take you to the makeup room now and show you the way to the set.
Shame! Shame! Shame!
Please come.
She's back.
Bas bas bas 'Inda'k 'inda'k
Welcome, oh welcome! Please come right in!
My teachers, the car you requested for the scene is ready.
Saoud is cleaning everything that's out of order.
I'll repeat the chorus once again and the assistant director is here to hear you and he'll go and reassure him.
Imagine yourself as the merchant of old.
You say hi.
I'm telling you, be patient, don't be hasty. I never expected this from you, Abu Abdulaziz. You're Abu Abdulaziz, right?
On our rights
Sweet and know.
My brother came back to brush his teeth.
Boabdulaziz Faleh Al-Marzouk
Sweet, done and considered.
And I consider your daughter to be divorced.
What made you divorce her?
Your daughter is divorced Sweet, she's sweet.
It's really nice, go on and consider it done.
Why don't I tell him 'Ptooey on you'
Perfect! God, you're just perfect! May Allah send prayers and peace upon the Prophet, the sweet one.
Toothpaste cleans my teeth.
How are you, what's up?
My lords, the house owners have woken us up. They want the hall in the passageway where we film the scenes taking place in the hall. Then we'll shoot the exterior scenes.
How come they don't want?
Yes, they do want to, but they're postponing a bit. They're filming a different scene first, and we'll follow them soon, hopefully.
I'll make them bring it to you right away.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you.
Good morning, Your Highness.
Hello, it's you, my son!
I am Salem Bushu'a, the Communist.
And the Al-Shuwa'is are well-known.
You deserve it.
I'd like to get my nose done, and my lips augmented right here.
Come on, you guys with the weak noses!
I wanted myself
If it weren't for you, someone else would have died of laughter.
He wants to barbecue.
O my dear mother
My mom is feeling unwell right now. I have to go see her ASAP, dude.
The moment's fleeting, off you go in your attire like that.
May I tell you that my mother is ill and tired, he says.
Hear me out. You can go like this, but when I call you, you'd better come back ASAP.
I am unable to knock down the location.
Okay, okay. I'll hail a taxi, geez.
A taxi, if you searched here and stayed for a year searching for a taxi, you still wouldn't find one.
This car we have rented for the scene.
It's a sin that she's standing still, go into her.
Oh yes, my brother, please, I wish you'd give me one. My mother is sick. Please, give me a switch! Give it to me!
In the car
I want a chair.
Right away, I'll send you a chair immediately, O sheikh.
I'll tell you, I'll tell you.
Tell you my mom is tired, God knows, in the car. I'd like a chair, God willing.
Where's the one who wants to get in the car?
Oh dear father, what's happening?
Shhh, don't say a word, just listen.
Peace be upon you.
There's nothing, but my mother, your aunt, is having an asthma attack.
Let them bring out the bed.
Mashi Mashi
Don't worry at all.
Hasbi Allah 'alayka, what have you done?
Praise be to God, Ya Rashid.
Save our boy Rashid.
You are commanded to follow me, Sir Roshdan.
Please join him, Mr. Rashood.
I'll take care of Professor Rashood.
This is the trustworthy one among you.
I'll ask the nurse to take your blood pressure and see what you'd like to drink.
Please come in, Professor Rashood.
‏ About you
We will make many people wait.
No one's giving us any attention, mom.
Sir, Snow wants to leak the new Coffee CapGen.
It's not just you, that secret photographer at the hospital, the one with the Filipina girlfriend, isn't it?
And who told you I was refusing?
But not a single one is giving me the time of day.
Philosophizing is not a prerequisite.
But those without a certificate I don't want your mom, what do I want with your mom? Go find your gang.
My brother, there's a girl in the hospital who I really like.
Oh, I'm not giving you any attention. Look for someone else.
My heart is attached.
Your brother studied medicine and fell in love.
I love Dr. Mohamed.
It's Snow in June
O Allah, grant him ease.
By God, on this Halloween!
Her aunt is in perfect health.
You're a professional actor, Saud. Next, please!
Oh, what a compliment! They clapped and praised you so beautifully.
Go now, change your clothes and wash off your makeup.
O son of the lawful, let go of that and come sign me here first.
Yes indeed, from this day forward my name is Faleh Al-Marzooz.
Forget this talk and write Saud.
Sa'ud is dead.
From now on, my name is Faleh Al-Marzooz bin Abdulaziz
May God bless you, my dear.
One buffet.
Sweet two.
I heard one of the bride's relatives say, "God, these people are so sophisticated, I don't think anyone could pull off what they did for the wedding."
Honey, goodbye. See you later.
Oh my mom
I need to take them something for the engagement party.
What is it, Mom?
See your brother who embarrasses us.
And he embarrassed him, because he brought shame.
Just as long as it suits us.
Let the servants eat this.
He wants to leave us hanging.
Tell me it's Zain what I saw
This type of free classic is for the high society folks.
Across the Mediterranean Sea
No, we want something extraordinary; something not everyone can buy.
Forgiveness, my lady, is for those who do not know you, for they are the ones who truly ignore you. You, with your long life of command.
Just shut up, you know nothing!
I'm afraid my money won't be enough.
Don't embarrass us, go withdraw with the card.
Oh oh oh, this is so elegant, God!
Yesterday, Saleh took shelter.
Saleh Nasser
Good news! Good news!
I'm coming to you, Abha.
Booking the small hall and catering for the parrots.
<h1> Ferry Trip </h1>
The Lām al-Laam that she spoke of regarding the wedding at Beit Isaid.
Sure everyone says the same thing.
That's what scares me.
My dear sister
I'm just sitting here waiting for the money.
And he didn't care about what people were saying.
He wants to leave us hanging.
But it's supposed to be something suitable for us and our circumstances.
You know that some people borrow money or even sell their homes and cars just to throw a lavish wedding, so that people will talk about them.
You just get out of the picture. The only thing sufficient and satisfactory is the pocket which almost made us ashamed.
You yourself said the manager liked the tray and took it home.
The groom's side, Zein, said: "You choose the venue and the wedding arch, and prepare everything yourselves."
And hopefully we will choose anything.
It doesn't mean anything, but the shop we went to yesterday had very reasonable prices.
This is the shop that did the wedding for the Al-Zuhair's house yesterday.
Did anyone use it before?
Honestly, just once.
His Highness the Prince's marriage is announced.
La la la, we don't want anything second hand!
My dad's couch. We're the first people in the world to use one.
You want to stand out.
Rawi, what have you got for me?
This couch is my first attempt at cooking Qatar.
Inspired by the informative verses, namely Facebook and Twitter
Evening conversation
The price of the Hulkouche with accessories was stunning.
Hello, I've calculated it for you; it's **125,000**.
Mom, mom, this won't be enough for our money. Everything has to be classier, better and more distinctive. All of this costs a lot of money.
Everyone does that.
Shut up or I'll kill you.
What's the decision?
What do you like about it?
This is the Ark of Noah.
At your ease, the two of them are ancestors, but the couch is Noah's Ark's most expensive item at twenty thousand.
And oh my god, may God have mercy on your parents' souls, I say the fancy couch is way better, honestly.
Hush, you're not getting on Noah's Ark.
These are the weddings and these are their costs. We consider ourselves average people.
The wedding ceremony area costs 150,000 and the reception area you booked is called the "Royal Hall", also 150,000.
What we said was not a magic wand, but why do appearances matter so much? Everyone's trying to outstare everyone else, and everyone wants to do better than the other.
Battle of appearances, only wedding shop owners benefit from it.
Those who know that everyone wants to stand out exploit and cheat us.
I know a guy whose brother runs a wedding shop.
He says the couch costs 2000 riyals.
O Lord, I swear by Allah, her father would never agree.
That's it, kid, you're done.
As others before you have done, young men have married and provided.
Welcome, O sheikhah. May you live a long life.
How's it going?
I know you love excellence.
That's why I'm telling you.
For the first time in Qatar, designed by world-renowned artist Peter Salmo.
The nine planets' composition.
From the solar group
<html> <body> <p dir="RTL">مع كوشة سفينة نوح بيطلع شي كتير حلو</p> </body> </html> <br> <br> becomes in English: <br> <br> <html> <body> <p>With Noah's Ark couch it turns out really nice</p> </body> </html>
Harmony, you are the first person in Qatar to ever use the Nine Planets.
That's it, kid.
It was fifty thousand and now it is zero.
Any salvation?
May Allah Grant You Peace of Mind.
At your service.
They are expenses, my brother.
Generally, I couldn't scrounge up all eighty of them.
All I could manage was sixty thousand and twenty thousand of them I borrowed from my brother
You didn't hold back, you didn't hold back at all, my brother Fahd.
O come on, Fahad, come on! As long as we keep boasting and showing off at the wedding, we're in deep trouble!
No show-off, no bravado.
Surely, the cards you wish for will reach you.
iNshallah this week we'll start with the cards.
If our wedding turns out to be more beautiful than theirs.
Oh my god, look at the cards your son is making for the wedding!
Where does your brother live?
People now travel to other countries just to take wedding card photos.
The trustworthy house of Amina went to Italy, designed the cards, had them printed and brought them back.
They went to France, even those who don't have a lot of money, they go to Lebanon, get their cards and come back.
After the country goes like this, they want us to obey the rules?
Wherever you wish to go, Inshallah.
That's a lot of awesome cards, Jafnah.
It's really expensive though.
Just outstanding, no one has done it before us
My dress isn't pretty.
I say gold shines.
Oh brother, since he can't afford the wedding expenses.
He got himself involved from the very beginning.
And he left us this haughtiness and ostentation at weddings, and the expenses that are of no use.
And the only ones benefiting from our mental illness are these hotels and wedding venues
Ooh, the poor thing is coming.
Let me go and get him. It's not right that he might not find anyone to take him.
Hey there, welcome!
You're very kind, Nasser.
My brother, the bride's family should really be supporting you.
But I've only been once, just once.
I say it doesn't have to be a huge hotel banquet hall.
And we found her on the street, others aren't better than her.
This problem, everyone is watching everyone.
And who told you I got married?
At least some people don't have this arrogant attitude.
It's just a simple party and we'll spend according to our budget.
And then, my friend, these days people are holding Facebook wedding parties.
Least expensive and low cost.
Does that mean you're not married to your homeland?
Forget you wanting me here
The text you provided is Arabic. Here is its translation: The return of 'Ad
If I don't find a place for my son Abdullah's wedding, then it'll be at Nawal's.
Omg, I hope she doesn't look better than me!
I say my love.
Madame, Waledj has Aroweed's number. Give it to us, let's call him.
Okay, my love. See you later. Goodbye.
Didn't we agree with mom on DJ Asheleh? You changed your mind, huh?
Mom's vision is better than mine.
You forgot who she is and who we are.
The ones less than us become better than us.
The subject isn't like that at all. It's just that my brother Saleh breaks my heart, and we don't want to pressure him.
It broke my heart wide open.
Oh, what a delight!
In my hospital any hospital
My mother suddenly fell upon us.
I heard that talk, may it fall on us.
He's got no story. Can't blame him after I prepared everything and everyone started saying he didn't want a wedding.
He wants us to fail.
The difficulties Dr.
He wants to call off the wedding, my dear sister.
Inshallah, all will be good.
Do not break her heart
O mom, you're the man who brings in the money
Soul, soul, wind her heart.
And Allah, if I said this to my Joseph, his heart would stop.
You know, Minister, that's why I still have Boyوسف around.
By the way, you know what? Eko should have retired three or four years ago.
There's nothing wrong with him helping me.
No, by God, you're not sane!
You understood that I'm breaking up with him now.
And let him keep the documents and records until you get your money back.
This is called overcooling
When John speaks, I don't know why, why are you so afraid?
There's nothing wrong with it, and anyway, I'll return the amount in the end.
Do you know what they call me? Do you know what they call me?
The disciplined member
Uncle, uncle, I tried, but there's no other way.
I gave you a high five after the audit.
And their condition is: Hurry up, please! ASAP!
As fast as the grain by grain by grain.
The entire bean.
Hopefully, we'll be in the hall from 7:30 onwards to welcome the guests.
We'll definitely be there.
I'm throwing a wedding for my son, it'll be the talk of the whole Doha.
Surprise!
Honey, my dear Fatima, I want to talk to you.
I'm afraid for you, my son. They might envy you if you walk into their midst like that, dressed in your best.
Oh, mom, the beauty of this robe is so elegant!
The police are coming.
O Allah, make it a good one.
6 conditions, you guys stay here, I'll come to you.
May Allah suffice me against you, Salah.
Your marriage is null and void.
The marriage cage feels like a prison now.
And they found the papers I hid regarding your loan. Come on, now they got it into their heads and are chasing me.
And why are you annoying yourself?
You hear much bigger horrors than these.
Back to Shanguol.
A dedicated and honorable employee.
The ministry loves its job. It has contracted a company to perform maintenance.
The employee, out of his diligence, inquired about the materials.
Found it for 400,000 Ariels
The text translates to: It saves the Ministry one million six hundred thousand.
The minister will punish him. No, no, I don't believe this talk.
Why don't you believe me?
Here he is, Saad has arrived.
He surely has all the news.
Fire him.
What's happening in the world? Where are the values?
Did he not tell you to contact his office manager?
Let's replace Osman with Khaled.
And it is forbidden thereafter.
The daughter of the manager of the same company that submitted the maintenance offer.
And Osman unmasked them.
No, no, no, it's unbelievable!
You're full of wonder, Saleh.
The company is his, basically.
Who has it?
Thus we became.
What do you say?
What's up with this poor employee, Othman? What did he do wrong?
His sin is being an honest and dedicated employee.
The director is now in his office.
It's urgent.
Healed her world
We saw some strange shapes.
I'm with you, Othman doesn't deserve it, but there's nothing we can do.
It is haram, may he live long, he has seven children and doesn't have a passport.
He's got nowhere to go now, poor guy. His job's gone up in smoke. Where on earth can he stick his hat?
Have you seen what happened?
The minister's newly appointed employee
Othman's desk Poor Othman kept insisting on taking his belongings. She said, "Go, and I'll have your things sent to you with the attendant."
Where is he now?
The scales have tipped, O Uthman!
This is the end.
Inshallah
And we place our trust in Allah.
God is kind, O Othman. God will not leave you, God willing. Goodbye.
Hopefully, there's no harm done, but your voice doesn't sound normal.
I know, I know, you're very sensitive.
I really don't feel like going in today. I'm leaving.
And I'll stop by my mom's on the way to get your stuff.
I don't want you to keep treating me like this.
What's wrong with you? Why are you shouting at me? I'm your mother!
I'm not shouting, I'm asking you.
Shenoua, it's okay for you to install on your computer the software your father-in-law, or your brother-in-law recommended.
The world has changed. Where do you live?
I don't know, Mom.
You're not sane, are you?
People have liberated the cosmos, the world has become a small village. Where do you live?
But I say unto you
Be up-to-date and live in the moment, don't lag behind!
Put the bags down quick! Come on, stop staring and close your mouth!
What's wrong, Saleh? Are you okay?
You're not yourself today.
So I shouted at the maid, who wasn't to blame.
I had no choice, swear to God.
La la la it's not the same
To forget the horrors I have seen
My love, there's no Akrai
Dad's in a foul mood today.
Your Highness, we are delighted.
Thank you so much, you've done more than enough.
And work hard with diligence and perseverance
True, peace!
The most important thing
The most important thing for me in this ministry is
Yes, Your Highness.
Tell me the benefits of the employee who doesn't take bribes.
It's useless.
That's why I need all of you.
There is no place here for the loyal, the principles, and the outdated values.
If I ever discover
He has only himself to blame.
We are not blamed for doing what's right.
That's why I need you to cooperate with me.
If you doubted.
Tell me straight.
Thieves and the children of thieves, and of course our sisters too.
Noura, if one day she doesn't take a bribe, she'll be late for work at the government office.
Masha'Allah, Masha'Allah! Well done! This is exactly what we expect from all of you. I don't want it any other way; each and every one of you should do the same.
May Allah bless you.
That's why I want you to leave the Procurement department and become my executive assistant.
Honestly, you chose well. You placed the right thief in the right spot.
That's enough, Mother of Saud. Please, don't torture me anymore.
I didn't put you in jail.
But I seek refuge in God from Satan, the one who tempted me and made me view honesty as desirable.
And he said: "Be trustworthy."
You're a real man among men.
Truthfulness and loyalty
You have lived your entire life as a thief, and been comfortable doing so.
It became honorable of you.
Let me talk to your father.
I will bear it and repeat it again.
One who walks his path, taking bribes, being deceitful, will live a stress-free life.
My dad is in jail because all his money is haram.
Just shut up.
This is not clothing you'd wear.
We are a respectable family.
It's not shameful for you.
Where is Tangier?
Why isn't it unveiled?
Do you not feel shame? Not a shred of it!
I'm embarrassed to wear my brother's clothes.
These days, she's too shy to be alone.
What's wrong with you, are you shouting?
My fluffy daughter
In a respectable unit she dresses like this
Inshallah you walk in the street with nothing of your body showing.
I wanted her to listen to me.
And I'm not doing her any wrong.
Dad, get her those see-through clothes that are totally unnecessary.
Beware, if I see you wearing anything below the knees, I mean it.
He who has been warned has been forewarned.
We are coming, God willing.
Inshallah bas la3ab w sarseer
He's the spitting image of his father.
I see it in front of you.
Honestly, he's a great guy. Where can we find someone like him?
My dear uncle, I am black-faced.
And yes, the Riyal is the truth. My daughter Sarah, whom I cherish a lot, her future is very important to me.
Don't they have heard about it?
Praise be to God, her hearing is terrible.
I enter the house at 3:30 in the morning.
Wow, Mashallah, you're up at 5 a.m.!
Iyo Iyo, shنو n-w-
Come get me from the bar
Start your engine, rev it up, and come pick me up at the bar.
Oh, I've never seen Abu not listening to his son's advice before.
Oh God, Dad, let's not mess around. Fire up your engine, we're waiting for you!
Merry Christmas, I love you.
I love you too, I have disappeared, disappeared, disappeared.
Basically, my dad's basically here.
‏ He exhausts me.
It's not the same as my father's kharboota, it doesn't give the same taste.
Introducing you to my boyfriend, Majed.
It's not Abdulaziz, it's that boyfriend before him.
Welcome, come on in! Great opportunity for some weed.
And the Arab and Israeli satellites
I found out that many Palestinians don't trim their nails
As committed by the State of Palestine in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement
Generally, the United Nations is meeting today to decide on Israel's request to send special teams to inspect the Palestinians' fingers.
If their nails are long or not.
There was a condition that nothing in Palestine should annoy, hurt, or make people bleed.
State of Palestine
I invite the entire international community to visit Palestine.
Comprehensive Peace Agreement
We make them out of cork.
The walnuts, my friend.
We're pressing olives this way this way we're pressing olives.
We and our Arab brethren demand the international community
We're doing inspections on Palestinians' nails.
And now we start the voting.
No, no, absolutely not!
In the name of God, the Most Merciful.
Saleh, what's wrong with you?
I dreamed of a place.
I dreamed of an upside down world.
O Rashid, your personality must be strong
Right now, the school I'm going to start working at tomorrow is number ___.
I am a teacher like you.
Why hasn't my school changed since I started teaching?
Who are you referring to, bro?
The problem is that his personality is weak.
By the way, it's the teachers who have a degree with him who protested against him.
To this extent, my brother.
I don't see him keeping quiet.
After he explained
It's not supposed to have mayonnaise at all.
Yo brother, we're not telling you this so you'd be upset.
We're telling you this because this is the last chance.
And I accepted Rashid, although his personality is weak.
Shaky and overly kind.
No matter what, this is a local boy.
Why are you staying silent now, my brother?
Because everything you say is true
All your words are true.
From tomorrow.
Professor Rashid Al Yidid
Professor Rashid
May Allah bless your tongue.
Forget it already.
And from tomorrow
That's not fair.
Here I am telling you
I am a teacher, I dislike mistakes.
If your son told you what the little boy told you at the primary school, and the inspector was sitting there, too.
Take your bag.
Slowly, slowly, I broke down the door.
Finally, one has learned from his mistakes.
From the very first minute
Here I am telling you
I am angry.
I'm chill.
Hush now, Zain.
Janna said, "Be quiet, Zain."
I heard it's you.
He said Professor Rashid threw me out.
Ava Jana said, "Oh God, that's so beautiful!" But I don't want to see your face here in this line.
I don't know which boy that is.

There is a Professor Rashid coming.
Here we come towards you

And in the end, Adam's son is just human.
It's only you who shouted at me.
A quarter of them joked around, bantering with me.
My dad's traveling, he'll be back next week, and when he returns I'll tell him.
No, no, Abdulrahman! And may God deliver you!
We're the ones It's raspberry ice cream - it's really tasty. You probably haven't tried it. It's amazing, you should get some.
Oh God, go get her quickly!
All he's afraid of is that he'll tell his dad
You didn't say his father was travelling.
I am a traveler, my father's daughter. My father's done with him; they've disowned him. They say, send him away.
God willing, it will be fine.
He took his bag and gave it to him, and gave him your phone number, telling him to call you if he needs anything. You're his friend.

Just what?
You're the ones who told me

Put them on the table.
All people are equal.
That's why I gathered you all here today, to hear your visions for the event.
Can anyone guarantee him a welcome?
Oh, Ball! You've caused us so many problems. This is the last straw!
3 o'clock
To my dear friend, sugar is joking around, by Allah.
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Peace be upon you.
Stand up for the inspector. Sit down.
Yes, sir!
O professor, venha aqui, venha!
He's upset now.
Didn't mean to laugh, my friend. I was just asking if you were done talking.
Did you finish it or not? Where's the teacher's prestige in that? You're mocking yourself, you're disgracing the profession of teaching.
Enough, enough, it's done, it's done.
I'll raise my voice even more.
I'll raise my voice, you'd better first find out who this boy's father is.
Hurry up! Hurry up!

Abu Nasser used to do this, and not do this.
May Allah make it easy for him.
I am the manager here.
It's well known as Bonaser.
He was giving all the teachers his own notes.
But as for me,
From the director, here.
You are the manager, God bless you. What's wrong with you?

You've put her on a pedestal, brother.

No need, really. I swear, honestly, I just want to help you out.
What's his name again?
You're with me in the end.
Mind your own business or you'll get a taste of my fingernails, whether you like it or not!
Get out, I'm telling you, get out!
Inshallah we go out.
How are you, young man
I have to put him in his place.
Hold on, everyone, hold on.
Don't blame us, Abu Salmeen
O Bonayef, you are the elder of the neighborhood, and I must put him in his place.
I am not my father's son
I I'll show you I
Hurry hurry!
With peace and long life.
Masha'allah! When did you buy this new car?
It's you who didn't believe me.
Beard days and his face is turning red
Do you believe it? When he came upon us, I didn't recognize him at first. I only knew it was him by his voice.
You know that from next week we're moving him out.
Responsible for eight schools, both boys and girls.
The magic word is "Alakazam"
Here I told you from the very first day
While I explain, I hear not a sound.
And We revealed not unto them any Scripture before it, [but] unto Moses the Book of Insight, a guidance and a mercy; that thereby they might believe in the Meeting with their Lord, and that they might fear Him.
Respect yourself.
Get out, you who hesitates! Go away! Out, out, out!
As soon as the decision to appoint you as a minister is issued, I'd appreciate it if you could find me a nice position.
Any hacker who says they can get the job done, come and take this position!
Oh, my [beloved one], give me several job options and I will choose the most suitable one from them.
My brother is a minister.
Indeed, I am not at ease with the calls I have been receiving.
Mā shāʼ Allāh, everyone congratulates.
They say O my mother, may Allah protect him.
This is a normal thing; every minister brings in their friends and associates automatically.
From this aspect, rest assured. Don't worry, nice to meet you too. You're welcome.
Of course, you know I'm becoming a minister.
Vishwanath is a painter.
The best is yet to come, the treasure's about to unfold for us.
The Land of Return
Oh Allah, everyone has gone to congratulate the new Minister.
Oh God, oh God, oh God.
Congratulations Minister!
His Highness, long may he live, congratulations!
Congratulations on your Minister's Watch. You deserve it!
The minister deserves it.
Oh, my brothers, the responsibility is great. May God, hopefully, give us the ability to bear it.
As the saying goes: A lucky coincidence.
You left right after I told you Saleh's phone was ringing.
It was a bit far from him.
Don't pay any attention to him.
That's the love that suddenly descended upon him.
And the boss Sultan is not easy.
I opened the car door for him.
Well done! You didn't hold back.
Waiting for our brother to become a minister
I told you so, Mom. You didn't believe me.
You keep saying "café talk", "café talk".
After her husband died she said it was me she had always loved.
God knows best. God knows best.
I have nothing to say to you.
Oh my, get up, let's go. You're bursting my gallbladder, get up!
I intend for no one to have anything to do with it.
Relax, you.
I just sent them an offer because they annoyed me.
They're right.
But I didn't want to say that in front of my mother. You know how mother can embarrass us.
Anything you hear, don't spread it around. That's called "meshkhala" and we don't want any trouble.
Zain, I guarantee it. If they remove him, they'll put you in his place.
Because I asked
If it's lifted, you'll be the first one nominated.
I guarantee they will remove it.
This one I am certain of.
Sure, here it is: It's all right, I see him just like I see you standing here now.
He's doing magic for it.
But the plan in my head is foolproof and efficient.
The line of hunger and exhaustion
I make him ban all activity in the country.
That's the moment when he'll burn. And when the burning comes, the urge will come too. And when the urge comes, the burden will be lifted.
I swear, brother, I have no idea. I don't know what to tell you.
Your departure is called "masharek ta'efek", which reflects how much you love the country.
That's how you see it?
You are now a statesman, you have to be in the picture.
I must contribute to everything. Please forgive me, Your Highness. Please forgive me.
Before I forget, thank you for the sheep you sent me yesterday.
His Highness, this is just a mere sheep, not fit for your status, oh yes it is. Would you deign to accompany me today?
The Royal awaits you outside.
You know, to tell the truth.
I don't want to go
I'm so over being the third wheel. I'm done.
You are the justice minister today. He corrected his statement and agreed with him that you are a social character and a lucky person.
God has made this good dirham available to you
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Imagine me not.
Give it give it.
Today I went to an evening party and a wedding. If it doesn't work out, it's like trying to pound split peas into a purée.
I also have something nice for you. I want you to take it there.
Hear me out, I've arranged an amazing educational activity for you.
That's how I want it to shine. I want it to shine, shine, shine until it's polished to perfection.
The shop owner, may he be congratulated, congratulated. Congratulations on the blessed bike. Oh, the Minister's messenger, give him a picture, give him a picture. Not me, not me, I'm far away. Give him a picture.
This cycle
Congratulations on the inauguration. May the Minister's endeavours be blessed.
A picture, a picture of you, so slim and lovely, throughout all your life.
No thanks to you all.
See the second page.
He doesn't know it.
National participation
Remembering Allah
This is the fourth friend of mine calling me today
Everyone praises your activities, O Khalid. They call you the Social Activist.
Yesterday I heard a word that hurt me.
Yesterday Sultan took me to the party
The Buds' Swimming Victory Party
One is telling another.
They think I can't hear them.
He says "Hello, sir."
I want to buy a birthday gift for my sister's son.
Hello Hello
I will be in the newspaper every day, Dad.
Sure, sure.
This is a very good question, Dad. I really want to do it. I'll make you proud, Dad.
No problem, he pays or he doesn't pay.
That's what your minister means. You won't find him spinning around and daydreaming.
I am Ana Ana, the Minister.
Bossultan didn't come to take me anywhere. I'm still waiting for him.
And he makes me sit in the front row, and goes to relax in his car.
May he not want anything from me. May Allah guide you.
Oh dear Amouda, may the mercy of God be upon you! Listen, I'll call you back shortly to make sure.
You started reaching out from within yourself.
People are doing discounts for us.
I told you so.
The job is super cool.
I've returned, my dear friend.
The Minister's efforts are truly divine. May God protect him.
The minister is being hailed, hailed.
No, by Allah, I'm a bit tired today.
Okay, if you're this enthusiastic about it, go for it, Tamer.
You just wait, my brother Saad will take you and, God willing, he'll find you a great party.
Yes, let's have a party!
Today we have no activities.
No by Allah, there isn't.
Where can I find a child?
Any help is much appreciated.
I say no one can we ask.
May God help you in your endeavours.
I tell you, go to sleep and rest.
A Lucky Moment
Anything, God willing.
e-Zine
The time has finally come.
And he just wanted to show off in the cabin, just take pictures and let him snap a few photos on his face, just a few shots.
Oh, beautiful Allah, farewell.
Have you guys lit it?
I don't know any match in the reserve league. Let him, God willing, do it himself in the field.
Oh, what a minister! He's been imposed on us.
Sweet means has reached the peak.
The end is near, as the saying goes.
His fame has now surpassed yours.
May you live long, if you go somewhere, take Saleh with you.
O longest living one.
Shining star
We turn it off to restore its original size.
The Minister has arrived. The Minister has arrived.
I can't imagine it. Not for a second. If any of you take my picture, I swear I'll break you. I'm not coming down until you're all broken.
Brook broke his camera, so he can't take pictures.
I missed you a lot.
As the saying goes, I missed the train.
This isKhalood, my brother.
There is no might and power except by Allah.
Why is it like this?
This is the first time I've seen him.
The first time you see him.
It's the first time I've seen him in years.
Why
This is Khalid.
It's been a long time since I saw you. Come here, my love, come here.
What am I supposed to do with it? I'm used to it.
Oh, woe is me! There is no might and no power except through Allah. You brought up the same story again.
Get out, I'll tell you to get out, don't inflate my head. I myself came back from the wedding at three in the morning.
Just let me rest; this has become a whole ordeal.
Your brother is my son.
I swear to God, I'm gonna tell my dad what you did. You're acting like my daughter!
It meant he was playing, playing.
He used to play with my makeup case.
But this Saud, I know what to do with him.
Khawood is back, and I wish all the kids were like him.
All this advertising and nonsense he keeps spouting about his brother
Oh my dear friends, come and give a hug.
Hello, my dear friends. How are you?
My eyes are not going to Spain this summer.
I need
Kuwait's Falcons
Hey Hamadeh
Hear me say it to you.
There is no might nor power except with Allah, the Most High, the Most Great.
I'll let my girlfriend Amal make the choice.
Just tell me your honest opinion.
I say the one by the sea is nicer
In the near future, we will own a yacht to sail directly from our house to the sea.
Our children and us
So, set the wedding date already.
It's almost over, just one more year and a few months.
But whoa, your brother put on way too much cologne!
I honestly hope that I'm not noticing anything with your brother Khaled.
But he's very different from your brother Saad.
Each one is a free spirit, Omar.
Then your fiancé is backward and doesn't know that there are unisex perfumes.
Let your fiancé keep his opinions to himself.
I don't care
Khaled believed it.
You're not just using your perfumes like a woman would.
You even use their colors.
Why are you doing this, Khaled?
Oh, you really have no story.
Mom, why don't you want me to say anything about him? Can't you see his moves and his behavior?
Perfumes for both of them.
Can you hear me? I'm warning you.
You saw the Bluetooth.
Hear the 1/4 isoflavones in the mills, they say it's spread in Doha.
I have heard about him.
You'll see, I'll tell you later.
Ooh, God, hey, Ashlon, how you dance!
Buzz buzz buzz buzz Cool dude
These are the girls Jaww describes. That's the one she was telling me about; she dances properly and does moves—this one here is Kholod, Mohammed's cousin.
My cousin's dog's money
But easy, I'll show you in it.
Wait for my brother Saad to come
Let him come and I'll show you. Saad will send him the Bluetooth so that his mom can see it.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, hello hello.
Certainly defeated.
What's up with my cousin, why is he sitting over there?
Yes, my Bluetooth is on.
Not only will I send you something, but...
Thank you, sheikhah.
Shhh.. Scatter, you flock of birds.
You're an idiot, Saad.
I'm travelling tomorrow.
I won't see her face in the country
Where's my abracadabra? Where's my abracadabra?
What would people say?
They say their son has gone mad and traveled. You want to make a scandal for us.
Oh, what a delight!
And whatKhalood's son has done is a source of pride and honor.
A real Kalab Age isn't embarrassing at all.
My uncle, the one they call the brother of my girls.
Say he left to study, work, travel, or even commit suicide. Anything.
The important thing is that I don't live in a place where embarrassment hunts me every day.
Where do you go back to?
Go fuck yourself.
This is the end.
That one over there, we don't know where to show him. This one here is putting his suitcase down, he's about to travel.
We don't even know where he's heading.
I expect it to happen.
What's wrong with you now? I brought you here to ease my pain, and you're ignoring me and breaking my heart with your words.
I was telling you to take care of him.
Don't let him treat you like a servant.
You didn't know about it nor did she.
And Dad's busy with his work, leaving the responsibility on you.
You're right, mom.
It means: There's no hope, for the sake of your sister.
In this, you are right.
<html> <body> <p dir="rtl">اللّٰه سواہ خلوں خلاّنا<br> كلنا مالنا وہ بين النّاس</p> </body> </html>
I can't see anybody.
You said something to him.
This is my father's greatest mistake.
We're dealing with the perverted scumbag Khalid.
I didn't tell him.
On a CD and give it to him.
And I'm off to the airport.
I'm very worried about him.
Our house needs to reach this point, Omal.
Don't be surprised.
Immortality and its forms clear their families' reputations of all charges.
Their brothers and sisters heard them.
No matter how much we call upon religious values,
And they go to dance and celebrate.
The Slurry of Evil
I swear to God, Ya Bok, you've got me puzzled.
Goodbye Dad
Take care of yourself, Dad.
I have a simple gift for you, Dad.
A gift for me.
Right now, as I put the CD into the laptop, I'm scared of what's about to happen. I'm walking with me.
O God, Mother!
Is it possible, Mom? Dad still watches the CD? It's only three minutes long!
It may appear.
Where does he come out? Where can he go?
Tell me what's wrong, Abu Saad.
Dad
Sorry, Amal.
And I get very tired if I look for it too hard.
To find someone with your ethics.
But forgive me.
May God help you succeed.
I say, I see you've made it to the roof.
Oh my love.
We are in an era of freedom.
The Age of Human Rights and no one can limit them here
The one who has an aerial gets a thousand, oh the envy of my eye.
Of course God may keep America my love
Here you go: <font color=green>Welcome to my humble abode.</font>
Two hundred and eighty
May Allah suffice me against you. And it's you who sides with Adriel; I asked him how much his salary is.
Mom, I have so many jobs.
From Ejofni, who keeps complaining about his salary being a bit low, but it's no use. We can't increase it beyond 700. He also got his license, so we added a 100 bonus.
I've completed the year; I'll increase your salary.
This one seems greedy and will get us into trouble.
Just leave it alone, just shut up, just get him out of here and rid us of him.
Sure, it's a piece of cake.
That means you're letting him make me hate riding in the car with him.
That's enough, leave it to me.
You just told me the story. I'm the man of the house. I'll keep quiet now. You too. Enough said. I'll take charge of things from here.
Come on, I'll take you outside.
Come stop
I am not sure what he is saying.
My friend says he saw you entering the migration office, whether he said it or not.
Daddy, this is not a friend, this is the son of Uncle Mal, I am the brother of Abu's brother.
EG five minutes, God willing, we're off!
Five minutes.
Let it be inside your mind, it's beautiful.
You're always telling Madam you want a higher salary.
Everything within the world of the Hin is precious.
It's been eight hundred months.
Dad, I'm in a big problem inside the country
This is a driver inside a Duhuh in Hasl, heading 1.42 million
300000 in Bads could be yours, above the 1000000 of your father.
Sabr, I'll make tea.
See, I've had enough, and that's the end of it. Period. Silence. There's nothing more to add.
You talk a lot of nonsense about the job.
Twin words.
I will say I will go
It's useless, really.
Two hundred is useless.
My glass is fear.
It's not a cough.
Sure! Here's the translation: <font color=green>All doors are open.</font>
Let's hope it will be three thousand four hundred.
Snow muscle scale inside the house is useless. Outside, good money goes astray.
I am very scared
The wool of this is super soft.
How much for?
2500
In his fear of the police, Eggy went to jail.
There's no coffee left.
I am your cousin.
I tell you, I'm wearing my coat, I'm going out.
No one answers me when I vote.
His room is the only place he's not suppressed.
Her servants have served her for a year now.
My only comment is: God knows best.
I'll swing by your place.
I went to the police and filed a report.
You're off the hook since you informed them, you have no further responsibility.
We'll do our best, God willing.
And you keep wandering around the neighborhood, maybe you'll spot him. Please let us know when you do.
I am gathering money, and when I am full, I will surrender myself.
I will bring them back, they were lost, I will clothe them, I will feed them, Training their car.
It's not up to him.
The match starts now. It's a beautiful day for some football!
Sure, we were afraid to tell you.
These are the Foxes team and Foxes aren't easily reached.
Do you know if more than three people have registered? If not, we haven't won. We need ten to fifteen.
Obvious mockery. Let's be frank, it's obvious mockery.
This level isn't an easy one. If it wasn't for the Foxes getting more than three goals, it wouldn't be a walk in the park.
I'll tell you straight: Take it.
<strong>In the soul, in the players, in the performance</strong>
They have nothing to be praised if they look at less than three [people]. They should praise the Lord.
Our appetizers team is still hungry. This is the Foxes team, get lost dad.
You scored a goal comfortably, and now you're overjoyed.
I expect there are still some quotes left, or has it stopped at "جي"?
This is a very good Thalab. This is in your head. You're crazy. There's no such thing as you're claiming. You're the main culprit here. Thalab eats chicken.
No no, I don't have a car.
You're my best friend.
He's what he said.
He tells you this fox causes a lot of problems.
You're in good hands with Mafy.
Yes, sir.
You don't know, or what?
This is the foxhole of free foxes.
He often appears on a show called "Fadfad".
Heglabook today, you will be defeated.
And Allah, you are a Thalab team, there's no defeat. You win everything.
Fox says the result today is:
What will I find out about this in the result?
The result of this class is Foxes.
This tiger comes and takes the livelihood of the one who does the work of a carrier.
Let's be realistic for a moment. Please don't tell me the foxes won and flew away.
This is my father's fox.
This is a fox that takes a chicken to make a meal.
O great one, he hasn't been seen here in the stands, what could he be doing?
The audience is slain by laughter.
The inside of his clothes is radiant, and his peace belongs to you.
He's a real supporter, the kind with true loyalty to the club.
That's walking with the big Qataris who go to the malls and such.
My friend treated me to a cappuccino.
Look at the world, my brother.
He pulled out a 500 riyal note right in front of me and paid the bill.
He recited to me the poem he made about our match against the Frogs.
Peace be upon you, O Arabs of the tribe.
You're a frog
You're not even close to my team's level. You're way below us.
Boo boo the club and the team look at what happens
There is no saying.
A Day One Fox Was Evicted
What's the reason for this and I hope you're all doing well.
Sure, here's the translation: <h1>True Talents</h1>
I made this gamertag from scratch.
Safety, safety, safety. The Arub tribe of Haderin wishes peace.
Every month we meet to select the ideal fan.
Masha'Allah, and may the one you have chosen this month be the one honoured, Insha'Allah.
Members of the Board of Directors are the ones who decide.
Not a hello, and each of you is the size of a camel.
The administration of this big club is run by a cunning old fox.
Get up, get up. They put the guy who ran away from us on TV. Get up.
Now this is it.
This one speaks properly, that one's a hooligan.
<h1>A pen, or he'll say you're a bad year</h1>
Now I know how to reach him.
O Allah, let the audience rise.
Wrap and roll it.
He's wrapped around me.
It's a accelerator.
We lost him now, it's good.
Sweet
You be quiet, it hasn't been decided yet. I'm the man of the house, I decide.
We cut off all doubt.

Let's have some coffee together, folks.
May God grant you well-being, you are so uninteresting, not ordering anything, may God provide for you.
Are you sure, really? You wanted to embarrass us in the cabaret?
God knows best.
O my mother, O my mother, it's me, it's me!
Right now, your dad's doing God knows what to us. We have no clue!
I didn't mean it, Mum.
Please don't tell Dad, Mum.
Your dad's turning the house upside down!
Surely it's killing you now.
Oh mom, I swear I'm not breaking it with hard work.
Mom, why don't we go and get some glue so we can stick it back on?
My mom glued it.
Where can we find one like her? I have no clue. Her uncle, he brought her, a gift.
O God, I'm scared for you because of him.
Mom, I'm scared Dad will hit me.
Slam the door until I figure out a solution for this matter.
Go to your room quickly, Allah ya salaam.
Uncle Uncle Uncle you're my Uncle
My uncle broke the vase.
O my son, why aren't you with us?
No, Mom, nothing's happening over here.
Ran away from home, mom. Afraid of dad.
It's haram like this, Mom. Have fear of God regarding the boy.
O mother, this is not how one is raised. May God guide you.
What should I do now, Mom?
I don't know how to react.
My mother only fears for him because of the cars on the street.
God protects him, hopefully. I think he might have gone to the small shop, or to the neighbours' place to play with the kids.
Oh, my dear Waleedo, he's so kind, handsome and lovable.
Oh Mom, please seek refuge from Satan, and don't worry. God willing, all will be fine.
Oh God, bye Mom.
Welcome to Bologna!
My dad's going to hit me.
My dad is going to kill me.
Don't be afraid, my dear friend
Don't be scared, my love.
I won't let him raise a hand against you
Against my will, it broke.
Come, Dad, come and have a drink of water and rest in my room.
Your face has turned yellow.
May Allah fix him, only Allah can fix him. Come here, Mom, come here.
O Allah, the Generous One!
I'm scared my dad will come here.
Just relax, Dad, don't worry.
No one interferes in the upbringing of my son.
This is my son and I'm raising him the way I see fit.
But it's a sin that the boy is trembling and jumping in fear from something his father did.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
Let him open it.
The bag hit the vase accidentally, believe me, it wasn't on purpose.
You you must defend him
Don't say anything to him, please forgive him this time. He's heartbreakingly scared.
But where is he now? Where is he hiding now? He's still with you at this hour.
It's not with us.
It's here
Enter the shower, wrapped in cloth.
I'll take care of my brother's share today.
Jan's engine is not primary.
Let's go, brother! We want to play!
Your friends say they're studying.
Dad, just this game and then we'll go study.
Why don't you have an exam tomorrow?
Yes dad
Okay, Dad, go ahead. Don't ruin it for us.
Go Dad, that's enough now, don't make a fool of yourself. Go, go Dad, we're getting up, we're going to study.
What's all this talk about?
If you don't call your uncle Bo Walid right now, you will regret it.
La la la Don't tell my uncle, don't tell my uncle, no!
It's none of my business, guys.
I'm telling him you don't hear us.
Oh Allah, I see everyone going to take their book and study.
Okay Dad, put your phone in your pocket. We're going to start studying. Okay Dad, don't tell Uncle.
Oh God, I'm so confused, I don't know how to act.
I'm afraid that if he found out, he'd make a problem for us.
Of course, everyone is asking why I sent him to the hospital.
What's wrong with her that you told him about?
If he knew that Walid is an apple, he would kill him in his sleep.
O mother, it's all his fault.
O mom, this is in the realm of psychology.
The boy is now twelve years old.
Excuse me, Mom.
My mom, he's going to eat lunch at our place. I'll just give him a hint.
Baghoj O'Shay
Her mother is going to Bahrain to buy an abaya.
O my mother, it's both a want and a need!
Fun and shopping
She says every night: "I am a butterfly."
I have a son who sleeps every night in his bed and doesn't tell me the story.
He said I need to take him to the hospital so they can treat him.
There's really no point to it.
Nothing escapes them.
His words are true.
It's necessary, Mom. I have to take him to the hospital. He needs treatment.
The wide door is correctly adjusted and perfectly dry.
The last one in the neighborhood will hear the screams until the end.
Sit.
Eat, my dear mother, eat.
I have nothing to say.
I'll take a quick shower and I'll go get some clothes. Be right back.
I begged you, please.
I have to teach them some manners.
Don't you interfere!
This you call success?
Khaled is forty-nine out of fifty.
This is a success.
Just their signs are beautiful.
I told them: Woe unto you, if you don't bring fifty out of fifty.
Please don't take them to your brother's.
It is necessary to obey.
These are my children.
That's it, swear to God, it's the last time.
Why don't you bring fifty of fifty, fifty of fifty?
Zayda wahda
I tell him not to go with us to public places.
Yesterday we went to the hospital and they said he couldn't enter.
You look different today, don't go with us.
Just give me a moment, I'll call my brothers.
That's it, uncle, I'm dying. I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying. This is the last time, uncle. I'm done.
Let me educate you, oh God.
Be careful, this is not a joke like the one you'll see at the end of the year if even one of you doesn't get fifty.

They said tomorrow.

Well done, Khaled!

No, I won't go with them.
Where did this kid go? Where did he go?
There is no might and power except by Allah.
Dude, this kid, what's his deal?
Of course, I'm failed and afraid of my mom.
O fallen one, may God guide you, except the child, who excels and is second in his class.
It's only that he's afraid to go back home.
Because he's only two degrees deficient in Mathematics.

Nuclear energy
This represents 60% of the world's oil reserves.
Saudi Arabia leads the global reserves with a share of twenty-four percent.
Then Libya, the United States and Nigeria.
3% each, the rest of the world 15%.
And then
And also from the production
And perhaps this is one of the secrets and reasons for the scramble for this region and its countries by the major industrial powers.
And at its head, the United States of America, the world's biggest consumer of oil energy.
But oil prices keep soaring.
Coinciding with a downdraft for the US dollar
The Gulf Coast marker, which is the pricing point for oil.
Yesterday's barrel price:
This has led to an increase in the earnings of producing countries and at the same time
to a surge in inflation
Inflation in some of those states has reached fifteen percent.
The most important source of energy in the world
Prices of life and goods
In a live interview with the Deputy Prime Minister
The Qatari Minister of Energy and Industry
Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah
For our viewers who wish to participate, you can reach us at the show's phone numbers.
MP's Hours Welcome!
I'd like to start with the unprecedented oil prices we've reached.
Where can prices go?
Of course, where prices can go is a mind-boggling question.
or what is called the market force
Not OPEC.
and not the producing states
And not producing countries Producing countries and OPEC have nothing to do with oil pricing.
Is it just the relationship between price and demand?
It's not even the offer, and the request is not very relevant.
What are the factors?
Other factors besides supply and demand
Of interest to investors
They felt huge pressures and turned to oil and gold, or what is called commodity marketing.
Investors have lost confidence in the stock markets.
And gold too
Gold has risen from $350 in recent years to $970 now.
or until today, as I mentioned, around $109
But they are all increasing, and if they decrease, it's only a slight decrease.
Let me remind you that in the first quarter of this year
The second quarter , oil prices are supposed to go down due to low demand .
But we saw the market in an exciting and amazingly dynamic state.
In Q2, at the beginning of spring, it surges past the $100 mark.
But that means the previous factors that determined the rise in prices for winter and consumption have now changed, and there are new factors at play.
And economic growth
At the same time, we witness oil prices soaring to such heights.
I talked about the political factors and mentioned that political tensions play a role in this.
Is Iran expecting Fallon's resignation amidst the political complexities?
Her owner, today topped most American newspaper front pages and made headlines in global media, can influence oil prices.
Beh beh meh eh eh alyoom eh.
Today we are in the era of globalization, and influence comes fast.
‏ Non-tangible factors can have an impact.
They create a sort of disruption in the market.
It also created a kind of political gossip.
He said there was no plan, but he also didn't rule out other options that could be taken with regard to Iran.
The markets always react to the Qamoos.
Of course, right now it's not certain whether America is at war with Iran.
I am one of those people who doesn't see this scenario.
It could be Falun And there may be things we haven't seen, that it will become in the future.
But we who work in the tyrant's sector
We see that all these political tensions
Oil supplies in the world
And vice versa, there are very comfortable supplies.
It indicates that there is oil being sent for storage.
There is never any oil supply shortage.
Perhaps preparing for the next war.
Under this reassuring picture of provision, that there are no obstacles in provision.
In case President Bush and the U.S. decide to carry out their plan
This is something else.
Prices are soaring to new record highs.
Oil price may reach
Some of the world's oil reserves
You are here This here represents the Gulf's most important today
In addition to Iraq, Iran and the other Gulf states
They represent over sixty percent of the oil reserves today, that's for sure.
You are today
A very minor incident occurred.
Therefore it indicates
That means that in the case of any war on Iran, oil prices cannot be guaranteed to any extent.
God knows, we might even get there today. We've made it without.
Wars for $107 and $110. Who knows, they might jump to $110.
Today, oil, as I told you, is living under psychological and political tensions.
Tensions rose and speculators took advantage of these tensions.
I'm only invested in oil.
Or so-called not really investing, of course. It's more like future purchase or forward marketing.
It is called oil paper.
These are all speculations in oil paper.
His production is approximately 300,000 barrels or less.
They might push for more purchases and, subsequently, even higher prices.
I wish April's lie was true.
I hope there isn't
Jenny is coming to the area and it's said that this is on his main agenda.
Jelly is the owner of this project, as many politicians and media figures have stated.
I didn't know what was in Jelly's bag.
And I can't foresee what it would mean.
Will he ignite a war?
America is in a transitional phase.
And why doesn't the son do something else?
Let's see. What happens when it's April. April is just around the corner, only a few weeks away.
And the world may pay.
And America is a major consuming nation.
In the Gulf States
The Gulf will be the tough one to crack.
You can't throw this number.
Its production costs are low.
In comparison with the countries of West Africa, most of which rely heavily on
The Gulf cannot be matched by any other region in the world.
We have heard this talk from the West, from the United States, for many, many years.
It's perfectly fine to seek assistance.
to the end and the Caspian Sea War Remember the story and
Whatever these dreams may be.
When you sit with those close to you in a circle
You hear them speak in a different way
What do they say?
On supplies and the importance of the region and the importance of precautions
When I asked one of the European officials, I said it's strange that you talk to us in the closed rooms during the Hajj.
In a way different from what you speak in front of
Or the media said: "No, this is for political reasons."
And of course there's the so-called standard butt or bal (two holes).
The cup that everyone knows is the Gulf States' turn.
The importance of Saudi Arabia in Qatar today, for example, is huge.
The world's largest producer and exporter of oil
and entering into
In spite of all this
Leader of the Central Sector
Waging war on Iran.
And if it takes an aerial war or a so-called air strike.
**Supplies**
‏You're not running late, you're being punctual to the highest degree.
I don't agree with you, we are not in
We do not deal with the Westerners.
With America we deal.
Where are the good prices?
Regardless of the nationality of this market
'Naẓa' means non-renewable energy.
For the sake of (or: on account of) generosity
Arab hospitality
Please give me.
Observers say the real price of oil is
And the reason for the rise in oil
You Gulf people, OPEC and the Nations
You are very generous with the Americans, insisting on holding on to their currency.
You said the oil price should be $70.
The true price in exchange for the dollar's drop is sixty to seventy.
Okay, the price is 100.
1.09 now that the dollar has dropped 35%
And now above $100
If we took ratios and proportions
No one denies this.
One of the main reasons for
Compared to the dollar's decline
If we took the
If we took this comparison
Oil prices
Because the United States of America
Of course, it is in my interest right now for the dollar to depreciate.
A weak or stagnant US economy cannot be sustained.
Hence, hence, what happened in this downturn and economic stagnation?
You too became.
‏ The United States lowers interest rates on the dollar
Why do you insist on linking the price of oil to the dollar?
Let's talk about why oil is priced in dollars.
The first above one hundred years
The first barrel of oil was exported from the United States of America.
The text was issued in US Dollars.
From the beginning of the 20th century until today
Dollar pricing Oil priced in dollars
Historically became
For the past one hundred years, the world has been engaging, interacting and pricing.
Today, Norway is the third-largest oil-producing nation.
And its source of oil
Russia is the second biggest oil exporting nation.
And North Sea oil production in Europe
Priced in USD, not MAD.
Everything in the world is changing. There are other sources and information pointing to something else.
You are the Gulf states.
There are secret agreements between you and the Americans.
And oil became the real cover.
Is this true? There isn't any
And these agreements
The arrangement stands that oil will remain the cover for the dollar, in return for which the US will protect these regimes.
This is not correct and there are no secret agreements.
Today let's not take the OPEC.
You have 66% effort from the deputy.
From the Thirteenth State
Of the eighty-five barrels, 40% are the OPEC's quota.
There are many very large oil-producing countries
Outside the OPEC organization
What obstacles prevent pricing in another currency?
See, the price is in another currency.
Not all the elders when they decide
You are Saudi Arabia and the large Gulf countries
Today's oil share is for OPEC as a whole.
There is sixty percent.
Even if OPEC hypothetically wanted to.
There should be an agreement among all oil-exporting nations to
There is no inclination or intention to change.
The attempt succeeded.
But now these nations are unable to change the pricing currency.
unless there is an agreement between them
What is the effect of Tarad?
Let me speak now, I mean the Europeans.
Why don't they issue their oil?
From the North Sea or Russia and Norway in Euro or Rubles.
Because it is in their interest, their currency is premium, elevated and high.
Vice versa. Not vice versa.
Here is their loss.
1 office = 1 barrel and a half
You're the ones who are losing, since your currency is tied to the dollar, and its value has decreased.
And he's also losing a huge loss.
The connection of currencies here to the Gulf is a historical one.
You remember, back in the seventies the Dollar was the world's strongest currency.
And you're linked when you talk about disengagement
This is like marriage. When you marry.
And you think divorce is easy.
No here.
And you're acting all fancy with the dollars.
Costs must be studied in a way
to study professionally and to teach
Kuwait also freed 25% of its currency from the dollar.
Saudi Arabia Bahrain The United Arab Emirates Qatar
may adjust its currency rate
Tomorrow we will change the subject, but that doesn't mean we have no intention of studying or thinking about it.
The study differs, of course, His Excellency the Prime Minister has stated.
The Wal said that the Qatari currency is undervalued by two percent.
to be enrolled in this study
It's not okay, because you can't just monopolize this topic.
Kuwait has taken a step forward. Why don't you follow her lead?
Economists say it's more profitable for nations and their peoples than loss-making.
But we
And nothing else.
These four Gulf States declare
Everyone means believer.
I am one of his personal supporters.
She will support him.
It must be among those studied.
By itself
Created what He created from one nation or two
Until the time of the currency.
You won't jump the waty situation.
This, of course, will be studied by specialists there.
And they will be the ones, the very ones.
This needs a political decision, it's not a specialized matter.
Let's wait and not be hasty. Let's see what happens today.
People started such as
Of course, in a complicit manner.
The MP's pursuit means that the inflation rate in Qatar has reached fourteen percent in 2007 and is expected to rise to fifteen percent next year.
<h1>People's salaries are eaten up and devoured here. The salaries of the employees here are</h1> <h1>devoured.</h1>
Residents of Qatar have seen their salaries eroded by 35% to 40%.
We'll be back after a short break to find out the size of the pay raises.
Employees in Qatar at least for the foreseeable future. Stay tuned.
Welcome back, No Borders, to this episode where we host the Deputy Prime Minister and Energy Minister.
Qatar's Minister of Industry, Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah, on the skyrocketing price increases.
Oil has returned tens of billions of dollars to the Gulf and other producing states.
Oil was my question about the expected increase in employees' salaries, but before this increase, I would like to give you some important information.
The UAE has 79.80 billion in reserves and is buying 2.60.
Only 1 ton and Kuwait Times reports an economic report on the revenues of the Gulf states.
Saudi Arabia's revenues are expected to reach $190 billion in the year 2008.
And it was
170 last year, 66 this year, expected 57.
Kuwait was forty six and then fifty four
One barrel of oil is not fifty-five billion.
Some reports say they've found gas – no jealousy here, sincerely!
Iraq Forty-seven billion
1.5 trillion
Spending areas were $1.5 trillion.
Gulf states imported one thousand billion, that is one trillion.
‏Multiple imports for a total of $
Investing in the United States $1.3 billion
And nine out of ten billion
It was three hundred in Bahrain.
It was 6.5 in Oman in 2007, increasing to 7. In Qatar it was 13.75, rising to 150.
Those living in Qatar herald the arrival of even more expensive goods, prices and a more expensive life.
Life is being swallowed up and prices have soared to unprecedented heights in Qatar.
We feel for everyone.
It must be processed
Processing aims to control inflation.
It means you will increase the salaries by fifty percent.
They do not say you are against the raise of salaries.
This isn't right at all.
All ministers are against the salary increase.
There's a problem and the solution must be optimal.
It's not a patchwork solution.
Okay, is there a balance between the two?
This is it.
The important thing is to tackle inflation.
Here in Qatar at the committee.
His Highness The Amir issued a decree forming it.
And she gave birth
Laying down means establishing rules.
Strong to solve the problem and control inflation
The important thing is to control inflation first.
The inflation
Ahwaa, if you do not control it.
Be the deputy's slave.
Specialized in market research and published at the end of February last week.
Among these <b>is a ban</b> on entry.
Now you'll be stuck with inflation, and inflation will eat away at the incomes of these people.
Many of them are now
Entry into other countries
Increase our salaries, then freeze them due to inflation and lower them again.
I'm saying the talk they talk is the parallelism in the subject.
But now.
It is not a temporary solution.
The problem is increasing even more.
And so here
To curb inflation from soaring
Boredom always will.
Because the increase was tremendous over the past year, previous year's figures look paltry in comparison.
Sani's spot. Sani's spot.
And some also work with the public sector, not just the private one.
The private sector is completely neglected.
The issue of the increase should also be viewed with fairness.
I don't know where I got these notes from.
We are living in Qatar, not in Germany.
I tell you, on the contrary, today the private sector has started to pay.
Most
Many Qataris who were working in the public sector have moved to the private sector.
Due to the high salaries
He is facing a problem.
They move into the private sector because the private sector is vibrant and dynamic.
It provides good salaries.
We are affected by what is called market forces.
Or by market force.
They do not come, those with very specialized expertise.
Don't come to Qatar, because Qatar is the least least means least salary or least cost.
or the costs shall come
Okay, with our full understanding.
I don't jump the gun, nor do I claim there will be a salary increase.
No hope whatsoever, then.
To control this inflation
Let's give some time.
to rein in this inflation
Inshallah this is what the report says: Qatar in 2028
inshāʾ Allāh means God willing.
We see that these numbers will decrease.
Show the people some love
It's a professional operation.
Of course, with professionalism and every thing else but.
From inflation
Because of spending
Big on various projects
Allow me some questions from the viewers, and I hope each will be asked directly. Abdelaziz Mohamed, Morocco, your question, please.
This is based on the fact that the ruling families in the Gulf have
I do not think that the justification for this is the lack of an OPEC agreement.
Secondly, all oil revenues go directly to the ruler.
Then to the ruling family, the rest to development
Under no accountability, it will stay as it is.
Peace and Mercy of God.
May God bless you, my brother Ahmad.
I won't elaborate on what my brother said about the ruling systems and the issue of linking the Gulf currencies to the dollar, or the riyal to the dollar.
America wants to use it to globalize the world under its banner.
The U.S. trade deficit with China hit eighty billion dollars.
The European Union's budget reached US$86 billion.
This means that all global policy directions are against the dollar.
We are paying the price for this now, as Arab states and Gulf oil producing nations.
It may end in a showdown with America.
Among the advanced nations of the world, such as China, Russia and others, it may become an issue.
Purely military
The explosions of Chinese, Russian, Japanese and even American bombs
Thank you very much for this clarification and this information.
Your question, Mohammed.
Hello, your question.
Could you turn down the television volume and ask your question?
Ask your question.
But what I see is that the deputy is determined not to cooperate.
The topic of non-correlation with the dollar, as the dollar is depreciating
It will hopefully land at the bottom.
He's a good boy.
It seems that the Arab brothers' style is not to be followed.
Thank you, Brother Muhammad. Thank you very much. The last intervention was from Ahmad Hasan, from Qatar. Your question, Ahmad.
Good evening to you.
Thank you very much for the lovely interview.
‏Salary increase, God willing, things will improve. We're not meaningless.
We're all facing problems, definitely not just about salaries.
Salaries Inshallah things
‏ Hurry up and ask your question
I'm available right now. Ask away!
All of them are wholesale prices. All goods are imported.
From outside European countries
Sure, we have factories and plants across the entire Arab world.
Thank you, Ahmed. I appreciate you taking the time.
Now, the issue of rising prices is a significant issue.
Case of being with the oppressed, walk with the oppressed. Strive for the deputy.
The one who doesn't have a billion here is a nobody.
Here means we , and some of us brothers of course.
Those who don't know Qatar

The person who means it comes and sees the immense developments in Qatar.
You are growing significantly fast, yes you do.
And all have the right
And you, the population, where will you find people from "ain"?
Actually, are you really going to import, like, a surplus of garlic from China, for example?
We won't be importing either, God willing.
The state is built upon a plan.
For the optimal independence of funds derived from oil and gas, which everyone knows will one day run out.

Qatar's foreign policy appears ambiguous to many observers.
The State of Qatar enjoys distinctive relations.
At the time Qatar was establishing relations with Israel, it still is.

What angered the regime in Egypt
He was so angry that he even accused her of plotting against Egypt.
Qatar was also involved in other important files.
As Darfur in Sudan, the Houthis in Yemen, and even the Israeli soldier captive

What force puts you in this position?
Of these accomplishments.

Your Excellency, the Sheikh, we welcome you.
On September 22nd, 2007 to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
The visit was a turning point in the relations between the two countries, at least in the last years.
Redrawing the boundaries
Washing off what adhered.
This is what I mentioned.
Al-Higaz Newspaper or Magazine
The meetings you held with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which restored relations and saw the return of the Saudi Ambassador.
To Doha
At first, your introduction was long and needed many answers without your last question.
What I think is pregnant with him
Especially regarding the topic of Saudi Arabia.
What is flour?
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is an important state for Qatar.
‏There exists between the two countries
I spoke about silencing the island.
I spoke about a coup attempt.
I think these matters are now clear on both sides.
And we accept your clarification.
‏In the State of Qatar
The dispute with Saudi Arabia
It has always been confined within the scope of
Views
And all praise be to God. This is the wisdom of the two leaders.
King Abdullah and His Royal Highness the Prince
‏In the Gulf significantly
> More than a hundred years
The relationships have always been brilliant, honourable, and based on trust.
I want to attribute it to a misunderstanding between the two parties.
This matter is settled and there were no conditions.
To solve any case.
But there was an understanding and a genuine intention from both parties.
To solve this pending matter.
The relationship is not seasonal; it is a strategic alliance.
We wish it not only to endure but also to evolve.
Beautiful diplomatic talk
Until Saudi Arabia recalls its ambassador from Qatar
I'm not used to speaking diplomatically; otherwise, I could have avoided many problems.
I always stood by what I believed in.
Saudi Arabia . It is not diplomacy , it is faith .
The topic of Al Jazeera falls under the topic of media.
The text has been translated into: <h1>An Agreement <i>Between</i> the Parties</h1> Many <i>countries</i> were <i>drawn into the affair.</i>
She believes she can spark or gain points at the expense of other countries.
or on Qatar's account
or on the account of Saudi Arabia
The ice has been broken within the Al-Khaliji family.
‏That is, unlike before.
Bowed down from a political agreement
No, no, there was only an agreement of affection and an agreement of mutual benefit.
Anything contrary to the above should be referred to the Island's management. Have you developed a strategy for the additions?
There should be a wall between you and Saudi Arabia to avoid a repeat of past events.
The relationship was originally based on a close strategy.
We can say it in one, two, three, four.
There must be solidarity.
I settled some of the differences on that basis.
Among some Arab states and we work to settle other disputes.
For the differences in the Arab world are indeed differences of opinion.
When we have an opinion on a certain policy, on a certain procedure, on a certain issue, and another state has a different opinion.
This can be viewed in two ways.
Some observers thought you enjoyed criticizing Saudi Arabia.
Criticized her
Did you get exhausted and decided to shift direction, then headed towards the larger state of Egypt?
It means the same thing. The same idea.
No, first of all, we don't enjoy it and we're not doing it for fun.
We do not deal with any other party in this manner.
That means the reasons for the dispute with Saudi Arabia have ended.
Among them and I know there is an understanding.
Too big and you know we established it.
There shall be a certain pattern.
But Saudi Arabia But but Saudi Arabia
Let me put this under two lines.
You have started to squabble with Egypt, The Ahram newspaper, in the April 13th edition.
The Egyptian Official Gazette
There've been extensive investigations.
In Hezbollah's network, a destructive plot has been unveiled.
Egypt is the target country in a three-nation pact involving Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
*Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood*
A famous media bugle player, known for his Tamari-style performances.
Qatar is the smallest Arab state.
Conspire against Egypt.
We respect.
Struggling over the years
I do not say it to finely hone the feelings of anyone.
I will complete it for you as you completed it for me.
We can
And the Egyptian President
Eager
On Arab relations
The first dot.
The topic of Gaza
As they say, and as we admit.
The State of Qatar
Her size is small
You can participate in a scheme of this kind.
Because we have suffered from the interventions of nations at one point or another, and I don't want to return to that.
Those who sold interventions by some states in the Qatari affair.
Therefore, the policy of His Highness's Government
Now that they have discovered what they are calling a "plot",
Also, the name of the house means that I want to say: May the Lord protect Syria and Iran, they are defending themselves, I will not defend them.
Stability in Egypt
And why would Qatar want to change or interfere in a subject of this nature?
And the Pyramids do not speak out of desire.
Qatar sought to undermine Egypt's role and its communications with Turkey and the European Union.
They even held a parallel conference to the Arab Summit, trying to steal its thunder.
And you use the Al Jazeera network as your mouthpiece.
Please, come in.
with Hezbollah
We're not comfortable with that, Miss.
I can tell you with confidence
We
It's not our principle to intervene in such circumstances.
The one who healed our brothers in Egypt is what we are grateful for to the Egyptian officials.
The dispute or sensitivity some members of the Egyptian government have.
But some officials are sensitive to it.
From which (it/this)?
I'm coming to the point.
Days of blooming peace and the peace issue , and that we .
And it took place before it in Egypt.
And afterwards, it was held with us.
Because Israel
We have a dispute with her.
You have no quarrel with Israel.
And ever since that day, the conference has been
Any Islamic conference is an Arab conference; they have a complex about it.
Why this sensitivity?
Sit with them and
Let me finish for you.
We're always hopeful.
This sensitivity we have discovered
O O three equals
The Gaza Conference
Egypt does not want to hold it in Qatar.
It's not Arabic.
In Qatar and at the summit in Kuwait we told them: "Guys, listen up!"
The Palestinian people's march goes on.
More than two weeks
but we hold it before the programmed Kuwait Conference, which we were the first to attend.
People are killing each other.
Procrastination is what it means.
The dispute arose.
And no minor state stood in the way of this clash.
Of course, I know there are some Brothers in the government, and that's also an embarrassment for Egypt, not just for the Brotherhood.
When they said that after
Okay, you're in the island.
The Israelis were informed that a day before any speech or any such thing, there will be a meeting to cease the fighting.
What is it?
O brother, they're taking in food and medicine during the strikes being carried out against our brothers.
They say the gateway is narrow.
No entry for trucks.
They once told us there's an agreement on the other side, and they must come.
Now is not the time to bring up Fatah or Hamas.
I don't care about Fatah or Hamas. What matters are the one and a half million six hundred thousand people who are being bombed.
And they have no medicines.
When we started talking about this subject, and speaking at the Gaza Conference.
And Qatar's involvement in the issue causes sensitivity in the Egyptian regime.
It's not interference.
We haven't discussed how Egypt is handling the situation because that's Egypt's prerogative.
One of the officials said we have uncovered a major conspiracy.
He still hasn't told us what the plot is.
We mean this official.
Egypt is a big thing
Sure, brother, we understand that Egypt is a major Arab country and we always say that Egypt is a great nation.
And that's why we always ask the great nations for so many things.
Because Egypt is our thing
And you invited them to a conference as well, which was also a provocation.
We were invited to a conference.
Gaza's Age
We coordinated and our stance was unified.
People are suffering in Gaza.
Forbidden means I know that Turkey has brought things in via Israel.
I would be delighted if I could see them enter through our Egyptian brothers.
Among us.
And if Egypt triumphs or pulls off good political work
We believe this is in Qatar's interest and that of the Arab world.
Egypt's stability is important to us.
If she does a good job that's important to us.
Let me finish your question and introduction, they took fifteen minutes.
The issue you've just wasted me on.
‏No, I am not them. I am them. I am now the embodiment of wrath.
Whom of the Egyptian regime's officials are you angry at?
We foiled the Doha summit.
The second thing is that it's *they* who failed the Doha conference.
King Abdullah had a rule: he wanted it.
I want to make amends.
Therefore some states intervene.
This is what I told our brother in Saudi Arabia because we
We have no dispute with Saudi Arabia, not even on this point.
The sharpness because the apparent in internal shapes
Is there any official among you?
‏ The older officials
One big nation, led by one responsible man, thinks that a smaller nation is doing all these deeds.
That's where you had yours.
She'll take on any role.
Darfur is part of Egypt's national security and Sudan.
The P5 nations
If any other country, it would've been possible.
But these sensitivities lead to an amplification of the issue. Why do you stick your noses into everything?
We want to eliminate the allergy, so we're taking antihistamines. They tell us that it's a matter of allergy.
Why sensitivity?
Some of the Brothers in the FaLaLa are in the government.
‏ They have an internal failure.
Iridon faces west, no, a plot in Gaza, a coup d'état.
That's what the English say: "Apples and oranges."
Everything will be fine.
Recipient of ‎ instructions and analytics, not just for the latter.
I know what happened, it's alright.
The issue must be tackled locally.
Don't treat it.
No, by Allah, my priority is my country.
My priority is to first tackle the issues that matter to my country.
Then I'll see if I have some time.
Consideration of issues of concern to the Arab Nation
And Qatar tried to mediate.
And think about any Arab issue in which we can contribute to the best of our ability.
Why so provocative? Why not take it in good faith?
I can't treat you.
I can clarify my opinion.
Throw it on me.
And we, we, we are of our opinion.
That which springs from the heart.
Let me finish for you.
When the initiative for reconciliation was announced and the presidents gathered in Kuwait, we were filled with hope. I issued a statement welcoming this development.
In spelling
Of course, the Egyptian official who revealed his heroic deeds.
In his article, in an apparent TV interview, I won't respond to it.
Because I have an answer to every point.
But I am maintaining the bare minimum of relations that bind us and Arab interests.
Also in response to the call made by the Servant of the Two Holy Mosques.
But all I advise him and others
And they try to fix their mistakes, both internally and externally.
In politics, economics, or other fields, we make mistakes too, just as we do in our political and economic decisions. No one is infallible.
Because they are accusing Qatar of these charges.
You deny any connection Qatar has with anything related to Hezbollah's cell.
This is a funny topic
To distort Egypt's relationships, spoil its role and contacts with Turkey and the European Union.
What we are first of all is few in number.
If we are able to fulfill this role.
This is not true.
There are accusations against you personally.
to pay funds to the Schalit captors so that Qatar can take Schalit and increase the Egyptian role in the affair
He always accuses us of paying money. We haven't paid any money and we haven't spoken to anyone about paying money.
But this issue.
We support Egypt as we supported it before and we still support it in solving the issue between the Palestinians.
Oh, He hopes the Palestinian President stays until this issue is resolved.
We were there and the first to support the State of Qatar.
<em>The authority</em> will <em>remain</em> and <em>Palestinian institutions</em> will <em>stay in place</em> <em>until the dispute is resolved</em>.
And We said, "Take it."
At the Arab League, he says no, we passed it because we believe there are people who do not want this subject.
But we sailed through it cleverly.
Does he address his superior?
His Prime Minister
My brother, I don't know if there's a problem.
From us from them I don't know
They decided back on April 12th. *Al-Shrouq* newspaper broke the story.
The political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a news channel to counter the mouthpiece called Al Jazeera and bring an end to its biased coverage.
And soon enough, matters will conclude and things will be put into place.
Do you not fear that the island will become a thing of the past?
It now means political adolescence. We're living it.
You have conceded to Saudi Arabia, and the Emir of Qatar sat down with the King of Saudi Arabia.
We didn't concede and they didn't concede to us.
We dealt with them as brothers.
A small state has ceded to the larger state of Egypt.
No Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is at a crucial point that needs to be clarified.
Qatar's relations with Saudi Arabia differ.
And then we'll talk.
‏ Qatar's relations with Egypt
We have high hopes for it.
Let me be frank with you, O Halal.
The text you provided is incomplete. Please provide the full text for a full translation. Here is what I can offer based on what you have given me: **Am khilaf fi al-siyasa al-ra'isa ar**
Sure, the English translation is: Joe, we have no personal dispute. I told you, we respect the Egyptian people.
If you asked me now to solve two problems, Gaza and what else?
And this is an issue that has affected us greatly.
We want to approach this from a psychological aspect, meaning we resolve this issue.
Published in some newspapers
Minister of Foreign Affairs
The attendance of Prince Saud Al-Faisal
We talked about everything.
It became obvious that matters had escalated and remained unresolved.
No no, it was in the la la land. Look!
I can't tell you that our relations with Egypt are good.
They have some grievances, and they are justified in their feelings towards us as brothers.
And we have some reproach from their right over us as junior brothers
In the major state, we do not want to compare ourselves to any other major state.
Egypt is bigger than frustration.
It's not a matter of life or death that I'm concerned about, but rather a solution from the heavens.
As for us, we strive to please someone.
Is anyone waiting for a style?
Qatar has
It deals with non-peer-to-peer, fraternal interaction.
As a major state, yes, we are proud of Egypt as a major state.
But if someone is deceiving someone
That's me; I know Israel is doing it to us.
And whether or not previous U.S. policy towards the UFL is also the previous administration's policy: with me or against me.
I don't think they want to emulate either Israel or the US on this issue.
And then, too, if I were to adopt their policies, I would also be pressured by external entities.
In several issues let me finish for you.
We too understand and know that there are still dictations even for the great powers regarding the matter at hand.
The dress codes dictate your politics.
We have no movement, our movement is one.

His Highness the Prince's Vision
I don't want to upset anyone
Let me finish for you, don't interrupt, we don't want to upset anyone.
We don't want to compete with anyone.
They say what they say, whether it's Qatar the Great or whatever.
But we have a viewpoint.
We first expelled the Israelis. Their office is closed.
Glory be to God! First they said, "Close the office", so we closed it. Now they're upset and running to the Americans, saying, "Look at those people!"
They aligned themselves with what some call the Devil's Team.
They say
For Americans and Europeans, these are not our friends and we know how to deal with them.
The plots.
which were exerted
It's a shame we've reached a stage where in the end, what's the point?
Now first.
What is your vision for solving the problem with Egypt? One Two points
And given Egypt's prominent role in the Arab World
We think it's important that you look into it.
I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak is keen on this.
But some of the crew
He needs to leave.
‏Engrossing the Egyptian public opinion, the government, or any other entity or institution with trivialities.
and focusing on Egyptian and Arab interests
Are there any steps?
We're after them, not in front of them. After them, because they are a major power.
In the foreseeable future
And God willing, I think this matter... I can't imagine how it will become a thing.
& I know there's a time for the mind.
And there comes a time for those who are from around here
If it's me
or from those who have it
Their interests are large Arab ones.
We will someday find that this subject
The world still has a long way to go.
That doesn't mean we're going to sulk in the Egyptian style you have.
If someone stretches out their hand I'll stretch out an arm up to the meter.
Now, His Excellency the Sheikh.
‏We have never gotten used to running.
Only on a sound basis are we ready to run for Egypt.
Stand with Egypt.
Now there are many rumors about Egyptians working in Qatar being harmed because of this.
And there are contracts for Egyptians working in both high-end and blue-collar jobs.
It's you who knows about this topic first hand or not, but Qatar does not cancel jobs and dismiss employees arbitrarily.
Because these people have nothing to do with what's going on.
This is a market where one demand changes, one is cancelled, and another one comes in.
So he applied and, in other nationalities, they sneaked in with nationalities that increased.
OK, a quick answer.
The office has existed.
We're worried the office will be upset, we should probably let them know now.
We tickled them during the days of the campaign in which all our losses in negotiations with Israel were because of this office.
Hi, we closed it. Let them solve the issue with Netanyahu.
He was a guest.
And among them were the foreign ambassadors, as it is our tradition to host all the accredited ambassadors in any foreign country.
It was not an official invitation to Acram Gabriela Chiel.
No, by Allah, he never showed us such respect before; when relations were as they say, "cool", we could respect him now, but it's a bit difficult.
There is no reason now for you to reopen the office at this time.
The office opens when the reasons for its closure disappear.
It's you who made it big
As big as Egypt
Egypt imposed this.
Our relations with America are strategic. Let me make this clear to you.
In some matters
The most important things are "eh"
There were some issues in our region where we disagreed with the previous administration on the approach to handling them.
Now we truly have a great hope for the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe there's a great hope in this administration.
Jade in moving the peace process forward Jade in solving the Palestinian issue
All our friends is what we deny.
What's happening in Iran and its effect on the Gulf and you
This is a matter for Iranians to decide how to resolve their issues.
Among them
in their usual ways and I am certain that they will surpass this crisis
Iran's stability , as His Highness the Prince mentioned
It's important for our region, the Gulf area, and we share borders with Iran.
Of course, we have distinctive relations with all our neighbors including Iran
Because we are a nation striving for peace and stability in the region.
We intervened every time a party wanted to amend or alter the Doha agreement.
I thought Saad Hariri said
The strategic conversation between the President and the Chairman has now concluded.
Among the Lebanese groups
How to see
As far as Yemen is concerned, do you have any role to play or have the Yemenis taken a stand against you?
See, first of all, it is known that we supported the unity when almost all the Arab world was against the Yemeni unity.
We are the only Arab state and Gulf country that stood with the Yemeni unity.
The issue of the South: We have spoken with Yemen, and His Highness the Prince sent me twice to meet with the President of Yemen.
I made it clear to him that our goal is stability in Yemen, because Yemen is an important state in the Arabian Peninsula.
This agreement was not respected by either party, and I don't want to say any more than that.
But what really upset me.
That Qatar, which took this stance, is being accused of paying money to the Houthis, and by senior officials no less.
Yemenis because we don't interfere in such matters.
Whoever stands for unity does not stand against it.
And for another purpose, for the benefit of Yemen, whether political, economic or otherwise.
This is a subject we have no objection to, but I was honestly shocked.
As I have been sent more than ten times during the fighting by His Highness the Prince to Yemen, among the Yemenis.
The accusation is strange.
Time's up, but to put it very briefly, will these problems that you have foresightedly warded off in your problem-solving quest change your policy on intervening in other Arab problems?
God, if only the Crown Prince would listen to me, because I truly believe there is no need!
He offered us a large sum of money once.
> More than five billion dollars . At that time , it would have grown to become fifty billion , avoiding all the hassle .
Just saying it while I'm convinced, because right now time in the Arab world might actually mean something different.
What is allowed in H under these circumstances.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency, Sheikh.
and even exceptional with the State of Sheikh Hamad
What happened in Doha is an agreement.
How Doha's miracle happened
Empowering the committee and providing it with all the support.
On the subject of Lebanon following Israel's invasion of the country.
When there was an Arab consensus
And we went to New York, and we were able to make the decision somewhat balanced.
And we felt this in Doha that both parties were keen.
We tried as much as possible not to listen to him or let him be.
Because we knew the committee, we knew.
Let's face reality and identify the problem after we have spent hours discussing it with the Lebanese.
I believe it's a joint success.
But there was insistence.
I believe Lebanon's problem is that the region's atmosphere directly impacts it.
Whether it be peaceful or not.
Lebanon was destined by this location.
It should be like this
And alas
External repercussions
I can tell the problem lies between the Lebanese themselves, even if it's not the number one issue.
State of Sheikhdom, I know it may not be too early to talk about the behind-the-scenes just yet, but...
What happened? You came here.
Did you stop the clash on the ground?
You didn't delay even a single moment.
What exactly was going on I know for certain even the Lebanese leaders at the time were telling me what had happened.
No, I was from the beginning.
When I spoke to His Highness
If we came to Lebanon
I put forward this idea as His Highness the Prince has supported and endorsed it.
All Lebanese leaders are depicted in it.
Since you're here in Beirut, let's look at each one's area.
And you're all in the same hotel, in the same location.
And you met and talked to each other on the same plane.
So we created this atmosphere, but from the start we thought differently.
This was the most important decision of them all.
Of course in Cannes
And I have touched this from the Arab League
We will be impartial brokers.
And, thank God, everyone can see that Qatar has made an effort.
The two parties
To reach an honorable solution for both parties.
And it has to be a solution where no one is a loser.
Before you take your step.
The consultation was held at the Arab League and we found support.
What we have done.
And I told him while we were there.
If we succeed in Lebanon, we will transfer them to Doha.
And he entrusted me with
Sugar on them and take away their cellphones.
We could bring them there and the brothers in Syria were also supportive of the position.
And I told you at the beginning that without Arab support, the committee would have been unable to do anything.
They wanted to know why.
I think the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that has occurred
And this tension
Tensions in Somalia Tensions in Sudan
In several issues surrounding the Arab world
And what extinguishes every fiery flame.
It safeguards the Arab world from foreign interventions.
We try as much as possible for it to be
Sends troops.
Even militarily.
In such a matter, I believe the subject is...
At the Sheikh's State
He always used to say solve the Lebanese side and the Lebanese file.
A Saudi Syrian agreement
QQ If correct, it reads: Arab Qaf = Qatar and the Arab League.
Could what happened in Lebanon potentially lead to a serious reconciliation between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Syria?
In the Arab world we need to soul search.
Because of Arab disagreements
And any agreement between two Arab States,
And we have tried this.
In the War of Seventy-Three.
When the Arabs agree to solve an issue.
I think this is a matter of interest.
Saudi Arabia and Syria have an important role in Lebanon.
The two parties
They overcome wisdom.
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because we are in the Arab world, we are faced with huge and significant challenges.
Everybody's playing in our yard.
And we have no might nor power.
How can we stop playing in the Arab arena?
As Arabs, we should agree on some minimum level of agreement.
Unfortunately, we complain.
We are spectators.
Our agreement is lacking in the Arab world, and there is a severe lack of confidence between Arab states.
And then the Arab states.
It's not about accusing others of treason, but rather a kind of
Al-Jalisi. What is called Al-Jalisi.
This is an issue that requires a moment of reflection from all of us. I believe.
Will you embody this wish? Will you really demand an Arab summit?
We feel the pain of those who feel pain, and rejoice when they rejoice.
I mean, it came up in the conversation.
Could you play a role in mending fences between Damascus and Riyadh even if it's behind the scenes?
‏ They are keen on finding solutions and I am certain that with their wisdom, they will
They may reach an understanding.
Among them in many cases
There was harmony in politics and I'm certain, God willing, this will continue.
Relations are improving.
needs both parties to want to take a step forward
But I can't affirm that this is what's happening now.
I am certain that if the Arabs focused on resolving inter-Arab disputes and the problems of some Arab states that I mentioned,
A state of optimism, a state of pride for the citizen; a general Arab awakening.
But I cannot connect what happened in Lebanon.
It can be translated as: There's an Israeli-Palestinian escalation on the ground
There's a possible escalation, maybe American, maybe Iranian, maybe other issues.
Will you still fear her in the months ahead?
We are Arabs
All we can ask for is food and medicine delivery.
And electricity for the people.
We in Qatar are always ready, His Highness the Emir
Over 100 million Palestinians are under siege.
We do not want them to have weapons, nor do we want to aid them in any way.
They do all of this
And electricity
We will give it, God willing, to the Red Cross, so that it can reach the Palestinians.
We only managed to get food and medication to the Palestinians.
And our dispute with them shall persist.
I urge Palestinians on both sides to prevail in the interest of the nation.
And they leave behind illusions.
Now, this Palestinian divide is a great wound.
About the solution
And they did not and will not commit.
This is a serious matter, they must adhere to the Mecca agreement.
They must ask to go again to Mecca or to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
And they solve this dispute.
They won't benefit.
Way wa'od 'an ay taef
I hope there's a solution.
Our position on this matter is well known and has been communicated to all relevant parties that we are not interested.
We will not be a party and we will not accept to be dragged into any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with her.
But we are a sovereign state and so are they.
Everyone looks out for their own interests, but these interests will neither harm them nor us.
We believe that the Gulf will inevitably witness a clear agreement among the GCC states.
And Iran in cooperation and peaceful coexistence
But when the Sheikh's state says that Qatar is not a party,
Is there any detail or clarification?
Just a mention.
Never.
Sure, I'd like to return to the Lebanese file, if that's okay with you.
Frankly, the Sheikh's State means that we were faced with a major deadlock, and suddenly in the last hours we reached a solution.
Some have linked what happened to what was announced.
Perhaps these are disparate pieces of information with no relation to one another, but what has occurred?
Until you reached this conclusion.
What happened in Istanbul I know it had specific dates set beforehand.
Did you know in the negotiations?
Continuously in the subject of the solution in
There is no doubt that the Kingdom's support is very important.
And change the negotiation tactics.
The discussions led to
We achieved a positive result by gathering various parties from various sides.
And we began to speak.
This paper represents an Arab and Qatari direction.
Tell me what's wrong with this paper.
And we started talking about the substances one after the other.
At the last moment, to surmount the final hurdle.
But the Prince walked on the edges.
And remove this obstacle.
And he was in a state of suﬁ.
We have heard the word of the Amir of Qatar at the inaugural session in Doha.
Doesn't that mean your turn now?
See, it's very important that we keep this matter out of the limelight.
We have no regional ambitions.
And by God, we will have control over a state or something, because we are a state.
Our size We are proud of ourselves and we do believe that we can contribute in solving matters along with our fellow brothers.
But in the Arab world it's very important
NNV DOL
We want it to do something, which is very important.
Some small states are empowered to carry out this role and supported in doing so.
Some things are excellent, some are good and some are less than good.
Last question, the State of the Sheikh.
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority?
The desire for reconciliation
What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the word "Israel"?
We stopped playing in the Arab arena.
We fix our problems in the Arab world.
An active member in Iraq
To soothe the situations
Regionally and internationally
If we put our heads together.
Any victory ahead of us or any hope we have is non-existent.
Thank you, His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, for this wonderful interview.
The international efforts to end the war on Gaza
We request a meeting of the Arab League Council at the level of
Ministerial and as if you had ignored
Request for an Arab Emergency Summit
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful At the outset, I am happy, Brother Hassan, to be in this program.
And though the circumstances
The humanity that our brothers in Gaza are being subjected to
Circumstances require us to do a lot.
Qatar did not disregard the Arab Summit.
We actually went with the idea of the Arab Summit before
Unified not only by a Security Council resolution but also through
Not always trodden down and overlooked.
And let me put it in another sentence.
And we discipline.
The street can no longer bear it, if we as officials can. The Arab street.
Doesn't bear.
When we were in Cairo
There were ten to eleven written agreements.
Some of them spoke at the meeting. It could have been held , the meeting.
As much as there is Arab consensus, we will hold it.
And I don't blame those who see that nothing can happen at this meeting.
Or or and solve the problem how
Because it will not unravel.
This is the important topic
Our goal is not publicity or marketing. Our goal is to find
Did you really disregard the summit?
We ourselves ask.
We're going to go and put pressure on the poor other party.
Previous and subsequent decisions and the UN Security Council resolution, but let's just focus on the Arab Summit. President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.
The situation may require an Arab summit with whoever is present.
We found that the majority of the brothers support holding the summit.
Who has been banned
I don't know what they mean by moderation.
We are the only ummah.
Only the Arab Nation means if we go to any nations in Asia, in Latin America, etc.
And without a solution.
which are classified as moderate countries
And what is moderation in our eyes?
Do we concede the Palestinian cause?
Because the ones we like
Should we interfere in Palestinian affairs in a way?
There's no mother who would allow such interference in distinguishing between the good and the bad.
The one they call Hamas, Hezbollah doesn't know, tomorrow another party might pop up.
Is she a student?
Can we be an integral part of the Arab body?
It was planned for us to enter an internal Arab conflict
Okay, let's go to the Security Council.
There is no decision in the Security Council.
I hope Israel completes its mission.
The Second Arab Ministerial Meeting that you have called for
which was dominated by discussions, disagreements and sharp exchanges
He's at a critical point.
That's not the point.
If we held a meeting
Of crossings.
There is no longer a case for peace.
Are the ministers ready for that?
Because one party involved keeps insisting that we must wait.
Sure, we're an Arabic initiative.
Peace talks with Israel have frozen.
We say that we are on one side saying that we will lose in this matter.
In a loss greater than what we are experiencing now. Okay, we have always been respectful, polite and committed to the decisions since the days of the truce.
Sheikha says that arguments are not important.
There are those who wish they could erase Hamas and the likes.
This expresses a political stance more than it is a spat between ministers or the like.
Unfortunately, this is a position that has arisen.
But not everyone
We don't want to speak on behalf of others
It is very important that we are masters of ourselves, men of our own countries.
We conduct the policy of our state.
Who does things like that on her behalf
I think it means
I don't think they'll respect us in the end.
Yes, is there anyone who acts on behalf of the West?
No, God willing, I won't accuse anyone. I don't want to accuse anyone in this matter.
Following a United Nations Security Council resolution
What would his agenda be?
The position appeared in the decision regarding the Arab effort.
Here's the dispute, if Israel were to implement the decision immediately.
We can say in resolution
but Israel has not implemented this resolution
Now are we ready to go and request Chapter Seven? I know there's difficulty, but
Do not inquire about the one who's sought after by the international community.
Shyly
<h1>The Situation</h1>
They think they have done the right thing by doing X to the Jews or Israelis.
Let them take their right
This current Arab situation
If the Arabs didn't go to the UN Security Council,
They agree on a summit and make tough decisions.
Western nations will seek us out.
Because we are in the Arab depths, in the world, among people, and you see how the Arab street is moving in this matter.
But this decision is important.
<b>Issue</b> <i>summoning</i> our <b>bosses</b> <i>one after the other</i>
Okay, so in the end they said there's no "One فولص".
Okay so if now we are like Germany or others, will we demand it?
Not those who attacked are exempt from paying compensation as a result of your false information.
And kills hundreds of thousands
This because you're an Arab party that's weak.
We went, us Arabs, some of us.
It's getting intense regarding how to.
The topic is dismissed.
It was fated and inevitable.
If the Arab nations said: "If you are sending forces to Darfur, we will send forces to Darfur."
Arabs considered it the 1860 Decision
And the group witnessed the issuance of the verdict.
‏Text issued by the UN Security Council
I don't want to say it's a victory or not a victory.
Things by their endings.
Let's assume a victory
What shall we do?
We assume we are not bound by the remaining decision.
But I assure you, we will abide by the decision.
Unfortunately, you will have to comply with it, but you shouldn't have to adhere to the decision.
Even after the Israeli refusal, Israel came back and accepted.
That means we
Will you have an alternative or rather you who call for a ministerial meeting?
I don't think the Arab nation will
In the current state, ready for any alternative.
I don't think the Arab nation is ready.
In enforcing the Gaza blockade
Other political aims
To elevate one category over another in Palestine instead of fixing the issues between them.
We started trying to plan.
Once they held some sort of Arab-European intelligence gathering, without mentioning any names.
And once they did, like we were contributing.
in implementing
What the West demands from us
Or we go.
This is what I want to have sorted.
Of course, I'm not talking about the decision itself, I'm talking about
Consequences because this matter began two years ago ‏the Gaza issue . It's not a minor matter.
I will talk about the subject two years ago but specifically about the decision.
Do you have any reservations about its provisions?
Issued but not implemented
We have been invited.
They may think we have an opposing viewpoint.
It was required that everyone share the same viewpoint.
Not all of us have to share the same viewpoint, but I think those who went put in a great effort.
And we appreciate it.
Regarding what's been going on in Gaza for the past two years, I said that some parties exploit the suffering of the people there for political purposes.
Preferring one group over another involved in the issue of the siege on Gaza.
You already agree with the hints and accusations made here and there.
On real Arab complicity in all that is happening now in Gaza.
We are aware of its two parts.
Regarding the subject, let me tell you, we are not privy to everything.
But I know
The Palestinian-Palestinian conflict
It ignites Arab and internationally.
And they would not have differed so much if it had not been for the first spark.
And after the elections were held,
The atmosphere is electric with the prospect of power.
Majority
It is assumed that if we gave them a chance and saw.
<strong>Irides</strong> want to fix them, the people are still revolutionaries in the true sense of the word, knowing only the rifle and combat.
But on the day they came inside,
Some of our brothers in the Arab world believe that the Islamic movement should not come to power.
Now some of them say there has been an attack.
Hamas has broken the ceasefire, Palestinians from Gaza have broken the ceasefire.
Truce
The Palestinian people in Gaza remain starved for two years.
This is not okay.
For Israeli security reasons
Obvious okay. I don't need them in the ruling. This does not concern me, I'm in Qatar.
But what about the rest of the people?
Who And then who gets to decide?
These or H are not all states with sovereignty in choosing.
‏ Governments
He is the root of the problem.
But I'm certain it could've been treatable.
If we've testified, we've testified that we amplify the dispute.
But it is obvious that we are required to dominate one group over the other because this group...
Category we consider terrorist or the one we consider
What has happened is that all these things have led up to this.
And also the promises they promised the party that will attend it.
They didn't do anything for him.
We return to the international and Arab efforts exerted to end what is happening. You mentioned them.
There is the UN Security Council resolution which Israel has rejected so far.
And there's the Egyptian initiative.
An Egyptian in Cairo
For those Egyptian efforts
It is never a wrap.
It has an important role to play.
Also, Egypt's borders are adjacent to Israel's and Palestine's.
We are
And now we, the prophets, shall put a stop to the chaos.
We will bring people who will stop the chaos in Gaza because
This is not the way to peace.
It must be there.
And so we always ask her for a major role.
What has been announced
No, the initiative cannot be evaluated now.
or provide the possibility of success or study
I think the chances of success are
If the Brothers in Egypt can
They present the Palestinian viewpoints.
And the one discussing the initiative is assumed to be the party in Gaza that is harmed.
Because he might say yes, he might say no.
And this is an important point
When resolution 1860 was issued
The problem we have is an Arab Palestinian one.
We don't want to hear a thing.
But I wish the Palestinian delegation had gone
And when they went to the university, they asked someone to join them from Gaza.
Even now, show the Israelis that this is our brother. We stand united with them.
This is an important point.
We do not let them have power
Our goal is to protect and build our policy.
To stay in power
The Shaykh now
I don't know whether it's possible to discuss the Egyptian initiative since you haven't seen its terms, but
Is it, in your opinion, a suitable mechanism to implement the international decision 1606 and subsequent resolutions, as some have suggested?
A Balanced Role
Now not tomorrow or the day after tomorrow
Each passing day
There is bloodshed in the veins of our brothers.
We don't want to drag it out or let the Israelis drag it out until they finish their operation. We should initiate this proposal as soon as possible.
And I am certain that the brothers in Egypt know this and are cautious about it.
And this is what I want to make clear: all I'm saying is
The issue needs to be resolved now.
And not as Israel wishes.
Noting this Turkish role since the beginning of the crisis.
Does it express?
On an Arab Vacuum
There was no doubt that his position was striking.
It has an Arab depth.
‏Their entry reveals an Arab shortfall, a shortfall in the Arab world.
We know there is an Arab deficit
Part of it due to disagreements.
Part of it is because of everyone's opinions; I think my opinion is the best.
And Fulan believes that his viewpoint is the best.
And no consensus will make people respect us and know that there is an Arab decision.
And let none of them be alone.
One says no, let's give them two or three more days so I can discipline them and bring in the guys to match their numbers. We'll be ready then and solve this.
We must rise above this and not accept this.
They may have mistakes we will hold Hamas accountable for them.
Arabic Arabic
But now.
At least tell them no.
Within the framework of the position, Qatar is also required to comply. As we hear, we will return to this point, but
On the ground you also heard it at the same time.
Khaled Meshaal, yesterday the head of Hamas' Political Bureau
Firstly, not every time Khaled Mashal speaks, with all due respect and appreciation.
Why don't we sit down and talk with Khaled Meshaal as Arabs?
We'll go to the Arab University and tell him.
This is important talk.
From Hamas
Israel also imposes its terms and conditions.
Let them impose conditions, does that mean they are forbidden to impose conditions while Israel can?
First, what do you think of this Arab popular gift?
The unrefined or these audiences are not worth listening to. They once told me to listen to Digol, but I didn't heed his advice.
Completely differs. Dicoll first freed his country.
With allies and without allies he liberated his country from Nazi occupation.
Now we're talking about you.
The Arabic gift is supposedly ours.
Presidents are supposed to represent the views of their people.
The Arab peoples in all those demonstrations we have witnessed
The demand can be met from these rows.
Also many of those who criticise Qatar in this position demand
In light of what's happening , the office and the representation remain open .
And they speak with the same logic.
We sever the relationship. We deal with all Arab countries.
To sever all ties, even if someone claims to have a treaty.
Iridon Qatar only.
We are
And this is more important than the relationship.
Not just in this decision, but in this and tougher decisions.
‏From this decision.
There must be a unified Arab stance.
For others
No one sells anyone to anyone, as this would go against their moral principles, or result in material gains, or be a cause for bragging.
Yes, indeed. Before we close this file on this topic, there are also nations that have taken individual steps.
Good Chavez's issue is different. Chavez has a dispute with America.
What our peoples need is for us to summon
The five permanent members and we present to you these films.
We've finished it the street is smarter now.
The highest roof holds the sheikh's happiness.
He demands that the resistance forces in Lebanon confront the Israeli aggression, etc.
Do you think that if this matter was framed within a single Arab framework, it could succeed?
But we call for an Arab position that makes people respect us.
I don't think the Arab states are ready for battle.
And we're not encouraged.
How can we bring Syria and Lebanon and the other countries, when there are Arab nations that won't even speak to each other?
It must be in
A paradigm shift in Arab relations
This is the current policy among Arab states.
The list is valid, but I think its expiration date has passed.
**In** **Goals**
The important issue.
We know how the Lebanese composition is.
Lebanon There is no doubt that
She gave an example of returning her lands.
The situation in Gaza is different. The situation in Gaza is still...
Surrounded on all sides
And this siege
Gives a different nature
Yes, I mean the goals, the objectives of the operation, as far as Israel is concerned.
A day to strike Alflan, a day to punish Alflan, a day to grant favour to Aflan.
So what happened in Lebanon is not a good example for them.
The Lebanese solution model
Consider it valid.
Gaza
The problem in Gaza is much easier to solve than the one in Lebanon.
Different in some of us whether we reclaim our land today or tomorrow.
Their conflicts over power
On the Distribution of Power
This differs because their fabric is closer to each other.
The intellectual fabric in Lebanon
Therefore, the solution is simpler.
And here's the problem.
His Eminence the Sheikh.
That leaves us only minutes if we're to gloss over it. Where can we go from here?
A diplomat is a person who is skilled in dealing with others, especially in managing international relations, and who is usually employed by their government for that purpose.
How can this process end?
The Palestinians in Gaza
Let me tell you
It might be refused.
And we'll help each other.
The one who didn't march with us.
Failure is ours, in Arabic.
From a strategic perspective
But on the Palestinian side
There have been some efforts, but we have not witnessed an integrated initiative.
Not before , not now . Why ?
It's not about an initiative as much as we feel it is.
The one who solves the issue, we help without mentioning the name of Qatar, because some may be sensitive to the name of Qatar.
And our goal is not to bring a summit, since we have one coming up in March.
If we took the initiative, would we be better than our brothers? I don't think so.
And we don't pressure them.
For history will not spare us if we oppress them.
It means we are moving with this initiative, and we saw all the parties were alive. There was a meeting scheduled for the 4th, which was postponed due to the trip to the UN Security Council.
We hope that, God willing, we will make progress. We wish our Arab brothers would help us as much as possible in this matter.
We hope to keep it away from the topic of competition.
Arabic Arabic
In its heyday, it was stoked by disagreements with the Sudanese government.
And this is also one of our problems. We fight and disagree with each other.
What I don't want to delve into this subject.
In Kuwait, on the 19th of this month, I think. As for the Arab situation,
As you know, have mentioned and elaborated Your Highness.
Is the entire Arab atmosphere conducive to the first Economic Summit?
His Highness
And of course, we always attend any summit held by any Arab sibling.
And we always have an excuse for attending any summit.
But doesn't it fear turning into a political summit?
Of course, time is of the essence.
It's too late, even if it means after ten days.
We're talking about Palestinians after they've had nothing but food for twenty-five days.
It means bacon.
Do people not say that the Arabs cannot agree?
This we said.
This we said.
With all due respect, this summit is programmed and we are committed to it.
I think we
The Arab street is upon us.
Our way of doing things
And so it means I
We believe and submit.
And he says it's guaranteed.
This meeting
Thank you for watching!
And we'll continue our live coverage of the ongoing war in Gaza. Goodbye for now.
Days ago, it was the celebration of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Sheikha Hassa bint Khalifa Al Thani
In Doha and contributed to drafting the special law
I have also served on several local and Arab childhood-focused councils.
She has delivered over seventy-five lectures, working papers, presentations and articles published in Arabic and international journals.
Let's agree on the currently used term first.
For reference, are we talking about people with disabilities or special needs?
Now is the time, good evening!
Because people with disabilities have adopted the human rights discourse or the culture of human rights.
Because she treated people with disabilities as people first.

His disability stemmed from his attempt to adapt to society.
Then the medical concept prevailed.
Then it veered towards the concept of

This category has become

They are the standard rules from which the rest are derived.
The Special Rapporteur's role in monitoring the implementation of this document.
Then came the internationally binding legal agreement, which distinguished itself from the aforesaid rules on this count.
I put forward a basic condition or fundamental rule for this term.
who treats them as human beings, as people, as individuals
With the change of terminology, the perception of this category of society has also shifted.
Yes, and it is measured by means of
Varies from region to region
But the thing about this topic is
The Arab world stands out or differs.
Yet the legal trend has a culture of human rights embedded in it. For instance, in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons are likely not due to a lack of financial resources.
Of course, that's exactly what I wanted to say. Culture exists, but there is a lack of resources, and sometimes even a lack of political will.
Sometimes , legislation , however ,
But unfortunately, awareness is somewhat low and there is also a lack of legal culture.
10% of the world's population have disabilities.
Eighty to ninety per cent of people with disabilities in the working age population live in developing countries
And they are suffering from unemployment.
By my visit to Darfur
And despite the mines and weapons.
Best for males, to a lesser degree
People with disabilities are in remote areas in remote regions
Thus, there are many trends among organizations working in this field trying to enhance
Consciousness is the realization of the right to education.
Instead of many so-called religious centres being established,
It establishes rehabilitation centres, hospitals and schools.
This is one of the things that, thank God, we are able to do through our work at the office.
I tried with the organizations present in the State of Qatar.
‏ Set the agenda.
or integrate the action agendas of these humanitarian organizations so as to include those aforementioned centers.
In light of the regressing state of affairs regarding the condition of the disabled worldwide.
I cannot agree with you that there is a regression.
If there is a regression in the Arab region regarding the disability issue
We cannot expect the situation of persons with disabilities to be within the social context, the political context, the economic context.
They are among the marginalized groups.
In a place like Gaza, like Darfur
On the contrary, I can't possibly make it any clearer that there is no improvement whatsoever in the situation.
Indeed, I have translated on the ground, for instance, if I may give an example.
Like the Qatar Red Crescent
We agreed that the projects will proceed.
For people with disabilities, there is the health aspect strategy. There are other projects too.
We also tried inserting it.
As part of the work of ground-based organizations
Now we have a complete guest, Kamal Crow from Syria. Welcome, Kamal.
Good evening Sulayman Qaru.
Solomon Crow Pardon, after you Solomon
Best regards to you and the esteemed Hafsa.
Firstly, is intellectual disability included in the UN laws?
Mental disability means a once‑normal person, who due to some pressure became a victim of mental disability.
He suffered intellectual disability as a result of the torture and imprisonment he endured. He has been receiving treatment for the past six years.
I know about four hundred people, children and adults, impaired as a result of imprisonment.
Is there a law at the UN?
Truthfully, it's me.
They know, they understand, as they know their own children.
And all means intention means intention without without without without them making themselves its name.
And there are values in the West
Agreed upon but people
Those who are hypocrites, or have strayed from Islam, should not be considered wise.
Thank you very much Naif Alsaud speaking to us from Kuwait.
We now return to our guest to comment on what has been said.
Communications Solomon wondered if there was a mental disability.
Yes, it is included in the classification.
Global Disability Day definitely targets intellectual and cognitive disabilities, as the name implies.
There are sensory disabilities, such as visual or hearing impairments, within these disabilities. There are also physical disabilities.
Of course, as I mentioned, the disability is
Action and reaction take place within a specific contextual framework.

The practical truth, and that was a positive for me, was not directly related.

I saw him at many meetings, for instance the International Convention.
Rights of Persons with Disabilities
‏ Her progress is impeded by some of these constraints or shortcomings.
For example, with regard to legal capacity.
This is one of the basic points in the world of disability.
United Nations, unfortunately, it was somewhat disabled during the preparation and drafting.

She must be committed to performing it.
I would first advise him to go back to the responsible governmental authorities, if possible.
Because it's within the national scope, it has to be contained within that scope.
Your mention of the **International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities** is apt, as it has been signed by numerous countries. However, the level of commitment to its principles varies greatly.
Here we bring up a caller's question: Why aren't there any laws?
It's definitely true that we live in a human society where a lot of things are right and many others are wrong.
Surely many agreements and surely many pacts are not literally binding.
Many states have demonstrated a high commitment to joining many conventions such as CEDAW and others.
But there are breaches and violations, and we know about them.
But the issue of adopting and acceding to a convention
Firstly, we'll make sure, at the very least, that there's awareness.
This awareness starts at the very top of this pyramid, which is the decision makers.
and officials, eventually reaching society at large.
The issue is also our commitment to produce reports, which reach the United Nations.
The issue of knowledge and understanding and the rise in the level of awareness
Did you work as a rapporteur at the UN?
Yes, from what I have seen and recorded, there is interest.
Thus, there is a relative advantage for the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities.
Therefore, I advise, encourage and invite.
It's also important that people with disabilities are included.

Disability and all countries will be obliged to provide funds. What do you think of this proposal?
United Nations has a fund called the Disability Fund.
Unfortunately, those contributions are very poor.

In my case, what happened was...

Dr. Hello, Sheikh Hessa
Almost ten years
This girl, we've noticed, has a psychological disability.
What is your role, then, regarding a girl like this who is suffering?
They are with their female coworkers.
With means sometimes even if we stay.
What is your role regarding Qatari female children?
Thank you very much Hamad Al-Marri, who spoke to us from Qatar. Bahjat from Kuwait, welcome to you.
As Sheikhah Hessa would say
Why don't we leave our oil in its murkiness?
People with special needs Arabs can be counted.
We can help them.
We have enormous financial resources
We can break the psychological barrier between us and them.
Reviving the individual's spirit
And seek His guidance for this noble cause.
This if we truly are believers.
Acknowledgement and appreciation to Sheikha Hessa for her efforts and work during her tenure as the Special Rapporteur.
We express our gratitude and appreciation to Her and thank the State of Qatar for all it has done for those with special needs.
Thank you very much, Aisha Mohammed, who joined us from Qatar.
Hello Professor Wasilah
And peace be upon you.
And on your noble duty

My question is about prevention.
As the saying goes, prevention is better than cure.
There's another level of disability beyond wars and road incidents.
The genetic level might be a result of familial negligence, namely marrying close relatives.
I think this is a high ratio.
Leads to disability.
Thank you very much, Sherif, our standard-bearer, who spoke to us from Tunisia. I return to you now, dear guest, L.
The first caller, Hamad Al-Marri, asked about
Where's the girl with the psychological disability headed?
Where is he heading?
In every country
Surely, there are services provided for all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether mental as we mentioned or any psychological disabilities
As for these schools,
In the past, there was
Is it the "Ministry of Education" that has become the "Supreme Council" I'm referring to as "P.E."?
The standard-bearer, Sharif, from Tunisia, pointed out a very important issue.

All of these have been the focus of many campaigns and reproductive health programs.
I spoke about this aspect.
Adopts health strategies.
It raises awareness.
The dangers of marrying close relatives
and genetic factors
I believe it's "Dish in the State of Qatar."
It conflicts with customs and traditions, but it certainly takes time.
Especially in tribal communities
But over time, there is a response to it, but it must be legally compulsory.
Yes, Kawran Bahgat has wondered and suggested that 1% of the budget of the Arab League be allocated.
**Let me help the disabled first**
Yes, there is the statistical estimation applied by the World Health Organization on the entire world.
There are forty million, or around forty million, disabled people.
Half of them are women.
But these numbers are multiplying.
There's a study in South Africa that observed and proved
<strong>It is certain that the statistics about the war in Iraq reflect those of the war in Gaza</strong>
Each killed corresponds to three disabled.
As our Arab region has undoubtedly become a region of conflicts,

Honestly, I truly don't think it fits.

They confirmed that people with disabilities are the most neglected.
that are conducted by governments generally do not count the disabled
Indeed, these are also associated with societal culture and sometimes constraints.
Societal in the sense that a census is conducted by the
‏The relevant devices
There is a disabled person at home.
There was only one question being asked: Is there a disabled person or not?
<strong>The relevant section dealing with this employee is &lt;the HR department&gt;. Contact details are as follows:</strong>
We collaborated on preparing a form.
We recommended having more details
It must first be ascertained whether the disabled person in question is male or female.
Does he have an assistant or not?
So the fact that even number is correct, as you know, we didn't reach an accurate result.
The interest is also in the progress of Fatima Al Dosari joining us from Qatar. Welcome Fatima.
And peace be upon you.
I am a Qatari national and I have a child with disabilities.
I would like to express my gratitude to the Ruler of the Country, Sheikh Hamad.

Latifa Al Missferi, please.
Because they represent a great obstacle in society without education and without treatment.
Thank you very much Nesim Al Missferi from Qatar.
Abdulkarim from Jordan, please go ahead, Nesim.
Please go ahead, Kareem. We're listening.
And peace be upon you.
May you be granted health and vitality. I sincerely would like to interject.
First off, I'm an audiologist and I worked in the State of Qatar for around four years.
We had a month dedicated to raising awareness about hearing and speech problems.
We were conducting conferences, lectures, and awareness campaigns for hearing impairment.
Now I want to talk about Jordan. I have resided in Jordan for almost three years.
Honestly, it provides new and wonderful services.
Honestly, it provides new services in terms of material, non-material and moral support.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education means it in its sources.
The one that belongs to the Ministry of Education in government schools
So we as private institutions
We receive wonderful and amazing support!
Okay, Kareem. Do you have a direct question for me? I'm short on time, I'm afraid.
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, the UAE and Jordan, the services are great and in my opinion, they are excellent.

Of course I hope for both.
I hope this research or survey will be measured against and more qualitative research will be conducted in this field.
It has also become clear to me from this experience.
Experienced for six years
Coordination among Arab States
They also have a role to play. It's not just about rights; they are also recipients of rights.
Sheikha Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, former UN Special Rapporteur on Disability, thank you.
We welcome the elegant host of Al Dawri Wal Kas, Lana Lana. Good morning!
I am also delighted to welcome the brilliant captain of the Umm Salal club, Captain Ali Qasim.
Welcome, Ali!
Welcome, Vija.
Good morning
I will leave it up to you to offer congratulations. Each one of you can congratulate whomever they wish. Lana has precedence.
I had an open studio for five hours and Apple had two hours today.
I congratulate the State of Qatar, its government and its people, who definitely deserve this global achievement.
I am fortunate to be able to congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
He and his heir apparent, Sheikh Tamim,
Yes, of course, because you're from the sports field and you're one of the workers in this domain and you know these lines very well.
Even we.
And we were rooked! We got six votes against America's fourteen for Qatar and eight for the U.S.
It's not from the night because our file is rich, comprehensive, and supported by many ambassadors. Let's say it's backed up by arenas.
Some people were afraid that it might be like America.
There might be some countries where these things are already in place and they wouldn't need to prepare the stadiums or some of the projects related to this event.
Because the orders are already prepared.
They were only afraid of this point.
Captain Ali, you are so kind. I expect this to be a very important achievement for athletes.
I expect it will enter the realm of politics, economy and health.
Just Kidding
What does this quantum achievement mean?
Of course, it's a huge achievement, especially for us Arabs. Even non-Arabs were overjoyed, did you see their happiness?
Inshallah Ali will inform me the moment the announcement is made.
And I swear I was leaving practice and we were hearing it on the radio.
We were waiting for him and I had one of my friends with me.
We're driving in the car and listening to the radio
The first thing they announced was Qatar F1™ Grand Prix.
We both shouted at the top of our lungs.
My friend came out of the hole.
Shouting and the world looks on as we do our dangerous work, our march continues on our own.
We made a march from the very beginning.
Praise be to God. It was a very special day, and I expect all the channels probably focused heavily on this event.
Lana, you're definitely part of this conversation.
especially sports channels
How did they celebrate this topic and what was their reaction?
There were media from all over the world.
Prime minister has already become very clear on the map Qatar
Definitely, his presence in the team is also very important.
I expect this to be a big responsibility on his shoulders.
What's your take on this very point?
The player who is to join this team must possess the following attributes:
Now coming up is more than one sporting event.
And we now must breed a strong generation
It means he has fundamental rules and studied football techniques and tactics.
What are the rules and basic requirements this player must meet?
I think professionalism encompasses everything.
**Consistency** **in** **training** **Diligence** **in** **exercises** **Disciplined**
Hi, these are essential things to help a player put all their energy into the game or training sessions.
Each stage has its own distinct character.
She has her own ways of enjoying things and her feelings.
From various programs, from entertainment to sports, where where is the most beautiful place in your opinion? Where did you feel the best?
It's so sweet.
It really makes you keep yourself safe. You know how I'm going to maintain through sports, that's the most important thing.
Then there's football, the beloved of the masses. Whether you like it or not, when you step into this domain, you can't help but fall in love with it.
The media restricts us to one side.
What confines you like this puts you in a certain aspect.
Football is not a requirement, but I hate it.
Both sports and medicine are sweet.
I also have some other important things we need to discuss.
May you never return like this, becoming ten years younger each time, to reach the year two thousand and twenty-two.
So I didn't wish for this.
Of course, we definitely wish for such a thing, especially since the World Cup is a very meaningful event for any player.
It means that if one merely watches a World Cup match, they'd be overjoyed and ecstatic; so imagine actually playing in the World Cup!
I hope they will live up to the trust placed in them, God willing. This is their chance, God willing.
What word would you like to say to them from your heart as a professional player?
We wanted you to be with us during this period.
And God, as things stand now, it's like a vacation.
His return to the competitions after an absence of thirteen years from the Gulf Cup tournaments.
You definitely left an impressive mark at Qatar TV, and many wonderful memories.
Mashallah, Qatar TV has become like a university, producing a large number of media graduates.
Our team is a strong selection that, God willing, will win many different awards.
Let's talk about the important job of the Umm Salal Sports Club.
How's it going over there? How's everything? I hope you're doing well.
Definitely, Alhamdulillah. Honestly, it's Mom's heritage.
Yesterday, of course. He was with us in the studio. We talked a lot about the players.
I expect some of the younger folks following us still see you as one of them.
Wanted
It means naturally in the professional reserve league and the players' engagement.
I got my chance in the prime of my life as an offer or offers.
I have the power to take Asia Cup spot with the team. Thank God!
My status with the team is thank God, fine.
Sports topic: How can we give it a social dimension?
And how can we introduce sports to women, children and youth, other than in Qatar?
Connects them all — a complement to sports.
You have it in various fields of sports, the women's role.
Sports awareness has spread throughout our community, from the young to the old.
It'll take us about a decade, maybe a bit more, to reach this milestone. I believe that's ample time.
Because the new generations keep emerging on the scene
In the generation that's passing, growing old is inevitable. But in the generation to come, there also has to be an emphasis on sports education from a very young age.
About Aspire A landmark we can't deny, A grand establishment.
Actual and number one for the new sports generation.
All we have to do is set our intentions and get going.
They specifically love football.
I want the audience to continuously interact with all the various matches and games, even between clubs.
And I tell you the truth, our league has a problem with few attendees.
The problem here is attendance. The Qatar Football Association still hasn't found a solution to attract fans.
What style should we adopt to entice them into following these matches?
Relies on oneself means some people don't like to attend the stadium.
The media have played a major role in the public's disengagement.
Here they currently have a ticket or points accumulation system. The points system accumulates points.
LaLa is the union that means it has a multi-step plan to attract the masses
Some clubs have methods, like Al Rayyan, to attract fans. Of course, Al Rayyan is rich, so it doesn't need fans.
Some clubs must make their club management do activities and events.
Public's right Stimulating the public's right but I think these are the means we have.
Players mean the new generation
Their love for the job, their faith in their abilities and moral support are just as beneficial as material support.
We definitely appreciate this wonderful meeting.
So, we wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate you on this incredible win. Qatar's successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup is, of course, a huge victory. Please, go ahead.
Energy returns from Manakad confirm that Qatar has not insisted. On the contrary, it has fulfilled its promises and always kept its word.
With the permission of Allah, Captain Ali has the final word in this encounter.
And I say congratulations, and hopefully moving forward, God willing.
Thanks Ali Qasim, the captain and the player. We wish you success, God willing, in your sports career and in your life as well. May God bless you.
We fell in love with sports even more and more.
Young Talents
Some youth say that these songs are indeed a current phenomenon, but they have a deep and vast history.
A group of young people sing Arabic or English lyrics.
We're diving into this topic today with a group of rap enthusiasts.
We will get to know them extensively through our upcoming live interview with them.
Welcome wherever you are, viewers!
A new kind of singing has been spreading in the Arab and Gulf scene for years now.
Coming from the West, specifically America, it's Rap music
And before delving into the topic of rap music
There is boldness in using any word without any reservation.
Can anyone rap?
As for writing the lyrics to the song
So almost all rappers write their own lyrics.
Generally, all these details are many and important, and we will get to know them through two people who are strongly involved in this field.
They formed a nice team.
Welcome Yusuf Al-Naimi, Salman Abdullah Yusuf. Good morning.
Hello and welcome, Salman. Good morning.
Good morning, welcome!
I am very happy to have you with us, of course, through this program.
And also, of course, through rap music
What do you have to do with it, Youssef?
We saw that rap art, in general, didn't really exist in our region.
Batargha is sweeter.
In the tongue of the citizen.
Therein lies the joyful, the sorrowful, and that which means political issues.
Yes, I am indeed a big fan of rap.
These songs are an art form, much like how painting is an art form. The poet composes a poem,
The singer can sing, the musician can play any instrument.
You sense a welcome from Qatar's society, from the Gulf society, for this type of music.
Two Thousand and Ten
You get the feeling that people have started to appreciate collecting CDs of rap music.
All ages
And there are families, many people who have started listening more than before.
So it was like a website.
How many of you are there in this group so far?
Everyone can say words, write poetry and perform it in a rap style.
The rapper, indeed as you say, one could say it's the same as the singer.
It's him who sometimes plays the music and writes the lyrics.
Oh okay.
Hear it, by Allah, I recorded this song.
Okay now all these songs I produced were from Salman, Mank يوسف or anyone else from the same band.
Did you ever think it could be on a specific CD sold in the markets?
But you know, when it comes to being a character, that means I'd have to go make an album and put it out there in the market. That's a whole ordeal in terms of paperwork and procedures.
Why didn't you consider that there are twenty-five of you, meaning one hand cannot clap alone?
You guys really have, mashallah, twenty-five hands among you. May God preserve you all, you young people and brothers.
Learn CD This CD can be promoted through many websites on the internet.
You have Facebook, you have YouTube, you also have the local newspapers.
There are thirteen songs, if I'm not mistaken.
Registration is not immediate.
Sure, I'll help you with that. It's obvious though.
The quality is a bit poor, but it's not the same now, but it's clear.
And he has recorded over fifty CDs.
It has so much that I can't really say it doesn't, because some of the younger folks have been into this art for ten years now.
It's not as strong as the recording, and I expect the distribution will be different now.
And especially since there's a large collection of music, a large collection of techno music genres right now.
These are the young artists who produce a wide array of lovely songs.
Also, we want to talk about the concerts you have participated in
And Allah, as for the party in Doha, we participated in one there too.
Of course, it was organized for us by Al Sadd Sports Club, so they didn't come with us.
The audience clapped.
Let's see, there's something here that we didn't expect. The number is huge!
And what surprised us was that families were more.
Families > Youth
From me to you, the event was beautifully organized!
And we were slightly confused, it being our first time in Doha.
We expected there would be no demand.
The audience interaction was amazing.
It has long been benefits songs mean.
Okay, let's listen to some of the songs they wrote and were well received by the audience, especially the younger generation.
For example, let's hear some of the words so we can also clarify them for the viewers.
We might hear it live
Please make yourselves comfortable.
Please come in Salim.
I am the problem, the word is a little bit.
Let's hear it.
Mom
Right now we have the 'Sabah Al Doha' program.
The one comes to him to perform Sahih had his psyche open.
Salman is like a mountain, he's been doing rap for five years now.
One, even if he doesn't accept to be poor.
I brought a lot of people into the mood.
I really need to grill the words.
Sure, here's a line from one of the songs we performed: "Oh, won't you stay, just one more day, Beneath the orange-blossom tree."
It's not all songs are random, it's what they call Free Style in English.
On the same weight.
But when we sing a song, we mean the lyrics, we've pondered them.
Thanks. Let's keep watching.
We can say good morning Qatar, good morning my country, with the Doha Morning Show program.
Keep yourselves visible, up in the live air for the viewers.
I see one and two and one more, they showcase a bit of the arts.
We have the Doha Morning Show
Of course, the beautiful song you saw.
I'm insisting now that the youth be persistent online and everywhere else.
Greetings indeed. When did you register it?
She was a subscriber.
Each one of us has the right to himself.
I feel like Youssef somewhat cannot accept my words, or he cannot let them settle, or cannot make them work.
So everyone takes the words.
We certainly expect that every artist, painter and poet is always
It can also be written in love with sports.
Out of love for the same homeland
Surely you participated in the National Day through the parade.
Through the beautiful songs, you Qatari youths represent Qatar as well.
Doha is dressing up to welcome the Asian Cup, there's a big parade at the Corniche.
To welcome this event.
And we are broadcasting these scenes to you live, of course.
Doha welcomes the Asian Cup
From Doha Airport until now
And we're watching these moments live.
For entertainment, it's the same WhatsApp existence with these audiences, it's the existence of our children, the students.
I arrived early this morning at the Doha airport for the Asian Cup.
Preparations for hosting the grand continental event
We return once again to our guests, Youssef and Salman, who are lighting up the studio.
Concerned about the Arabic Gulf Qatari rap group.
We can say that about you.
And Allah is the One intended. As for us, currently, that is exactly what we mean.
I'm organizing a party, but it's not certain.
Now you're working on a specific show, which will be announced soon, Youssef.
Inshallah, but it's not certain. It's still in the beginning stages.
The beginning of the journey, we wish you the best of luck. Rest assured that our program will, God willing, be your greatest supporter, with all our hearts.
It also means Salman. Where do you all meet? The whole youth, around twenty-five of you.
Where's the meeting? How do you put the ideas together? How do you write them down?
Sure, there have to be some duets.
It's not necessary that, for example, one person is called Salman, or يوسف, or anyone else among them sings a whole song.
There has to be some harmony regarding where and when we meet.
And I tell you, it's tough to gather all twenty-five of them at once.
So I started talking to Yusuf and to Afnan, trying to organize a get-together today at some place.
To see the idea of the song and the lyrics
And on a second front
I'll note down what's on me.
Let him hear you out.
This will be for you, Joseph. He'll register and wire it to you. He'll send me the details shortly.
See the experiences abroad.
You take, you acquire some of the CDs of great artists.
Take a little expertise from them, some techniques.
Hi, it's definitely us, always.
artists who have been in this field for years or have an established reputation and expertise in their domain
One hears them, the way they go about their methods, their ways. They try to create a style, one that's not a copy.
That means if I do the same style, the same tone of voice, and use the same vocabulary as him.
So I'm just copying, I'm not doing anything new. I'm doing something that's uniquely me.
That means we'll use them a bit.
Yes, I too expect there to be a large group of Gulf youth in the Gulf itself.
In a primitive style, we follow this report together, we benefit and also enjoy seeing it together.
The mystery still shrouds that talent which some people possess.
Using very primitive means
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah Al-Daail
which is located away from the Saudi capital, Riyadh
150 kilograms
He has a tremendous capacity and extensive experience.
To detect shallow groundwater sites.
To depths exceeding one hundred meters
You know that drilling wells is expensive.
But with the expert, he can determine the proper location to drill the well.
Of course, the way to discover or find out is
Locate the water.
It is from of old.
And the ancient fathers and grandfathers were al-q
They resort to experts to locate the wells.
To dig
Abu Ibrahim's water detection methods.
It's not modern devices.
A soil analysis in scientific laboratories.
His work relies solely on Allah's guidance.
<strong>And its tributaries beneath the soil</strong>
They are the seeds of pomegranates.
A branch of pomegranate or a fig branch.
Now we practically apply the process of detecting water channels.
It starts now, going back the other way. This is the end of the run.
Come back again.
Come back come back.
The origin of this issue can be traced back to here. If it stems from hence, we place a marker.
And here the water channel ends.
Requires extensive experience and a lot of patience.
For the explorer to reach tool motion sensitivity
I went to more than one area.
Means 95% success rate
Of course, this method and the use of copper rods.
There is, of course, no precise scientific explanation.
This method
It's astounding the success rate of those who ply this primitive trade.
Exceeds ninety-five percent
In the detection of shallow groundwater.
Glory be to Allah, Who taught man what he knew not. This is a report, which we have naturally acquired from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
They formed their own band and have released more than one CD.
Whether it's online or some of them on the phone.
<h1> Competitions often arise among the Gulf states: Qatar versus Bahrain, Qatar versus Kuwait, Qatar versus the United Arab Emirates. </h1>
You can download a song even stronger on the topic of 'Stronger'
About a problem about about what it means to the end Lots of topics
I follow him as my role model or my idol means I see that there's none like him.
inshallah
At the same time, we also want to take various things.
It also represents a vast array of songs.
We try our best to spread it.
From time to time we will keep in touch with you like this.
Even we know what's the latest news about this band first hand.
I just want to confirm the band's name.
Rubber's Qatar
We come back again with our guests and return to the corniche and the beautiful atmosphere
We are definitely live with you through the live link we are streaming to you, our viewers.
Wherever you are at the corniche, welcome the Asia Cup!
The many arts we are certainly proud of.
It addresses many psycho-social problems among the youth.
But there are two Yunas in the studio.
Sure, they'll complete the twenty five.
We welcome you again, Abu Yusuf and Salman. May God bless you both.
Subscription stopped
We're trying to contact the company but we don't know where it is located and no one is responding to us.
She needs to develop herself. The one outside is at least the one who... who... who... exists.

Sites like these
Band name
We received them and we're always watching.
Do you organize yourselves as we saw? Mashallah, you did this job together.
You make these songs and put them together with a collection of photos, your own personal pictures.
He and upload it to YouTube, upload it to websites where there might be videos that one could follow.
Sure, the translation is: And Allah has indeed revealed to us [before].
And in many songs too
The obstacles you're currently encountering are such that there's no location where you need a company to sponsor you.
You really need a place that brings you together as a team.
What are your wishes that you truly hope will come true and reach the sophisticated level you desire?
That's it, we've given up.
She tells us, "Oh God, we're preparing for you, we're arranging for you, we're bringing down an album for you."
‏It means something, it's official.
That means it's a five-year period now.
It's just a hobby.
Yes, we shared in things, we shared in programs, we shared in series.
I hope it evolves into an Aion.
It means in something it means supporting us it means we're always with him
Yes, we also want to know your wishes, Salman. What would you say are your wishes, different from Yusuf's?
The only wish is to shoot the video clip abroad.
Inshallah, we wish you all the best of luck, hopefully through this team.
Kindness, and we hope that your songs will always be present in the Arab world and beyond.
Indeed, it's a sophisticated art, an greatly appreciated auditory art.
And it contains the messages as you mentioned
Good luck, hopefully always. We wish you all the best, God willing.
Give my regards to everyone in the group. Best of luck, hopefully with God's will.
We will conclude this interview with the song they made for the show.
With you, it's KD & DJ Mr. Bobo on the Doha Morning Show.
Good morning ladies and gentlemen.
This key opens Mr. Bobo's with SKT One Hot to Try.
We can say good morning Qatar, good morning my country, with the 'Morning Doha' programme.
Keep yourselves visible, up in the live air for the viewers.
Don't forget the show airs at 9:30 in the morning, so everyone will be sitting in front of the TV.
I see one and two and one more, they showcase a bit of the arts.
We have the Doha Morning Show

Repeated and benefited from at home.
There's an Atreuli in this shopping cart.
They put anyone who shops at any FAL supermarket or elsewhere.
Any merchandise you put in the trolley, anything you wish to buy.
You have a big screen, it will show you all the components of this item.
This idea was also brilliant and feasible.
Just a simple scan of the item's barcode reveals this merchandise.
It gives you at the buyer an easier way to purchase.
He gets all the details on his private screen.
I expect it would be in a healthier consciousness.
When it's on your device or on the same cart
Most of the ingredients
And its side effects are also its precautions.
Full details are contained therein.
He has ambitious plans, for example there were a number of projects, maybe four or five.
Tackles traffic problems
The traffic congestion and parking problems have also been tackled in a very creative and nice way.
The cultural centre for childhood.
Let's also talk about the various activities we will hopefully experience in the coming days, Professor Abdullah.
Yes, there certainly are some surprises in store. But it's all very hush-hush.
Ideas are mine if you'd like me to mention some of the projects I've worked on
This, for instance, is an underground transportation concept. Its main clever or creative idea is that
Whoever leaves their house has an appointment with me.
They gather at a certain point.
These are, of course, all the images the viewers are currently watching. I think they will greatly enjoy them.
Children's Creations
Exactly. Yes, these are like the same ATM machines.
For example, I have a card.
Insert this card, let's say I need a black T-shirt
These are for example some of the shops. Or I have for example some missing things at home like a key I don't know where it is.
What I lost, for example, the office keys, the car keys
Of course, our main goal, Her Highness Sheikh Moza wants to achieve...
His Highness The Emir's Court
At an early stage, which is of utmost importance in project design.
The number was also selected from three hundred children.
We also have the promising orators in Ramadan.
Yes, she hosted the closing ceremony.
Indeed, we would love to open our hearts and doors to all children who wish to present their shows.
And then they're off.
Our need for their support is also a top priority, and their presence is a must.
These projects and programs serve this main idea.
With the variance and diversity of children's skills
Self-development
Okay, do you have such cooperation with some of the different youth clubs in Qatar?
There are also scientific clubs in Qatar.
Of course, all of our programs are partnership-based.
All our programs are specialized partnerships.
With a group of institutions specialized in developing these skills, it also has community service institutions.
He is in partnership with all institutions interested in the field.
The Society of Photographic Imaging
<strong>Innovation Centre for the Girl</strong><br><strong>General Secretariat of the Cabinet of Ministers</strong> also played a very significant role.
Yes, he played a significant role in explaining Qatar's vision.
Training children on them.
Attracting and engaging children in all our programs, which are built on institutional partnerships.
Depending on the specialization of these projects and institutions
What has changed you?
Of course, our presence here in Katara has given us a strong boost and a lot of support.
The fastest
Now, there are several projects in partnership with Katara, currently being prepared for launch within the next two months.
Of course, there is collaboration on many programs.
Especially as regards reading.
President of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
And we're walking in it now, especially since we are currently in the time of preparation.
Building a promising scientific future for children, upcoming generations and youth, God willing.
The word I want to present to the parents, to the youth who follow us, and to the children who wish to participate through the center.
What we give now
Our children's thoughts are precious and should never be dismissed or underestimated.
We must give it attention , whatever these thoughts are .
For anyone who truly cares about this idea, it will definitely develop. At the very least, it will foster the child's love for thinking.
This is very important that I care about it.
I communicate with him spiritually. I communicate with him now. Our big problem is that most fathers...
He is supported.
Encouragement is provided to him, so parents and educators are urged.
They should pay more attention to their imagination Children are the today's future They are the origin of tomorrow
We really have been strolling through a showcase of their projects.
I'm living in a dream.
It means in a dream, ideas all very wild imagination.
And now, the dream definitely means it's a reality. Many dreams have come true and have become reality.
And all praise be to God. We hope, God willing, that our children who were present will succeed.
Our hopes are attached to you, Insha'Allah.
In His permission.
of all ages and genders
I reached seventy projects.
These are considered pioneering and new projects in implementation.
To talk more about this exhibition
Nationally and also about the Cultural Centre for Childhood
Professor Abdullah also briefly spoke about the exhibition at the beginning.
What lies within definitely holds many an event. What can one briefly say about this exhibition?
So she became a new pattern for the expression of children's love, loyalty and belonging to their homeland.
Of course, it was held under the patronage of the Minister of Education and Higher Education.
This exhibition tour came about as part of the exhibition.
He starts growing with him until he reaches twenty or thirty.
Of course, we have started training the children on the vision of Qatar National Vision 2030 and its five pillars.
Human development, Economic development, Sustainable development, Environmental development
The first one knows now where it's heading in 20 to 30 years.
Then he starts thinking about his way of thinking.
How to be creative and come up with creative ideas
I predict that his domain is, mashallah, quite extensive.
But when we give it certain codes and help it along,
I expect his thinking to grow bigger and more.
Professor, you launched the exhibition under the slogan "Dreams of Generations: Tomorrow's Realities".
It is the slogan of the dreams of today's generations.
**He will be a part of tomorrow's Qatar.** Qatar's future Qatar.
We have indeed experienced this while strolling with the children. When a child speaks, he says: "His Excellency the Minister."
I want you to inaugurate my project. I invite you to visit my project on 20/30.
The child thinks after twenty years.
> He expresses his love for the homeland and what he adores most in life.
Sure, it's accompanied by various activities, events and competitions.
And the Stars of Science winner was...
And it was also the first prize winner of the League of Arab States.
Of course all the children
On the exhibition's sidelines, there were various presentations scheduled according to a specific agenda.
To showcase the projects they have undertaken during the exhibition
mashallah, an outstanding attendance
Stars of Science
Some of the winning projects' winners participated in the exhibition.
who also won one of the main awards
The place it is a forest or a nature reserve
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
The colorful sky, of course, is also part of our vision and the children's dream for Qatar's future.
Also think about twenty two and twenty.
How can the child contribute to the project idea of twenty two?
Its main idea is that there's a chip inside the ball.
It gives a color when judged.
If she went, for example, in the referee's eyes, everyone would be watching the movements of the ball.
<strong>Stadium movements and changes are displayed through this electronic screen.</strong>
The sphere contains existing things.
Ideas, of course, are creative. The main idea, of course, often surprises and puzzles many who ask us.
And these projects.
We always say we reached out to the children.
At this stage of their development, expanding their horizons is instrumental in cultivating these skills.
Those who give them the idea of ​​expressing their love for their country through these projects
He gained the confidence to present his project to the public and explain his idea.
His interests are his passion. This is an achievement.
The support provided was invaluable and much appreciated.
Now it enters the phases of development.
In support of various officials, support from the committee, and I expect support from the audience as well.

Who's talking about a lot of tourist ideas?
Exciting
Perhaps this is what the minds of children will need in this time. Maybe in 2020, 2030 or 2050.
And perhaps these things will indeed come to pass in the future.
It means we have three projects.
The Science Club has not yet adopted these projects. I need them now; I want to start working on them.
A project , for example , the water air conditioners .
Let's see now *Al-Arab Newspaper*.

And how long also classifications and coloured threads?
The artist Abdelhamid Charchani is considered one of the artists who formed themselves.
It wasn't convincing.
It would not have been selected to be part of the operations carried out inside Qatar.
Currently, artist Abdulhamid Al-Sharsani is participating in the series A Killer Feeling and Tsanif Season 2.
We are delighted to have him as our guest this morning.
To talk to him about his participation in these two important works and about his overall experience.
Welcome and good morning!
You're welcome to the show, 'Sabah Al Doha'. This is the first time I'm meeting you and it's wonderful to have you with us this morning.
And props to the people who are working hard on the program
And you, Liz's sister.
Welcome! Let's start the conversation.
Let's see.
I am a responsible and administrative man.
And enforce the laws.
All I can tell you
Bring the bisht.
Then listen, why are you coming to me?
Go see if anyone will agree that you won't be returning the bisht.
And of course, I had another question to begin with, but since we've seen this clip from Tasneef's first season, what is it?
Indicating that Khalid ibn al-Walid
Some historians attribute the great poet Imru' al-Qais to the city of Marrat.
Many things and information are associated with this city in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
And for more, we continue with this beautiful report by our colleague Abdulrahman Murshid.
We continue with some.
It is indeed a certificate of sincerity and integrity.
Emphasis on the antiquity of that city or this.
As much as we see of their effects and hear of them from their narrators and poets
Their old and new, for it comes as a glorious record added to the city's annals.
Medina is one of the cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
It is an ancient country historically established in the pre-Islamic era, the Jahiliyyah period.
Scholars disagree on the reason behind its naming.
Some ascribe it to Imru' al-Qais, the renowned poet.
And by the Pool, the one attributed to him.
Its establishment date is unknown.
The Pre-Islamic Period
The most famous thing in the city of Murta is Mount Kamit, which has become a proverb.
Because it is in the city and attached to it.
‏ These places are also of archaeological interest.
Many , and since this landmark is considered a tourist landmark in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia .

We're back with our esteemed guests.
It would be great if you informed us and the viewers about these methods.
As I mentioned earlier, we have a very unique infrastructure.
We're opening a new page for him where he'll be registered and have his own special file on our system.
‏His father's email
This tweeting involves increased focus, speed of writing, agility, and general lack of focus.
The ruler has complete authority to entice.
Good, this deception adds to the student's file.
Accessed his son's file online.
and sees how much his son has grown
He checks his grades and also his attention with the teachers.
So we actually enjoy the intelligence of this lovely child.
We gathered most of the children from the center and send them our warmest greetings.
I entered this center with a kind professor who exists through this center.
We get to know her intelligence and the level she has reached, of course, from her entry into this center.
Of course, this year.
Focus on his work after Ramadan.
But this would undoubtedly be unfair to other works.
And some people only watch television during Ramadan.
He stays up watching TV while the people keep fasting throughout the month of worship.
Lighten up, lighten up! Make it a two-year project, that would be better.
Of course.
Inshallah they accept me in Armathan
Just hope I can send you all my greetings.
inshallah
And also in the plays that
Of course, from the art of drama to the art of fashion
A fashion show was held in the Cultural Village of Katara.
Sure, we are continuing with you, with all our love and sincerity.
It fosters children's skills and abilities to a greater extent.
Not about the different schools in this generous homeland
We have a prototype, we've spoken with the guests who were with us.
Now we have with us Professor Ibrahim Hussein Abdul Salam. Welcome and good morning!
How are you, Amnah?
All praise be to God.
Who's up next?
Professor Ibrahim, first of all, let's get acquainted with the materials that are provided through this center.
As an example, Sister Omnia.
Also went with her the style or method she mentioned, "Nisima".
You feel like there's a difference in his mind.
You feel that these skills and methods
Things were changing regarding his skills, his mind, and even his educational level.
Scientific methods
Some of it is that at the beginning, I first perform a global assessment called the Tony Test on the child before starting anything else in the program.
I'll also start working on the second part of the tuning test.
We can use it to measure the difference in the students' level or the level itself.
There will now be a quick math test.
Amnah will tally and answer live on air.
Of course, Omnia has no idea whatsoever about these questions.
We are in their midst on this matter.
Of course, I had another question to start with.
We ask about your participation this year in Part II.
What's your contribution about?
Of course, after we presented the series "Tasanif Wade"
Of course, thank God, He has helped me in several roles.
Mr. Ghanem
The roles are, of course, distributed in collaboration with executive director Ashraf Shahat and the esteemed professor
Of course, an opportunity from Tar Art Production Company.
Honestly, it's the guys' turn.
Professor Ghanem, of course, this year nominated me for the 'Right Person' award.
Of course, every episode is different.
I have so many episodes where I'll be doing characters.
And vice versa, it's a sweet experience, of course. There's work involved, but it's there.
A pyramid of Kuwaiti pyramids Saad Al-Faraj
We have artists from Bahrain: Abdullah, Malik, Ali Al Gharer.
Our role model is Ali Mirza.
With you is also a group of young men: Abdullah and Adham.
We also have Abdullah Al-Asem among the youth.
This has been the norm for a year now. We work two jobs per year.
Maybe this is why Apple's software asked you if you were born in '79.
But I didn't know that it would come true or that you would succeed in the arts.
All praise be to Allah.
Did you study the art formally or is it just a hobby?
I got it as a gift.
I took art as a talent, of course, the one who adopted me at the start was the artist Abdul Aziz Jasem.
Some of the artists consider me as a person like their son.
Anything I can help you with.
Of course, we're with all the series.
We exerted ourselves and, thank God, we succeeded.
Now, if it weren't for Tara, big thanks to Professor Abdulrahman Al-Sulaiti, a huge thank you!
You, if you compare us to Kuwait, in Kuwait every year twelve to thirteen new actors emerge.
It's with them.
<em>Definitely a lot of thanks means you're giving opportunities</em>
Let's just say
We talked about the series El Sani and we got an idea about it.
The Killer Feeling Also
And the foot is also a foot.
And we have a model, we have with us the processor, Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Muaiouf Al-Tamimi.
For this process to be done live.
Let's see how we can deal with the character. Good morning to Mr. Sobhi Abdullah. Welcome!
Hello and welcome. Peace and mercy of God be upon you.
If we start with you, sir, please go ahead.
Insha'Allah.
In the name of God, of course.
We hold hands.
Let's see who's nervous.
It's as if it's a divine painting or a message from Allah, showing the purpose of each and every part of your body.
From the inside, she's a mess.
I get dizzy sometimes.
Headache and dizziness
Relax your hand, take it easy. Keep calm, everything's fine.
So Professor Abdulaziz will discover a certain thing through his hands that he suffers from a certain disease.
The one on the left has a slight inflammation of the middle ear.
What does "fe el ma" mean, Professor Abdulaziz?
There's a problem with your ear.
It's me, the one created when I was young
Here I feel the pain again
The sinuses
<strong>A stuffy nose can give you a headache here.</strong>
I have a headache here.
He has a problem with his sinuses.
It's giving him a headache between the eyes.
Weight gain without eating
The thyroid is a bit tired. You have some hypothyroidism and always feel sluggish and heavy in the body.
Over-sleeping
Oh, the sleepiness! The body always feels so sluggish and heavy.
Constant tonsillitis
There you can see the tremor, can you notice the tremor?
He's stressed, and of course you never walk barefoot. Probably the last time you did was a long while ago.
The brother is from Tunisia.
Masha'allah, you have told us many things about him.
Does this massage also benefit children?
The pains are true. Subhan Allah, the mother's stomach aches as much as the baby's little hand.
Most of our children sleep now.
When he picks people up, they think he loves picking them up, but actually he has stomach gas, may God bless us all.
As soon as the mother lays down her breast, explain thus: Spread the thumb.
It's in the palm of a child's hand.
The hands are facing each other, the child is in between.
Let's see, so that every mom can learn this move.
Press Tab, then Right, Left, Right, Left.
This is a matter concerning the child and the 'about-the-child kind-of-thing' is so sweet.
Okay, regarding your discoveries, you have made specific findings, especially regarding women.
That's right, as we mentioned, in every household, Mashallah, 90% of women, God willing, are doing great.
First thing, first warning: watch the ceramic tiles and even flooring.
When walking barefoot on tiles, our main issue is that we always want to walk barefoot, even on uneven surfaces. This is dangerous.
I walk barefoot or it's a guide that the increase in health problems has followed the introduction of ceramics in homes.
The earth is cold and even.
When Farah was in Paris, she suffered from asthma.
Increased more
The woman makes sure to focus on walking barefoot on her heels.
Right now the foot's heel area, which is the back of the heel.
From here, this foot below the heel.
These are the first discovery. The second one is facilitating birth.
Just focus a bit.
In the seventh or ninth month
As soon as you enter the month of your birth, in general
It means they didn't come in 8/8th. The most dangerous thing is that she's walking barefoot.
Pregnant women should not walk barefoot.
If you enter the house at the time of birth.
I seek refuge in God from the Devil, the accursed. Shake towards you the trunk of the palm tree, and it shall drop upon you ripe, delicious dates.
We know that Mary's sustenance was brought to her.
That's how much it has changed; I discussed it with the scholars of science. They said, "Why has Ibn Kathir's interpretation changed?"
And I will not give you the idea that Allah has placed within this science and inspired me with it.
Shake towards you the trunk of the palm tree, as when the palms tremble, of course, how it comes naturally.
Sharp as a tack, just like little nails or pins.
When the palm tree shook, it gave orders to the branches that had grown heavier.
The viscera have given us orders to facilitate the birth by adjusting the fetus.
The baby's head height or something adjusts along and turns out normal.
Glory be to God! This fruit has so many benefits.
Hold the hand, start and guide her.
Some see it as a habit, while others know it's a real science.
They say fear makes you see things that don't exist.
Yes, Professor Abdulaziz. Your discoveries are truly remarkable.
Just wanted to know, the last question, time flies by so fast.
‏One wishes to communicate with you. Anyone who wishes to contact you can use a certain email address. Are you in?
The mobile phone is in the control room. Anyone who wants to contact Abdulaziz can call us after the show.
Of course, anyone from Qatar TV can contact us on this number.
I was created only to serve mankind.
If we hold this belief, may God bless you in your work and cause people to be well-disposed towards you.
Sin as people sin, and do whatever comes to a normal human being's mind.
Just aspire for more good
Think always of the good.
Our viewers, hopefully you also enjoyed this segment on reflexology and hand massage.
Also through the foot
We saw a live on-air demonstration of how our guest discovered the illnesses afflicting the person in question.
What does he suffer from? If you wish to help, please let us know. Anyone interested in communicating with him can also read about his story online.
How to implement it in the coming days and years if it will encompass more schools
Good morning
How can I access this experience?
In the name of God, the Most Merciful.
The obesity issue in the Gulf States has become a major problem.
We feared it was a fifth column they were operating with.
And the program means is that the First Lady in New York is honestly getting it done.
She visited Doha and they had a program planned for her.
They offered it to us and we adopted it. We're good with it.
It means our students with New York students with Spanish students with English students.
Even our brothers the students in Qatar , how do they fare against the rest of the world ? That's what we aim for in the future .
Because we promote eating fruit among the students
He stops exercising.
Of course, this is your fifth week's family meal with the family.
Of course, two birds with one stone.
Of course, the sixth week is when he talks about the benefits of this experience. We are grateful today on this conclusion.
So we're happy in the students.
They were three independent boys' schools: Abu Obeida
Independent girls Ragia
Our morale is high.
The family is aware, their brothers got excited at home and started eating this food just like them.
It became a rampant affair among the students, even extending to Al-Sqaaf's family and home life.
They say that's how they made me, or that's what they taught me.
The coaching staff or the one who was delivering this information to the students
How did you choose him How was the communication with the students through whom
Yes, indeed. We are very grateful to several organizations that have helped us.
And our brothers at taught them about a diet center, and also about eating healthy food.
Learn dining etiquette with A'isha Al-Tamimi
How do they prioritize? How do they eat? How do they arrange things?
To teach cooking, sports, or to raise awareness about healthy food benefits.
It was in the form of separate lessons, not curricula or anything.
How was it getting these ideas across to the students?
In a variety of ways, some within the school
We started the program with a day at Aspire Zone, gathering all the students, boys and girls.
As this issue isn't about anyone in particular, it concerns all of us. These are our children we're talking about.
How did their studies start?
That's exactly what I meant, the results were satisfactory.
But is three schools , or certain classes from those schools , enough ?
Now we are the first experience in the world, as things are only just beginning and not yet widespread.
It starts on a reasonably good scale, with all the independent traits of both sons and daughters.
So as to comply with our culture, for example, and our environment, and the circumstances of families, they accept certain things for their children that they would not accept otherwise.
Fibonacci actually means they participate in them and they are really important.
The student is twelve or thirteen years old; it's the perfect time for him to learn about his health.
This means many people wish to be weak, but they think it's an impossibility.
Some of the heroes we see in movies these days are so skinny; it's like a supernatural phenomenon.
We spoke in detail, but unfortunately there are many weeks where we didn't manage to cover it all.
Through the morning of Doha, we can also remind them.
And fruits that contain vitamin B, which can be obtained from fruits or vegetables.
So man knows the benefits of fruits, and he knows that eating them improves his health. This gives him the morale to carry on.
Hi, in the fruit section they were going to the supermarket and choosing their fruit.
For example, this point.
Means diversification, of course they competed. Each school excelled in its teachers with unique ideas.
The spirit of competition, the will to win, burns fiercely within me.
We gave them the general idea, and everyone can now showcase their brilliance.
The teachers here are the ones who train the students; there is no special cadre for that.
We train them. We train them.
Just means the teachers would add, for example, some schools like Abu 'Ubaydah decided that Saturday would be dedicated to student activities.
For example, on this day outside of school hours, they decided to adopt Rania's school. They said they would organize a march.
We're organizing a day of healthy cooking, girls only! The boys aren't forced to participate, as it's the girls who are more skilled in the healthy culinary arts.
Of course, thanks to Rayan Waters, who provided all the water for the schools for free. Rayan Waters has done a great job here.
Of course, it means more healthy water because he will need to purify his body from all these toxic substances that enter his body daily through the water.
This week we say: third
It means his body has started moving.
They can play football or basketball, but they don't know that this is the sport I love.
True true exactly Some might want other games and some might not want a multiplayer game.
How live on air.
Mr. Abdul Aziz Al-Jaber, the founder and manager of the Qatar Association of Neurological Patients. Welcome!
And of course, we try our best to focus on most of the important topics.
We wanted to get to know and let our dear viewers know what Neurofibromatosis is.
Because this so-called "Lord" may also seem rather strange to us. Please.
The number of infected women is higher than the number of infected men.
All currently available treatments are preventative.
The white blood cells that are supposed to protect us start fighting us.
We fought by hitting the nerve cell.
The easiest one for the audience is an electric wire.
Covered with a layer called the *malin* for shaking it off, which is a nylon layer.
Of course, this generally leads to imbalance, double vision, and blurry vision.
can lead to problems in the digestive respiratory system
leads to madness in its worst form leads to quadriplegia or paraplegia
Of course, the treatments.
The most of the most important functions in the human body can be severely disrupted.
I suffer from a disease called Neuropathy.
Theories suggest it's a viral transmission.
It is a non-contagious disease.
and is not inherited.
Some consider it a disease, depending on the region.
But the equator for instance was completely spared.
Right now we have cases on the equator line that are infected with this disease.
The disease so far has no cure, as its cause is unknown.
So far, scientists have been unable to determine the cause of the disease in order to find a cure.
The current process is a reverse process.
They try to avoid the very effect of the disease on the human body.
They try to start from the back, in other words.
We're a little scared of this topic, which means we can say this disease might suddenly appear.
There's a certain group who feel that this disease is spreading within a specific age group.
It was globally ranked from 20 to 40th place for years.
Currently, the international organization for the same disease has lowered the age from twenty to fifteen.
He has been hitting the falconer's arm for forty years.
But it does not heal the human
Of course, we are even open to alternative medicine and prophetic medicine.
Yes, through its affiliation with the Qatar Association for Neurological Patients.
What is the reason for the existence of this association?
Indeed, it's a vast collection, which is why we thought of creating a connection for this topic.
Of course, I'll give you some random numbers.
In Kuwait, it is said that there are twelve thousand infected.
One thousand wounded
The rest of the Gulf countries range between 100 and 300 cases.
I was diagnosed five years ago.
It was sixty-four.
Are there some symptoms that indicate to a person that they actually have this disease?
And we do not have confirmation that it is a virus. That's why we don't want to adopt a certain theory. This is our stance.
The second point is how can I know if I am infected or not?
This is very difficult.
I got lost, Mr. Abdulaziz, while trying to find a specific point.
