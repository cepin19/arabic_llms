<h1> Chapter Thirty-One: The Elect in the Kingdom of Heaven </h1>
And He called the twelve together, and said to them, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things will be accomplished there which were written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man. For He will be delivered to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they will condemn Him to death, and will deliver Him to the Gentiles. And they will mock Him, and scourge Him, and crucify Him, and He will be raised on the third day." Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Him with her sons, worshiping Him and requesting something from Him. And He said to her, "What do you wish?" She said to Him, "Command that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on the left, in Your kingdom." Jesus answered, "You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They said to Him, "We are able." He said to them, "My cup indeed you shall drink; but to sit on My right and on My left, this is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father." And when the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers. But Jesus called them to Himself and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant. And whoever desires to be first among you shall be your slave; just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many." Luke 22:24-27
And he gave the baby to Jesus to hold, and when he had taken him in his arms, Jesus said,
Truly I tell you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Mark
But whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And whoever welcomes Walid in such a way, welcomes me.
And the one who fell into the sins was one of these young believers. It would be best for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be thrown into the depths of the sea.
Alas, the people of this world, for the things that cause sins! For they will surely come to pass. But woe betide the one who causes them!
But if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. Matthew 18:8
But if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye, than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. Matthew 5:29
Do not arouse them, for I tell you: Their angels in heaven are always watching over them who are in heaven.**
The way of the son of man came to save the ones who were being cleansed. # 18‏.11 This verse is not found in many old manuscripts.
What do you think? If a man with a hundred sheep prays to one of them and then lets it go, won't he leave the ninety-nine in the mountains and go in search of the one he prayed to?
<h1>Now I'll tell you the truth: he will rejoice even more than the one who found the lost ninety sheep.</h1>
«Even the angels in the sky don't want any of these little ones to perish.» The uncle whose sin
"Except your brother's sin, your right is yours. Go to him and argue your case in private, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. Luke."
Or he won't listen. You need one or two people with you so every word can be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
Or he won't listen to them, tell the people of the church; and if he still won't listen, regard him like an idolater, or a tax collector.
I say unto you: whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Matthew 16:19; John 20:23.
And again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.
Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, there I am among them." The example of the servant who does not forgive.
And Peter came up and said to him, "Lord, how often shall I forgive my brother who sins against me? As many as seven times?" Luke
And Jesus said to him: "Not seven times, but seventy times seven."
Regarding this, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves.
And when he began to settle accounts with them, they brought him a certain man who owed him a great sum of money, namely, a million dinars in silver.
And when he had nothing left to repay the loan, his master ordered him to sell himself, his wife, his children and all his possessions.
And the servant prostrated and said: "Be patient, my Master. I will surely return to you all that is yours."
His master took pity on him, divorced him, and waived the debt he owed.
When that servant left, he found one of his fellow slaves whom he owed a hundred dirhams. He seized him, demanding: "Give me back what I lent you!"
And his friend fell at his feet, begging him, and said to him: "Please wait, and I will pay you back what I owe you."
But he refused. So he seized him and threw him in jail until he repays the debt he owes.
When the slaves saw what had happened to their companions, they were deeply saddened and went to inform their master.
And he's calling out to his master, saying: "Oh, this servant who is good for nothing! I allowed you to renounce the whole debt since you desired it,
Why didn't you show your friend the same mercy you showed me?
His mistress is worried, she sends him to prison to be tortured until he returns what he owes.
The way is going to be prepared for you by the One above, if each one of you sincerely forgives his brother.
Chapter Thirty-Eight: Jesus Teaches about Divorce
When Jesus had finished saying these things, He left Galilee and went into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
And many groups of people followed Him there and He healed them.
And the Pharisees came to him, and questioned him, saying, "Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? testing him."
And he answers them: "Haven't you read in the Book of God that He created mankind as a single being, male and female?"
<b>Gal: That's why a man should stay with his mother and not get married. They'd both be better off as a pair.</b>
And they won't remain two, but will become one. What God has joined together, man cannot separate.''
And the Pharisees asked him, "Why did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce, and send her away?"
And Jesus answered them: "Because of the hardness of your hearts Moses permitted you to divorce your wives; but from the beginning it was not so.
"I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery." Matthew 5:32, 1 Corinthians 7:10–11
And he told his students: "If this is how a man treats a woman, it's better for him not to marry at all".
And Jesus answered them: "Not everyone can receive this word, but only those to whom it has been given.
There are those who have been born of dead wombs, those whom people have kept apart, and those who have not married in this age. Whoever understands this will understand it." Jesus then took the children in his arms and blessed them.
And they brought him little children that he should hold them in his arms and pray with them. And the disciples rebuked those who brought them.
But Jesus said, "Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of heaven."
And he placed his hands on them and walked away. The young man who had been standing there was now gone.
And a young man came to him and said: "Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?"
And Jesus answered him, "Why do you ask me about what is good? One there is who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments."
And He said to him, "What are the commandments?" Jesus answered, "You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,
"Treat your neighbour's property as you treat your own, and what is dear to them, as you treat your own head."
The young man asks: «What else do I need to do? I've fulfilled all these commandments!».
And Jesus answered him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me."
But when the young man heard this, he became sad, for he was very much ashamed.
Jesus said to his disciples: «Verily I say unto you, It is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven.
And we tell you: It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God!
The students were very surprised when they heard this and exclaimed: "On that account, who could ever succeed?"
And Jesus looked at them and said, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered him, "We have left everything to follow you. What then will there be for us?"
And Jesus said to them: *Verily I say unto you, In the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel*. Matthew 19:28.
Whoever gives up his wealth, his siblings, his sisters, his father, his mother, his children, and his property for My Sake, will receive manifold what he has given up, and he will be granted eternal life.
"Many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first." Matthew 20:16, Luke 13:30
Chapter Twenty: The Servants' Hall of the Heavenly Vineyard
The path to the Kingdom of Heaven is like a vineyard owner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He gave them a dinar for the day and sent them to his heavens.
And out came Jawiyah al Saud di morning and found other servants standing idle in the market.
He tells them: "Go and work in my gardens, and I will pay you what you deserve."
And he went out. Again he went out at about noontime, and at three in the afternoon he sent out others.
And he went out again the fifth hour of the afternoon, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
And they answered: Not one of us has served him. He said to them: Go then, and work in my paradise.
When evening came, the master of the garden said to his agent: 'Call all the servants and give them their pay, beginning with the last and ending with the first.'
And he gave them the five dinars, each of them receiving one.
And when the two lollipops came, they were charged an extra price, but they only received one dirham each.
When they were done, they started looking around the King's Mall.
Kechaoulo: Those others only worked one hour and you're giving them the same pay as us who have been slaving away all day in the sun.
He's replying to one of the King's men, saying: "My friend, I haven't wronged you in any way. Did we agree on a dinar together?"
Go away and leave me alone! This is the last straw. I was the one who wanted to give it to you myself.
«Don't I have the right to do with my money as I please? Or are you envious because I'm generous?»
And Jesus said, "The last shall be first, and the first last." Matthew 19:30; Mark 10:31; Luke 13:30 Jesus prophesied for the third time about His death and resurrection.
And when Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside by themselves, and said to them on the way:
Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn Him to death.
And they will deliver him to the one whom they do not know, and he will be mocked and struck and spit upon, and he will be killed and on the third day raised to life." Mary, the mother of James and John, asks Jesus about her sons.
A woman named Mary of Magdalene and her children came to Jesus, and she prostrated herself before Him, requesting that He help her in a certain matter.
What do you want?" she asked. "I wish that my two sons may sit one on your right and the other on your left in your kingdom," she said.
He answered, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup I am going to drink?" "We can," they answered.
I'll tell them: "Yes, you can drink my wine, but the glass on my right and the glass on my left won't be given to you, because those are reserved for my true friends."
When the ten heard this, they were indignant with Jacob and John.
And He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be a house of prayer'; but you have made it a den of thieves." Luke.
And this should not be among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant. Mark 10:43
And whoever wants to be the first among you, must be your servant.
Thus was the Son of Man born, not to be served by human beings, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many." Jesus healed two blind men.
And when they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed Him.
And two blind men were sitting by the road side: and when they heard that Jesus passed by, they cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.
Despite the public's animosity towards them in an attempt to make them be quiet, they increased their clamour, crying: "Have mercy on us, O our Lord, O son of David!"
And Jesus stopped and said, «What do you want Me to do for you?»
They answered him: 'We wish our eyes could behold the sight!'
And Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes. And immediately they received their sight, and followed him.
<h1>Chapter Twenty One</h1> <h2>Jesus Enters Jerusalem</h2>
And when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount called Olivet, he sent forth two of his disciples;
Tell them: "Go to the roundabout ahead of you. You will find a she-donkey tied up, with a young male donkey. Untie them and bring them to me."
«Otherwise, tell them just one thing: God needs them and will reward them instantly.»
And all this came to pass in order to fulfil the Prophet's saying:
Say to the daughter of Zion: "Behold, your King is coming to you, Humble, and mounted on a donkey, A colt, the foal of a donkey."
And the disciples went out, two by two, and did what Jesus had commanded them.
And they brought the donkey and the colt , put their clothes on them , and Jesus sat upon them .
A large group of people spread their belongings on the road, while others cut down tree branches and laid them on the road.
And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.
And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying: «Who is this?»
And the crowds answered them: "This is Jesus, the Prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus was walking in the temple, teaching.
And Jesus entered the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;
He told them: «It is written in the Book of God that my house will be called the House of Prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves!».
And there came to him, at the House of God, people who were blind, lame and sick.
But the chief priests and the scribes, when they saw the wonderful things that He did, and the children crying out in the temple and saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David!"
And He said to them, "Have you never read what the Scripture says: 'Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have perfected praise'?"
And when He had finished speaking, He said to the disciples, "Let's go up to Jerusalem. And when we have arrived, we will celebrate the Passover." So they went up, and when they arrived in Jerusalem, Jesus sent two disciples ahead, saying to them, "Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here. If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' just say this: 'The Lord needs it.'" And those who were sent ahead went and found it just as He had told them. And as they were untying the donkey, its owners said to them, "Why are you untying the donkey?" And they said, "The Lord needs it." And they brought it to Jesus, and threw their cloaks on the donkey, and He sat on it. And many spread their cloaks on the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them on the road. And the crowds who went ahead of Him, and those who followed were shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!" "Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!" "Hosanna in the highest!" And Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple. And when He had looked around at everything, as it was already late, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.
And when morning came, he was hungry.
And he saw a fig tree by the wayside, and he went to it, but found nothing on it except leaves. And he said to it, &ldquo;May no fruit ever come from you again!&rdquo; And the fig tree withered away at once.
When the students saw what had happened, they were amazed and exclaimed: "How did the vine grow so fast?"
And Jesus answered them, "Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it will obey your voice.
"Ask whatever you want in prayer with faith and you will receive it." Who gave authority to Jesus?
And when Jesus entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching, and said, "By what authority are You doing these things? And who gave You this authority?"
And Jesus answered them: "I also will ask you one question, and you answer Me:
Where does John's baptism come from? Is it from God or from man?" They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From God,' he will ask, 'Why then did you not believe John?'
"Otherwise it would have come from the people, we're afraid of the public because they think John is a prophet."
And they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And He said to them, "Nor do I tell you by what authority I do these things." The parable of the two sons.
Ash had two sons. He went to the first and said: "Go my son, work today in my vineyard.
His son answered him: I don't want to. But he changed his mind at the last moment and left.
And Abu walked up to the second boy and said to him what he had said to the first one. The boy replied: Even if I wanted to, sir!, but he didn't move.
«Who are the two men who have done Murad's work?» And they answered, «The first.» Then Jesus said to them, «I tell you the truth: the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the Kingdom of God ahead of you.
Since John the Baptist prepared your way, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him; and even after seeing it, you did not repent and believe him." Luke 3:12; 7:29,30 The parable of the vineyard and the vinedressers.
They heard another parable: "A man had a vineyard, and fenced it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower; and he let it out to tenants, and went into another country.
And when the time for gathering grapes came, he sent his slaves to the vineyard to collect his produce.
The gardeners fought with the slaves, beat one of them, killed another, and stoned yet another.
And he sent other slaves more than the previous two, and treated them as he had treated the others.
And in the end, he sent them his son, saying: They will respect my son.
But when the gardeners saw the young boy from the neighbourhood, they said to each other: "This is the one who will inherit it all! Let's kill him and take his inheritance!"
And they enticed him and led him out of the garden of the grapevines and killed him.
"Iwa, ila ja moul el jnan de l'eneb, achnoue khasse yder ldouk ljananiya?".
And they answered: "The evil-doers will end badly. The heavenly vineyards will be given to other gardeners who will harvest the ripe grapes at the proper time."
And Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The very stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner; This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?
Behold, I say unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.
"Whoever falls on this stone will have his limbs crushed, and the one on whom it falls will be smashed to pieces."
And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they understood that he was speaking about them.
They started looking for ways to capture him, but they were afraid of the crowds, as they believed he was a prophet.
Chapter Twenty Dragon and the Wedding Procession
Once more Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who arranged a marriage feast for his son.
And he sent his slaves to summon those who had been invited, but they didn't want to come.
And he sent more servants, saying to them: 'Tell those who are invited, "Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fat calves are killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding!"'
But some of them didn't heed it. Some went to their farms and others went about buying and selling,
And two others of those exhibited his slaves, mocked them, and killed them.
The king grew concerned and sent his army, who killed those murderers and burnt down their city.
He tells his slaves: The wedding feast is ready, but those we offered it to are not worthy.
Let's go out and meet on the crossroads and invite everyone we run into to the wedding.
And the slaves went out into the streets and gathered everyone they found, good or bad, and the house of the bride was filled with guests.
And when the king went to see the guests, a man appeared before him who was not dressed in wedding attire.
He asks her: "Why did you come here my friend, without wearing the wedding attire?" The man fell silent because he had nothing to say.
And the king said to the servants: 'Seize him, bind him hand and foot, and cast him into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
Many are called, but few are chosen.**
And the Pharisees at that very hour sent out spies, who should feign themselves righteous, to catch Him in His words.
And they are sending to him their disciples with the Herodians, and say to him, "Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God in truth, and you do not care about anyone, for you do not regard the person of men.
"What has appeared to you, Lina? Should we pay the tax to Caesar or not?"
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said unto them: Why do ye tempt me, ye hypocrites?
«How do you want to be paid? Cash or check?» They brought him a dinar.
And they asked: "Whose picture is this, and whose writing is on the money?"
Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's, and unto God that which is God's.
And when they heard it, they were amazed and walked away. The matter of the resurrection of the dead.
Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and asked him a question: "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies, leaving a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow. Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married, and died; then the second 2 took the widow, and likewise died, and so did the third. In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman also died. In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be? For the seven had married her."
O Sir, said Musa: If a man dies and leaves no sons, his brother shall marry his wife, and perform the levirate duty; and the first son born shall be deemed the son of the deceased brother.
And we had seven brothers. The first one married and died. As he had no children, he left his wife to his brother to marry her.
And so it happened to the second, the third, up to the seventh.
And in the end, after they all died, she too passed away.
Who among these seven will be this woman's husband on the Day of Judgment? For all of them were once her husbands."
And Jesus answered and said unto them: Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
When the day comes that I send them, the people will not marry nor will anyone marry them. They will be like angels in heaven.
As for the sending forth of the dead, have you not read the words of Allah:
I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.".
And when those groups of people heard his words, they were amazed at his teaching. The Great Testament.
And when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
And one of them, a doctor of the law, tested Jesus, saying:
"O my master, what is the greatest commandment in the law?"
And Jesus answered him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind."
This is my sole and final will.
And the second commandment is like unto it: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
«On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets». Luke 10:25-28 Christ and the Prophet David
When the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
"Who do you say that I am?" And Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of David!"`
He asks them: "How is it that David, through the inspiration of the Spirit of God, called out: 'The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at My right hand'?"
The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool."
"How can Christ be his son, when David calls him 'my Lord'?""
Not a single person could utter a word in response, and from that day on, no one dared to ask him any further questions.
Chapter Twenty Three Jesus Warns the Disciples about the Scribes and Pharisees
And Jesus spoke to the people, and to His disciples:
The scholars of the Law and the Pharisees are the ones entitled to interpret the Law of Moses.
Do as Eva Ga'al tells you, follow her, but do not mimic their actions, for they do not practice what they preach.
They tie up bundles and put them on people's shoulders, but they themselves won't lift a finger to help carry them.
Or they do things just to show off, expand their sleeves and forehead tattoos, and grow their hair long.
Keeps being first in line at parties and first row in mosques.
People in the markets greet them and call out: "Yes, sir."
But don't let anyone cry for you: Oh Lord, you are all brothers and have one Master.
And do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, the heavenly Father.
Do not let anyone make you cry: A teacher, you have one teacher, and that is Christ.
And let the greater among you be as the younger, and the leader as him who serves. Mark 10:43
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted. Luke 14:11; 18:14.
But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the Kingdom of Heaven in people's faces. You do not enter yourselves, nor do you allow those who would enter to go in.
But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers; therefore you shall receive greater condemnation. # 23:14 This verse is not found in many ancient manuscripts.
Woe to you, hypocritical scholars of the law and Pharisees! You traverse land and sea to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves!
Oh you blind officials! They say that an oath taken by the House of God is not binding, but one sworn by the gold of the House of God must be fulfilled.
O you fools and blind ones! Isn't gold more sacred than the House of God which returns gold?
And he swore again: An oath by the altar is not binding, but an oath by the gift on the altar must be fulfilled.
O you hypocrites! Why is it [forbidden]? Is it the sacrificial animal? Or is it the altar where the animal is slaughtered, that is sacred?
Whoever swears by the slaughterhouse also swears by everything above it.
And the one who swears by the House of God, swears by God Himself and by the One who dwells within.
And the one who swears by the heavens, swears by the throne of God, and by the One who sits upon it. Matthew 5:34
Woe to you, scholars of the law and you hypocritical Pharisees! You tithe on mint, dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy and faith. It is these you ought to have practised without neglecting the others.
O you public officials! You drain the water out of the laws but fill the camels.
Woe to you, hypocritical scholars of the law and Pharisees! You meticulously clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside you are full of greed and robbery.
O you Pharisees, you cleanse the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness!
Woe to you, hypocritical scholars of the law and Pharisees! You are like whitewashed tombs, which appear beautiful on the outside, but inside are full of the bones of the dead and all manner of impurity.
Thus you appear righteous to people, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and sin.
Woe to you, hypocritical scholars of the law and Pharisees! You build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous,
If we had lived in the time of our ancestors, we would have participated in the battle of the prophets.
So you bear witness against yourselves that you are the sons of those who killed the prophets.
Go on with what your ancestors started.
O Had al-Hanash, the trickery of Al-Lafa'i! How will you manage to escape the torment of Hell? Never!
That is why we shall send to you prophets, wise men and teachers of the Law; some of them you will kill and crucify, others you will flog in your mosques and pursue from one town to another.
May the punishment for the blood of every innocent victim that has been shed on the earth come upon you, from the blood of Abel, who was righteous in the eyes of God, to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.
Behold, I am about to bring to you, O generation, a heavy calamity! Behold, I will bring down calamity on this generation.» The love of Jesus for Jerusalem.
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you! How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.
And your house will remain desolate.
And Hannah said, "Only the Lord could have brought me up to this point. He sees me! He has given me a glorious future! As for my husband, the Lord has judged between me and him in regard to your sons."
Chapter Twenty-four: Jesus Foretells the Destruction of the Temple
And Jesus went out, and He walked to the temple. His disciples followed Him, and He showed them the offerings of the children in the temple.
Jesus said to them, "Have you seen all these things? Truly, I tell you, not one stone will be left upon another; all will be thrown down." The Signs of the End Times.
When Jesus sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
And Jesus answered them, "Take heed that no one deceives you."
I will meet many people and they will take my name and say: "I am the Messiah!" And they will deceive many.
And you will hear of wars and rumours of wars, but see that you are not troubled! For all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
When one people will rise against another, and one kingdom against another, there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
But that's not the end of my woes.
The clock's rooster will announce your torment and your death. All the peoples of the world will hate you because of my name. Soon.
And the clock's dick makes many people lose their faith, betray one another and hate each other.
And they made many of the prophets lie, and they misled many people.
Out of so many sins, the love of many people has grown cold.

Chapter Twenty Five: The Ten of Singles
And the kingdom of heaven is like unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. Luke
And there were five of them wearing veils, and five others without veils, sensible.
And those five shook the beehives without adding any oil.
The five wise ones brought their lanterns and oil in flasks.
And when the groom broke down, all the singles started to flock together until they fell asleep.
And in the middle of the night, you can hear a loud voice shouting: Here comes the groom! Get up and go out to meet him!
And all the bachelors rose, and found their sweethearts.
<b>Give some of your oil to the wise women, as our lamps are about to go out.</b>
But the sensible ones answered them: He can't provide enough for both you and us. Go and buy it from those who are selling it.
And when they were going to buy oil, the groom arrived, and those who were present for the wedding feast entered with him, and the door was shut.
And the bachelors returned to the others and called out: Oh sir, oh sir, open up for us! Lock
But the groom answered: To tell you the truth, I don't know you.
Surely, He is aware of it, for the day and the hour [of the coming of the Son of Man] are known to none, not even the angels. The last part of this verse is found in few of the ancient manuscripts.
"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was going on a journey, and he called his servants and entrusted his money to them. Luke ."
He gave the first man 500 dirhams, the second two purses and the third only one. Each received according to his ability. He travels.
And he who took the five coins and traded with them, gained another five coins in profit.
And he who had received two talents also gained two more.
And he who took the purse, dug a hole in the ground and hid the purse his master had given him there.
After a long while, Mr. Diall's slave returned and settled accounts with them.
He came to him and gave him five more dirhams and said: "Here are the five dirhams you gave me. Here are the other five you've earned."
Your lady says: I have nothing to ask you, you're a good and trustworthy servant! You've proven trustworthy in small matters, now I'll entrust you with much more. Come, rejoice with your master.
And then he said: "My lord, you gave me two hundred dirhams, here are two more that I won additionally."
My lord, I have nothing to ask you. You are a good and trustworthy servant! You have proven trustworthy in a little, now I entrust you with much. Come, rejoice with your master.
And then the other one, who had a purse, came to him and said: "Sir, I know you are a harsh man, reaping what you have not sown and gathering what you have not scattered."
And out of fear of this, I hid your purse in the ground. There it is, that's your fortune.
She replies: "You're a nasty, ungrateful slave! Do you think I'm not aware of what I sow and what I reap?"
Iwa, you should have put my money with merchants M-for-money, so that when I return, I can retrieve it with its profit.
Give him some of that purse and add it to the one who has ten purses.
For everyone who has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. But the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.
"And this servant, who was useless to his master, cast him out into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Matthew 8:12, 22:13; Luke 13:28. The Son of Man will judge the nations.

When I was hungry, you gave me food; when I was thirsty, you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and you invited me in.
And they stripped me naked, and clothed me not. They took me to hospital, and put me in prison, and they came to me.
The clock's rooster said: O Lord, when have we seen You hungry and fed You, or thirsty and gave You drink?
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you? Or naked, and clothe you?
When did we see you ill or in prison and come to you?
And the king answered them: I tell you the truth: Each time you did this to one of these my brothers, even the least of them, you did it to me!.
And on his left hand the second, and to them it shall be said: Depart ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
When I was hungry you did not feed me, when I was thirsty you did not give me drink.
And you did not welcome me as a stranger, nor clothe me as one naked, nor visit me when I was ill and in prison.
And the clock's ticking: When, O Lord, have we seen You hungry or thirsty, a stranger or naked, ill or in prison, and failed to serve You?
And the king answered them: Behold, I grant you a true grant; I have not done this for any who have rank among you, nor shall I do so.

Chapter Twenty Six: The Jews of Caiaphas plot to kill Jesus
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he told his disciples:
"You know that Easter will be in two days, and they will deliver the Son of Man to be crucified."
And the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the court of the high priest, named Caiaphas;
And they plotted to seize Jesus by stealth and kill him.
But Galou: "We shouldn't do this during the holiday, so as not to cause chaos among the people." The woman who poured perfume on Jesus.
And when Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper,
The woman sitting at the dinner table had an expensive perfume bottle and generously spritzed its contents onto her head.
When his students saw what he had done, they were not pleased and exclaimed: "Why this waste?"
"When this smell could be sold for a high price, and its value distributed among the poor."
And when Jesus knew what was done, He said unto them, For what cause do ye trouble the woman: she hath wrought a good work upon me.
The poor will always be with you, but I will not always be with you.
And it's filled with the scent of her presence, a scent that haunts me deeply. It's as if the perfume was worn to mark my skin.
<b>I tell you the truth</b>: wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her." <i>Judas the traitor</i> agreed to hand over Jesus.
And for your sake, Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the chief priests,
He asked them: "What will you give me if I hand him over to you?". They agreed on thirty pieces of silver.
From then on, Judas sought an opportunity to betray Jesus. The Passover meal with the disciples.
And on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
And he said to them: "Go into the city and meet a certain man, and tell him: 'The Master says: My time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'"
And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the Passover.
And when it was evening, Jesus sat down to eat with the twelve disciples.
And while they were having dinner, he said to them: "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me."
The students were very sad, and each one began to ask themselves: "Is it me, sir?".
He tells them: "Anyone who wants to be with me had better put their hand in the dish! That's the one who'll deliver me!"
Man's fate is sealed, he will die as written in the Book of Allah. But woe to that man who delivers him, it would have been better for him if he had never been born.
Is it I, Master? Jesus answered, You have said it. The Lord's Supper.
When He had given thanks, He broke it, and said, "Take, eat; this is My body."
And after Allah's name, he said: "Drink from it all of you,"
This is my blood, the blood of the covenant which will be shed for many, so that their sins may be forgiven.
Unicorn Lake: From today onwards, we won't drink this grape juice until the day comes when we can enjoy it with you again in the Kingdom of Ba.
And they praised God, and returned from the mount called Olivet. And when Jesus had spoken, behold, a cloud received him out of their sight. And as they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go up. And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen. Peter also denied Jesus, as prophesied.
And Jesus said unto them, This night ye shall have cause to be offended in me: for it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.
But after I have been raised from the dead, I will go before you to Galilee." Matthew
And Peter answered him, "Though all may deny you, I will never deny you."
And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.
And Peter answered Him, "Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!" And all the disciples said the same. Jesus went on ahead to the Garden of Gethsemane.
And He took with Him Peter and James and John, and began to be deeply distressed and troubled. And He said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and keep watching with Me."
And after that Peter and the sons of Zebedee took him aside and began to be sorrowful and troubled.
He tells them: «My soul is very sad, even to the point of death. Stay here and keep me company!»
And then he prostrated and started praying, saying: "O Lord! Please, if it is possible, take this trial away from me. Not as I wish, but as You wish."
And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me even for one hour?
"They watched and prayed so that they would not fall into temptation, for the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
He walked for the second time and prayed, "Oh Lord! If it is not possible for this trial to pass me by, then let Your Will be done."
And he came back and found them asleep, for weariness had overcome them.
And he left them again and prayed for the third time, repeating the same words.
From afar, he went to his students and said to them: "Are you still sleeping and at ease? Behold, the hour is approaching when the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of sinners,"
Let's get up and go! Behold, the one who will betray me is at hand." Jesus said this.
And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived—and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs, sent out by the chief priests and elders of the people.
And that man who gave them the sign said: "The one I'll kiss is the man, grab him!"
And behold, a woman who was bent over and could not straighten up at all, came to him. And when Jesus saw her, he called her and said to her, "Woman, you are freed from your ailment." And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she stood up straight and glorified God.
He said to Jesus, "Why have you come to me, Lord?" And he fell at Jesus' feet.
And one of the bystanders, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's slave, cutting off his ear.
And Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place; for all those who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you really think I can't call Papa right now and have him send over a dozen angel squadrons?
But how can the words in the Quran, which state that this is how it shall be, come true?"
And Jesus said to them, "Why have you come out with swords and clubs to seize Me, as though I were a robber? Every day I used to sit and teach in the temple, and you did not seize Me. Luke
But all this took place that the Scriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left Him and fled. Jesus before the Sanhedrin.
But those who had arrested Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.
Peter followed him at a distance, right into the high priest's courtyard. He went in and sat with the servants to see the outcome of it all.
The chief priests and the scribes were seeking false testimony against Jesus to put him to death,
But they didn't find anything, even though they produced many false witnesses. Eventually, two witnesses came forward.
And they said: "This man said: 'I am able to destroy the Temple of God and to rebuild it in three days'." John.
Isn't there anything you have to say in your defence against these charges?&nbsp;
But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest said to Him, "I adjure You, by the living God, tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God."
And Jesus answered him: «Get behind me, Satan! But I say to you, behold the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of God, who has heaven and earth.»
And the clock's rooster crows, the Chief of the religious men fetches his belongings and says: "This is blasphemy! We no longer have any use for witnesses, you've all heard his blasphemous words."
"What did Eva say to Ash? She said: 'You deserve to die!'"
They made him lie down on his face and beat him. Two of them slapped him.
Peter said: "Lord, who hit You?"
Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant girl came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean!"
And he stood up in front of everyone present and said: «I don't know what to write!»
And then he went into the house. And behold, the servant whom he had wounded met him, and said to those who stood there: 'This is one of them that was with Jesus of Nazareth.'
And Peter denied it again with an oath: "I do not know this man!"
Surely you are one of them, for your accent betrays you."
And he started swearing and cursing: «I swear I don't know this man!». And at that very moment the rooster crowed.
Peter remembered the words Jesus had spoken to him: *"Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times."* He went outside and wept bitterly.
Chapter Twenty Seven
And in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people plotted against Jesus to put him to death.
And they bound him and led him away to Pilate the governor. Judas Iscariot hanged himself.
And the clock struck three when Judas saw the man he had betrayed, and brought the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
He told them: «I have sinned because I have delivered an innocent man into your hands». They said: «Not our problem, sort yourself out».
And Judas threw the silver pieces into the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.
And the chiefs of the religious men took the silver, saying: 'It is not lawful for us to put it in the Treasury of the House of God, for it is the price of blood.'
They agreed to buy the land of Al-Fakhari and turn it into an outside garden.
And that's why people still talk about the blood that was shed there to this very day.
And the clock's dial made good on what the Lord revealed to the Prophet Jeremiah, saying: "Take the thirty pieces of silver, the price agreed on by the people of Israel, "
"And for this reason, at such a price, God's clay vessel acquired me. Jesus before Pilate."
And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest it.
When the heads of the religious men and the elders accused him, he didn't respond to any of them.
Did you not hear all their witness statements against you?"
And Jesus did not answer him a word; and the governor marvelled greatly.
The governor's custom was to release one prisoner, whomever the crowd requested.
And they had a prisoner called Jesus Barabbas.
When the people assembled, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release for you: Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
When Pilate saw that he was gaining no headway, but that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves."
When Pilate was seated on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous Man; for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of Him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas to be released and Jesus killed.
Pilate therefore said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas or Jesus?".
He said to them, "What shall I do then with Jesus who is called Christ?". They all said to him, "Crucify him!".
He asked them: "What evil have I done?". But they shouted even louder: "Crucify him!"
And when Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that the crowd was growing tumultuous, he took water and washed his hands before the people, saying, «I am innocent of this Man's blood; see to it yourselves.»
And the whole people respond, saying: «Let his blood be on us and on our children!»
And they released Barabbas for them; but Jesus, after scourging Him, they delivered up to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
And the ruler's soldiers led Jesus to the palace, and assembled the whole cohort.
And they dressed him in a red cloak.
They wove a crown of thorns, placed it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They jumped on him and took the pipe, hitting him on the head with it.
And after they had mocked Him, they took off His robe and put His own clothes back on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him. Jesus was crucified.
As they were leaving the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon, and they imposed on him to carry Jesus' cross.
And they arrived at the place which is called Golgotha, which means Place of a Skull.
They gave him wine mixed with a herb called 'Al-Mer'. When he tasted it, he didn't want to drink it.
They crucified him and divided his belongings among themselves after they had gambled for his clothes.
And they stayed sitting down as if they were statues.
And above his head they placed a written inscription of his crime: 'This is Jesus, the King of the Jews'.
And the clock's rooster was crucified with two thieves, one on his right and the other on his left.
The passers-by were making fun of him and shaking their heads in derision.
Kiyyalo: "I am going to rebuild the House of God in three days. If you are a son of God, come down from the Cross!" Matthew
And the chiefs, the religious leaders, the scholars of the law, and the elders would laugh at him and say:
He saved others, but he couldn't save his own head! If he is the King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him!
"Yaqu! He relies on God! Let him free him now, if he wishes, since he said: 'I am the son of God!'".
And even the thieves who were crucified with him mocked him in the same way. The death of Jesus.
And darkness fell upon the whole land from the sixth hour until the ninth hour.
And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" that is, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"
And two of them, who stood by, heard it, and said: «He calleth for Elijah.»
One of them ran and grabbed a piece of cloth, soaked it in oil and put it on the head of a flask, offering it to him to drink.
And they tell each other: «Let him be, let's see if Elijah comes to save him!».
And again Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
Raw data of the House of God in two's, from top to bottom. And the earthquakes splitting rocks.
And the graves sweeten and many a sacred person does death befall.
And they came out of the graves after Jesus' resurrection, and went into the holy city of Jerusalem, and appeared unto many.
And the captain of the temple guard and the officers saw the earthquake and what had happened, they were terrified, and said, "Truly, this was the Son of God."
And there was a great multitude of women who followed Him from Galilee, ministering to Him. They had seen Jesus heal the sick and raise the dead. Luke.
Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. The tomb of Jesus.
And in the evening, there came a certain man, whose name was Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus, from Arimathaea.
And the said man entered and came forward to Pontius Pilate, and requested the body of Jesus. Pilate therefore ordered that it should be given to him.
And Allah took the soul of Joseph while he was a pure shroud.
And he placed her in the new tomb which he had hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb, and departed.
And Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.
And the next day, which followed the Day of Preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees gathered together unto Pilate;
He told me: "That liar, even when he was alive, kept insisting that after three days he would be sent [somewhere]. When?
I have ordered the watch to be kept on the grave until the third day, so that his students don't come during the night to steal the body and tell the people: He has risen from the death! This latest lie would be even worse than the previous one.
He said to them, "You have a guard; go and make the grave as secure as you like."
They lit the chamber's candle and spun the wheel.
Chapter Twenty Eight: Jesus Raised from the Dead
And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint Jesus.
And suddenly there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord, descending from heaven, came and rolled back the stone from the door of the sepulchre, and sat upon it.
His aspect was of lightning's gleam, and his attire was white as snow.
And the guards trembled with fear; they became like dead men.
But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid! I know that you are seeking Jesus who was crucified.
Our way is not here, it's where he followed the death, as he said. Come see the place where it was put.
They will run quickly and tell his students that he is being pursued by death, and he will outpace you to Galilee. That is where you will see him."
And the women left the grave in a fluster, both afraid and extremely joyful, running to bring the news to his students.
And as He met them, He greeted them, saying, "Rejoice!" And they came and took hold of His feet and worshipped Him.
Jesus said to them: «Do not be afraid! Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; it is there that they will see me.» And the guards reported what had happened.
When the women were walking, some of the grave guards went to the city and informed the religious leaders about what had happened.
They gathered with the elders and consulted them. They bribed the soldiers with a lot of money.
Tell them: "My students came at night while we were asleep and stole it."
"Otherwise the governor will hear about it, we'll make sure he's on our side, you won't have any bad luck."
And the moneychangers took the money and did as they were told. This news spread among the Jews, and it still goes on today. Jesus also instructed his disciples to do this.
And the disciples went to the mountain which Jesus had appointed.
And some of them prostrated themselves before him, but some remained doubtful.
And Jesus came near and spoke to them, saying: "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth."
Baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Matthew 28:19
And teach them to do all that I have commanded you. I am with you every day, even to the end of time.»
Chapter 1: John the Baptist Prepares the Way for Jesus
This is the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As written in the book of Isaiah:
A voice booms in the desert and echoes: «I'm sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your path.»
And John came into the wilderness, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.
And all the people came to him, from the region of Judea and Jerusalem; and being baptized by him in the Jordan, they confessed their sins.
John the Hairy wore clothes made from camel hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
Keikhbar and Keikvol used to say: "There will come after me one who is mightier than I, the very thought of unbuckling his sandals I am not worthy of."
"I am your Mayor of Palma, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." John baptizes Jesus.
And behold, there came Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee, and John baptized him in the Jordan.
And verily, the hour when he left the water, the skies cleared and the Spirit of God descended upon him like a dove.
And a voice came from heaven, saying, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased." Matthew 3:17, 12:18; Mark 9:7; Luke 3:22 Satan tempts Jesus.
And He went out into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
And the devil took Him up into the holy city, and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple, And showed Him in an instant of time all the kingdoms of the world. And the devil said unto Him, All this power will I give Thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. If Thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be Thine. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve. And he brought Him down to Jerusalem, and set Him on a pinnacle of the mountain, and said unto Him, If Thou be the Son of God, cast Thyself down from hence: For it is written, He shall give His angels charge concerning Thee: and in their hands they shall bear Thee up, lest at any time Thou dash Thy foot against a stone. And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from Him for a season. Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
And after John was put in prison, Jesus came to Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,
Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Matthew 3:2 Jesus chooses his first disciples.
And as he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
And He saith unto them, Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.
And the clock's rooster escaped through their window nets and followed him.
And He added, "Come, follow Me," as He saw Jacob, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John, mending their nets.
And Jesus called them, and immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him. Jesus and His disciples got into a boat, and He said to them, "Let us go over to the other side."
And he went to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and taught.
And the people wondered at his teaching, for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
