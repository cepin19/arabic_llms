Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? (Mark 9:33-37; Luke 9:46-48)
At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked him, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”
And Jesus called a little child and set him in the midst of them.
And he said: “I tell you the truth, unless you turn and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.”
Whoever humbles himself as this little child, he is the greatest one in the kingdom of the heavens.
Whoever accepts a small boy like this because my name is Accept me.
But what would cause a person who was not born to stumble, was if a large stone of a mill was tied to his neck and he was thrown into the middle of the sea.
Oh Willow, the things that make people commit sins! Those things must come, oh Willow, but the human being who brings the things that make people commit sins!
If your hand or your leg makes you commit sins, cut them off and throw them away, for if you enter eternal life with a limb cut off, you will be better off; for it is better for you that one of your members perish than your whole body be thrown into hell.
“If the eye offends you, cut it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye rather than having two eyes and being thrown into hell.” The Lost Goats (Luke 15:3-7)
«Be careful, don’t make fun of one who hasn’t been born yet. I’m telling you: they are angels, they are always looking at the face of the one who is in the sky.
# ‏18:11‏ There are old texts that contain this verse: I, John, the son of man, have come to bring judgment to the earth.
What do you think? If a man has 100 sheep and one of them gets lost, wouldn’t he leave the other 99 in the mountain and go look for the lost sheep?
I’ll tell you the truth, if he gets it, he’ll be happier than the 99 who didn’t lose it.
“Unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.” (Luke 17:3)
«If your brother is wronged against you, go and tell him about his mistake between you and him Akaho, and if he listens to you, you have won your brother.
But if he doesn’t listen to you, take one or two others with you, so that every word is witnessed by two or three witnesses.
If he doesn’t want to hear their words, tell the church, and if he doesn’t want to hear the church’s words, calculate how one who is not a believer and not a tax payer.
Here is the truth: what you tie on earth will be tied in heaven, and what you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
I repeat: if any of you agree on anything they ask for on earth, it is I, the one in heaven, who will do it for them.
Where will they all meet under my name, I will be in the middle of them.» Like a servant who doesn’t forgive
At that time Peter came to Jesus and said, “Lord, how many times does my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?”
Jesus said: “I did not say to you seventy times seven, but seventy times seven times seven.”
That's why the Kingdom of the Heavens is like a king in love who holds an account with his servants.
He brought one to account, and he got one to ask for money without account.
And as the loan is settled, سيدو has to sell himself, his wife, his children and all his belongings to pay off his debt.
Ya khi tāḥa al-khadīm ‘alā rakāibuhu wa-qāla: "Ya sidi, ya sidi aṣbar ‘alā wa tu nakhlṣuka fī kull shay’!"
And forgive سيدو وسيبو وسامحو on the debt.
But that servant there, he went out and found another servant who asked for a little money, and he choked him and said: "Finish me with the money you ask for!"
Ya khi tāḥa al-khadīm al-ākhăr ‘alā rakāibihi wa-tashḥutu wa-qāla: “Aṣbar ‘alā, tu nakhlisuk.”
And he didn’t like it and went and put him in prison until he paid the debt he owed.
The servants discovered what had happened, they were very worried and went to tell their master that everything was lost.
At that time, Nadalo said to the slave: "O evil slave! I forgive you all that debt, because you have made me ashamed.
And you are not entitled to pity your servant as I have pity on you?
Sidou cheats, Salmo is handed over to the prison authorities until he pays off his debt.
That's how Papa who is in heaven will work with each one of you if he doesn't forgive his brother from his heart.
Marriage and divorce (Mark 10:1-12)
As Jesus was saying these things, he went from Galilee to Judea, by the road to Jordan.
And a lot of people followed him, and their mouths were filled.
A group of Frisian people came to him and asked him to try: «Bro, is it allowed to divorce your wife for any reason?»
Answer them: “My brother, didn’t you read that the one who created them in the first place created them as females and males.
# 1:27; 2:24; 5:31; I 6:16 and he said: "That's why a man leaves his father and mother and clings to his wife and the two of them become one?"
“Otherwise, they are not two, but one. That is why God does not separate what He has united.”
# Matt 24:1-4 The Pharisees said, “Why did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and not leave her?”
Jesus said to them: “Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because of your hard hearts. But it was not so at the beginning.”
And I tell you: anyone who divorces his wife for another reason than adultery and marries another woman is still having an affair.
The students said: “If this is how the man treats his wife, it’s better for him if he doesn’t get married.”
But he said to them: “Not everyone will accept this speech, but those whom God will let accept it.”
There is no one who cannot get married when he is born from his mother's womb, and there is no one whom people have done something to make him unable to get married, and there is no one who does not want to get married because of the kingdom of heaven. Let him who can do this do it. Jesus blesses little children (Mark 10:13-16; Luke 18:15-17)
They brought to Jesus children to place their hands on them and to pray for them. The disciples rebuked the people for bringing the children.
But Jesus said: “Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.”
And he put forth his hand, and took her, and lifted her up immediately: and when he was come into his own house, he began to cast forth the unclean spirits. And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. (Mark 10:17-31; Luke 18:18-30)
And one of them said, “Teacher, what are the minor things that I have to do in order to get eternal life?”
Jesus said: “Why are you worrying about such things? Is there one thing good? If you want to enter into eternal life, do the commandments.”
# Ex 20:12-16; Deut 5:16-20; “Did they ask you about the commandments?” Jesus said, “You shall not kill, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
# No ‏19‏:18 Honor your father and mother, and you should love your near kin as you love yourself.
The boy said: “I will do all these things, what else do I need?”
Jesus said: “If you want to be perfect, go, sell all your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Come and follow me!”
When the boy heard that, he went sad because he had a lot of things.
And Jesus said to his disciples: “I tell you the truth, it will be very hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven!”
And I repeat: “It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.”
When they heard the disciples this word, they were astonished and said: «Who will be able to pay for it?»
But Jesus looked at them and said, “With people, this is impossible, but with God everything is possible.”
At that time, Peter answered: “Hannah, we left everything to follow you, what are we going to take?”
Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, when the Son of Man is seated on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
And whoever left his home, his brothers, his sisters, his father, his mother, his children, and his lands for my name, so that he could take a wife as old as the one he left behind and inherit eternal life.
And a lot of people at first to become in the end and the people in the end to become in the first.
Like the servants of the grape-sands
The way to the Kingdom of the Heavens is like a master of the house who, in the early morning, went out to put his servants to work in his vineyard.
And he agreed with the servants on a silver coin in the day and sent them to the grapevine.
And he went out with the nine, my brother saw another group standing in the market and unemployed
And he said to them: "You two, go to the vineyard, and we will give you your share, my brother."
And he went out again around noon, and at dusk he went out with the three, and did the same thing.
Taqrib left with the five of them at dusk, and found other people sitting, and he said to them: "Why are you all sitting here idle during the whole day?"
He said: “Not a single one called us to work.” He said to them: “You two go and work at Sania Al-Anb.”
In the evening, the servant of the grapes said to the one who was not busy with the servants: Call the servants and pay them, be patient with the last ones until you reach the governor.
And the group that started working with the five o'clock tea each took a silver coin.
When the others arrived, they thought about taking more than the others, but each of them took a silver coin.
And when Utali finishes, they will cheat the master of the grapes,
They said: “The other two only worked for one hour, and you finished them how we worked the whole day in the heat!”
But one of them answered: "My friend, I didn’t wrong you. My brother, didn’t we agree on a silver coin?
Take your rights and go. I liked to give this to the other one as we give you,
“Ya khi, I don’t have the right to spend my money however I want? Or are you jealous of me, I’m kind?”
And Jesus said: "If it is wish of two of those who sit in my Father's kingdom to become one of them, they will become one of them." Jesus speaks for the third time about his death and resurrection (Mark 10:32-34; Luke 18:31-34)
And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the two disciples aside and said to them, “
«Hanna, they are taking me up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of the chief priests and the scribes, and they are condemning me to death.
And he delivered me up to the other nations, that they might make fun of me, and whip me, and crucify me; and on the third day I shall rise again. This is what the Lord God required of the son of man, that he should not look on anything that he sees, or understand anything that he hears (Mark 10:35-45)
Gato's wife came with her children, and she kneeled in front of him and asked him for something.
And Jesus said to her: “What do you want?” She said to him: “I want that my two sons, the one on your right and the one on your left, sit, one at your right and the other at your left, in your kingdom.”
But Jesus answered: “You don’t even know what you are asking. Would you like to drink from the water I drink?” They said to him: “Give us!”
He said to them: “You will drink from my cup, but it is not me who will decide who sits on my right and on my left, it is my father who has prepared people for that place.”
And when the other ten disciples heard that, they were angry with the two brothers.
But Jesus called them to himself and said: “You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and those in authority over them exercise power over them.
But you must not have that kind of thing between you. Let whoever loves to be among you be a servant to you.
And whoever loves Yuly, let him be a servant to all people.
Even from me, Anna, the son of man, I did not come so that people would serve me, but so that I could serve them and give my life so that I could save many of them.» Jesus heals two blind men (Mark 10:46–52; Luke 18:35–43)
And when Jesus and his disciples came out of Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
And there were two blind men sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”
My brother, they called out to them to be quiet. But they called out even louder: "Lord, son of David, have mercy on us!"
And Jesus stood and called them, and said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?”
They said: “O our Lord, we wish to return and see!”
And Jesus wept over them, and touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight, and followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem (Mark 11:1-11; Luke 19:28-40; John 12:12-19)
As they were drawing near to Jerusalem and were coming into the village of Bethany, which is by the Mount of Olives, he sent out two of the disciples,
And he said to them, “Go to the village opposite you, and you will find a beast tied up with a donkey. Untie the rope and bring them to me.”
And if anyone tells you anything, tell them: "God knows." And He will return them to you.
This is how it happened that the Prophet’s saying came true:
# 62:11; Zak 9:9 Say to the daughter of Zion, “The king of your salvation is coming to you, humble and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.”
The two disciples went and did as Jesus had commanded them.
They took the beast and the ass, and put on them the garments; and he sat upon the ass, and went forth into the temple: and the servants spread their garments in the way.
And the majority of people spread their sheets on the road, and others cut tree sticks and put them on the road.
# Sura 118:26; Sura 2:14; Sura 21:15; Sura 23:39 and the people who preceded him and those who will follow him will call out: "We have recommended the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! We have recommended to the high ones!"
As Jesus was entering Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up and they asked: “Who is this?”
And they said, “This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.” Jesus drives the money changers out of the temple (Mark 11:15–19; Luke 19:45–48; John 2:13–22)
And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all those who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.
# 56:7; 7:11 and he said to them, “It is written in the Holy Bible: ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves!’”
The blind and the lame came to the temple and he healed them.
But the chief priests and the scribes, the rulers of the Jews, had conspired to put him to death. When they saw the miracles that Jesus did, and how the little children were calling out in the temple, “Hosanna to the Son of David!”
# مز ‏8‏:2 And they said to him, “Do you hear what they are saying?” And Jesus said to them, “Yes, have you never read this verse: ‘Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings you have prepared praise for me’?”
And he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night. Jesus curses the vine (Mark 11:12-14, 20-24)
And as he was coming back to the city in the morning, Jesus was hungry
He saw a vine on the side of the road, my brother picked it up, and he didn’t find anything in it but paper and he said to her: “You will never bring the harvest forever!” and the vine withered at the same time.
The pupils were astonished and saw what had happened and said: "Why did the vine dry up at that time?"
Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed and do not doubt, you will be able to say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.
Whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be so for you. The power of Jesus (Mark 11:27-33; Luke 20:1-8)
As Jesus was entering the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and said, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered them, “I have one question to ask you. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”
Where did John’s baptism come from? From heaven or from people? » My brother, understand between them: «If we say: "From heaven" they will say: "Why didn’t you believe in it then?"
But if they say: "From the people." We are afraid of the people because they are all sure that John is a prophet.
Then they answered Jesus, “We do not know.” Jesus said to them, “And I do not tell you by what authority I do these things.” Like the two sons
«What do you think? There is a man with two sons. He went to the first and said: "Son, go and work today at the vineyard."
Ya khi, answer his son: "I'm not going." But he was too late and went.
He went to his other son and said the same thing to him as he had said to his first son, "I'm going, sir!" But he didn't go.
Anahu Malzus brothers who did the thing that he loved to do? » The elders said, «The first.» Jesus said to them, «I tell you the truth: those who collect taxes and those who commit adultery will enter the kingdom of God before you.
“You didn’t believe him when he was a good man, my brother, but you believed him when he was dealing with taxes and corrupt women. And even when I killed you, you didn’t believe him until you saw that thing.” Like the servants of the fig tree (Mark 12:1-12; Luke 20:9-19)
«Listen to this one: There was a man who planted a vineyard, surrounded it with a wall, built a press in it, made a watchtower and latrines, and rented it to a group of five. He then travelled to another country.
As the time to harvest the grapes approaches, the servants sent their own to the market to send him the harvest.
And they tightened the chains of their servants and beat one of them, killed another, and stoned another.
And the servant of the grapes sent his servants again more than he sent them the first time, my brother, they did the same thing to them.
He kept them at a distance and said: "Now you can see my son."
When the five saw the boy, they said to each other: "This is the one who will inherit! Let's kill him and take his inheritance!"
They tied him up and took him out of the Sانية العنب and killed him.
“Otherwise, when the master of the vineyard comes, what will he do with those of you who are in the vineyard?”
The Jewish elders said: "So that he may kill these evil ones and give the other five the grape harvest in its due time."
# Mt ‏11:‏22‏-23؛ Ac ‏4:11؛ I Co ‏2:7‏ Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the scriptures: The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner? This is the Lord’s doing, and it is wonderful in our eyes.”
That's why I tell you: The Kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation that will produce its fruit.”
# ‏21:44‏ There are old texts that contain this verse: I, John, the son of man, have come to bring judgment to the earth.
And when they heard these things the chief priests and the Pharisees, they took counsel together against him.
But as they tried to catch him, they were afraid of the people, because they considered him a prophet.
Like the feast of the king (Luke 14:15-24)
And he spake unto them by parables again, saying:
«The Kingdom of the Heavens is like a king who works as a caterer at a wedding of his son.
Khadam sent to call the people who were invited to the wedding party, but they didn’t come.
Khadam sent others again and said: "Tell the summoners: Hani has come to the evening, and has slaughtered the bulls and fat cattle, and everything is ready, come to the wedding party!
Ama Huma didn’t take into account the evening and went on their own, one went to his shop, and one went to his shop.
Others tied up their servants, humiliated them and killed them.
The king cheated, sent his soldiers with their belongings, and killed those criminals and burned their city.
The majordome told the servants: "The evening has arrived, but the guests who were called are not worthy of it,
“Otherwise, go to the streets and call as many people as you can for the wedding party.”
Those servants went out and brought all the bad and ugly people, the whole house was full of guests.
When the king came to see the guests, he saw a man who was not wearing a dress. My brother said:
How did you get in here and you’re not wearing a wedding dress? My man, shut up.
At that time, the king said to the servants: "Bind his hands and feet, and throw him outside in the dark, so that he may weep and be plagued with years."
"Many are calling and only a few are chosen." Paying taxes to Caesar (Mark 12:13-17; Luke 20:20-26)
At that time the Pharisees went and discussed how they could catch Jesus in his words.
And he sent the disciples away with their luggage, along with a group from the party of Herod, and said to them, "Behold, I recognize that God has given me in his hands all things.
We said: what do you think? Dude, is it okay to pay taxes to the Caesar or not?
But Jesus, aware of their malice, said to them: “Hypocrites! Why do you test me?”
“Give me my tax money!” He brought a silver coin.
Jesus said to them: “Who is the father of this child and what is his name?”
They said: “Caesar’s things!” He said to them: “Why not, give Caesar’s things to Caesar and God’s things to God!”
And they were astonished when they heard that speech, and left him, and went away. The resurrection of the dead (Mark 12:18-27; Luke 20:27-40)
On that day, the Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection after death, came to Jesus and asked him a question
# Matt 25:5 And they said unto him, Master, that which did Moses command concerning marriage?
There were seven brothers between us, and the first brother got married and died without having children, and his wife was taken by his brother.
The same happened with the second, third, up to the seventh.
And after them, the more the woman died, the more they increased.
“Except for that woman on the Day of Resurrection, who will be a wife to whom? Because she married them all.”
Jesus answered them, “You are mistaken, because you do not understand the scriptures and the power of God.
On the Day of Judgment, they will not marry, nor will they be married. They will be like the angels in the heavens.
And you are like the dead in the resurrection, O my brother, did you not read what Allah said:
# 3:6 O Lord of Abraham, and Lord of Isaac, and Lord of Jacob; not of the dead, but of the living, do I worship.
And when the people heard these words, they marveled at his doctrine. The great commandment (Mark 12:28-34; Luke 10:25-28)
But when they heard that the Pharisees had silenced the Sadducees, they were glad, and each of them went his way.
And one of them, who is a jurist, asked a question to test:
«O teacher, is Anah the biggest will in the sharia?»
# Matt 6:5 Jesus answered, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.
This is the first and biggest will.
# No ‏19‏:18؛ Yes ‏19‏:19؛ Hate ‏5‏:14؛ Love ‏13‏:9؛ Be ‏2‏:8 and the second commandment, how about, "Love your neighbor as yourself."
"The whole of the law and the prophets are based on these two commandments." Christ and David (Mark 12:35-37; Luke 20:41-44)
When the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them:
«What do you think of Christ? Who is he?» They said: «He is the son of David!»
He said to them: “How can David call him ‘Lord’ when he killed him and all his family?
# Sura 110:1; Sura 2:34-35; Sura 19:13; Sura 10:13 My Lord has said to me: "Sit on my right hand until I place your enemies beneath your feet."
If David called himself “Our Lord”, how could his son be anything else?
Not even one could answer him with a word. And from that day, no one dared to ask any question.
Jesus Warns of the Jews and the Pharisees (Mark 12:38-40; Luke 11:37-52; 20:45-47)
And Jesus went out, and saw a great crowd, and he said to his disciples,
«The book is the property of the Jews and the Pharisees are sitting on the throne of Moses,
Otherwise, work and keep everything they tell you to. If you don’t do it the way they do, they will say it’s their way or nothing.
They put a heavy burden on people's shoulders, but they don't touch it with their fingers.
They work so that people can see them, they grow in their turbans and long in their clothes.
They love to sit in the first rows at the parties and the first seats in the assemblies
People love to greet them in the markets, and call them: "Oh, the teachers!"
But you don’t even let anyone call you: “Teachers”, because you are all brothers and you have only one teacher.
And do not say to anyone on earth “My Lord”, because you have one Lord who is in the heavens.
And don’t let anyone say to you: “My lord” because you have one Lord, who is Christ.
Let your elder serve you
Whoever comes out of his soul, he will go down, and whoever humbles himself will be lifted up.
Ah, welcome, O you who believe, O you who are the book of the Jews and the hypocrites of the Pharisees! You drink in the kingdom of the heavens in the faces of the people, and you do not let those who enter enter.
# ‏23‏:14 There are old texts that contain this verse: O woe to you, O Jews and hypocritical Pharisees! You lust after the wives of the dead men and take their houses, and you think that you are more righteous in your prayers, that is why your account will be great before God.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You cross land and sea to get one in your fold, and when he is in, you make him twice worthy of hell!
Woe to you, O blind leaders of the blind! Saying: "Whoever swears by the Temple is not bound by his right hand, but whoever swears by the gold of the Temple is bound by his right hand."
Anna is the one who is more valuable, you idiots and blind? Gold or the frame that returned the gold is sacred?
And you say: "He who swears by the altar is not bound by anything, but he who swears by the chalice above the altar is bound by his word."
Anna is the one who is more valuable, you blind? The altar or the one who returns the offering is holy?
Unless he swears by the altar, he is swearing by it and everything on top of it!
And the one who swears by the Ark, he swears by it and by the fact that he lives in it,
And he swears by the sky, he swears by the throne and by God who is sitting on it.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You pay the tithe of mint and anise and cumin, but you have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice, and mercy, and faith. It was necessary for you to have done these, and not to leave the other things undone.
You who lead the blind! You clear the mosquito water and swallow the camel.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are full of greed and avarice.
Oh, you hypocrite, you blind guide! First wash the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside also may be clean.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! How beautifully the graves are whitewashed from the outside, but inside they are full of the bones of the dead and all sorts of filth.
And you, from the outside, you appear to people as righteous, and from the inside you are full of hypocrisy and evil.
O you who believe! Do not take the Jews and the hypocrites as allies. They are allies of each other. They adopt the graves of the prophets and adorn the tombs of the righteous.
And you say: “Jina was there in the time of our ancestors, so we didn’t participate in the killing of the prophets.”
Here, witness your souls that you are the sons of those who killed the prophets.
Otherwise, you will not be able to balance the scales of your ancestors.
Ya wlad el-Lfaai, kayfa bash tahrubo min al-hukm ta'a'ab al-jannah
That is why I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will stone to death and chase from one town to another.
# 4:8; 11:4; 1:1; II Chronicles 24:21 So that all the pure blood shed on the earth from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar, may be avenged from you.
Here is the truth: all these bad things are coming on this generation!» Jesus’ love for Jerusalem (Luke 13:34–35)
“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathereth her brood under her wings! But ye would not.”
Come to my house so that you can stay there.
Rani tells you: You will never see me again until the time comes when you will say: "Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!"
Jesus Foretells the Destruction of the Temple (Mark 13:1–2; Luke 21:5–6)
Jesus left the temple. As he was going away, his disciples came up and took him by the side of the temple.
Ya'khi said to them: "Did you see this clo? I'll tell you the truth: not even a chamber here will remain above its sister, the clo will fall." The catastrophe and persecution (Mark 13:3-13; Luke 21:7-19)
While he was sitting in Mount Olive, his disciples came to him on the side and said to him: “When will this thing happen, and what are the signs of your coming and of the end?”
Jesus answered them, “Be on your guard; do not let them deceive you.
A lot of people are coming in my name, and they say: "I am Christ!" and they are confusing a lot of people.
And when you hear about wars near and far, don't be afraid. This is something that has to happen, but that is not the end.
The road is paved so that one people can come against another, and one kingdom against another, and there will be famine and earthquakes in many places.
This is just the beginning of the birth pains.
That is the time to take you to torment and kill you. And all the peoples will hate you for my name.
And at that time, a lot of people stopped believing, and they betrayed each other and hated each other.
And they show a lot of false prophets and they fool a lot of people.

And let the one in the cart not return to pick up his cap.
And woe to the pregnant and nursing in the daytime, those.
Ask your Lord that you may flee in the day, not in the winter, nor on a sabbath.
Because at that time there was a big shortage, it didn’t happen like he wanted it to happen from the beginning of the world to now.
And if God didn’t fall short in those days, then he didn’t save anyone. But he fell short in them because of the people he chose.
At that time, if someone said to you: "Here is the Christ" or "How is he going", do not believe it!
They will appear and many people will mistake them for the Anti-Christ and false prophets, and they will do great and wonderful things to deceive them, even the chosen ones, if it is possible.
I warned you before.
Otherwise, if they say to you: “He is in the wilderness!” do not go out, if they say to you: “He is in the inner houses” do not believe!

And they had nothing in mind until the floods came and shook them all. That's how the time will come when I, the Son of Man, will come:

Like the girls
“As for the kingdom of the heavens, it is like ten maidens who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.”
Five of them were ignorant and five knew how to behave.
When the ignorant killed, they didn’t take their lanterns with them.
But those who know how to behave, took their oil lamps with their lanterns.
And the groom, everyone fell asleep.
But at midnight they heard shouting: “The groom is coming, get out to meet him!”
Damn, all the girls got up and lit their candles.
And they said to the ignorant ones who knew how to behave: "Give us a bit of your oil, so that our lamps can be extinguished."
But those who know how to behave, answer: "Maybe not to satisfy us and you, go to those who sell oil and buy what you need."
And just as Waktali was about to go and buy them, the groom arrived. He and the guests entered the house where the wedding was taking place and the door was locked.
The other girls came and said to the groom: "Sir, Sir, we have opened the door!"
But he replied to them: "I tell you the truth, I do not know you.
Otherwise, get your minds right, because you don’t know either the day or the hour.» Like the coins in the treasury (Luke ‏19‏:‏11‏-27)
«The way to the Kingdom of the Heavens is like a man who loves to travel, my brother, called his servants and gave them his money»
He gave each of them according to his power, he gave one five chests of gold, another two chests of gold, and another one chest and he left.
Whoever took the five safes went quickly and traded with them, my brother, and he made five more safes.
And he took two more chests, and won two more chests.
But the one who took the purse went and dug in the ground and hid his master’s money.
After a long time, the master of those servants came back and accounted for them.
He who took the five bags, brought five more bags and said: "Sir, you gave me five bags, I have won five more bags."
They said to him: "Wake up, servant, Saleh and Thiqah! You were a bit of a thiqah, I’m going to make you sleep on the brush: enter your master’s paradise.
And he took the two boxes and said, "Sir, you gave me two boxes, and I have won two more boxes."
They said to him: "Wake up, servant, Saleh and Thiqah! I was waiting for you, I will take you to your master's paradise.
And he took one bag and that was all he came with, and he said: "My Lord, I know that you are a hard man, you reap what you did not sow, and gather what you did not plant,
Bro, I was scared, I walked away and hid your money in the dirt, and here is your money.
Ama Sido Jaoubo: "Oh evil servant and miserly man! I know that we reap what we do not sow and gather what we do not plant,
You should have put my money in the bank, and we would have taken it back with interest.

I was hungry and you fed me, I was thirsty and you quenched my thirst, I was a stranger and you gave me shelter,
I was naked and you were poking me, I was sick and you came to see me, I was tied up and you came to me.
That's when the righteous will answer: "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you drink?
And when did we see you strange and settle you? Or naked and clothe you?
And when did you see us sick or tied and weighed us?
And I answered them: "You are telling the truth every time you did that to one of my younger brothers, you did it to me, I!"
And I want to tell the one on my left: "Get away from me, you cursed ones, go to the fire that God and His angels have prepared for you forever:
Rani I was hungry and you didn’t feed me, I was thirsty and you didn’t quench my thirst,

And I replied to them: "You have been telling the truth every time you didn’t do that with one of my younger brothers, you didn’t do it with me, I am."
And they will go to suffer forever, but the righteous will go to eternal life.”
The Jews tried to kill Jesus (Mark 14:1-2; Luke 22:1-2; John 11:45-53)
When Jesus had said all this, he said to his disciples:
“You know that Easter is coming in two days, and that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of the sinners to be crucified.”
And at that time were gathered together the chief priests and the people’s elders in the house of Caiaphas (which is the chief among the chief priests).
They consulted one another what trick they could use to catch Jesus and kill him.
But they said, “We didn’t find him during the festival, so you shouldn’t make a fuss in the middle of the people.” A woman anoints Jesus (Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8)
Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,
My wife gave me a bottle of expensive perfume, and she poured it on his head while he was eating.
When the students saw it, they cheated and said: "Why such a waste?
This perfume used to be sold for a few dirhams and given to the poor!
But Jesus knew it and said to them: «Why are you worried about the woman? She did a good thing to me.
The poor are always with you, but I am not here to be with you all the time.
If she were to pour perfume on my body, she would be preparing me for the burial.
Here is the truth: Who in the whole world would believe this gospel, so that they could talk about what this woman has done, so that people would always remember her.» Judas’ betrayal (Mark 14:10–11; Luke 22:3–6)
At that time there was a certain man of the Iscariot, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests.
# Surah 21:32; Surah 11:12 and he said to them: “What will you give me so that I betray you?” They gave him thirty pieces of silver.
And that time he began to wait for an opportunity to betray. The Last Supper with the disciples (Mark 14:12-21; Luke 22:7-23; John 13:21-30)
On the first day of the Feast of First Fruits, the disciples came to Jesus and said to him, “We would like to prepare the Passover meal for you so that you can eat it with us.”
He said to them: “There is one in the city, go and tell him: ‘The teacher says: my time has come, to eat Easter dinner at your house with my pupils.’”
And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover feast.
In the evening, Jesus sat down to eat with his two disciples.
While they were eating, Jesus took bread and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, “This is my body which is for you: this do in remembrance of me.”
They were very sad and started saying to each other one by one: «My God, who is he?»
Answer them: “Whoever put his hand in the bowl with me is the one who will betray me.

While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread, and when he had blessed it, he broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.”
And he gave them a cup and said: “Drink it all.”
This is my blood, the blood of the covenant that was shed for the sake of many people so that their sins may be forgiven.
We tell you: we will not drink this grape juice anymore, until the day when we will drink with you the new one in Papa’s Kingdom.
They went away by boat to pray. And when he had dismissed them, he went up on the mountain to pray by himself. And when evening came, he was there alone. And as morning came he called them, and he took them with him. And Peter said to him, “Lord, it is good for us to be here.
# Zakk 13:7; John 16:32 and the separation Jesus said to them, “You all will be scattered this very night, for it is written in the scriptures: To strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.”

Ya khi qالو bṭrus: «Hatta law kan kholook al-kulhum, ana 3amri ma nakhleek.»
Jesus said: “Truly I tell you, before roosters crow on this night, you will disown me three times.”
Peter said, “Even if it is necessary to die with you, I will never deny you.” And all the disciples said the same. Jesus prays in Gethsemane (Mark 14:32-42; Luke 22:39-46)
Jesus and his disciples went to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”
And Peter and the sons of Zebedee were shaken with him, and he began to feel sad and worried.
At that time he said to them: “I feel very sad to the point of death. Wait here and stay awake.”
And after a while he fell on his knees, prayed and said: “Oh father, if it is possible, pour me another glass. Let it be whatever you like, not whatever I like.”
He went back to the students and found them asleep, and he said to Peter: "My friend, can't you stay awake with me for one hour?"
Stay awake and pray so that you don’t fall into temptation. The soul loves to stay awake, but the body is weak.
And he prayed again, and said: “O Papa, if this cup cannot pass away from me, but must needs be that I drink it, let thy will, not mine, be done.”
And he came back and found them sleeping, because they couldn’t even lift their heads to sleep.
But he left them again and went to pray for the third time, and then he spoke again, this time with his own voice.
And he came and said to the disciples, “You still sleep and take your rest? The hour has come, and the Son of Man is handed over into the hands of sinners.”
Let’s go! Who is going to betray me?» (Mark 14:43–50; Luke 22:47–53; John 18:3–12)
And while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the two disciples, arrived, along with a crowd carrying swords and clubs that had been sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
And the family gave them a province, and he said: “Whoever kisses that one, take him!”
And as he went along, he saw them plowing. And he said unto them, And he said unto them, “Make ready for yourselves: for the harvest is near.”
Jesus said: “My friends, do whatever you came for.” At that time they came and laid their hands on Jesus and held him.
And one of them, being a man of might, drew his sword and struck the high priest’s servant on the ear, cutting off his ear.
And at that time Jesus said: “Put your sword back in its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword,
Ya khi machi fi بالك ya ana ma anجمsh n'tleb min baba, wu bal-waqt yeb'athli aknan thanashin jish mat'a malak?
“But how is it that the holy books say this thing must happen?”
And Jesus said to them, “You came out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were a murderer. Every day I was teaching in the temple, and you did not arrest me.”
But all this was to fulfill what was said in the books of the prophets. At that time the disciples left him and fled. Jesus before the Jewish Sanhedrin (Mark 14:53–65; Luke 22:54–55, 63–71; John 18:13–14, 19–24)
And they took Jesus to Caiaphas, who was the chief among the chief priests; and the elders and scribes of the people gathered together.
Peter followed him from afar until he reached the middle of the priests' hierarchy. He entered and sat with the guards to see what was going to happen.
And the high priests and the elders of the council were seeking a witness against Jesus to put him to death,
But I don't know how, even though many people came and testified falsely. And they came in pairs
And they said, “This man said, ‘We will certainly destroy the Temple of God, and in three days we will build it.’”
The highest of the priests said: “Hey, why aren’t you answering? Hey, why don’t you hear what these men are saying about you?”
But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest said to him, “I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?”
Jesus said: “You have said so. But I tell you: Today you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming in the clouds of heaven!”
Cut the top one of the heads of the priests of Dabsho and said: "Raho is an infidel! My brother, we still need witnesses? Here, I just heard it as an infidel.
What do you think of him? » They replied: «He has to die!
They spat on him and slapped him, and some of them hit him
And they said, "Prophesy, Jesus, Who struck You?" Peter denies Jesus (Mark 14:66-72; Luke 22:56-62; John 18:15-18, 25-27)
At that time Peter was sitting in the middle of the house, and a servant came in and said: “You’re also with Jesus from Galilee!”
But he was the one who made them all angry, and he said: “I don’t understand what you mean.”
As he went out of the door, another servant saw him and said to those present: «This man was with Jesus from Nazareth!»
Peter denied again, and immediately, “I do not know this man!”
A little further away came the people present and said to Peter: "Truly you are one of them, for you speak the same way as they do!"
At that time, he started swearing and shrugging his shoulders: “I don’t know this man.” And at the same time, the sardouk said,
And Peter remembered Jesus’ words: “Before the cock crows on you three times, you will deny me three times.” And he went out and wept bitterly.
Jesus before Pilate (Mark 15:1; Luke 23:1-2; John 18:28-32)
In the morning, the chief priests and the elders of the people conspired together against Jesus, so that they might put him to death.
They bound him, and led him away, and delivered him over to Pontius Pilate the governor. And Judas died by his own sword. (Acts 1:18-19)
And when Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that he was condemned, he repented and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,
And he said to them: “I have committed a sin equal to the shedding of the blood of an innocent person.” They said to him: “What concerns us? Take care of yourself.”
He threw the silver in the structure and left, and walked and hanged himself.
But the heads of the priests scoffed at the silver and said, “It is not right to put it in the chest of the temple, for it is money of blood.”
Unless you come to an agreement, the seller of the pottery will buy the donkey so that he can make it into a grave for the Braينية.
That's why they call that kind of donkey a blood donkey.
# Zak 11:12-13; Ir 32:6-15; 18:2-3 And so it was done as the prophet Jeremiah said: “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price at which they had valued him at the price appointed by the people of Israel,
And they gave him money to buy a potter's pot. As the Lord had commanded me.’ Pilate questions Jesus (Mark 15:2-5; Luke 23:3-5; John 18:33-38)
And Jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him: “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus answered: “You have said.”
But when the heads of the priests and the elders were accused, he did not answer anything.
Pilatus said to the crowd: “Don’t you hear how they are testifying against him? It’s a bunch of stuff.”
But he did not answer any of them, even to the point where the governor was greatly amazed. The judgment of Jesus to death (Mark 15:6-15; Luke 23:13-25; John 18:39-19:16)
And on every feast the governor would give the people one malmurabit that they loved.
And they had in those days a man known in prison by the name of Barabbas.
And when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom of these two do ye require me to release unto you? Barabbas or Jesus which is called Christ?
He knew that they had handed it over out of jealousy.
In addition to this, when Pilate was sitting in the court, his wife sent him and said to him: "Be careful to do nothing for that righteous man, for I have had a very bad dream about him tonight."
The high priests and elders convinced the people to ask him to spare Barabbas and to crucify Jesus.
The governor said to them again: “Who of them do you want me to leave you?” And they said: “Barabbas!”
Pilatus said to them, “What is it that you wish me to do with Jesus who is called Christ?” Then they all answered, “Crucify him!”
And he said: “Why? What evil have they done?” But they shouted even louder: “Crucify them!”
Otherwise, he saw Pilate, who had not come to a conclusion, and on the contrary, there was no struggle. He took water and washed his hands in front of the people and said: “I am innocent of the blood of this man! Do with him what you want.”
And everyone answered: “We and our children are wanted for blood!”
They led him away to crucify him, and they flung lots to decide who should take his garment. The soldiers mocked him, saying, “Come now, come, save us, the King of the Jews! Have you come to save us, before you save yourself?” They also said to the chief priests and the soldiers, “He saved others, so save him if you are the Christ, the Holy One of God!” And the soldiers mocked him, saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself! Come down from the cross!” (Mark 15:16–20; John 19:2–3)
The soldiers, who had been humiliated by Jesus, led him to the governor’s palace and assembled the whole troop in front of him,
And we tried to put a red dress on it,
They made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And they bowed before him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”
They spat on him, pulled his beard and hit him with it on his head.
And after they had mocked him, they put a red robe on him, and put a crown of thorns on his head, and bowed their knees before him. And they mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" And they struck him with their hands. And when they had mocked him, they took off the robe from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him. Jesus on the Cross (Mark 15:21-32; Luke 23:26-43; John 19:17-27)
And when they were leaving the city, a man from Cyrene by the name of Simon was brought out. They forced him to carry the cross.
And when they came to a place called Gethsemane, which is in meaning “the place of the skull”
They gave him a mixed drink with something called mir to drink, but when he tasted it, he didn’t want to drink it.
# 22:18 And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots for them, to satisfy each man’s share.
And they sat and kept watching the passerby.
They put the charge on his head on a board that said: “This is Jesus, King of the Jews.”
They crucified him with two criminals, one on his right and one on his left.
# 22:7-8; 109:25 and the people who passed by would slap their heads and curse him and say:
“If you are the Son of God, get down from the cross and save yourself, for I will throw the temple down and rebuild it in three days.”
And the high priests and scribes, the possessions of the Jews, were also laughing at him, saying:
«Let other people be saved, and he can’t save himself! He is the king of Israel, let him come down from the cross now and we will believe in him.
Mawu trusted God and said, “I am the son of God; let God deliver me if he is pleased with me.”
And the criminals crucified with him were also mocking him. The death of Jesus (Mark 15:33-41; Luke 23:44-49; John 19:28-30)
And at noon the whole world became dark until the three o'clock in the afternoon.
# Gen 22:1 And Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw three men standing by him. And he said, "Behold, in the day of my being called, I lifted up my hands unto the Lord, and said, 'O Lord God, take not away my son, whom I have laid away for a burnt offering.'"
And the people who were standing nearby said: “This man is calling for Elijah!”
# 69:21 and one of them ran and shook a shofar, blew it in the vinegar and put it in a reed and brought it to him to drink.
But others said: “Wait, let’s see if Elijah is coming to save us!”
And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up the ghost.
The veil divides the structure’s goods into two. The earth quaked and the stones cracked.
The graves were decorated, and the shrines of the saints that rest there were adorned.
And they went out and found no one in the tomb, and they came back and told that to the others.
When the chief of the priests and those who were with him saw how the earth quaked and the things that happened, they were afraid and said, "Truly this man is the Son of God!"
And there were many women there at a distance watching; for they had followed Jesus from Galilee to serve him and to do what he had said.
And among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. They buried Jesus (Mark 15:42-47; Luke 23:50-56; John 19:38-42)
In the evening a rich man named Joseph from the region of Ramah came, who was also one of Jesus’ disciples.
He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered that it should be given to him.
And Joseph took the body of Jesus, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
They buried him in a new grave, dug his soul into the stone, and put a large stone on the door of the grave and walked away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. They were watching over the tomb.
And from dawn until the day when they were to appear before him, the chief priests and the Pharisees took their case to Pilate.
They said: “Remember, O our Lord, how the liar said when he was alive: ‘I will rise up in three days.’”
That's why I ordered them to guard the tomb for the third day, so that his disciples don't steal it and tell the people: "He rose from the dead", and make people even more mistaken than they were before!»
Pilatus said to them, “You have a guard; go, search him as you wish.”
Otherwise, they would put wax on the door and soldiers would guard the grave.
The Resurrection of Jesus (Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:1-12; John 20:1-10)
And after Saturday had passed and on the Sunday morning, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
Ya kii waqea zalejal kabir, thمة malak min 'ind rabbii haba min al-samawa wa ja wa ba'ad al-hadara wa qada fawqaha.
And their appearance was like lightning, and their hair like snow.
They turned the guards into trembling people, afraid of nothing, like the dead.
But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid. I know what you are seeking.
He's not here, he left as he said. Go and see the spot where he was put.
And hurry and tell your disciples, “He has risen from the dead, and he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him.” I have told you.
They went to the cemetery and were very scared and happy at the same time, and they pulled the students.
At the bend Jesus presented himself to them and said: “Peace be with you.” They embraced him, pulled at his feet and bowed down to him
Ya'khi said to them, "Do not be afraid! Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and whoever sees me there will believe in me." What the soldiers said
When the women were killed, some soldiers returned to the city and told the heads of the priests about everything that had happened.
And when the chief priests and the elders had gathered together, they consulted and gave large sums of money to the soldiers,
And they said to them, “Tell the people, ‘Our disciples came in the night and stole it while we were asleep.’”
And when the governor hears the news, we will satisfy him and get you out of the problem.
And the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story was spread among the Jews even to this day. Jesus appears to his disciples (Mark 16:14-18; Luke 24:36-49; John 20:19-23; Acts 1:6-8)
And now the eleven went to Galilee, to the mountain, as Jesus had told them.
They recognized Jesus and fell down before him, but none of them dared to accuse him.
And Jesus said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Unless you walk and work as disciples among all the nations, and unless they are baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
And teach them what you have been ordered to do, all of it, and I will be with you always, to the end of time.

John the Baptist came to the wilderness and preached baptism for the remission of sins.
And he advised the people who lived in the region of the Jews and in all Jerusalem, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan, after they had confessed their sins.
And John’s garment was of camel’s hair, and a leather girdle about his waist; and he ate locusts and wild honey.
He used to preach and say: “Let the one who is stronger than me come and we will not deserve to go down and untie the laces of our sandals.”

And as Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting their nets into the sea, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”
And in the meantime they left their net open and followed it.
And after he had gone a little further, he saw James and John, the sons of Zebedee, in the boat mending the nets.
And at the same time he called them, and left them in the boat with Peter and the twelve, and went away to pray. And when he had taken sufficient rest in prayer, he came to them, and found them sleeping. And he rebuked them, and said, “Can you not pray one hour with me? Not yet the hour has come, but go and pray that your faith may not fail you.” And he went up on the mountain to pray, and he spent the whole night in prayer to God. And when it was day, he called to them; and they, waking up, came and followed him. And when he had come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him. And behold, a man who was possessed by an unclean spirit came and fell at his feet, and he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ, come out of this man.” And the unclean spirit, crying out, said, “I know Jesus Christ, and I know that you are the Son of God, but let me come upon these people, for I command you in the name of Jesus.” And he permitted him, and the unclean spirit came out of the man and entered into the herd, and the herd ran wild through the streets of the town, and the people ran after them. And Jesus came to the market place, and began to teach, and immediately many who heard him were astonished, and said, “Where did this man get all this? And what is this wisdom that has been given to him? And what miracles are done by his hands? Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and Joseph?” And they were astonished at him. (Luke 4:31-37)

And Simon and his companions followed him.
And when they found him, they said: «Everyone is coming to you!»
He said to them: “Let’s go to the nearby cities so that I can spread the good news on my own. I came for this.”
And he went on to preach in all the synagogues of the Jews throughout the whole region of Galilee, and he was leaving their towns. The leper was cured (Matthew 8:1-4; Luke 5:12-16)

And with the people was a great company of scribes of the Jews, who began to think in their hearts:
«Can a man like this speak like that? He's cursing! Only God can forgive sins!»
And at the same time Jesus knew in himself what was in their mind, and said, “Why are you thinking this in your hearts?
Is Anna easier? To say to the paralyzed: "Your sins are forgiven" or to say: "Get up! Shake your bed and walk."
"This is how you will know that I, the son of man, have the power on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralytic:
«Your transfer: Get up! Shake out your bed and go home.»

Ya'khi said to the man with the dry hand: "Get up and stand in the middle!"
And he said to them: “Is it allowed on Saturday to do good or evil? To save a soul or to kill it?” And they remained silent.
