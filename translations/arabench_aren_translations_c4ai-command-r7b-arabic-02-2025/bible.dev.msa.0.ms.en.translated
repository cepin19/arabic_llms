There are fourteen generations from Abraham to David. And fourteen generations from David to the time of the exile, and fourteen generations from the time of the exile to Christ. The birth of Jesus Christ
This is how Jesus Christ was born: his mother Mary was betrothed to a man named Joseph. But before they married, she was found to be pregnant through the power of the Holy Spirit.
But Joseph, her husband, was a good man, and he did not want to expose her, so he decided to leave her quietly.
And as Joseph considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to yourself Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
And you shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.
This happened so that what the Lord spoke through the prophet might be fulfilled:
“Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.”
And when Joseph awoke, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him; he took his wife to him.
But he did not know her until she gave birth to a child whom he named “Jesus.”
The East’s Wise Men
And when Jesus was born in the city of Bethlehem in the province of Judea, during the rule of King Herod, some wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,
And they said to him, “Where is the infant who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him.”
King Herod was displeased when he heard this, as was the whole population of Jerusalem.
So Herod gathered together all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and inquired with them where the Christ should be born.
They said to him: “In the city of Bethlehem in the province of Judea, for this is what is written by the prophet:
«You, Bethlehem in the land of Judah, are by no means the least among the rulers of Judah, for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.»
So Herod called the wise men and met with them in private, and he learned from them the exact time the star appeared.
Then he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, “Go and search for the child. And when you find him, tell me, so that I may also come and bow down before him.”
The wise men listened to the king and then went away. And the star that they had seen in the east went before them, until it came and stood over where the child was.
They were very happy when they saw the star.
They entered the house and saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts: gold, incense and myrrh.
Then God warned them in a dream to return to Herod, so they left and went on their way to their own country by another way. Flight to Egypt
And when the wise men had departed, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.”
Joseph took the child and his mother by night and went to Egypt.
And he remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called my son.” #From … my son. 15:2 From the Book of Hosea 11: 1. Herod kills the children of Bethlehem
And when Herod knew that the wise men had deceived him, he was very angry, and he sent and slew all the boys in Bethlehem and all that were in the villages about, from two years old and under, according to the time which the wise men had determined.
Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:
«A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and weeping very bitter: it was Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are no more.» The Return from Egypt
After the death of Herod, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream in Egypt.
And he said to him, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who tried to kill the child are dead.”
Joseph took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was made king in the province of Judea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither. And being warned from God in a dream, he departed into the region of Galilee.
And he dwelt in a town called Nazareth. This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophets, that the Christ would be called a Nazorean. #Nazorean. 23:2 From the town of Nazareth. It is also a word similar to the Hebrew word "gushen" which appears in Isaiah 11:1 referring to the promise of the coming of the Christ from the seed of David.
John the Baptist
In those days came John the Baptist, and preached in the wilderness of Judaea;
And he said, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.”
And this John is he of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke when he said, “A voice of one calling: In the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.”
John wore clothes made of camel’s hair, and a girdle of leather around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
At that time, people began to come from Jerusalem and the whole region of Judea, and from the region around the Jordan, to hear him.
And he baptized them in the Jordan, after they had confessed their sins.
And when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to be baptized, he said to them, “You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
Bear fruits that demonstrate your repentance,
And do not boast saying, ‘Abraham is our father.’ For I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
Here is the axe laid to the roots of the tree trunks. And every tree that does not bear good fruit will be thrown into the fire.
“I baptize you with water for the sake of repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, and I am not worthy even to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.”
He will carry his scrip in his hand and his sheaf by his side, and gather in his harvest and burn the chaff with unquenchable fire. The baptism of Jesus
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
But John tried to stop him and said: “I need to be baptized by you, so why do you come to me?”
Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now; for it is proper to fulfill all that He commands.” Then John allowed Him to be baptized.
And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
A voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”
The Experience of Jesus
And the Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, to be tempted by the devil.
After Jesus had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.
Then the tempter came to him, #the tempter. 3:4 That is, Satan. And he said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.”
But Jesus answered him, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone,’ but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.”
Then Satan took him to the holy city and set him on the top of the temple.
And he said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written, ‘God commands his angels concerning you,’ and ‘they will bear you up in their hands, so that your foot may not strike against a stone.’”
Jesus answered him, “It is also written, ‘Do not test the Lord your God.’”
Then Satan took him to a high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their greatness.
Then he said to him: “I will give you all this if you worship me.”
Jesus said to him, “Get away, Satan! It is written, ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve only him.’”
Then Satan left him, and angels came and served him. Jesus begins his ministry in Galilee
And when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he returned to Galilee.
But he did not stay in Nazareth, but went and dwelt in Capernaum, by the sea, in the district of Zebulun and Naphtali.
This was to fulfill what was said by God through the prophet Isaiah:
“The land of Zebulun and Naphtali, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, including Galilee of the Gentiles.”
The people who sat in darkness saw a great light, and to those who sat in the region and shadow of death, the light has shone.
From that time on, Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.” Jesus chooses some disciples
While Jesus was walking on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, who was also called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea; they were fishermen.
He said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of people.”
They left their nets at once and followed him.
Then Jesus went on from there. He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in the boat with their father Zebedee mending the nets, so he called them.
They left the boat and their father immediately and followed him. Jesus teaches and heals
And Jesus was traveling through all the region of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity.
And the news about him spread throughout all the land of Syria. So they brought to him all the sick, suffering from various diseases and pains, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics and paralyzed, and he cured them.
And a great multitude of people followed him from Galilee, and from the ten cities, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.
Jesus’ Education
And when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a hill, and when he sat down his disciples came to him,
And he began to speak and to teach, saying:
“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”
Congratulations to the weepers, for God will comfort them.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. #They shall inherit the earth. 5:5 See Psalm 37: 11. Here it may mean a future spiritual inheritance.
Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled. #Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled. 6:5 Literally: “to the brooks.” Because God will satisfy them.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Congratulations to those with pure hearts, for they will see God.
Congratulations to those who work for peace, for they will be called the children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
“Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely accuse you of doing evil, because of me.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. Salt and light
«You are salt for all people. But if salt has lost its taste, with what shall it be seasoned? It is fit for nothing but to be cast out and trodden under foot by men.”
“You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.
People do not light a lamp and put it under a vessel! They put it on a high stand so that it lights up all those in the house.
“In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.” Jesus and Moses’ Law
“Do not think that I have come to destroy the Law of Moses or the teachings of the prophets. I have not come to destroy them but to fulfill them.”
I say to you the truth, until the sky and the earth pass away, not one jot, not one tittle, shall pass away from the law until all be fulfilled.
“Whoever, therefore, breaks one of these least commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever practices and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
For I say to you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
«You know that it was said to your fathers: “You shall not kill. #You shall not kill. 21:5 from the book of Exodus 20: 13, and the book of Deuteronomy 5: 17. Whoever kills shall be put on trial.”
I say to you that anyone who is angry with another person deserves to be tried, and anyone who insults another person should stand before the court. And anyone who says to another person: ‘You stupid’ deserves hell.
“Therefore, if you present an offering at the altar, and as you remember that someone has something against you,
So leave your offering there in front of the altar, and go and make peace with that person first, and then come back and present your offering.
“Salim will quickly defeat you, while walking with you on the way to the court. Otherwise, he will hand you over to the judge, and the judge will hand you over to the jailer, who will throw you in jail.”
I tell you the truth, you will not leave there until you spend the last penny you have. Adultery
«You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’ 27:5 Ex 20:14, Dt 5:18.
But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery in his heart.
Therefore if the right eye of thine is unto thee a occasion of sin, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee that one of thy members should perish, than for thy whole body to be cast into hell.
If your right hand is a cause of sin, cut it off and throw it from you. It is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. Divorce
«It was also said: ‹If a man divorce his wife, he shall give her a writing of divorce.› #If a man divorce ... that. 31:5 from the book of Deuteronomy 24: 1.
But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the charge of sexual immorality, makes her sexually immoral; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits sexual immorality.
“You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not break your word, but keep what you have promised to the Lord.’ #Do not break your word... to the Lord. 33:5 See Leviticus 19:12, Numbers 30:2, and Deuteronomy 23:21.
But I say to you: Do not swear at all.
Do not swear by heaven, for it is God’s throne, 35:5 meaning, under his authority, and by the city of Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king.
Don’t swear by your head, because you can’t make a single hair of it black or white.
If you want to say ‘yes,’ say ‘yes.’ If you want to say ‘no,’ say ‘no.’ Everything else comes from the evil one. #theevilone. 37:5 the devil. Resist evil
“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’ 38:5 Exodus 21: 24, and Leviticus 24: 20.
But I say: Resist not evil. But if a man smite thee on thy right cheek, offer him also the other.
If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him take your coat as well.
If someone forces you to walk one mile with him, walk two miles with him.
If anyone asks you for something, give it to him. Do not refuse to lend to anyone who asks you for a loan. Love everyone
“You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ 19:18.
But I say to you: Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you,
And you will be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
If you love only those who love you, what reward do you deserve? Don’t the tax collectors do the same?
If you only love your brothers, what is that to others? Do not even the pagans do that?
Therefore be perfect, even as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Generosity
“Beware of doing your almsgiving before men, to be seen by them; otherwise, your Father who is in heaven will not reward you.”
When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, as the hypocrites do in their assemblies and in the streets, so that they may be praised by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full.
But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
So that your giving in secret may be done, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. Prayer
“And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and at the street corners so that they will be seen by others. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full.”
But when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
“And when ye come, judge not, that ye be not judged. For with the same judgment wherewith ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with the same measure that ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.”
So be not like them; for your Father knows what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
Therefore pray thus: “Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name,
Let Your kingdom come, let your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. #theevilone. 13:6 the devil (Iblis). For to you, O Lord, belongs the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen›
For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will do the same for you.
But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses. Fasting
“When you fast, do not put on a sad face, as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full.”
But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
So that people don’t notice that you are fasting. Your father who you don’t see notices. Then your father who sees what happens in secret will reward you. God or money
“Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal.
But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
The light of the body is the eye. If therefore thine eye be clear, thy whole body shall be full of light.
But if your eye is evil, your whole body is full of darkness. If the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness that is in you!
“No one can serve two masters. Either you hate one and love the other, or you are devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth. #Wealth. 24:6 Literally “Mamona.” An Aramaic word meaning “wealth,” in its negative sense, as it represents a god that people serve without God. God’s kingdom first
“Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?
Who of you can add an hour to his age when he is worried?
“And why are you anxious about what you will put on? Look at the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin.”
But I tell you, no one has ever cut a stone like one of them, not even Solomon in all his glory.
If God clothes the grass of the field, which today you see and tomorrow you will throw into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O of little faith?
“So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’
These are things that the people of the other world seek, and your heavenly Father knows that you need all of these things.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
Do not worry about tomorrow, for each day has enough trouble of its own, and tomorrow will have its own troubles.
Judging Others
“Do not judge others, or God will judge you.”
For by your standards you will be judged, and with the measure you measure others will be measured to you.
“Why do you see the speck of dust in your brother’s eye, but you don’t notice the big log in your own eye?”
How can you say to your brother, “Let me take the splinter out of your eye, when there is a log in your eye?”
Hypocrite! First get the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.
“Do not give what is holy to the dogs, and do not cast your pearls before swine! For they trample the pearls under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces. Ask that you may receive.”
“Ask and it will be given you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.”
For whoever asks receives, and whoever seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.
Who of you, if his son asks for a loaf of bread, will give him a stone?
Or if he orders a fish, does he get it alive?
You, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children. Is not the Father who is in heaven much more likely to give good gifts to those who ask him? The Golden Rule
“Love others as you love yourself. This is the essence of Moses’ law and the teaching of the prophets. The road to heaven and the road to hell
“Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there are who go in by it.
The gate leading to life is very narrow, and the way to it is full of difficulties; only a few find the way. A warning against false teachings
«Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
You will know them by their fruits. People do not pick grapes from thorny bushes, nor figs from brambles!
So every good tree bears good fruit, and every bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Therefore you will know the false prophets by their fruits.
«Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that last day: ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name? Did we not drive out demons by your name? Did we not do many wonders by your name?’
Then I will say to them clearly: I never knew you. Get away from me, you doers of evil. The wise man and the fool
“Whoever hears these my words and acts upon them may be compared to a wise man, who built his house upon the rock.”
Then it rained, and there was a flood, and the wind blew and beat against that house, but it did not fall, because its foundation rested on the rock.
And whoever listens to my words and does not act on them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
"The rain came down, the flood waters rose, the wind blew and beat against the house, and it came crashing down!"
And when Jesus had finished speaking, the people were amazed at his teaching,
For he taught them by authority, not as the scribes.
Jesus Cleanses the Leper
Then Jesus went down from the mountainside. His crowd was so large that he had to turn and lead them on.
And a leper came to him and fell on his face, saying, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”
Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I do want it; be clean.” And immediately his leprosy was cured.
Then Jesus said to him, “Do not tell anyone what you have seen, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses prescribed; this will be a proof for them that the Lord has cured you.” Faith of a Roman officer
And Jesus came into Capernaum: and when he was in the house, he asked him, When thou hadst the feast, didst thou invite me? #Roman officer. 5:8 Literally "centurion." Repeated in verses 8, 13.
And he said, “O Lord, my servant is very ill and lying down at home. He is motionless and in great pain.”
Jesus said to him, “I will go and heal him.”
The officer answered: "Sir, I do not deserve to enter your house, all you have to do is say a word and my servant will be cured.
“I myself am a man under authority, and I have soldiers who obey my orders. I say to one soldier: ‘Go!’ and he goes. I say to another: ‘Come!’ and he comes. I say to my servant: ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who were following him, “I tell you the truth, I have not found such great faith even in Israel!”
I say to you, many will come from the east and the west, and will take places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
“But those who were destined to inherit the kingdom of heaven will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
Then Jesus said to the officer, “Go, let it be done as you believe.” And the servant of the officer was healed at that very hour. “He took our sicknesses away”
And when Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed, feverish.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she got up and began to serve him.
That evening, people brought to him many who were oppressed with demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed every sick person.
This was to fulfill what was said by the Lord through the prophet Isaiah: “He took our infirmities and carried our diseases.” Followers of Jesus
And seeing the crowds, Jesus commanded his disciples to go to the other side of the lake.
A man of religion came to him and said, “O teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”
Jesus said to him, “The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”
And another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, let me wait till I bury my father.”
But Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.” Jesus calms the storm
And Jesus got into the boat, and his disciples followed him.
Then a violent storm came up on the lake, so that the boat was being taken by the waves. But Jesus was sleeping.
They came near to him, and waked him, saying, Lord, save us: for we sink.
Jesus said to them, “Why are you afraid, you of little faith?” And he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
But they were astonished, saying, “What man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?” Jesus casts out a demon from two men
Then Jesus came to the region of the Gerasenes, on the other side of the lake. A man with an unclean spirit came out of the tombs to meet him. The man was so dangerous that no one dared to travel by that road.
The demons screamed, “What do you want from us, Son of God? Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?”
And there was a large herd of pigs grazing at a distance.
The evil spirits entreated him, saying, "If you drive us out, send us to the swineherd's."
Jesus said to them, “Go.” And the spirits, having departed from the men, entered the pigs; and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.
The shepherds fled to the town and told the people what had happened to the possessed by evil spirits.
So all the town went out to see Jesus, and when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their district.
Jesus Heals the Paralysed Man
Jesus got into a boat to cross to the other side of the lake and came to his own town.
So some people brought to him a man who was paralyzed and lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, “Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven.”
So some of the teachers of the sharia began to say: “This man is insulting God with his words.”
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them, “Why are you thinking evil in your hearts?
Which is easier to say: “Your sins are forgiven” or “Get up and walk”?
But I will show you something greater than that: the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” And he said to the paralytic, “Get up, take your mat and go to your home.”
He stood up and went to his house.
And when the people saw it, they were filled with awe, and glorified God, because he had given such power to men. When will Jesus come again?
As he went on his way, Jesus saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth. He said to him, “Follow me!” So he got up and followed him.
While he was eating in the house of Matthew, many publicans and sinners came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
When Jesus heard this, he said, “Those who are well do not need a doctor, but the sick do.”
Go and understand what the book means when it says: “I desire mercy, not sacrifice.” #Iwant… animal sacrifices. 13:9 from the Book of Hosea 6:6. “I have not come to call the righteous, but the sinners.” A question about fasting
Then came to him some of his disciples, and said unto him, Why fastest thou, seeing the others fast not?
Jesus said to them, “Where is the bridegroom? And they began to question one another, ‘They have taken away the bridegroom, and we have not been able to find him.’ ”
«No one sews a new piece of cloth onto an old garment, because the new piece of cloth will shrink and tear the old garment, and the hole will be worse.
New wine is not put into old skins; or else the skins break, the wine runs out, and the skins are spoiled. Therefore, new wine is put into fresh skins, and both are preserved. Jesus raises a dead girl // and heals a bleeding woman
While he was speaking, a ruler came and knelt before him, saying, “My daughter has just died. Come and put out your hand on her, and she will live.”
Then Jesus went with him and his disciples followed.
And there was a woman who had been suffering from heavy bleeding for twelve years. She came from behind Jesus and touched the edge of his cloak.
She said to herself, "Only if I touch his cloak I will be cured."
Jesus looked around and said to her, “Take heart, daughter, your faith has made you well.” And at that moment she was completely healed.
And when Jesus came to the house of the chief of the synagogue, he saw the minstrels playing, and the people in a commotion.
He said: “Go out. The boy is not dead, but he is sleeping.” They laughed at him.
And when they had brought the people out, he went into the house and took the child by the hand, and the child arose.
And the news about Jesus spread throughout that whole region. Jesus heals the blind // and drives out an evil spirit
After Jesus left that place, two blind men followed him, shouting, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”
And when Jesus entered the house, two blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to heal you?” They answered him, “Yes, Lord.”
Then he touched their eyes and said to them, “According to your faith let it be to you.”
And the blind received their sight. Then Jesus sternly warned them, “See that no one knows what has happened, so that no one may take credit for it.”
But they went and spread the news in the whole area.
As they were going along, some people brought to Jesus a man who was deaf and unable to speak, and who was supposed to be cured.
So Jesus cast out the unclean spirit, and the mute began to speak. And the crowd was amazed, and said, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!”
But the Pharisees began to say, “He casts out demons by Beelzebul, #Beelzebul. 34:9 one of the demon names. the prince of the demons.” The harvest is plentiful
And Jesus went through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness.
And when Jesus saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were weary and overwhelmed, like sheep without a shepherd.
Jesus said to his disciples: “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
“And pray to the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth harvesters into the harvest.”
Jesus sends out his disciples
And Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out and to heal every disease and every infirmity.
And these are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon, who is also called Peter, and his brother Andrew, and James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John,
Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the publican, James of Alphaeus and Thaddeus,
Simon, also called Zealots, #Zealots. 4:10 a political party of the Jews that resisted Roman rule, called the Zealots. And Judas Iscariot who betrayed Jesus.
Jesus sent out these twelve, and gave them the following instructions: “Do not go into the territory of the Samaritans,
But go to the sheep of the house of Israel astray,
And they announced that the kingdom of heaven is near.
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cure the lepers, cast out the demons. You have been given freely, so give freely.
Do not carry gold, silver, or copper in your belts,
Don’t carry a bag or extra clothing or extra shoes or a cane. The worker deserves his food.
“And when you enter a town or a village, find someone worthy and stay with them until you leave.
And when you enter a house, salute its people.
If the people of the house are entitled to it, your peace will come to them. If they are not entitled to it, your peace will return to you.
If anyone does not welcome you into their house or into their city, and will not listen to what you have to say, leave that house or that city, and shake the dust from your feet.
I say to you the truth, on the day of judgment, the people of Sodom will have a better case than these towns. Jesus Warns of Tribulation
“And I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.”
Beware of men, for they will hand you over to the courts and they will flog you in their synagogues.
And they shall deliver you up to be put to death by the governors and kings because ye have my name among the gentiles.
And when they take you, do not worry what you will say; but say in that hour what the Spirit will give you to say.
Remember that it is not you who will speak, but the spirit of your father who will speak in you.
A brother will deliver his brother up to be killed, and a father will deliver his son up to be killed.
And all men shall hate you because of my name: but he that is faithful unto the end shall be saved.
When they persecute you in one city, flee to another. I tell you the truth, you will not complete your circuit of cities in Israel until the Son of Man comes.

“Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth. I have not come to bring peace but a sword!

And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.

“Whoever welcomes you, welcomes me. And whoever welcomes me, welcomes the one who sent me.”
Whoever welcomes a prophet because he is a prophet, will receive a prophet’s reward. And whoever welcomes a righteous man because he is a righteous man, will receive a righteous man’s reward.
“Whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is my disciple, I tell you the truth, will never lose his reward.”
John the Baptist and Jesus
When Jesus had finished his instruction of the twelve disciples, he left that place, and went on to teach and to proclaim his message in the region of Galilee. Jesus and John the Baptist
While John was in prison, he heard of the works that Christ was doing, and he sent and asked him, “Are you the one who should come, or should we look for another?”
And he asked him: “Are you the one we are waiting for, or should we wait for another?”
Jesus answered them, “Go and tell John what you have heard and seen:
Now the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the good news preached to them.
And congratulations to those who have no hesitation in believing in me.
When the disciples of John had left, Jesus began to speak to the people about John, saying: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?
Why did you go out then? To see a man wearing soft clothes? Those who wear soft clothes live in the palaces of kings.
So why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, that is. But I tell you, you have seen someone greater than a prophet!
This is the one about whom it is said: ‹I am sending my messenger before your face. He will prepare your way.›»
“I tell you the truth, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.”
From the time of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom has been under siege, and the meek are trying to take it by force.
For the law of Moses and the prophets were until John.
If you want to accept what the prophets and the law say, then John is Elijah, of whom the prophets announced that he would come. #Elijah … his coming. 14:11 Elijah was one of the prophets of God, about 850 B.C. The Jews expected his coming based on Malachi 4: 5-6.
“He who has ears, let him hear.”
“What is this generation like? It is like children sitting in the markets, calling out to their friends and saying:
«We played for you, but you did not dance. We sang funeral songs for you, but you did not weep!»
John came, who did not eat like the others and did not drink wine like the others, and the people said: ‘There is a wicked spirit in him.’
Then came the Son of Man, eating and drinking, and they said, “Behold, this is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and of sinners!” But wisdom is proved right by her deeds. Jesus warns the wicked cities
Then Jesus began to rebuke the cities in which most of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent.
He said: “Woe to you, Corzin! Woe to you, بيت صيدا! If the miracles that happened to you had happened in صور and صيداء, you would have repented long ago, and your people would have worn sackcloth and sat on ashes.”
But I say to you that it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you.
And you, Kafr-Nahoum, do you think you will be lifted up to heaven? No, but you will be cast into the abyss! If the miracles that happened to you had happened in Sodom, you would still be with us today.
But I say to you that it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the inhabitants of Sodom than for your. Jesus is the source of comfort
At that time Jesus said: “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to little children.
Yes, father, because you were pleased with doing this.
«For the Father has given all things into the hands of the Son. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.»
Come to me, all you who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.
Carry my yoke #Neri. 29:11 The yoke is a wooden tool placed on animals to help them carry heavy loads, and is a Jewish symbol of the law. You, and learn from me, for I am meek and lowly of heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
“For I give you the light of life, and the burden I lay upon you is light.”
Jesus: Lord of the Sabbath
At that time, Jesus went out to walk in the fields one Sabbath day. His disciples were hungry and began to pick the ears of wheat and eat them.
But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, “See, your disciples are doing what is not permitted to be done on the Sabbath.”
Jesus said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
He entered the house of God and ate the loaves of bread which are offered to God, although it is not lawful for him or for those with him to eat that bread, but only for the priests.
Did you not read in the law of Moses that the priests on the sabbath day do not keep the law concerning the sabbath? Yet they are not punished for their work.
But I say to you that there is something greater than the temple here.
And if you knew what the book means when it says: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ #I_desire… animal sacrifices. 7:12 from Hosea 6:6. When you judged those innocent ones.
“The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.” The healing on the Sabbath
Then he left that place and went to their congregation.
And there was a man there who had a withered hand. They questioned Jesus, saying, “Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath?”
He said to them, “Suppose one of you has a sheep that falls into a pit on the Sabbath. Won’t you pull it out?”
And man is more important than a sheep. If you do good on Saturday, it is in accordance with the law.
Then Jesus said to the man with the paralysed hand, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored, like the other.
The Pharisees went out and began to plot how to kill Jesus. Jesus: God’s Chosen Servant
Jesus knew their plan and left that place. A large crowd followed him and he healed all of them.
And he ordered them not to reveal his identity.
This was to fulfill what the Lord said through the prophet Isaiah:
“Behold my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom I delight; I will put my spirit upon him, and he will declare judgment to the Gentiles.
He will not quarrel with anyone and will not shout, and no one will hear his voice in their streets.
He will not break even the bent reed, nor will he extinguish even the smoldering wick. He will continue until he makes justice prevail.
And all nations will put their hope in him. The reign of Jesus
Then they brought to him a man who was deaf and mute, being seized with a demon. And he cured him, so that the deaf and mute man spoke and saw.
The people were astonished, and said, “Can this be David’s son?”
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, “This man is casting out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of demons. 24:12 One of the names of the devil. Also in verse 27. The chief of demons.”
And knowing their thoughts, he said to them: “Every kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.
If the devil is casting out devils and fighting himself, how can his kingdom stand?
If I cast out demons with the power of Beelzebub, what do your disciples cast them out with? For they are the ones who judge you.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the Kingdom of God has come upon you.
How can one enter the house of a strong man and rob his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then he will be able to rob his house.
«Whoever is not with me is against me. Whoever does not gather with me scatters.»
Therefore I say to you, all sin and blasphemy can be forgiven to men, but the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit can never be forgiven.
Whoever speaks against man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, in this world or in the world to come. The fruit reveals the truth.
«To get good fruit, plant a good tree. A bad tree gives bad fruit. Because a tree is known by its fruit.
You sons of snakes, how can you speak good things and you are evil? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.
A good man brings out what is good from his treasure of goodness, and an evil man brings out what is evil from his stock of evil.
But I tell you, on the day of judgment, people will be asked about every word they spoke.
Your Words Will Determine Your Acquittal or Conviction.” Jewish Leaders Ask for Proof
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees asked him, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.”
He answered them, “This evil and adulterous generation is looking for a sign to believe. But the sign of Jonah will be given to this generation.”
For as Jonah was in the belly of a great fish three days and three nights, so shall the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
On the day of judgment the people of Nineveh will stand against this generation and condemn it, because they repented when they heard the warning of Jonah. Now, here you are, greater than Jonah.
“And there stood Queen of the South #Queen of the South. 42:12 Queen of Sheba. She came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. See 1 Kings 10:1-13. The day of judgment against this generation and it will be judged. She came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And now you have one greater than Solomon here before you. The empty soul
“When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through dry places seeking rest, and finds none,
Then he says: ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ He goes and finds the house empty, swept and tidy.
Then he will go and bring with him seven more spirits more evil than himself, and they will enter and dwell there. And the last state of that man will be worse than the first. So will it be with the present evil generation.” Jesus’ disciples are his family
While he was talking with the crowd, his mother and his brothers and sisters were standing outside, asking for a word with him.
A man said to Jesus, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside and want to speak to you.”
Jesus answered him, “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”
Then he pointed to his disciples and said: “Here are my mother and my brothers!
“For whoever does the will of my heavenly Father, he is my brother and sister and mother.”
Like the seeds
On that day, Jesus left the house and sat down by the lake.
A large crowd gathered around him. He got into a boat and sat in it, while the people stood on the shore.
And he said unto them many things in parables, saying, “A certain farmer went out to sow his seed.
While he was sowing, some of the seed fell by the wayside, and birds came and ate it.
Some of the seeds fell on rocky ground, where there was not enough soil, and the seeds sprouted quickly because the soil was not deep.
But when the sun rose it burned, and because it had no roots it withered.
Some of the seeds fell on thorns. The thorns grew and hindered its growth.
Other seeds fell on good soil. Some of them grew and yielded a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.
“He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”
The disciples came to him and asked him: “Why do you speak to them by parables?”
Jesus answered them, “The Father has set apart for you what is God’s, and what is God’s has been given to you.
For whoever has, to him more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.
For this reason I will speak to them in parables, because they have a heart that is blind and ears that are deaf.
And so the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled: “You will hear, but you will not understand; you will look, but you will not see.”
Their minds have become dull and their ears heavy. They have closed their eyes, so they cannot see, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their hearts, lest they turn to me and I heal them.›
As for you, congratulations to your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
I say to you the truth, many kings and righteous ones longed to see what you see and did not see, and they longed to hear what you hear and did not hear. The meaning of such sowing
“Listen to the explanation of the Parable of the Sower:
When a person hears the message of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes #the_evil_one. 19:13 meaning the devil. (Also in verse 38) and takes the seeds that were sown in his heart. This is the meaning of the seeds that fell by the wayside.
“But those that fall on the rocky ground are like those who, hearing the word, receive it with joy;
But because it has no roots in itself, it lasts only a short time, and when the pressure and persecution come because of the word that came before, it quickly loses its faith.
“But the one that fell among thorns is like the one who hears the word, but the worries of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it does not bear fruit.”
«But the seed sown on good soil is the one that hears the word and understands it. It produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.» Like the grain and the weeds
And he said to them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
But while the people were asleep, the man’s enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and then went away.
And when the wheat sprouted and formed ears, so did the weeds.
His slaves came to him and said, “Master, have you not sown good seeds in your field? So where do these weeds come from?”
The man answered them: “My enemy did that.” His slaves asked him: “Do you want us to go and pull it out?”
“No,” the man said, “because when you pull the weeds, you may pull up the wheat with it.”
Let them grow together until the harvest, and at the harvest I will say to the reapers, ‘First gather the weeds and bundle them for fire. But as for the grain, gather it and put it in my store.’” For example, mustard and yeast.
Then Jesus told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and planted in his field.
It is the smallest of the seeds. But when it grows, it becomes the biggest of the garden plants, it becomes a great tree, even the birds of the sky come to it, and they make their nests in its branches.
And he said to them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till the whole was leavened.”
Jesus said all these things using parables. And he did not say anything to them except in parables.
This is what God said through the prophet: “I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.”
Then Jesus dismissed the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the parables of the weeds in the field.”
He said to them, “The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man,
And the field is the world, and the good seeds are those to whom the kingdom belongs. The weeds are those who belong to the evil one.
And the enemy that sows them is Satan. And the harvest is the end of the world. And the harvesters are the angels.
“And as weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will be the end of the world.”
For the Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;
Then they throw them into the oven. There people cry and grit their teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear. The parable of the treasure and the pearl
“The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and because of his joy he went and sold all his possessions and bought that field.”
“The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.”
And when he found a very precious pearl, he went and sold all that he had and bought it. Like a net
“The kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and collected fish of every kind.”
And when the net was full, the fishermen pulled it ashore. Then they sat down and sorted the good fish into baskets, while the bad ones they threw out.
This is what will happen at the end of the world, when the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous,
Then the evildoers are thrown into the fiery furnace. There people weep and gnash their teeth.
And Jesus asked his disciples: “Do you understand all these things?” They answered: “Yes.”
“Therefore every teacher of the law who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the head of a household who brings out of his storeroom both new and old things.” Jesus Returns to His Town
When Jesus had finished saying these parables, he went away from there.
When he returned to his hometown, he began to teach them in their synagogue. Everyone was astonished and said, “Where did this man get all this wisdom and these miracles?”
Is Ali the son of the carpenter? Is his mother Mary? Are his brothers Jacob, Joseph, Simon and Judas?
Don’t all his sisters live among us? Where did he get all he has?”
This was the reason why they did not accept him. But Jesus said to them: “A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country and in his own house!”
He did not work many miracles there, because of their unbelief.
Herod hears about Jesus
At that time, Herod, the tetrarch of Galilee, #Galilee. 1:14 heard literally “tetrarch of the quarter.” The Romans had divided Palestine into four provinces, so the governor of each province was called the tetrarch or tetrarch of the quarter. See Luke 3:1. about Jesus.
He said to his servants, “It is John the Baptist, risen from the dead, and for this reason miracles are being done by him!” The death of John the Baptist
It was Herod who arrested John and put him in prison, because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
For John had said to Herod, “You are not allowed to have your brother’s wife.”
For this reason Herod was trying to kill him, but he was afraid of the people, because they considered John a prophet.
But when the day of Herod’s birthday came, Herodias his sister danced before him and all the guests, and she delighted Herod greatly,
He even promised and swore to give her whatever she asked for, whatever it was.
But her mother had instilled in her what to ask, so she said: “Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a plate.”
The king was sad, but he ordered her request to be granted because of his oath, and out of respect for his guests.
So he sent and had John's head cut off in prison.
Then he brought his head on a plate and gave it to her, and she gave it to his mother.
Then came the disciples of John, and took away his body, and buried it: and went and told Jesus. Jesus feeds more than five thousand
When Jesus heard this, he went off by himself to a crowded place and taught the people there.
And when he came down to the sea, he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, and he healed their sick.
In the evening, his disciples came to him and said, “This place is remote, and the hour is late.
But Jesus said to them, “It is not necessary for them to go away; give them something to eat.”
His disciples said to him, “We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish.”
Jesus said to them, “Bring her to me.”
And he commanded the people to sit down on the grass. Then Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks, and broke the loaves and distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples distributed them to the crowds.
They ate and were satisfied. They gathered up the rest of the food, twelve baskets full of broken pieces.
Five thousand men ate from it, not to mention women and children. Jesus walks on water
Then Jesus commanded his disciples to get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.
And after he had dismissed them, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.
The boat was in the middle of the lake, and the waves were hitting it hard, because the wind was against the boat.
Shortly before dawn, Jesus came to them, walking on the lake.
When his disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified and said, “It’s a ghost!” and they cried out for fear.
Then Jesus said to them at once, “Take heart! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”
Peter answered him, “If it is really you, tell me to walk on the water to you.”
He said to him, “Come.” And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter noticed the strong wind, he was afraid and began to sink. He cried out, “Lord, save me!”
Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught him, saying to him, “O you of little faith, why did you doubt?”
And when Jesus was gone up into the ship, immediately there arose a great tempest on the sea, so that the ship was covered with the waves: but Jesus was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep.
Those in the boat fell down before Jesus and said, “You are truly the Son of God.” Jesus Heals Many
And when they had crossed the lake, they came to Genesaret.
And when the inhabitants of that place had heard of Jesus, they sent out into all that country and brought to him all that were sick.
They implored him to allow them to touch only the hem of his garment. All who touched it were healed.
God’s Law and People’s Customs
Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law from Jerusalem came to him and asked:
«Why do your students break the traditions we have inherited from our ancestors? They do not wash their hands before eating.»
Jesus replied, “Why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?”
And God said: “Honor your father and your mother.” #Honor … your mother. 4:15 From the Book of Exodus 20: 12, and the Book of Deuteronomy 5: 16. And he said: “Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death.” #Whoever curses … shall be put to death. 4:15 From the Book of Exodus 21: 17.
But you say, “Whoever may say to father or mother, ‘I have no more to give to you; everything that I have given to the Lord,’ he is not obliged to honor his father or his mother.”
And so you have ignored the will of God because of your traditions.
O hypocrites! Believe Isaiah’s prophecy concerning you, when he said:
This people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
Their worship is in vain, because they teach what is not but human commandments.››
Jesus called out to the people and said to them: “Listen to me, and understand the things that I say to you.
What enters a man’s mouth does not defile him, but what comes out of his mouth, that defiles him.
Then his disciples came to him and said, “You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard what you said.”
Jesus answered, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots.
Leave them, for they are blind leading the blind. And if one blind man leads another blind man, both of them will fall into the pit.
Peter answered, “Explain to us the meaning of this simile.”
Jesus said: “Have you not understood yet?”
Don’t you understand that whatever goes into a person’s mouth goes into the stomach, and then comes out?
But what comes out of a man’s mouth comes from his heart. And this is what defiles a man.
For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false testimony, and slander.
These are the things that defile a man, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile a man.” Jesus helps a stranger
And Jesus went out from there and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
And a woman from the town, who was a Canaanite, came to him, crying out: “Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is tormented by a demon and is suffering very much.”
Jesus did not answer her a word. His disciples came to him and asked him, “Send her away, for she is following us and making a disturbance.”
He said: “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the House of Israel.”
But the woman came near him and fell on her face and said: “Lord, help me.”
Jesus answered her, “It is not right to take the children’s food and throw it to the dogs.”
She said: “Yes, sir, but even dogs eat from what falls from their masters’ table.”
Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, your faith is great. Let it be done for you as you wish.” And at once her daughter was cured. Jesus heals many
And Jesus left that place and went to a region near the Sea of Galilee. He went up on the mountain and sat there.
A great multitude came to him, having with them the lame, the blind, the sick, the mute, and many others who were in need. They laid them at his feet, and he cured every one;
The crowd was astonished, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, the lepers cleansed, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel. Jesus feeds more than four thousand
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, “I have compassion for these people; they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way.”
His disciples said to him, “Where in the wilderness can we get enough bread to feed such a crowd?”
Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” They answered, “Seven, and some little fish.”
So Jesus commanded the people to sit down on the ground.
And he took the seven loaves and the fish, and giving thanks, he broke the loaves and distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowd.
Everyone ate and was satisfied. Then they gathered the rest of the broken bread, and there were seven full baskets.
There were four thousand men who ate, not counting women and children.
And when he had dismissed the multitude, he went up into a ship, and returned to the region of Magdala.
Jewish Leaders Test Jesus
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus to test him, and they asked him to give them a sign from God to prove his authority.
Jesus answered them, “When evening comes, you say, ‘The weather will be fair, for the sky is red.’
In the morning, you say: ‘Today will be stormy, because the sky is red and overcast.’ You are good at interpreting the signs of the weather, but you are not good at understanding the times in which you live!
This generation is an evil and corrupt generation, which seeks a sign to believe. And no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.” And leaving them, Jesus departed from them. Misunderstanding
Jesus’ disciples crossed to the other side of the lake, but they had forgotten to bring bread.
And He said to them, “Take heed of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.”
Then the disciples began to reason with one another, “We have no bread.”
Jesus knew what they were saying and said to them, “You of little faith, why are you arguing among yourselves that there is no bread?”
Have you not realized yet? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered from the broken pieces?
Don’t you remember the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered from the broken ones?
Why do you not understand that I was not speaking to you about common bread, but was warning you to keep yourselves from the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees?
Then his disciples understood that he did not want to warn them away from the leaven of the bread, but from the teaching of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. Peter declares that Jesus is the Christ
And when Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do the crowds say that I am?”
His disciples answered him, “Some say you are John the Baptist, or Elijah, or Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.”
He said to them: “But who do you think I am?”
Simon Peter answered him, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
Jesus answered him, “I congratulate you, Simon son of Jonah, because it was not flesh and blood that revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven.
And I say to you that you are Peter, #Peter. 18:16 from the Greek “petros” meaning “rock.” On this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell #the gates of hell. 18:16 meaning the power of death. You will not be able to overcome it.
And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Then he sternly warned his disciples that they should not tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus speaks about the inevitability of his death
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and undergo many things from the elders and chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised up.
But Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “Be it far from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you!”
Then Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. You are thinking not about God’s concerns but about people’s concerns.”
Then Jesus said to his disciples: “If anyone wants to come after me, he must deny himself, take up his cross and follow me.
Whoever wants to save his life, will lose it. But whoever loses his life for me, will find it.
What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul? And what can a man give in return for his life?
For the Son of Man is coming in the glory of his Father with his angels, and he will render to each man according as his deeds.
I tell you the truth, some standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Jesus with Moses and Elijah
Six days later Jesus took Peter, James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain, where they were to be alone with him.
And as they were coming down, he was transfigured before them; his face blazed like the sun, and his clothes became white as snow.
And suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, “It would be wonderful to be here with you. If you want, I’ll pitch three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
And as Peter was speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice came from the cloud: “This is my beloved Son, whom I am pleased with; listen to him.”
When the pupils heard that, they trembled and fell on their faces.
Jesus came and touched them and said, “Get up! Don’t be afraid.”
And when they looked around, they saw no one but Jesus.
As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them a command: “Do not tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”
And his disciples asked him, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?” #Elijah … first. 10:17 Elijah was one of God’s prophets about 850 B.C. The Jews expected him to come based on Malachi 4: 5-6.
Jesus answered them, “Truly, I say to you, there is no one who is accepted by God but the one who is accepted by his Father.
But I say to you that Elijah has come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him what they pleased. And so will the Son of Man be by them.
Then his disciples understood that he was speaking about John the Baptist. Jesus drives out a demon from a child
And when they returned to the multitude, a man came to Jesus and fell on his knees before him
And he said, "Have mercy on my son, O Lord, for he is a epileptic and suffers much pain. He often falls into fire or water.
And I have brought him to your students, but they could not heal him.
Jesus said, “You of little faith, when will there be an end of your disbelief? Ask yourself, ‘How long must I put up with you?’” Then he said to the man, “Bring me your son here.”
So Jesus commanded the unclean spirit to come out of him, and the boy was healed instantly.
Then his disciples came to him in private and asked him, “Why were we not able to cast it out?”
Jesus replied, “Because of your little faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.
But this kind comes out only by prayer and fasting.” Jesus announces his impending death
As they went on journeying by boat in the lake of Galilee, Jesus said, “The Son of Man is about to be given into the hands of men.”
And they will kill him. But on the third day he will rise again. The disciples were very sad. The tax of the temple
And when Jesus came into Capernaum, he entered the house of Peter, and his mother-in-law lay in a fever.
Peter answered him, “Yes, he does.” Then Peter went to the house. Jesus began to speak to him, “Tell me, Simon, from whom do the kings of the earth collect customs and taxes? From their own sons or from others?”
Peter answered: “They collect it from other peoples.” Jesus said: “If so, the children are exempt from it.
But so as not to cause them a problem, go to the lake, and cast a fishing line. Then take the first fish you catch, and open its mouth. You will find a four-dirham coin in it. Take it and give it to them in my name and in your name.
