Alright, alright, come on, peacefully
He didn't agree.
He says only those who can, will rise.
You're welcome at any time
I'm going to the bank in the morning, what about you?
I've been learning all these years
Sure, here is the translation: He definitely feels the pressure.
Do what's best for him
Leave him to rest again.
Poor Farhan, he's going home
Someone called me and said that Khalid
He's being difficult to finalize his treatment.
Fear Allah
Everyone depends on themselves
My mother is sorry about the henpecked
This kid is so naughty
I'm not sorry for the traitors, my mother.

You're saying that kids depend on us, God bless you, you don't listen to the elders
I only do what I believe in
Upon him and upon his family be peace.
I'm sitting here, waiting for the butterflies to come back.
Today
Goodbye
I forgot to tell you
My love, my darling
May God help you
Yeah, who's going to the market?
You heard from my brother quickly

Hello, Els Jana
Welcome, don't miss out
From one ministry to another, government transactions.
Ministry of Interior from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
behind the children's transactions
Respect your elders and respect your youngsters, so that they may respect you.
The kids are holding important jobs.
Their time is cramped and tight.
Every day except a meeting with the manager or with the responsible person or with the minister
They have nice jobs, but then they need time to get used to the work and suddenly...
I'm tired, finish your business and leave me alone. Second job, I'll make you sit idle, how?
حظا مبروك جزاك الله خيرا
Goodbye for now
Oh God, forgive us again, oh Bushahin
They called me, they said it's done.
If your dad pays a good salary, he'll treat you fairly.
I'm running really late
Fear your Lord
It's impossible, especially me.
For his love in you
He's fed up and tired of you and your behavior towards him.
You don't even respect the gray hair on his head.
There has been a fly in the room for two days.
From these streets and these suns
May God bless you with this deal
And may His spirit protect her for him.
A committee that comes in the morning until the next day
سمعتك يا ماما
It means that the building is very beautiful.
You have until the last day and the committee.
Your treatment is bound to end with a fee
Come over at night and check on them for me, or else.
He has a committee that he must satisfy.
What's up, Dad?
Tears welled up in his eyes
I never told my parents.
The committee is the one that changed their opinion.
They said Piyun by the end of the week
Say the truth about your father
Hey, don't go.
I'm going to heaven and he's not coming.
A meeting was held in the cafeteria with these issues
You laugh at him.
I'm done.
I'm going to apologize to him.
I'm going to him
Thank you, my friend.
Eternity, oh my love
Thank you for your apology.
I woke up feeling selfish afterwards
What a tiring day when the committee doesn't come
You are goodness and blessings.
From today onwards
We handle our transactions ourselves.
at home
This is your head, Abusa.
Hello hello hello oh book
Good morning
Dear Dad
The whole world
Why are you mad?
I'm not annoyed
And you are like what I told you
I'm done with this deal.
I want to finish it myself.
Come quickly
You have a meeting
Minister Saadah
Make her happiest moment, my love
They brought him along with the adults.
O joy of mine, they told me your child is with the W and oh no, this is it
May Allah grant you long-lasting, smooth success.
Prince Saeed Wink
The one who made you submit, oh fool
My old friend
You just wait and I'll throw you the envelope with the money.
My love, my dear
It means what happened
It seems he forgot
The committee will meet after one o'clock
There is no god but Allah will keep you safe.
My son has a meeting with the minister today, and first of all
Give me the deal.
Hey, I'm working from home and home from work.
Nobody was there.
Hello
And upon you be peace, sir.
I don't know, lalala, he didn't do it, he didn't do anything.
Neither a week nor a classified beer goes to the bar.
There's no one at the farmhouse
I'll go in the morning
He took a break. Of course, there was.
No more poetry from you, not even a single verse.
He tells you that the cook doesn't need it.
And I'll leave him.
With peace
May it be good
May what my uncle did be good
May God guide you.

You're the best
He killed him.
By Allah, my brother
Allow me, my dear brother
The league and the cup
He was talking about the judgment
My mother said this boy is crazy, where did he come from?
Hold onto him, we're the Kharabiyeh and we're the Kharabiyeh
People started using it again
It's great that he's a Hajj pilgrim, and they tell him to speak on the radio and television.
The one that is more beneficial
Catch them, grab them, guys, and throw them in jail
I believe you, my brother.
Oh, you lawful daughter, these days no one can do anything.
It's full of problems.
By God, if I die now
Leave him to his own devices and only listen to his words if they're sensible.
Praise be to God for his safety
Our blessings upon you
Goodbye
I'm late for work, my mother
Listen up, kiddo
I was up all night last night.
I warn you
Right now, I just wanted to remind you, my dear.
Enough, man!
Impossible after calling
No radio, no TV until the router is connected
Your sister has been living in her new place for two days.
Your bride, Munirah, her tears are four, four on her cheek.
It's forbidden for you, you fool. Have mercy on us and may those who have mercy on your parents.
As I said
We are the Destroyers
What's left of your patience
Your uncle is coming with his wife.
Yana after he was released from prison
He said "That's it."
Break the ice
Get lost, you fool. I fell for his gift. May Allah protect me from the devil. I hope it will only bring good.
The second time, he'll grab you by the hand and take you to court. He'll let his daughter go.
Enough, dude!
Repentance after saying
If you call the radio or television, you only have yourself to blame.
Act of repentance
Let me go back, I'll go now
Between you and me only.
He told me I'm the manager
We have a notification.
I'm going to disconnect from the management.
We'll make you a nice mess.
الآن المدير مشغول.
He's got a million excuses, always has an excuse.
Where am I going?
I guess that's it, I'm done.
I miss you
Yes, indeed
Goodbye
I love you
What do you mean, Saleh? Are you challenging me?
The public interest forced us to reduce the number of correspondents in the ministry.
You're right, but
The one who makes you submit is just a single snake in our midst.
It's nice of you
We are the Destroyers
Yes, indeed
I'm here for you.
We have a job if you're interested
What's up, man?
Handle the matter
I miss Salouh so much
What killed the dinosaur
Munira was standing and listening when I said to her
I said, "Oh my!"
I hear them, give me Tony from the mill.
My soul is now inside you
Let me understand with Abu J.
We said we were wrong and fell silent.
We will remain silent after we finish.
because we're family
How are you?
I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed devil.
Insha'Allah, it will only bring good.
Mentioning Allah guides you.
I don't want coffee, make me coffee instead.
I know how
Bored
Give your uncle a two-week extension.
By God, He won't hold you back and will take you to court to get a divorce.
I wish I had never been born
You're always in trouble.
Take it upon yourself
Even if someone tells you
Think for yourself, don't just listen.
We're not just here to cause trouble.
Yeah, Uncle.
Don't punish me for these two days.
We've heard enough of your nonsense, just once, just once from you.
Enough already.
To be the police
Lala yama, you're misunderstanding
My uncle's son has a problem, so we asked him to speak about it on the radio.
He was hesitant to grill.
We hesitated to speak to him in a public place, so he hesitated.
I told my uncle's son that I would give him the house and that it would be better to speak to him privately.
Do you feel like he wants to say something?
It means he's indecisive, neither here nor there.
They came from somewhere.
Stop stop stop stop stop stop stop
I am not your mother, I don't know you, and I disown you until the Day of Judgment. I heard and did not say no.
Saleh Saad
No god, I swear you're done, finally. We're rid of you, thank god.
Do you have a sense of responsibility?
A successful employee example
Unfortunately
Despite trying
Hello to you
Why are you exhausting yourself, man?
I'm Tony, I was talking to the secretary to let you know I'm not coming.
Shahin Ashfaq
You didn't know about this
Afaa, there's someone in Qatar who doesn't know Saleh except as a troublemaker.
You are a good person, but you are a troublemaker.
We are the Destroyers
The job is great.
But there are no jobs, you know, I mean, the circumstances, you know.
Zayn, oh Real, they didn't employ him
I work at our place
What made you leave the place, I swear, Manira? You didn't go?
He said before I came, five minutes ago, he had a job but he lost it.
My wife lived yesterday, she divorced him and
Its meaning implies that my responsibility has become so great
After one became responsible for the great
I swear I don't know what to do, I swear
Approaching the minister's residence
I'm honestly not feeling it, she's not my type.
He thinks I'm afraid to take his place.
I'm done for.
Who told you I'm okay?
I wish this method were far from me.
I'm thinking of a way to slaughter him.
Once and for all
I miss you
I know
People who are interviewed on the radio
Baby, you're the best
And you're just a bite of information
You, Saleh, are a citizen brimming with national spirit.
You are a patriotic citizen
Received
I swear, I'm done.
I consider your voice to be the voice of truth
I'm like Bufahd, after I've hung out with him, I'm cooked.
Welcome back, Saleh.
We've been hearing this for a while now, but we're just messing around.
I remember meeting him
This is normal, Saleh.
I camp out
Forward, forward, forward
Few are like you
Your words are very nice.
Your words on the radio were so beautiful.
We heard only the sound of the waves.
He's being silly again, coming back alone so I can scold him. Now he's saying it, saying it, "I heard, I heard, I heard, I heard."
We played marbles
This is the original, may you live long. This is it.
Your request continues unabated
It's hard to grill.
Then Ma'ali stood up
I want to keep helping people with their problems and issues
Listen up, Saleh
I'll give you just one problem.
You, Saleh, are the voice of truth.
I'll come over to cook
A high-ranking official
It's true, by God.
By Allah
This is your chance
The opportunity doesn't come twice.
No means no.
You're the one who doesn't understand.

This is a special request call.
InshaAllah, you'll name him Naeem.
Last night, disaster struck.
Do I know you?
Life and what happened
This is the last one, that's it.
Sultan's friend flew.
The speed is terrifying, Minister.
He said the right thing.
It's been a while since the witch's cruelty has truly been felt by Wufhad as he plays with his spirit.
I will complete all the tasks
As long as you live
The minister is present, seeking.
Goodbye

Enough, this is the last one, enough after that.
Oh, and here you are, long live your papers for the job, forgive me, it's raining.

He evaded responsibility and exposed atrocities and corruption.
You point out flaws and criticize
They are afraid of you.
My dear sister, I've been deceived.
You are the kind one
Uncle Payee's son, Abu Amneirah
If I work
They only have old news to criticize and point out flaws.
Why do they envy our country?
Do we have any flaws?
We have connections

I go to the government departments on the second floor
We don't have bribes.
We don't know her.
Look at the employee
No, never. A foreigner does not get more than a local.
We do everything ourselves by hand

Your boss is upset with you and you're still on the job.
We are the best people
The best country
Flawless
And thank you.

Come come see your brother's handsome son cooking
You don't need to buy it expensive for me, it's not like I have a son who will grow up to be handsome.
Look, I'm trying
This one doesn't work, this is the one that works, this one doesn't work, I'll take it.
I'll do what he wants in it, of course no one will oppose him
Where is the sweetness?
Look at the guy faking his injury on purpose.

What are you saying, my Lord?
How did you know the famous actor Rashid Abdullah, my friend?
Yes, yes, right.

My dearest, I'm going to ask my father-in-law for a loan, and if he agrees, I'll sell all the furniture.
I'll repeat that for you one more time.

We can say that it's finally over.
Good morning, good morning
I'm sorry, but I can't help with that.
Bouali knows his goat with us
شكرا جزيلا، يبارك الله فيك، ما قصرت يا بوسعد
Everyone loves you, mashallah
God is so sweet
Come back guys, I see Professor Rashid is busy, let him go
Permission granted, Professor Rashed has given us time off, nothing else.
At your service, at your service
You have a strong mediator on your side
We're your family and your brothers'. If we need something or anything, we'll say "Insha'Allah, Insha'Allah". We won't forget.
Where should I put it? I'll bring it to you.
I'm sorry, I don't understand why you're ignoring me.
You're hiding Manal from me
Agreed, agreed, agreed.
Manal spoke to her mother about me.
Astonishment struck him with disbelief.
Mother of Walid
Dresses for a wedding party
I understood
The falcon is a true-born son, God willing, my eye's sight.
He came back to me, poor thing
Accessories
Call them jewelry accessories
This is my mother
It's now time to assemble the motor assembly.
Mashallah Mashallah
Mashallah, I can't argue with that.
Mom, did you see what Walid has become?
على كل اللي عطيته إياه بعد عطيته السيارة
With her, the Driol
ها إذا إذا ر رحت معاج هاللون ما بيصدقون ان هالاجلح والاملح زوج هالملكه Here if you go to the palace, they won't believe that Al-Ajlah and Al-Amlah are the queen's husband.
Ameba Way
Insha'Allah, you'll go with these clothes.
No no no no no Fava Alig
Without my clothes, you guys wouldn't recognize me.
They say that old man who came to us
Coffee is good for longevity
I don't know you, I swear. I said this is definitely one of the cabarets. We don't know you, you're not Ali.
Opinions
walking distance
May God bless you with two tails that we can propose marriage with.
Elderly people
I prepared my soul to drive the car for him.
I'm sure you have it.
The last series I acted in
at a wedding, mention any wedding
I was wearing that black coat, sparkling.
After your father teaches me how to wear the coat
Your brother's god bless you, he never wore a shirt.
Mashallah amin waramin
Any juice would be nice for the miles on the group
Avoid injustice.
Brother Rashid,
ما عندك بعد ازرار What do you have after the buttons?
Hello
My constant companion, me and Khaloud
The previous one was good, meaning
I miss you, my love.
We're people now
Our daughter Norah is going far away.
Noura Al-Haq Walid
I said to myself, I'll see her at the university and I didn't find anyone better than her.
This blessed hour
Insha'Allah, I'll tell the truth, his father, and may He write what is good in it.
Why did they raise it without a reason?
His father is an actor
Call your dad's spirit
Quickly, Rashid said, "I want you."
Hey you
Cried out for the safety of oppression
They say that because his father is an actor
You are ashamed of yourselves
I am an actor
But the most honorable example
I perform on stage for two hours and then my turn ends.
The performance ends
You play roles
I act
I send them a message informing them
But you
I put on my acting clothes
On stage
But you
You represented it in the miles
The old lady
There is no actor among us
The real actor
Don't be sad, Walid
Lift your head
We don't condescend.
But you missed the view at the time, oh Yai
Listen to her screaming at him, don't look back, don't look back, poor thing, he's breaking her heart.
Her master walks
I say there are horses in paradise
It's Thursday, Real
Thursday
I'll look at it sometimes.
You are being mocked.
So that this happens, this happens
So that I don't see women and women don't see me
I saw how he lied to you.
Seda doesn't look around
But tomorrow I won't be at the office
Enough, enough, Khamees, look at them, how they're dressed, the stupid.
Thursday, I'm sorry for your clothes.
You're right not to call your wife's clothes "her clothes".
Let's go, it's Thursday again
A hollow spirit, Salem Ashbi
Poor thing, my brother
When will you be like this again?
What people say about you behind your back
لا مشالله حتى جدامي يقولون ممكن أكتر بعد
Why am I doing this?
I miss you
I long for you, Shine
I spend hours in front of the TV.
This is it.
By Allah the Almighty
Lala, it's normal.
السلام عليكم أختي
A pair of times
I used to go to my grandfather's house and hear the sound of Real.
I swear, sometimes I cut my clothes in the car.
Respect yourself and leave her.
It's tough, let it go.
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Do not come near me Do not come near my family
I miss you so much
Neti Khair
Are you challenging me?
Your only problem is the company you keep.
I'm the one who's been with you all along, not just material things, but life itself, God willing, the two of us.
A buzz that sounds like a paradise planted today has emerged
The honorable one who has no shame
I want you to torment me in my grave.
Let me understand her.
After I said
Agree with him
I'm not going to let anyone hurt me.
Salam Ishfik Ishsair
Our Thursday neighbor
I'll cook, but I won't watch the pot and let it boil over.
I'm not saying the limp in his head is wobbling up and down.
Just another Thursday, poor thing
Everyone was saying that his mother was old and he was sitting arguing with her
My sufficiency is in Allah concerning my wife
They say it's Thursday for you
He's currently on an international call, please hang up the line.
Healed her with the message
I say, may God help you, Ya Khamees
I hope you're well.
I don't have any desire, I swear I don't know, maybe it will come to me.
For tomorrow's meeting
with the women's delegation at the ministry
It can mean
May God guide you, Khamees
الاسماء هذه من مكتب سعادة الوزير
And then come
You're scared of her.
If I were to argue with Salem, I wouldn't be afraid.
The fool's saying
A car that is rusty and has a broken water tank.
Just my luck

Last number
The last number you called after deleting the number you needed
Say her name, oh women's father
Kill me kill me kill me
She has a healthy appetite
Hello my dear friend, how are you? How is work?
You're telling the truth, my brother.
What are you wearing?
I'm going to go diving
By God, what have you done to me? She said, "Get out of my car."
Call me
Call my mother-in-law
Mr. Morty
Say it, brother, give me the pen, I'll give you the number.
Some of you are in charge
This is your nature, you guys from Riyadh
You're one lucky guy, but I'm telling you
I won't go to the minister's office again if I have to intervene a second time.
This is why
He threatened me, saying that he would complain about me to the minister's office.
Bold move, this.
You're planning to cut off my livelihood, is that it?
I was the one at fault for listening to you and contacting her.
Deep returned, ya Khamees
If you complain to me in the minister's office
I come with you, there are people who say that the past has risen again.
I'm broke
Are you afraid?
Dear brothers and sisters
Good morning everyone.
It is an honor to have you attend the meeting.
The rest of them, where are they?
It's raining cats and dogs
It's Thursday evening
Long may you live
Phone sugar
Enough, don't mess with me, leave me alone in the office.
The entire meeting is one hour.
Here's my phone number
It became a habit and it became a tradition.
I've been at your place since that day and I'm not going back to their house.
Where is he going?
I'll go
Zack is still in the same condition today.
Be jealous, be jealous of him, be envious
My love, this is nothing else
Yells Ahni in the hall at night, his spirit.
Say it, solve it, oh father
The father, the father has passed away.
I need you to help me find a solution
Madame Aya asked you to move from the department where we have women.
A military rule is
I'm glad you signed up below
Please translate the following text into English: "Brother, if you don't mind, I want to transfer to the Social Care department."
Are you sure you're transferring to the care department?
Why is it weird
Alhamdulillah, may peace be upon you
You are the sister, I apologize, brother Khames
Please contact our minister's office and inform us.
I've arrived at your department.
Menu with you in the office
Isa, Saleh, Jassim and
Mr. Juma, the minister decided to transfer you yesterday.
Today I'm sending you to your new department.
I explained to you that I have a problem with my family
You are a decisive minister.
I'll go to the minister
Today, I started my annual leave.
And he will return only after a month and a half
What a mess!
I'd like to know your opinion after.
The minister said the same thing to you.
I'll see you a place this time, I'll move you because they told me about your problem with your wife
I'm telling you honestly
the solution
They said if I call you this time, we won't argue.
Please ask them to help you, Washdrak.
They made them put the toys in the car, they put them in a box.
Just him
I put in ten days' worth of work assuming there are five of you in the office, so each person would handle two days.
He was so scared of his wife that he even feared her shadow.
Imagine we all named ourselves with fictional names
I'd rather not say
He is a thorn in my side
He's handsome and sweet, so I'm afraid I'll fall for him.
In the name of God, I will heal her.
I tried calling you twice.
Abdul Qadir, who is sitting here, is better than Hassan, who is sitting behind Khalil.
Here's the translation: This game, each player chooses what they want
Jovi, this is
Happy mute fool
I wish you would heal

You are always welcome to visit our project again
We met with them
انزين اشقالوا الكم = How much did they charge you?
They said
I'll be coming over to your place later.
I miss you
I'll prepare the kitchen and clean it up.
Come on, come on, come on, let's go, we're coming, come on
Come on, come on, come on, let's go!
Listen up, listen up, hear what the people are saying, hear them out.
يا الله، ولا نسيتي أن احنا بني عقرب
Come on, come on, I'm coming without thanks Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
The bank said that there are no discrepancies in the project.
His phone is always busy.
Poor souls, waiting for hours
I'm worried about him and these brothers
I've been traveling for a month, and now it's been three months.
Allah reem, ya Allah, ma'assalamah
All the modifications are for our benefit.
The boy Naa
If you make the garden beautiful
At least he will go somewhere, at least two places, or even three.
They say that the garden is a breath of fresh air for the people living in this complex. This is the bank.
Two men are sitting and discussing what they need from their wives' opinions.
Get hyped up
I put the guy down, we met, he showed me his angel wings
A garden without

My dear, you know that I love football.
Our mom and brothers don't know you play soccer at school. If they knew, they'd kill you.
Self-awareness
She said to him
I say forget the topic is best for me
I won't show you mine.
I have you on my mind.
Things of this world are but play and pastime.
You have the right to bless us.
Uncle Shahin, we have a problem
Mashallah

Fear of the Dashdasha
I wanted to look for privacy and couldn't find it.
Origin and End
I'll tell you something
I have a wedding on Thursday.
This is from the Human Resources Department
Yes, may you live long.
Leave it on the side.
Here are some suggestions: --- **Original Text:** "عندها اشويه ملاحظات عالاقتراح" **Translation:** "Then, I'll share some suggestions:"
امرج طال عمرج May you live long, Amr
You got something after?
May you live long.
Take care of them and I'll try to meet them when I have time, God willing.
You've ruined the detergents I sent you
Be good.
I'm leaving now and I'll call you later.
Statistics
Who do you think you are?
We are bigger than that.
Two evils have been around for a long time
You know, ask me what sports you play at school
They have a table tennis.
They only killed Zain.
Appetizers coming up
You don't know who we are.
Our roots

Uncle, let's give her a hand.
Enough is enough.
You're a treasure trove of character later on.
Jealousy is what you said about not becoming an architect like me
I miss you

Where are you going among the scorpions?
Let me break my head.
No, no, Sultan, no.
The scorpion is present in the wood.
Your mom's talk is broken.
Brother's saliva, the hawk takes its chance

Come on, my grandfather, my grandfather
Where are you going?
No word
We're going to Zane Wynn.
We said to Jab nothing but a word
تكتبين بدلاً منها تربيع
Even if you're just browsing, you'll see we have nothing to hide.
I was mistaken.
You have two options.
To get to know that we are Democrats
You're putting too much pressure on me.
Oh, you who are nurtured, you who are raised
Let's go down now
Bring us a copy of the order.
Yalla dhalfi dhalfi
The biggest scorpion, oh Yabeh
The scorpion said to the stick, "I have a proposal for you."

Professor Amnira
I'll check it out later, it's a bit difficult.
What can I travel, Uncle Khaled?
I have special circumstances.
He insisted on it, the minister.
Difficult and wide
Think carefully, Amnira
Don't make a decision when you're thinking, neither yesterday nor tomorrow.
How are you doing? How's work?
Because I was quiet
I have a suggestion
One of them should travel with me.
We don't have girls who travel
Turki Anj Halakhrubba

How can I do it?

I mistook her for you.
Tomorrow is Thursday, God willing.
We're calling you to inform you that the lecture will start at 3 PM, according to the sheikh's time zone.
You're so funny!
Here's the translation: Soul of the season for your clothes
Here's the translation: Soul of the season, your clothes are amazing, oh darling
I'm dying from laughter
Brother, I beg you
I don't want to hear a single word.
Sure, here is the translation: Let's have tea, coffee, and cake.

I'm afraid it might be a rumor, Uncle Khaled.
Minister of State candidate to hold one of the ministries in the new cabinet formation
Her Highness deserves it
InshaAllah, it won't be a rumor
I'll see you tomorrow
We all cooperate to serve the nation
Through the contribution of each one of us in our respective positions, thank you.
I wish us all the best of luck.
Thank you for your efforts, Minister.
Thank you, the minister's effort is commendable.
Thank you
She will live long, she will remain, she will remain.
Hello
Any soap after what you instructed me.
This is the general manager of the women's national football team
How is your sister Fatima doing?
In the name of God, as God wills, God is the greatest
Captain Fatima led the adults' team
Captain Fatima is talented, my friends. Farewell, my son.
What position does Ashraik play in your team?
Head of War, that's it
China will travel
Captain Gena is far away in China
May God grant you success
Your sister is playing an important match.
This was studying education, but today I went and changed her papers
She studies architecture at the university.
No captain, because there's no difference between the Riyal and the Dirham.
He poured the coffee, but just poured.
Where are you going?
I want to look too
You are red, you are red.
Hey, hey, go say hi to your mom, tell her to kick us out
Come on, come on, not your dad, not your mom's dad.
By God, his condition
The jacket you have is colder.
They don't know what a year is like for you, and the first thing they hear is that you have a job.
How are you? How are the kids?
I missed her
Insha'Allah, this time you'll be with us in the series.
Of course and you will work as the heroine
Deep down, Ali, no one can play Nouf's role but her.
My love, in something called makeup, make her younger.
Maryam is 26, her mother is 27 episodes
Your parents will benefit from your hair.
He sits and gives us lectures that have neither a beginning nor an end.
I'm afraid we might have a bone stuck in our throat.
The most important thing I don't know is that the company that produced the series is your company, you and Hamed.
Insha'Allah, I'm not late, my brothers
And Kaho Rashid, what do you think?
The director is ready with the technicians, what's up?
Let's get started, everyone, but since we're short on time.
اللي بيحب يتكلم ليه يقول رايه يتفضل
What do you want to say, Jenk Hamad?
Honestly, I don't think there's a better show than this one.
Come you one day, she died the next day. This maid committed suicide.
The most memorable scene from "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"
The day of service commits suicide
Her spirit was attached to the bank, The bank cracked, cracked, cracked, cracked, And the blood trickled, trickled, trickled down her neck.
She found him and started screaming at her son, by God, it's an action.
He sits and shoots, and shoots, and shoots until he reaches their house yard.
Action Summit
The police are searching for him, he might be the mother.
Honestly, the series is extremely amazing
Just act out the series on the table, act it out
This is a rape of artistic conscience.
Violation of community values
A series based on bizarre events
Incredible
77 Cases of Murder
The old cries of this year
You're not known for what you want someone to find out.
Hey, hey, brother Hamid, let's be democrats.
We decide the subject by majority.
Dear brother Nasser, I will not hide behind the majority and democracy in the field of critical evaluation of any artistic work. There is no democracy and majority.
You got involved in your previous government job last year.
Goodbye
I tell you I heard the sound of the bell.
The day Wala Hindi emerged with a gun in his hand
What do you ask me, I say you are a mom's share, I told him what
The army opened
There's a ring in it, I think its value is around seventy-eight thousand.
I'm afraid the Indian will bring us that thing by mistake
No worries, no problem with the mistake
This is Samira
Hamad's wife, our responsible person at the company
This is the God who accepts a gift from her.
I love you
The ring is wide and luxurious
I've never dreamed of having a soul ring.
Allah bless you, my dear Hessa, my love
This is my dad's series. I call it the series of goodness.
Ali and Hamad are the most important employers, but since the most important employees are ours, they cannot present the series in their name, so they will present it in the name of others.
What's next besides this ring?
I'm just saying, what the Hajji says is between you and him.
اشدعوه مينونه انا بقول حق حد Who are you calling a liar? I'm telling the truth.
The madman's wife
The one they call the magician
Call him five percent
No, my dear, it's not sweet if they agree to four million for them.
My husband gets two hundred thousand riyals, sweet.
I say the university girl's role is to give Nada.
They really like to ride a bike together and enjoy the ride.
Our series that we are working on after is called "Rape of the Conscience"
I was told about a role in a series
I want to know one thing
Our Gulf series are always like this, I mean like I say, this year's trend is rape.
What should I do, my love?
You're my favorite after my beloved Dorge, 100% guaranteed
Zayn refrained from embarrassment
It's time now
My love has returned now, he's doing all these sweet things, leaving me and going away.
This is Omar, the manager's secretary.
May He conceal.
He's never asked for me at this time.
He said that this series they are making is weak and worthless.
It's not right that they lose money on it.
I'm fine, and then I mean to build
God cover my soul, I'm scared that Rashed, this idiot, said something bad about the series to them.
You don't have to be afraid, you
This issue is on hold
A generous human
Social Series
This is Tony's first appearance on TV in years.
May you live long.
The series that's airing now is called Rape and the Rose That Hasn't Been Plucked Yet
The budget they are asking for is way too large.
A larger budget is needed
Don't forget to thank God that the institution producing the work is a local institution.
May God protect you. I miss her so much.
May you live long and be content.
I read the artist's page
We hear these days about the start of filming the series "Rape of the Conscience."
He was allocated a huge budget.
It is said that the series is not up to the required standard.
The last one says that the series is about a school for teaching deviance.
There's a high chance they'll stop the filming
Hello to you

He's lying, the one who said all this.
If you are not ashamed, do as you please

It's reasonable that we have serious journalists again

I met Minister Sa'ah Al-Shu'la yesterday, you know how he is.
I tell you, our series is amazing, its events are strange
The fee for the first session and the one below it with people
Here you go, enjoy your meal
My dear Sabri, this is just the first episode.
People often see themselves in Gulf series
And then, my mother said, "I will sacrifice my children unless you have something."
My dear children of art, you have peculiar tastes. You create and spread abnormal conditions among society and people.
This might work in visual arts, but not at all in drama.
Oh, don't hit me on the head
Turkey's eagle is still on it
No more, Yaba. At least from now on, you won't be in control. Just watch the first five episodes.
The series is bad.
It is forbidden to leave our families in the throes of this misery.
Call your brother, he's not acting right.
No series is worse than this one and it's terrifying.
لا يا اخي سالم
I swear I was wrong.
And he entered every house

Please remind them.

Travel to Isfahan
The minister and his guests arrived
I did it to greet him
We're the ones who agreed to this world.
Invite those who like it, but Saadah Al-Wazir
Let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleague is the one who dropped the insult.
I only download messages that praise the series.
No one ever fails completely.
غدا سأنشر ما كتبته وسأنزل رسائل من عندي لأشكر المسلسل ومدحه وسأبدأ بإرسال القراءات.
Insha'Allah
Just a moment
for this year
We agree with him.
The longest-running series in the history of Gulf drama
All agree with the minister's efforts
I agree with the journalists when I walk with you
Headings Headings only
I wish for the re-raping of the conscience
Thank you to the Minister of Information for this series
I wish they would do it again.
I was the first one they contacted at the minister's office
The remaining amount of the payment is 10,000 MAD, which we have shown you.
What are they blaming me for, oh wizard?
They haven't had anything to drink yet.
We've entered our money now and we've won, and the win was great.
And then you see the series is a failure
المؤلف نفسه يقول: ندمان
I suggest to you now a second part of the series
There is a minister between you and me.
The old press that was trampled on and the fake success we created.
He told me that he was comfortable inside the series.
It's impossible they'll agree to a second part
If the minister himself requests a second part
I cannot
However, I would like to reiterate my thanks.
To all employees
In this series
Congratulations on your victory
You deserve it
The truth is that winning these awards at these prestigious festivals
It is the strongest evidence.
I think you're saying something
It's a piece of cake

We must ensure they comply before we sign a contract with them.

Our products are exported overseas, including all types of Roti, small and large bread, triangular bread, and shaped bread.
We are about to sign the contract with them.
Two million dollars
You sweetened it with the Australian baker
This is the inventor of the rotie
What does the product they make look like?
They told me to do the routine, but what's in the routine? How do I know?
May God give you bread to eat.
You guys call it a waste.
Take this bread instead of the routine you call a life
This is the inventor's idea to simplify it.

You eat the roti with the salsa.

Come here, Samir
Yeah, Uncle Nasser
Under your command
Long live our river, oh eternal one
What should I say, Samir?
Take your son Nasser to them yesterday to play some football with the guy he's working with.
I agree with him.
The team is doing this only for what they've given us, but from security and drivers.
We're lacking because we only have one guard. If something goes wrong, we're in trouble.
and the best thing is having a fanbase
You and the day you fired the employees based on your mother's word, may you live seven times.
I have something for you
The important people in the company
The ones who form the heart of the company
The baker took the dough from the hospital.
The child was therefore convinced.
He's got a flaw, he won't become a boy from a known family, he won't go out and let us watch him and laugh at the world on our behalf.
Take those who want to play in them, do what you want.
The important people who form the heart of the company.
I'm missing four players for my team's match.
I'm sorry, I can't help with that.
What's done is done now.
Hamdi didn't go to work today, sir.
I rode with him
Put it on.
And they brought me up and made me stand and said
The match seemed
I didn't feel anything.
They tell me that a ball is coming my way, but I don't remember.
Did you used to play as a goalkeeper?
For Nasser's sake
There is no power nor strength except with Allah
Hopefully, we'll go to the soccer game and to the amusement park.
From today, Nasser
There's no such thing as football
Your team is what you're doing as a mess.
All the bunnies returned to the bakeries.
You're crazy
The subject is omitted
I don't hear anything from you
طلبتك يا بو ناصر Your request, oh Abu Nasser
We never hear the boy say anything, just your request is enough.
For you only, ya Abu Ahmed
What do you have to say?
We have one more match left in the season we're playing.
Don't break the mood, Uncle Nasser. Your request is enough.
Hey there, guys
Congratulations, congratulations
Congratulations, congratulations, congratulations to the graduates.
Mr. Nasser, I need you.
May God bless you, my team was on time today.
Mr. Nasser Lazzam
You promised us you would throw us a party
Please let me know if you would like to book a hall at the hotel.
Leave me alone with the journalists and the newspapers there.
No, Rashid, we have it at home.
So that my dad can have the joy, the fun, and the victory, maybe the team can continue
O champion, O champion, O champion, O champion, O champion
God hears you well
Lala saw pictures with the players and had a press meeting with them.
Wako Gene Samy, the editor of the sports page, will conduct an interview with him.
What's the picture?
I won't go far from me
Hopefully, the picture will turn out nice.
I'm not being unfair.
Congratulations on your sons' victory, the bakers. I am very proud of the great achievement.
With the fighting spirit
effort
Loyalty to bakeries
We saw the bakery team throughout the tournament eating in a way of four four two.
Loyalty to the bakeries and the coach's plan
Thank you, Uncle Abu Nasser
May God keep you safe
Here's the translation: "Here's the goalkeeper"
Your league and cup winner will meet you in a match.
The tail is not the council's.
A messenger from them will contact you to arrange a meeting.
Come on, the cup! Come on, the cup! Come on, the cup! Come on, the cup!
Encourage young people
InshaAllah, I will witness that you will see it in the future.
Goodbye
Mashallah, your phone never stops, and your pictures in the newspapers are blessed. This is the football.
You know what he told me
Tamer, Abu Nasser, the ball is on sale for us at the machine's price
I've become famous now, and the newspapers don't print your pictures without writing under them "the first of the international bakeries."
I'm far from football.
This is nonsense.
I've been a fan since I was little in elementary school.
My little brother used to play football
Stay away from the ball
As long as the one I love plays soccer, I'm close to soccer.
I'm close to the field, I mean I'm a player.
We're not just international bakeries anymore, we're international stadiums now.
I heard yesterday that Uncle is going to establish a sports club.
Of course, today we meet at the Ibraeiry Riyadh at the International Bakeries, Um Bu Nasser
Developing football
Sure, here is the translation: Of course, before the match, we should know your expectations and before you reach the platform
The match is tough today
The team that controls the text line will be the high tower today.
Insha'Allah, we are currently in the process of contacting professional players' agents to develop the Al-Mokhaba Al-Duwalia team
His name is Saud. I heard he's coming back, God willing, God willing. He's coming back to his grandfather, God willing, God willing.
Listen to me, you idiot. The deal that went to the players, the shipment that's coming to us.
We didn't benefit from anything
I gave you the prices
Our prices are competitive globally.
It's like, the Gulf isn't like the world
Sure, here is the translation: Of course not
Finish your work
You just need to bring the Gulf buyer and give me the news.
Keep your fax open
Two defenders, one midfielder, and one forward
Look, my love, I'm telling you, the players at the end of the four.
Three of them are the head
Maitin al-F
Took them all, Jack. One dollar at a time.
I'll give you 550,000 dollars for 600,000 of them.
Cool, this one is for the singles. Here's one for the Brazilians.
This is the player of the season. This is going to take him to a million and two hundred thousand dollars.
Wait, you're saying the price is in AED? Send it to me via fax, I'll forward it to him. It's urgent, send it immediately. God willing, may Allah protect you from the Emirates Club.
You are the owner of the deception, and the deception is your deception.
Received
Mashallah, come on, come on, bring me a chicken, man
How are you?
The knee The knee
The kneecap, the entire kneecap
We don't cheat after being in a cruciform position or anything.
Hey Uncle Nasser
What is this smooth muscle?
I'm sorry, but I can't translate that text.
Congratulations to Al Ahly, meaning well done to the players, meaning the Brazilians and the free agents, with blessings, with blessings.
May God bless you
I say the warehouse, the warehouse, this keratin, come on, the warehouse
Mashallah, you have a second business
Players only
Empty carton
Where do these sprouts come from? Yes, these sprouts come from the jungles of Africa.
Why not?
Karem has one cartoon.
Those people are beautiful
I'm telling you, it's not what you've heard.
I'm telling you this for your own good
Sometimes, we
Why didn't you give us this demo with them?
If I may say, Abu Nasser, this is the time. If you take care of him and raise him well, it will benefit you.
The team will go to the stadium later.
How much How much How much How much
Fry it, fry it on it, fry it, fry it on it, look at it, it's tender, tender.
Put it in the annex, Airbone, goodbye
Anything you need, all the players are with me.
If the coach Malik understands this
We're two, zero we control the world.
This is a coach in Spain
I'm impressed.
The successful coach
The referee who controls the game during the match
The north for example, this line, its opposite is the Tropic of Capricorn
This is your coach, don't let him go as he is.
Coach, what's going on? It's been two months with the team.
I need to see a solution with it
If Jan understands football, the players won't sit for the entire match; he will attack from depth.
Any rule I stand by is based on the method of infiltration.
Oh my mother, and those who raised you, don't break my heart.
The joyful one withdraws the economic law of his parents
Waw iyakt Shynamwa Hababwa hitawalawtawa hawawaw ayklihi
No no no no no, there's nothing to play with.
Shululu Habobo Taba Lava Kala Ayoli
Any line
According to the plan
What a mess!
Something that must not necessarily be between the manager and the team coach
The star of today's match and the team's star scores a super hat-trick. May God be with you, Jaikolamanandu.
We just don't get football
Listen, O Sultan
I'm going home
Lala couldn't reach them easily, the bakeries. Let him take a taxi.
Get lost, you're bothering me.
C'mon, stay with me on the line
It means I like what my dad made
The coach made us sweat.
I will do it later
The team is destroyed
Say hello to our team
Yallah yallah
لا مب صاحي يعني قالج تعالي انتي طالق قولي الصج اصار بينكم Translation: He said, "Wake up, I divorce you," and now it's final between you two.
I didn't like Real Madrid from the very first day I saw them.
He felt like he was being relieved of responsibility.
خلنا من الحجي الزايد والكلام ف الماظي Let's leave Hajji Zaid and talk about the past
You should respect your father's spirit and know his past. Why did his daughter get divorced?
I swear, I admire you, brother Rashid
He remarried because of that.
It's not right, Uncle Abdullah. We have the right to know why she got divorced.
You have no business interfering in this matter.
How come you're not interfering, the prince is sitting in the parliament, oh he wants to know why his daughter got divorced
A woman who is not known to be respectful cannot be a good wife nor respect his feelings.
Who is Dhi Barcellona?
I don't know what they call it in Spanish.
Barcelona is not just one thing
This is the Quadriola team
I'm going to go for the Real that's sitting in the MLS waiting for me
If I leave, you leave. That's it, just stay at home. You don't know how to raise girls.
Knock on the door so I don't bump my head.
It's enough that she left Barcelona's team.
Messi, the football magician who hasn't played a match without scoring a hat-trick
Maradona, the one and only Maradona, said that Messi will be better than me.
واتقوم بنتك اللي ما تستحي على ويها اتغلط عليه شوف عاد Translation: Your daughter, who isn't shy about it, made a mistake on it, check again
Your daughter is neither from Barcelona nor from our tribe.
What do you mean by that?
اسمعيني الله ايهداج Let God guide me
To be your intention, my old one
I'll go apologize to her and make her happy.
I'm missing in action
After that, thank God, we have a lot of good things.
Our home is our paradise, if we are happy with what we have in it.
Why did you come back?
I'll marry you only if you become a Barcelonian.
I'm not joking.
What do you understand, Yama? Forget it, she's gone for sixty days.
Hack guy hack ya yama
لا، لا أعرف.
You are the only one I wish for.
That's cool, bro
You broke my heart, damn it.
Poor thing, she's been missing for two days
After a marriage that lasted only one month, damn it.
You guys are making me get involved with him.
I can't do that, bro.
You're the one who said to bring those idiots who have no brains.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
What do you know, this one will have a son
Check it out
Provide for her.
You told me about the building I was thinking of buying and turning into a furnished apartment hotel.
What's in Mansoura?
The father's right is to ask for compensation when his son takes our daughter and asks for her hand in marriage.
If I could
My words are better than hers
Listen to me, be just
A guy whose father is a millionaire
هل تعرفين ما يعني مليونير؟
The opportunity doesn't come twice.
You know they've got a palace in Spain, but they only go there every summer.
هنا انزين وسالفه برشلونه هذي اشلون يعني Here's the engine and gearbox from Barcelona, what does that mean?
People of the building went out to this broadcast to prove that their daughter is innocent
If we assume that the past is gone and Real Madrid loves Barcelona and has loyalty to Catalonia
It's great that his wife respects that.
I made a mistake with the team
This is if we assume that the past is valid
God rest his soul, they called him Abu Burjayn because he had two towers on his balcony
I'll make them like strange penguins, tangled up like a rope on a camel.
People think they know me from afar, they consider me a single tower.
My dear, may you bring goodness, may you bring it
The Mercy of Allah is upon you, O Yana
May God bless you with good health and long life.
Thank you, darling
Please, Bashirini, send me Abdullah's eye opinion. My son is waiting for your response.
No, Umm Abdullah, I won't let you down, my gaze.
If I were to look for a better council than the Gulf Cooperation Council, I wouldn't find one like you.
They're saying they'll provide us with their estimates for building the structure again.
I've had enough of your nonsense, Tamer. It's been going on for too long.
Anyone who calls you family
Check out their wedding requests, prepare the jook, and I'll sign it.
In the name of God, as God wills, in the name of God, as God wills After your permission, my lord, after your permission
After Abdullah's divorce response
The children are well, thank God, and so is the money, thank God
May God bless you, my aunt
Put a coat on him to keep him warm.
I don't know where my mom booked us.
Where did you book us?
My mother says she has booked us a slot for Malaysia.
ما شاء الله في ماليزيا
Goodbye
Honeymoon is over
What's up, mom? Tell me.
قولي لي اشصاير يا يمه Tell me what to do, oh my love
Wide open spaces
Why do you see yourself like this?
Leave the arrogant one to me.
You're so sweet to have taken her back to her family's home.
I broke my thoughts.
Hey there
Fix it and make it better
A barrier within it
May God bless you, don't forget to send us some olive oil from Spain.
Where in Spain should we go?
Engine
My mother says she has booked us a trip to the Maldives.
What's up with you, mom? After the Maldives, it's beautiful.
I'll go to your place tomorrow, hopefully with your permission.
I said you're coming back relaxed from the trip
My heart is broken, mom, why does he take it away?
Come here, Shili the monkey
They are the same among themselves
May you be healed from your ailments, O light of my eyes.
Shut up, you and whoever taught you to talk to me like that, you little brat.
May you heal, oh my mother, take away my worries
I haven't seen the peels in a while.
Long live those who make you happy, oh mother.
Leave her, just divorce her, divorce her, you don't need her, not a single penny, your dad is gone and the girls are gone.
Shut up, you and whoever raised you, my son. I know him well. He's a troublemaker and a nuisance.
Soul, oh mother, call her and divorce her
May God grant her success
Wah wah say it three times
You are divorced moment by moment, don't call again twice.
Divorce, divorce
I'm annoyed, I swear
Go, my dear, go and rest, take the worries off your mind. The girls are on Ava, who can lift like they say, go, my dear.
There's a problem
He just saw her dancing
Hit it, hit it, let me need it
I'm done with you, just divorce me. He said, "You are divorced, divorced."
Break his neck, he's shameless, a bit of decency, please.
The time alone doesn't make dancing comfortable, it means it's awkward.
When necessary, I'll shake it, there's nothing in it.
Everything in it is something, what does it mean the world has turned upside down
I was at his house earlier, I cleaned his windows, and then I don't know if you're a girl.
I, I, oh Abu Abdullah, my daughter is getting a divorce.
My daughter is getting a divorce.
A feather grows on her head.
We buy and sell them from Toys "R" Us stores
Like what burned Yufj now on Bentj and my patience
The most important thing they did was help the poor.
Throw away the peeled apple.
Normal, I'll shoot them on sight.
He is in debt for one riyal.
This is a normal 60-day trial, let it be monthly.
Drink from the cup I drank, what God has created
The things your soul does not tolerate
Do not make it public.
I got to know the committee, this was from him
In a strategic location
Leave it to God.
Don't be a cheapskate.
I am currently standing
You need to get approval from Bu Saqr
I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
I went to him the week before, they told me to travel yesterday.
I'm currently standing. The problem requires approval from Bu Saqr.
He has a slight limp.
No no no no this is official business
May God be in your place, peace be upon you. The office is at home.
After eating
He returned with a new shirt on.
Listen to everyone who has a key.
يا بو فهد
I don't know you
I only know him from TV, and you told me you knew him in real life.
We're not at the level of knowledge yet
May He cut off your speech
May God guide you and you were right, you knocked on the door first. At least ask about the purpose of this determination.
ما شاء الله ايهداك
The month has thirty days and it's fifty times that I make dinner
I suggested, as long as you live, they should put you in the Guinness Book of World Records.
More than one person in the world is having dinner.
I say to him, this is the halachah that you have with you
Hello, how are you? By God, it's been a long time.
It is our honor, long live you
Uncle, oh farmer
I say that Abu Saqr cooks dinner every day.
I'm craving this.
Sure, here is the translation: "Come on, Uncle Flah, tonight is a special occasion."
May God keep your son safe, Hawk
Mashallah, you deserve it. May your life be blessed.
ابشر ولد الحلال على طاريه حياك يا يبه Abshar, the righteous son, on the tray, I greet you, my dear
Hello
Returned Sheneh
Congratulations on the occasion of your son Saqr's agency fee and choosing the car he wants.
I've been waiting for approval for a year and a half.
Current status
I reached him one day
and his happiness
May God guide you, Uncle Saad
Things will get better.
He's gone for good.
Emer selects the car he likes.
We buy him three
I invite him
I will dedicate my soul to him
You're not telling me you're the same age as him, are you?
Today, little Shahin's son
He played the violin.
This is your chance
May He visit and bless him.
You deserve safety, long-lived one
My Shahin, hey Abu Saqr
May Allah grant you peace. Peace be upon you all.
Praise be to God for the safety of our son Shahin, long may he live
May God protect you and
Only the expert
May you live long.
I didn't recognize you
May God bless you with attraction.
I have been with you for a long time, a long life, a long year
I even bought a red swimsuit
I am Allah, I surrender to you.
I was at the hospital
One of our children
It's a pleasure to see you.
He is now hesitant, whether to enter the field of trade or not.
Sure, here is the translation: Do you want to come with him, brother?
Why do you think, my dear Saqr, that trade is beautiful?
You started by placing a desk and a sofa
Bu Saqr
Long life does not bore me and saying "done"
Returned Sheneh
I have a gift for you, Saqr.
Full cycle
If business loves you and brings you something, she'll tell you "Don't be like that."
Today, someone like you has everything at their disposal. You've taken the license, praise be to God, and the world has opened up to you—a car, an apartment, and the best office on the corniche.
Yesterday, Abu Abdulaziz said to my father, "If you want to expand the business, you can join me as a partner with a 50% share."
How are you balancing between work and university?
I don't force myself on anything, I just don't like it.
And thank God for you, may the agencies, offices, and cars disappear for you.
Opportunity, my child, these days you can start your business without capital.
You are the head of a people-loving family, not just your father.
Be smart and invest in yourself
Believe me, my child, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
God willing, prepare me for tomorrow quickly.
Insha'Allah, he'll be fine.
ما خله شي ما خله شي باجر بعد اخاف ياخذ وكاله السمبوسه No problem, no problem, I'll do it after I'm done being scared to take the samosa agency.
A hollow man opened himself up for business
This is what you've been longing for. Do you know what I'm going to say today?
Say, Dad, I want to expand more after the investment.
He wants to visit the Caribbean Sea and invest in the islands. Is there?
Far from the envious eyes.
My friend said yesterday that his son was born.
He has twenty agencies, six restaurants, and he also owns a bank.
I gave him the elbow, the one he didn't want a certificate or a name for.
It appears, and God knows best, that there is something they have opened up for now.
Here's what's in the northern area of our office: nothing
I can't stop thinking about it.
May God accept it, bless you, congratulations Abbas
In the name of God
May God bless you
الندم لا يفيد
Listen dad, listen, a whole year of misery and hard work, prepare the supermarket.
Every day, the past comes knocking at the door.
This secretary named Samir is very sour.
Just say this is my brother's son who wants to join you as a partner instead of taking the shop from you.
I have a business partner with you
No power nor strength except with Allah
I'll see you at the top, inshallah.
Who are you asking about?
He was killed by a drone strike.
Why did you tell me you're an Iranian baker?
What was the name written on the small sign?
Al Farij Bakery
I want a different name
And peace be upon you
How's work going with you?
I hope you have a long life, inshallah. Tomorrow or the day after, we will complete the workers' housing plan for Al-Mustaqbal Company.
Lala Monsieur is now Madame Elisa, you know Monsieur is the company owner
Hello, how are you?
Leave it to take one of the company cars.
Thank you very much for everything.
Cooking is also a science and a study.
Today, a guy comes up to you and says he's been working in the business field for about a while and wants to invest them.
But this thing between us has neither expertise nor knowledge nor study in economics nor even in trade.
One like this
You think you're doing great, but you're wasting your time and you'll end up losing.
سمعت يا بو ناصر
I heard those two chatterboxes, what are they saying
Loquaciousness
We have a falcon here, mashallah.
Mashallah, may Allah protect him
Today in Jūfūh
We're talking about longevity, not your son's hawk.
We're talking about the base
Your son is a hawk, mashallah. May my eyes always see him as an exception.
He says you're talking about al-Qaeda
We raised a falcon, my son built himself by himself
He gave him a car as a gift once.
Sell it and invest the money, and take advice from him himself.
Mashallah, they really got him.
We've been talking about regular people.
One of them, a man named Abu Nasser, took him and placed his hand on the chest.
Insha'Allah, he is a falcon with commercial talents.
Powerful economic tendencies
We need to ask who his father is.
It's unbelievable, I swear to God.
Mashallah

Please be seated.
Walaikum assalam, hola hola, Salem
May it be good
I swear, I don't know what to tell you, Salem.
Sure, here is the translation: "Oh yes, tell me."
I have been informed previously.
The company sent a fax to your father.
They said to him, "It's over."
Our home cannot bear it.
As you see
He told me as soon as he heard the news
The printer and fax in the office are broken.
He remained upon him
Alas, he said, the one who taught him archery. When he grew strong, he shot me.
Dr. Weshkal now
Call him, Salem.
I'm shocked.
A responsible person in this world
A man gives to the poor with his right hand without his left hand knowing.
This is the organization that, of course, delivers its donations to all Muslims in all parts of Asia and Africa.
However, I would also like you, oh immortal one, to explain to us, if God wills, about your future goals and steps.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Our goal at the Saqr Charitable Society is to achieve solidarity in this community.
In addition to sixty burnouses for our afflicted brothers in the earthquakes of Pakistan
This also, finally and not lastly, means that we are now appointing seven poor families.
A monthly salary of only 50,000 and 31 riyals.
We apologize for the delay
After it, along your bungee cord
My life
This is Khaled and his wife, Azmina, planning to stay at the hotel tonight.
Anywhere, I swear, anywhere. Anywhere we are, I'll be happy there.
My life, may God grant you to me, O Lord

I want to practice.
Enough, you long-lived one
He came back.
I need you to repeat the word you said so I can hear it again.
Hello Nora
The text "العنود زعلانه عليك" translated into English is: "Al-Anoud is upset with you"
Why are you being so mean to me?
Insya Allah
Why is he angry?
Nora Amnaih: Two Simple and Easy Dresses
I won't say anything, Judi. Anoud will get upset.
Wa hayy al-Lubnaniyn al-sunna halaw
You're not smoking it, taking it, and giving it to others, okay?
I miss her too.
If the most beautiful dress, then the most beautiful necklace
I'll tell her after I say her name.
There's still a lot left to do
My share is twenty thousand and my brother's share is twenty thousand dirhams.
Congratulations, you're both hired Insha'Allah
God be with you
Welcome, may your life be long and virtuous.
Hi Fadi, you look busy. I don't want to keep you.
I am present, sir.
Welcome, welcome
You received a message yesterday
Arrived at the bakery
What a funny joke!
Got it, I've brought the design with me.
I don't have time to do them all, show me yours and I'll choose from them.
Honestly, you have the best taste.
He made us work with envy
My day went well, my project went perfectly, and he entered with good intentions.
He says he has a project like mine
Design and Tailoring House
Women's clothing
This is Nasser who earns his living through trade.
Your children are present.
His uncle's son disgusts him.
من هذه القبيل هذه الأيام
My cousin's son is a good boy.
I swear, I was sleeping. They woke me up and said, "Your uncle's son wants you."
Better, God willing, is a matter of indulgence.
Good, God willing, good
Oh, would that
Owner wants to create any project for example for example
I'll be whatever you want, a partner or anything else
They say you meant to say something that was imposed on you.
Hello there, welcome
What do you want to increase your presence?
The job is excellent, thank God
ما تريد أن تفعل يا بو صالح
We were just late paying last week's rent.
By Allah
May God be with you, I hope so, goodbye
He remains.
Are you sure?
With it comes detail, and you don't know the big ball.
I'm feeling hungry after
He opened a store right next to yours
O envious one, O malevolent one
Before I knew the market was open to everyone
I need to know
Your heart must be open to your cousin's son.
What do you want me to do?
Disguise, attract, and laugh at me Woo and what do you do to me?
I want to do my work remotely.
You're taking the place of glue in my ruined spot.
By God, yes, but they said come, I'll sit and pull your wisdom tooth.
This is envy, this is hatred. By God, by God, I will make you pay for this hatred that you have instilled in me.
Are you guys locals or what?
Woe unto you, oh Abu Saleh
يا بو زنطه انت، هادني عليه والله بييك بكس ترا
I reached out my hand just as you did yours, and what remained was just a morsel for me.
Hey there, everyone
O congregation, send prayers upon the Prophet
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
Eiib, a designer from the Philippines, advised me
There is no limit to you
Why do you say why do you say Lebanese?
Take it easy with your questions, your jokes, and your laughter, and they'll let you relax at the end.
I'll see you later, you Lebanese guy
He kept talking and convincing me.
You enchanted me with your words.
I was convinced and made to pay 12,000 riyals.
After two days, God's emissary went to the auction market and found the captive there, smiling at him with two irals.
It's not clear what "افلوس" means. Could you please provide more context or clarify the term?
Lebanese designer
It was hard to meet the lawyer yesterday, you told me it was also hard to reach him.
I swear today is also very difficult
I feel like Abu Saleh has been acting strange these past two days.
What?
I don't know what's going on with it.
Abu Saleh is very psychologically exhausted after his cousin opened a store and brought a Lebanese designer like him.
The store's sales have been increasing for two consecutive weeks.
What's the problem here? Why isn't my awning opening? If it can't be fixed, I need a new one. The same project, the same store, next to it. Can I get in for that?
La la la with the designer Fady Halo and Uncle they are thinking of a solution
How are you doing today?
Sitting in paradise, eating and drinking
If we finish the work, I think we won't enter the shop's rent.
A place far from them means
Enchant them with your charm.
Welcome, how much is the discount?
I hope you don't give a party dress with every wedding dress.
Call them nationalists.
Show what happened at the spirit of the place you're visiting today, announcing with every wedding dress, two evening dresses, no more, after a 25% discount.
Let's go, let's go
Welcome! Wait for them for two weeks, they'll come down with the same dress. Make one wedding dress and get two dresses for free with a 25% discount.
We will fight them.
I'm thinking the same way because if we leave them alone tomorrow, they'll wreck our house.
It doesn't matter to you.
Glowing afterwards
This is a challenge and I appreciate it.
A family challenge
You deserve it, Zain. You've worked hard for it. No one else deserves it. May you prosper.
Don't worry, I'll check the news in two or three days if I don't find it in one go.
May you be content with what you have.

Best of the best
He says the place is unbearable, there's a foul smell. He says he doesn't know where it's coming from.
The smell has nothing to do with the air conditioner.
Its smell didn't spread from the place for at least six days.

The electricity wires to the store have been cut.
This is justice
They are now betting on a commitment, otherwise we leave the issue and open a file
It's worth a try.

Uncle Bonasser, something strange is happening. No one is entering the solution world.
Uncle Abu Nasser is sweetening his customer, he's coming to me, I'll tell you something strange
He is lying in his bed, sick.
I'm in a psychological state right now, brother, I was afraid to say the bank is calling and demanding the installments.
Tlemcen is indebted to him, the son of his uncle, this miser.
Zein Shally became this time
And so if they flooded the place with mistakes and dried out the designer Saad, they screamed in Wyeh and strayed from him
No eyes, no ears, no mouth, and it reads the ceiling.
What should I do, Mom?
Saad F. Al-Mahal
I'll enchant my mother to death for him
من اتخوفها الحريم تخترع اتخاف
I wish my mother would fix it
Lost me, lost me
Addini waid ya khok
I'm afraid they will imprison me.
I have nothing to hold onto to go complain about him.
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do
He deserves it
The one who made you submit, tell him about the magic I did to him. I made the designer turn into a monster, and women, if they see him, they will be afraid.
A rumor surfaced about him.
Hey guys, tell him the photography team needs you.
Hey guys, and whoever is listening, may God bless you, tell him I need him, I really need him.
By God, they raise my blood pressure, they slaughter me, they grill me, I won't come again, oh teacher Abdullah.
You're being unreasonable, Ali Ahmed Habibi. Don't be so biased. You're the shepherd of the heart, it's not good for you to be like this, my dear.
I swear I called him more than once, my sister, but it didn't help. This habit of his is driving me crazy.
You're not doing anything, all the things are in my head.
The void returned to you with the free wind in you
حلوا خمسه وعشرين مشهد ستاشر يالله يا أحمد عايزين نخلص
After that, I mean, I stopped the filming because the actors didn't show up
Decreased production
I don't have anything, Mr. Abdullah. Why is he bothering me like this?
My love, do you want me to bring you something?
Abdullah Alashray
Late bloomer and a scatterbrain
I don't have a boyfriend, Ahmed.
Not everyone can convince people that they can actually be a millionaire, a billionaire, just anyone.
Please have the honorable's power of attorney photos ready. The request will be detained for a period of one hour.
Not just anyone, Ala. Not just anyone. I'm still explaining to him his mother.
I'm done with myself, I can't even act in one scene, let alone two.
You bear the responsibility, and as a production manager, you bear the responsibility.
When they are drunk
They're all nervous in the exit, the situation is up to God but they're behaving.
I need someone with specific qualifications, a safe Qabah.
You are from your own kind.
I heard the director say
I have someone who needs your help, God willing, may it be beneficial.
SS Saud Aknar
I'm the one who told Saud Qawati, Saud Aknar.
This was a day when he was small, they used to call him Asaad Aknar, and when he grew up, they called him Quwati.
Why are you cats?
I'm telling you why this poor guy is wandering the streets, catching stray cats, and selling them by the kilo.
My brother, sing and be fearless, don't disappoint.
His shape must match his inside, which Amdouh Jdih informed him of, and Amrbarb has no length or width.
It definitely works
InshaAllah, I'll just tell you, you nailed the makeup 100%. It really suits you, lightens your face.
I'm waiting, what's up? You haven't spoken.
I have the number
I'll take Amir and go to him.
House of Saud Qahtani
He said that
Shut up, shut up, you
Saoud Qaouati
We have someone in our neighborhood named Saud Qawati.
I'm sure he's in Al-Fureij, but which house?
This is a house where a man named Saud lives with his father and mother.
Iowa City
This is not my strong suit.
This is Saud's laptop
Sure, here is the translation: Of course, it's just evolving over time. It's not like the laptop is like a cat.
He is tall, strong, and has a wheatish complexion.
I'm tired of this nonsense, and I'm about to start smashing eternal laptops. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, uncle.
Going to Souq Waqif to buy it for me and the second one
I swear, I have no idea
This is what you're all wearing
I only have a second, where is the second veil, mom?
Right to return
This is what I assigned to him and he completed it.

Put it in the oven to bake before it goes bad.
Sure, here is the translation: "Today I gained 2 pounds."
يا الله، أيهداج من البارحة أحن عليج أوديج الطوارئ أوديج الطوارئ اتقولين لي لاء Oh my God, I've been so worried since yesterday I miss you Emergency line Emergency line Why won't you answer me?
They told me to give it to you.
Alhamdulillah, this is it, my boy, ya ak. The job instead of your idle sitting.
Goodbye, come back safely.
You're about to get all worked up and act foolishly, storming out.
Sit down, relax, move around, and the camera moves with you.
Yeah Jafar, yeah
Whose laptop is this?
Abdullah Al-Luma'a is a great actor.
I have a son named Fat Aboud Shakhbarek
How are you, my friend?
Stop acting like a fool, respect yourself and others.
Every boy from our village
Hop hop hop hop hey hey
I love acting, hopefully they'll give me a role in your movie.
I swear, my brother, I haven't heard from you.

You're so annoying, listen to me for once. I swear you don't have any manners.
I miss my mom
Get lost, you idiot.
I heard you talking about me
I'll tell you something, make it heavier, make it even heavier.
Give me a gift, a gift, a gift, a gift of half a million to fix my broken car.
Give me dinner and I'll give you three million.
Tony, why are you being so stubborn?
Because I'm heavy according to the requests of some people
جوف يا أستاذ غافل إنتاج فريجنا ممثلين على مستوى عالمي
Currently, Mamta means she is suitable for the role.
Cool, I'm just watching, I don't have anything, right?
Hi, this is your home Sharine.
By God, he's flying in spring.
The professor entered the makeup room and did his makeup. Salman, hopefully, will make him look good and suit him.
Walk, walk, walk, very nice
I love you
Listen bro, we've finished filming with the car, it's at our place. Come and pick it up.
Nobody matters to me, I just need someone to reach me

Hey guys, call Saud for a laptop in the makeup room
Hey, you're the cleanest guy around.
It is written in the old script.
I swear I'll tell
I'm done, I mean.
What do you owe me?
What are we waiting for?
We have been silent about our rights for too long.
Who is more patient
And know that whoever disputes with Abu Abdulaziz
Why do you think he divorced her? Why?
Just divorce her and that's it.
We don't take a thief's daughter.
I don't need your opinion
When you add it later, the important thing is that you prepare yourself because you will change your clothes and we are ready for the photo shoot.
Take care of your teeth, they're expensive.
The scene here has been underrepresented.
Why?
What prophet is coming, bro? I'm bored, my stomach's bloated. I'm the one coming, what's going on? It's been an hour, when are we waiting until, huh?
You're overthinking it, this is normal.
May God grant you well-being
Mashallah, how fast!
May God keep you safe and prolong your life under God's protection
Hey everyone
قولهم بوعبدالعزيز ايسلم عليكم = May the peace of God be upon you, O family of Abdulaziz
Insha'Allah, long live you, Insha'Allah
You guys are beautiful
May Allah bless you. Do you think they will like your mustache after?
First time someone loved me for who I am.
How do they love them for their noses?
Issues
His nose, like an ice cream cone, cracked with your sweet, sweet lips.
By God, you haven't laughed since.
May God have mercy on you.
The best actor
May what is evil cure your voice.
Hey, hey, you're tired, let me help you.
Come quickly
Welcome, Sheikh, welcome
You're either here or there, may your soul rest in peace.
Listen to me,
Yes, please God
Hollow of respect, Zaydah
Oh, you fool!

Go go go go
Don't worry, hopefully it will be there, Dr. Hassan, come on, come on.
What's up, Dr. Hani? What's going on?
May your life be long and peaceful in this office.
What are your requirements?
Everyone, God willing, will be fine.
Welcome, welcome, long life, welcome
Shut up or I'll slap you on your face
My name is Bouabdellaziz

Listen to me, ya
Possible friend
Hey, hurry up and get tired.
You've been going to the hospital so much, you haven't even seen one of them smile, let alone do anything nice.
Girls like you
Leave the local girls alone.
Get lost, I'll go to the hospital alone.

What do you want from me, brother?
Sure, here is the translation: "Enough, man, go near her, make her laugh, flirt with her, give her your number, and you're serious about her."
There's nothing, nothing at all
Respect yourself
I'm not going, I'm not going, I'm not going to go. I'm speaking to security so I can talk to Mak.
Lala maby maby she
It's not a must to leak a biography
I remember you
Lala, thank you.
Sure, here is the translation: Can you take it and go?
The one who speaks to Al-Hajj Al-Marzouq
I'll marry him, I mean, I'll marry him.
I want the coat, I want the clothes, and I want the car after I rent it from you.
To give you your reward
Wait a moment
Oh God
This is the voice of Al-Marzouq Stadium
Hello, hello, welcome, welcome Who is it? Hello
No such thing as yesterday's eye view.
Oh, I wish I knew
I tell you, they were amazed by what we did for them. It was a huge, wonderful, and distinctive party.
One regular and one diet
I'm sorry now
What's up?
I have an appointment with the boss at work in the afternoon.
InshaAllah, I'll take them this.
No cure
Noura Alali
ما هذا
Something like that is a quarter of it, a fraction of the atrocities
It made everyone talk about us
Give me some money and I'll go buy you something nice.
I just have to meet them now.
You must pay him a wage.
I'm done now, so come on, let's go so I can bring us something to eat. There are a lot of people here.
May Allah heal you
Affordable price and excellent quality
Above average doesn't mean better quality
I'm sorry, but I can't help with that.
After that, I'll go crazy, my dear, after you left us for the most precious.
It's impossible to describe that artistic touch.
Heidi's Royal Chocolate
The same chocolate that the Spanish Royal Palace always orders
Give me this.
Congratulations! And with that, a warranty certificate as well.
Stay, stay, rejoice
Come on, bro, give us some of this chocolate, bro
I say it's appropriate to melt
Abdul Qadir Al-Salih, who is in charge of the accounts
By your kindness, you deserve it. Come after I give you a moment. Come.
We'll get you coffee as quickly as possible
My aunt Raha is attending their wedding.
My dear, did you go to their wedding? Did it fail? Did the liver get upset? Did you believe my sister?
I heard what your aunt said.
I wanted to throw you a wedding, but it didn't work out.
There's nothing left but a month and a half.
I'm organizing everything
Let Him make me again
You're not living in society if you don't get scared of people who put their problems and solutions on display.
You raised your eyebrows
When I bought you something nice, I saw how they praised you and complimented your taste.
They said you're awesome and sweet.
Sure, but how many times have we paid?
The money we paid for the coffee is enough for four sheep for the wedding
You, who made her convert, you don't interfere. She knows how to do everything. All you have to do is give her the money, that's it.
They mean they agree with whatever we choose.
What do you have to offer?
ما رأيك بالهلوسة
The discrimination costs more money.
Why did you do what you did?
ما رأيك بهذا؟
The first time in Qatar history, someone thought of making a cake in the shape of a computer.
Listen up
Look, you're arguing about everything except the kitchen and the furniture in this place where the women sit who have nothing but the pilgrimage. Just be quiet.
The riyal surpassed us
We want this dish, the chicken.
A strange thing
I suspect model number 110001.
We're done, we've got the rabbit.
Take care of yourself, all of this is for your own good.
The important thing is to choose whether the ship of Noah will increase to twenty thousand or if the bat is one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
We are ready, proceed.
You're not the first one to get married.
Do you see yourself getting married in the Comoros? Look how beautiful the country is.
We were just starting out back then
Where does the bride sit at night?
Iron, dye, and wood stain
People are annoyed
We're being exploited and cheated by these two swindlers.
What's up with you, then?
The hawk and the angry one
What do you want to get married already?
I'll talk to the bride's mother and tell her that he's in a difficult situation.
He who wants to get married should be able to afford the wedding expenses. I want to talk to her. Go ahead, talk to her.
We received a flower arrangement from the Netherlands today.
I think they should be placed on the tables at the wedding.
Sure, here is the translation: It's definitely my first time in Doha.
the Middle East after
Put it on the bill
It means Jim is increasing
Two and seventy, that's it.
I wish I could see that formation at the wedding of all weddings.
I got to know people after the Hajj.
Consider it done, I've booked them.
Are you earning more than me?
A door opens for you that you never knew existed.
May God help you, Saleh
But you're back, may God guide you. I tried to sort things out.
But I, thank God, am determined to go on a pilgrimage to any Arab country.
I'm telling you, there's a wedding party that didn't cost them all fifty thousand dollars.
May God bless you, my dear.
Insha'Allah, next month is a wedding.
You just pick a card and tell me.
The important thing is that people know they are oppressed everywhere and it's 5 o'clock now.
What matters is what you think, not what others say.
People know the level of the wedding from the cards
I wonder what people say about me because of these cards.
They must have received wedding cards. These are their cards. They haven't seen cards like these before.
We didn't say we're requesting it from the internet.
Cover made of panda bear fabric with Jif Fuzzy sequins
I just don't expect anything from you.
I'm not a womanizer, but I do ask women for their cards, meaning I do ask for them.
By God, you're breaking my heart, brother.
Poor thing, he's definitely going to be bullied.
Hey Real, did someone borrow something from you?
You're saying he even sold his car.
A young man, over twenty years old, woke up in the morning, walked, and greeted himself.
I don't blame you, my poor brother. I swear, I don't know when we will ever improve.
Sugar on top and no worries.
Forgive me, brother
You mean you didn't even try to convince them to let you have a wedding your way?
What do you mean by that?
Why am I living in despair?
The problem is that our noble assembly is preoccupied with appearances, boasting, and arrogance.
You're being ridiculous, you're acting like a spoiled brat.
You wanna live there
I once saw the bride's right.
I only want my clothes.
Leave it to God
Say not
How did you get married?
I don't want to marry anyone.
And then, brother, even if I decide to get married
I'm thinking of taking a foreign language, maybe even Arabic.
By Allah, you're talking nonsense.
We had actually decided to bring a DJ for the songs.
Mrs. Nasser is always complaining about her son's wedding and that singer.
This singer is famous but I forgot his name.
Shocking material
Heaven doesn't appeal to someone who's been sitting comfortably.
He sold his car and with that money, he can get by for a quarter of a year.
He found him talking to himself in the room after he had taken a shower.
I see apps that change the time
My brother Saleh is exhausted, he's back.
I don't have anything on me, nor do I have any with me.
I'm not less than others.
Don't leave me alone in the park.
The one who is struggling, oh mom, but my brother spent all he had and no one lent him.
You're the only one who makes me shut up.
My mom has new demands for the wedding and my brother told her to cancel it, I don't want to get married anymore.
Where is it now?
Inside ISOON has first aid
He says now he will grill, but they are preparing a room for her at the hospital.
The Disgraceful Jafta
You're the spirit of my soul, my sister.
Dr. Khalaj said, "Don't talk and don't eat anything so you can fall asleep."
He relaxes and makes us a park for those who do and those who don't.
عيل يقول: "يبنا عبدالله، ارويشد!" ايقول ما عندي افلوس.
You should obey your mother.
I was afraid for her.
A soul for her, a soul for her, and a kiss on her head.
Just tell her to do what she wants.
Pepi for Abdullah Arwished
Yusuf thought he would never run out of time.
It is forbidden for you to find anyone but Yusuf.
Heal her, please.
Hey, you Saleh
But the minister left him because Real Sheba and everything above is organized and safe.
What do you think, my dear, if I went and told him what you told me, there's a bigger chance he'll stop.
Did you understand?
You want to ask Abu Yusuf for money, of course from the ministry's money.
I swear, when are you going to give them back to the world?
Hey, if a group of auditors come to him and ask him about the money
Of course, I can go there.
He'll know how to act later.
Wallah how are you, Real, in your office and you're taking responsibility if something happens?
I've been stealing my whole life.
Stealing
First floor
A white cat with a blue ribbon around its neck and in its circle, as I say, like the picture of the pigeon, yiibeh yiibeh.
InshaAllah, Uncle, Uncle, Yusuf. If they don't show me any difficulty.
Back to square one
Call me Yusuf
I will see you at the end of my life
I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
Saleh Saleh
Listen to what I'm saying, I swear, if someone else had done this, you would have written about it, or something would have happened, oh oh oh Khalid.
Saleh Saleh
Uncle Yusuf, all the ways I've tried haven't helped. I'm drowning now.
I can't go back to the wedding now.
I know them all by heart
Heal you, heal you
Lala Malt Al-Ru' Al-Ru' Al-Thaniya

Uncle Yusuf is the most beloved of them all.

There is no god but God
Sure, here is the translation: "Don't forget to read the Mu'awwidhatayn when you enter the room, okay?"
Women are the apple of their father's eye.
I'm telling you it's awesome
Most beautiful wedding, Mashallah on you my eye on you, stay cool
The police are knocking on the door
I am guilty for having obeyed you, oh God
It is forbidden for me to marry today.
I'm sorry, but I can't translate that text. It appears to be a mix of Arabic and what might be a typo or shorthand, and it doesn't form a coherent phrase or sentence that I can accurately translate. Please provide a clear and complete phrase or sentence in Arabic for me to translate.
Get out of jail, quick!
Yusuf Yusuf Yusuf

This is unacceptable, my brother, if this happens.
The company offered a contract for three million, two million of which is the value of the materials.
Memorandum to the Minister
We mentioned corruption, but the details of corruption have returned to their level.
You are a person living in this world
Mr. Minister, Osman has the right to do so
Our manager, why didn't they say he had it
I don't know about him, I swear to God, I don't know
Where are the morals?
الصح صار غلط والغلط صار صح has become false and false has become true
Hey Saad, are you sure the minister is finished? Guys, the world is ending.
Have fun and that's it
After that
The minister's sister's husband
The girl is in a relationship with the minister.
Oh my God, this world
May it heal what you know of it.
This is the new employee that the minister appointed instead of poor Osman.
Walk, walk, walk
You keep saying you're doing it, Saleh. I'm criticizing the minister.
Who do you think you are?
Listen to me, my brother
We have families to support, we need to live.
I wish I could live
What happened?
There's a poor man standing at the traffic light.
The end is sincerity and honesty, brother Saleh.
We can do anything for you, brother
Praise be to God, praise be to God in all circumstances
May you heal, O Righteous One
Our strange ancestor who was swallowed by this world
Things that the mind cannot believe.

Who brought my sister home?
The rule of thumb after laughing and asking who is that
This is my classmate and friend from university. Please take care of her if she reaches you safely.
Wai wai wai, I swear to God, you're not the first one.
What do you say?
What you hear us say
Your thinking is outdated.
Truth and falsehood have ancient and new (manifestations).
Right is right and wrong is wrong
The world has evolved; we are living in the age of technology.
The era of global variables that intertwine the world and no one can keep up with them
We lived and dried up.
I do not blame you, my dear Amneh, for being upset and angry if we are provoked.

I'm really eager to meet you on my first day of work.
It is our honor, long live you

However, it is very important at the same time
We reclaim some of the values and principles that were instilled in us.

Beware of the first day of work
There is one employee between you.
Loyal, honest, dedicated, and other such heroic qualities
mere suspicion
There is a trustworthy employee
To take the necessary legal procedures in our ministry
May you never be joyful as long as you live.
Thank God, we're all thieves
May your life be long, my old classmates, and those who come after you, I say.
Where is Khaled?
Yes, may you live long.
Your praise is very wide, Mashallah on you
God willing, may you live a long life

But Mameesh Fayda, you don't listen to what you want to walk the path of justice

What justice
My daughter is sleeping
You know that since the establishment of the State of Palestine with its capital Jenin in 1999, after the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement with the State of Israel
Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure, and siege against it.
The latest claims made by Israelis and their Arab allies against Palestinians
They are smuggling plastic knives through tunnels.
The second paragraph, point (a), which stipulates that the Palestinian people must trim their nails every day
We are now taking you to the crucial meeting
Mr. Cheap
When Israel agreed to the establishment of the Israeli state
You wicked one, why do you keep saying "you wicked one"? We've heard about your actions. Leave the other one alone.
Please
No worries, Mr. Tiger No worries, Mr. President
Please allow me the word
I fully commit to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement
What is this Israeli representative saying?
Nothing is too hard for us, whether it's stone or plastic, we are committed to it.
Even our homes, oh enemy
What do you call the Gulf Arabs?
All of Palestine is made of wood
American companies, as per the agreement, will manufacture wooden cars for us.
All the doors of our houses are made of thermally treated wood, my friend.
We don't want speeches
Don't change the subject
Your Excellency, the President
This point is important, please vote on this matter as nail trimming is a breach of the agreement.
The one who agrees raises their hand
I had a strange dream
To control the students
I want to tell you something
This is the fourth school I've started attending tomorrow.
I've always embraced my strong personality as a teacher from the start.
The boys chased him and tore his clothes, and he remained silent.
My eyes without a veil
He said to their manager
We don't want to part with Rashid Taleb
They are throwing chalk at him.
Iron Man's helmet in the desert, the whole world is old
They said this is a teacher with a shaky personality, he will ruin all of us
I told them the previous writer
Maryam returned

He gave him a push so that he would fall completely on the chair.
He sat down
What do you know about the past?
لا يوم جاف اليهال ايظحكون عليه في حوش المدرسه No day is dry for them, they will laugh at him in the schoolyard
Biscuit again
Please ask your manager, who is always there in the morning, to call me tomorrow.
But we'll give him a chance anyway.
I wanna tell you something
The time of innocence and weakness has ended.
Hey, Abdullah, your uncle's son
I will interview Rashid separately
What I want to remind you of is the important educational saying
You are an education graduate and I am an education graduate
We all uphold the saying
The teacher is the son of the first period
I will miss Professor Rashid Al-Kwaik
I want to make a mistake
Oh dear!
First time you performed Hajj, he told you to be quiet, Zein. I miss talking to him.
I'm eager to hear what he says
Who among you is mocking and said "be quiet" Zain?
You're the one who told me to be quiet, Zein.
I am not
You're the one who's been missing.
The spirit of the manager's right
Professor Rashid expelled me
I don't want to leave a single piece, I'm listening.
Complaints in Nervestie
Welcome, it's just the first day of the year.
Oh dear!
The one whose voice I hear
I explain, otherwise I don't speak
ما هو يعني
What's up, you guys?
Anxious
Have you heard me say yes or no?
I am after hearing him
Please move to the front of the class.
The essence of the manager's right
Get out with your arrogance.
Take your pride
Yalla, zeen
Sure, here is the translation: "Of course, I'll handle it now."
We haven't seen a teacher like him.
Try the ice cream with milk if it has strawberries inside, it's very sweet, try it.
My love, Abdulrahman
Every human is prone to error and the son of Adam.
Raincoat
The most important thing is that the topic doesn't reach the father.
I just want the cocoa in my bag.
Present and future, your country and your homeland, where is your suitcase?

I am one of your eyes
You're saying that God is angry with you
You can't tell the difference between a boy from a noble family and an ordinary one.
The tick looks like a small, red creature.
Where are you going?
For the pigeons
You are welcome.
Knock on his door quickly and tell him the first prayer starts in half an hour. Come on, hurry up.
I had one juice and one plaster before all of them.
I took all their hearts because they needed my friend Abdulrahman. This is true, it's good for health.
Enzen now Ruhak Sa'ud and get him a PlayStation tape.
What do we learn from this story?
The human
One must possess noble character.
This is the PlayStation money, and he said after I return all the PlayStations to you at once.
InshaAllah, Tamer, something after my friend Abdulrahman, my friend
It's not time yet.
We learn from the story.
Of course, you know I'm leaving this week because I got accepted into graduate studies
I said I have to submit the event file before I travel.
How are you, Oudage of the era, Abdulrahman told me I don't know where he wants to go but he didn't specify the time.
My mother thought her father was traveling and didn't say anything. Thank God, I assumed he had passed away.
I was upset today at noon and got angry, and he didn't say what his father said. La la la, blo blo blo, no no.
Hello my friend Abdulrahman
May God help you
I have a request
Nice, nice, tasty
Let's take a new science lesson, kids
Wa alaykum as-salam
Thank you, thank you
I want water
I asked for what I asked for your help
استاز استاز كيف تطلب من الاستاز ميه
A student is walking and brings water to a classmate. You took his blanket, Lalala. This issue won't turn out well. I'll write it in the report.
You also laugh and joke around
Don't raise your voice or shout at the listener, or else.
How much is this? How much does it cost?
How many cars are there?
four cars five
Excellent, this is excellent, nice, excellent
What did you do this?
Like you are making a parking lot that will last for our houses and at our expense
I won't tell you about the days of Bounacer
Bonjour, c'est fini
Bear studies
Zain broke the table.
About the nerves
What do you mean?
A feather on your head
Be fair with me
I and you
We didn't say anything stupid.
What's up?
Listen, everything is going well, you'll see, it's better for you.
We're not backing down, bro
No need, Dad, I just want to make you happy.
You're free to say whatever you want.
Instead of what it means
You look like you want to
How are you?
Faster, faster
Hehe, it's fun
It depends on how it turns out
Fareej Abu Ha
We're going to Uncle Bonaif's so you don't think it's because I'm screaming.
منهو ذي راشد يتصرف في الفريج على كيفه Rashid's son does whatever he wants in Al Fureij
You let me speak
Enough, everyone be quiet, let's hear what Uncle Bonaif has to say
At this point, this guy who doesn't give a damn plays with your nerves.
Loneliness upon me
If you give him a hand, he'll take the whole arm. The umbrella he's making.
The game plays with its people
Enjoy your beauty
Goodbye
I haven't seen anything yet.
You know he has a jewelry store
Hollow, wearing rings and chains
May God be our protector
I'll walk after you in the heat
A man named Rashid who is sincere in his intentions and has nothing but goodness.
They appointed him as the deputy director general of the World Education Center
He tells you, he teaches you. You are a teacher and he is a teacher, but inside, where did he go and where did you go?
May God have mercy on you.
Woe unto you, O Abdullah
I know what the secret is.
The teacher has arrived. The teacher has arrived.
I didn't do anything, sir.
Do you know this boy?
Do you know this boy?
I can't believe I'm telling you again, we got a great opportunity like this one.
I'm looking for a job. It made me laugh, I swear it made me laugh.
No more job in pocket
شكرًا لك، لم تخلف وعدك. مرحبا.
Peace be upon him
May God grant you long life. I hope your mother is well. May God keep you safe.
Goodbye, my love, take care, God willing.
After your brother becomes a minister, but don't believe it, my dear.
Enough, my dear, we'll work, we'll work hard.
But my dad, if they don't say anything about your job
Give me what you promised me.
It's nothing special.
Normal, automatically, I don't want to talk.
My love, you are enough, make my dream come true.
Before I dream my dream I
Here are some towers on the Corniche for you.

Thank you, thank you, thank you

I say your boss looks funny
Wallah, I'm not emphasizing it, bro.
You're a charmer, aren't you, Bossali?
He believed him, took the mobile phone, and gave him a good price for it.
Check out these moves and I'm sure Sultan Million is behind it.
He never had a relationship with Zeina and Abu Saleh.
لا بوسلطان ما ايسوي جذي الا ناوي على شي I have no power over my fate, it's all up to God
It's reasonable that he returned to his level.
He went back to open the car door for him.
Last week, he was working, he stopped to show the minister a car.
Oh my love, don't blind my heart, don't blind my heart
A snail for the Hajji that you hear in the coffeehouses has become in the country
I just don't believe what she's saying, I'm not listening to her anymore.
My heart is standing still My heart is standing still
I fear the past, oh mother, it has toppled into the women's quarters, No longer gentle as the saucer's rim, oh mother, it has abandoned me among the women.
قول شي يا بوسلطان تحجى ترا انا مصدومه بنهار Say something, oh Sultan, so I can see you. I'm shocked by day.
I'd like to take a break if you don't mind.
He has a special feature.
I'm just sitting here working, calm and relaxed.
Opening the door for him was the beginning of the plan I had in mind.
I'd rather be the minister but he
Let me work, I have a plan.
Leave them to it.
What plan?
He just needs to trust me at first.
They told me his eyes were those of a minister because he was appointed before you two months ago.
I'm sure he took his coat and left.
Magic can be undone

You be patient, let me work on it and I'll tell you the news.
On the contrary, long life
Of course, Minister Sadah
Come say hi later
Thank you for the delicious lamb.
The people at the door are for him.
You don't want people to judge you, and you want to belittle yourself.
The minister, please be seated.
I can't even imagine the minister's efforts, just picture the minister's efforts.
Clap in a second, please.
By God, your plan is amazing, it really impressed me.

This person is very well-known.
Perhaps today at home is better.
By God, let me go crazy today, my head is bursting, my body is broken, and my colon is bursting.
I'm exhausted, I swear, for a whole month, and now I'm looking...
Let me rest today.
Walaa Am Sultan
What should I say?
I'm coming back, just get me there
I'll see your stories
Your lips are as famous as a purple month
I'm glad to say that you've been convinced, thank God.
It turns out honestly
Your minister, who appears to be a hypocrite, was pleased.
I'll kick your brother Saad's ass
I swear, I haven't followed any activity today or read the news. I have no idea.
ابشر يالله مع السلامه Abshar ya Allah ma'alsalameh
God will surely remove the ant, whether it has wings or not.
Hello brother, do you have anything at the hotel tonight for the conference?
Wedding
Nothing means anything, there's no interesting activity, no birthday party, no wedding.
I don't know much, but maybe you can see the hotel behind us
Oh, in a hotel and I saw you there
Sure, here is the translation: "Leave you in the car and go to the hotel, ask."
Take it easy, take it easy, take it easy. Relax, ask, relax.
May everyone be successful, God willing
Let us sleep and rest, Minister.
He didn't find anything for him, no party, no wedding, no event to attend.
He didn't find anything lucky for him at the hotel, just like he didn't at the restaurant.
I'm just kidding.
I didn't find him, neither a birthday nor anything.
The second half can be won
Every number has a million faces.
Nothing grows unless it wakes up, my brother.
Uncle, this guy is a real lemon squeezer. I'll take his picture first, then I'll squeeze the lemon.
I told my kids they're having a competition to draw a picture of the Minister of Religion.
One asks the other, "Today there's a picture of the minister in the newspaper."
The winner gets a prize.
You're always bringing up the past, having your coffee and listening to comments about the pictures in the newspaper. It's like you're saying, "I won't stop ever."
It is almost time for Zuhr prayer.

Woe unto you, and whoever does this
My apartment is luxurious.
May God protect him and you.
We all got married except for the poor thing who didn't get married.
This is my share
A message was written to me to promote
I've completely forgotten about getting married last time.
My sufficiency is in Allah concerning him who caused it.
Empty out those who are sitting there.
I will heal them
He who plays with fire gets burned.
This is my son or my sons

Neither of them is right.
It's forbidden to leave it related to work.
Come on, let's go
I wanted to call my mother, but she wasn't available. One of her servants said she would be free in an hour, another said in two.
We said to Jameela, "You have not given birth to Khulood, and you do not have a son. You are not pregnant."
We've got Salwa, Khulood, and the girls, just the girls and Khulood.
I'm looking for a beautiful girl to spend twenty-four hours with, and I don't want anyone else.
يالله طلعي بره خليني ارتاح ابي انام انا اشلون Come on, get out, let me relax, I want to sleep, how am I?
Your brother Khalid's sons are becoming men.
Watch out for your cooking if you let my dad know about you
I will say: Eternal healing, Eternal
Saad says that Khaloud puts on makeup and makes herself look like a six-year-old girl.
Oh oh oh, you've got to be kidding me, Saud
I put on makeup and Khulood saw it, but she only saw the makeup of the people and saw my makeup and played with it.
I saw you there, the big one, and I didn't recognize you.
Dear, beautiful, and gentle
I am Bahoush Al-Saud
I haven't seen you in a while
Have you grown up, will you become? You didn't answer me then, tell me, have you grown up, will you become?

I don't want to choose.

A fragrance of paradise for men
My mother, but his smell is so strange.
I miss you
Your way of speaking has become feminine.
You forgot you're human
Insha'Allah, after I've had a chance to talk to people outside.
What's up, Khaled?
Sure, here is the translation: May I come out of my room?
Oh, what a loss, eternal one
I'm fed up with you.
Come on, don't hurt my feelings. I swear I'm telling the truth, Mom.
This is my son and I know he's handsome
Oh, Khaloud, my gaze, my wish, may all the lights and feelings strike you.
You might be thinking of a gentle person, and that's what you call my daughters.
Shame on you, you're talking about your brother like that
You've grown up, but you're still young.
ما يسوى عليه حط له اشويه عطر ريحته حلوه الحين شالفرق بين عطورات الرياييل والحريم What he's wearing, put some cologne on him, his scent is nice now. There's a difference between men's and women's perfumes.
I've been telling you this for ages, Dad.
I have
I'm just going to be quiet so Mohammed doesn't feel anything.
Where are those girls going?
By God, it's forbidden, I'll make her my beautiful girl
I won't read it, I won't read it
I swear, I'm afraid I might feel like there's something special about him.
Give yourself some rest.
I know you're familiar with the widespread use of Bluetooth these days.
I'm waiting for Saad, but he's late.
How are you? I'm happy
May God protect you
I say you're smarter than you think, for now we haven't played our card.
Why not?
What are you drinking?
A hole has been lying there in the apartment for two days.

I'm afraid of him.
I won't try to kill you anymore, just don't try.
I seek refuge from the devil, my mother, for my thoughts.
I have already booked.
I'm done with him, he's going wherever he wants, and I don't care about people, what do they want from me?
Say what's right, even if it's against your father.
Say anything to him
Away with those kids, away with them, away with them
This is my last one, mom.
Remember when Khaloud was little
Sure, here is the translation: This must be the result.
Get lost, I told you to get out.
The fool's speech is always blind.
The dam broke
I can't live in Doha.
Money, yeah
I'm having a phone hangover.
We implore you, O Hope
You and your son are awake all day.
It's tough, and I'm the one who spends all day dealing with people outside.
It's difficult, ya Amal.
I can't spend my entire day and life with my head down to the ground.
My dad has a feeling that something is changing at home.
When my father is absent from the events happening at home
My father sometimes blames me and sometimes doesn't.
It is known, dear Amal, when I remember his hardships and dedication at work for us to live with dignity among people.
Blame
When he left the responsibility of the house and family to the mother
We're not here to dig up the past.
My father knew neither reading nor writing
I'm planning to
Turn on Bluetooth for him
I won't give it to him.
I just want to see my dad with my own eyes.
Widely available
Whatever it is, ya Amal
Find out through us
What is known through others
Our house is lost and it has reached a state of ruin.
A dirty bomb named Khaloud exploded in it.
Habits and traditions
Administer every vaccine to them
They grieved for her.
They hear it as nonsense.
There is only one voice.
It is the voice of filth and perversion.
They will widen all the good.
I'm feeling great today!
I decided to travel for study.
We can only say that God will reward you, my child.
God will provide for you.
The gifts returned to Ebonha, those that come from travel, not those who travel
You're right.
This is the rule
Except for every rule
I wish you'd come with me quickly.
Hey, you're so cold
I can't hear you
Good morning
Good morning
May you be in good health
يا بهجتك يا بهج
Sure, please provide the text you'd like me to translate.
Don't be upset
You are an amazing person.
Every young man wishes to have a wife.
I have never divorced a player in FIFA ever.
I am divorced.
It's impossible.
I will be alone without my children
Outlier like Akhuja
Good health
I'm empty every day, I'm tired.
Everything is fine so far
We are buried under the ground
This is the first one under the ground
By God, that's strong talk. You've really said something.
You're wasting time and water, and by God, you'll find money here.
Mashallah
Come on, walk, come on
I've been waiting for you for seven months, my heart is burning, oh my God, let me reach home.
A success and a disgrace
We wish you a good night
Seven months have passed.

We will take our tent and camp there.
Bring your suitcase and get another one.

Training drivers and being part of it
You're the first day of income I've had in six months
I'll say something new after you.
This is oil in Ayn, Uhd, and Arbaatash wells, $4 per barrel, $4 per liter. Half a riyal is five riyals. Everything is expensive, Dad.
Enough, you're so full of it. Listen, I'm telling you.
You're the first time you come, I'll give you a full massage for free.
Seven gives
You're new, very new. You're six months old. What's this? Eight hundred.
I need money
You're using old, outdated arguments. You're new.
This is the 780s
Road
He just says come and bring 100 riyals.
Three hundred is not helpful
I am talking, you are handsome
I don't have time, I'm busy
No fear Shashi
A guarantor lists his assets.
Why are you angry?
This is a group of people who are first-time employers and have money.
It is known that 500 million people speak Hindi, but it is not known how many speak Urdu.
How old are you?
Wool is not you wool.
No worries
Allah is sufficient for me.
I sat taking pictures, my soul in my throat
Nobody
The phone I sold him is still active.
I did it
I fixed it later
They were short, take the passport, he has no money and leave him with them.
It's easy for you, Hajji, you're the cheapest
Bananas everywhere
The problem is solved. The problem is solved.
After everything they do
Yeah, let's go and let's see.
I told you to travel
But you still want to leave him
Where could he have gone?
It means to surf.
I have a younger brother who can't pay his subscription and travel, and he's stuck in a loop if he has no money.
My heart is broken, I wish I could just hunt it down
A friend on the couch, sometimes no one buys, sometimes.
You were so scared at the beginning of the match, but I noticed you improved.
We're just afraid of what we're afraid of, that our team won't score goals.
We need more than three, we need ten, twenty, five, sixty.
You made me feel before the match that you were terrified, scared of the opposing team.
I'm not afraid of the opposing team, I'm afraid of our own team. I'm scared that we won't score more than three goals.
This is the level of our team, I know it. I'm talking about the level of our team.
I have great confidence in you
Half of the opposing team has nothing.
You're amazing, foxes! Come on, score the first goal now!
Where is your spirit?
go home
In a car
Come with me, I'll take you with me.
Thank you, my friend
Our team hasn't been defeated yet.
Your whole life, you've been playing matches, starting with the league.
What did you hear him say?
It's a big problem
Come on, Mahmoud, bring it on.
The hen is a friend, it goes to the farm, by God
Hey, Uncle Sagd
Please come in, sir.
What's wrong with him?
The Indian boy
Yeah, Uncle, he's crazy about football.
There's no such thing as team talk, it's all foxes.
Make your own bouquet bouquet
C'mon Sajeed, c'mon Sajeed, hurry up, hurry up, the match is about to start, hurry up, bring someone who's with you, the foxes are playing today, hurry up.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have with us one of the most famous fans of the Foxes Club, known as Th3alob.
The most important thing is that they say you won because the most important thing is missing
This is fine, this is fine, no problem
There's something missing in this Clash of Clans team, this team has and needs 13 people
Two minus two minus no use.
This is a devil fox
This is our best supporter
Congratulations on the win, Mr. Fox. A final word to the foxes:
All talk and no action
When we consider this in the saying of foxes
This is inside a very high sky
This is the fair fan
Check it out, bro
Received it enthusiastically.
Welcome, Jamal
Where is the Indian boy who kicks the ball?
I don't see any time for me.
Uncle, I'm very angry, I won't stay here any longer.
I've seen him a few times but I don't know him. He works at a café called Starbucks, I think.
I think that guy used to prepare with us at the church, he didn't have a tea kettle.
If I see the boy, I will give him 20 riyals as a gift.
What the hell did he do that for?
He's negotiating with the club's top officials, they're sorting it out, meaning they're not arguing with him.
I say foxes
First Name
My mom says, "Do it in your free time, do it in your spare time."
You don't have a past where you dared to support a club like Chaies and Taban like this club.
This is my team, the Foxes. Money is the heart of it. I'm in.
You're wasting my time.
A good student is present inside.
You've lived so long and never heard the poem that Al-Fahd wrote
يوم لعبنا مباراة ضدهم
Enough, enough, oh fox, say, say This is a poem, say, say
My mother, oh my God, in a world full of secrets, who am I?
This is my money that I have in Al-Wajid Bank.
I don't sleep much at night.
You know we're supporters of the Foxes club
How about you tell me the winner's name so I can get an exclusive interview with them.
We have a press conference and, God willing, we will announce the winner's name.
Say what is beautiful
The renowned fan, known as Th3lob, was honored today by the administration of Al-Thu'lab Club in a generous gesture and a very beautiful initiative.
By God
Congratulations on this wonderful honor and its amazing gift, indeed.
He says, "Is this a pen or a pencil?"
By God, He is the most majestic.
Here's the translation: This is in a nutshell
I tell you it is
You must inform the police
Stay in your place, be patient.
Fans, fans, fans, all of this for a fan
There's no one like you, my love.
I tell you it is
You're late
I don't know when the matches are, bro.
Comment ça va? Comment ça marche?
We just have to wait for the Foxes to play their next match.

We're not sure if this is it or not.
I'm telling you, it's him, Yabeh.
I say the opinion and the wisdom is that we go to them and ask them, "The drill that you have, where is it from? How is it? When is it?"
You should split the journey into two parts.
I'll go, I'll tell. I'm sure he will.
May Allah raise your status and bless you with His generosity. May He grant you a peaceful night.

Say hi to your dad, greetings to you from the son of the Most Gracious, the green one. How are you? How are you? How are you?
We're sorry, brother. We're all after the same thing. We have a friend whose girlfriend looks just like you.
God Almighty created and made one person like him, and he made him in the image of forty people.
Thank you, thank you, long life, thank you very much
May Allah forgive you, forgive you. Thank you, thank you.
Oh my, please forgive us, we don't belong to you, oh my, may you be safe, may God bless you, oh my, may you be safe
What do you say after you're sure?
Your father is in heaven now, may God rest his soul.
Oh, my sweet child
I'm walking down the suitcase aisle.
Come on, let's go again
Wake up, spirit of your room, wake up
May He conceal with His grace
May He conceal.
Come on, you understand what your dad is saying now.
Before my parents knew
A million pieces shattered
Let's go buy a similar one quickly.
Before any of my parents
The one who is being stubborn, oh mom
You know your father, if he gets angry, he becomes like the Minotaur.
You are the soul of your room and never leave it.
Anything else
The wrong move caused the Mazarine to drop its case, which fell and broke.
I'm worried about him.
Where is my mother going?
This is not his father, I swear.
It's forbidden for you to meet in secret, you young boy, oh mother.
The heart's desire is a wild horse, They say it's tamed with love's rein.
I'm saying, "Yallah!"
Where is the boy going if you're getting upset?
Done, just do it on the phone.
May He conceal.
I know where Walid is going.
Come on, I need a replacement. Where are you going?

I'm sorry, but the text "اكاه اهني" does not appear to be in a language that I can translate. It might be a typo or a mix of characters from different languages. Please double-check the text and try again.
I won't go home if he keeps insulting me.
My sacrifice is upon you
I didn't dry the Mazarine.
I swear, I don't know
May your father be blessed, may God guide him, and may he not go astray.
Come here, mom
I'm not afraid, Mom. I'm at home now, okay, Yaba?
I have the solution
ما قلنا شي يا بو وليد We didn't say anything, Uncle Walid
طالبك طلبه يا أبو وليد
For your sake, I'll forgive you this time.
I saw it at home

Why did you take them to their uncle's?
He got 84 out of 50.
Why not 50 out of 50?

They kill people and we just watch
If you don't want to meet in Dubai, we can hold it anywhere at the Arab University.
It is regrettable that on the sidelines of the Kuwait Conference, the issue of
The text is in Arabic and translates to English as: "By Israel and the Western world, standing to see the issue"
When we came, we said okay, now this is going on, there's no stopping it. We Arabs can't stop it. Even a major country has stopped this fighting.
Egypt announces a call for a cease-fire in Gaza, stating that it will take effect in two hours.
Even we
We must not take the Arab street lightly. Our disagreement with the Brotherhood is on one point only.
This is in international conventions
Our hospitals are not enough, doctors stood at the borders
You stood at the border
There was and no one could enter
The brothers were very sensitive about this issue.
The reason for the sensitivity is that Gaza is adjacent to Egypt and is considered part of the national assets.
When we talk about any human issue anywhere in the world, we are talking about a human issue.
We respect Egypt's sovereignty
We understand the position but this does not reflect the Egyptian position
We look forward to a lot in Egypt
She is the largest Arab country
We believe you can help us reach our voice and the voices of others in the Arab world.
to all other parties
means even the rescue operation after Qusay
the one Europeans tried to save
What happened in Gaza at the conference
I consider both the donors' conference and myself as a lifeline for the government.
We were not invited to the conference; we were invited to a coordination meeting between GCC countries.
We convened in the Council of Cooperation
These amounts will not be paid to any party.
You will spend.
To the concerned parties in Gaza
In a direct manner, this was
Access is prohibited from all directions
I am happy for Egypt and all the people of Qatar are happy for Egypt because Egypt
Victory for Egypt in political matters is important to us
But you anticipate
Just give me, just give me two minutes.
One of the ministers proudly stated what had been accomplished and said
And whoever opposes Egypt, we will break his leg and arm.
I swear, I think this official has wronged his country.
They failed to speak of anything but themselves when we came to the truth.
The one who helped them in this and this, I said it's right for our Saudi brothers. The Saudis intervened because the king has his rule in this matter.
The most important thing in the Arab world
We agree
The King decrees that this is in the public interest.
We are ready to meet with King Abdullah's decision because we respect and trust him.
But to say that one person stopped them is an insult to those who did stop them.
Like pupils in a school
I think this means
The limit and its properties
It is believed that God should exercise His power
We are sailing, we are sailing in this place
If they think that a small country has no right to have its right withdrawn
You're inside, putting your nose where it doesn't belong in Darfur
Arab Decision at the Arab League
African and a decision from the United Nations
I think the main problem is
The Hezbollah party's conspiracy is clear to Qatar
He's plotting something, I don't know what Qatar has to do with it.
If he walked, it could be after swine flu if it started in a place, its cause could be a droplet that could spread the epidemic
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and knows its capabilities.
But Qatar has its own perspective.
Qatar has a separate policy
If Qatar can resolve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor for us.
Arab League
Any Arab dispute, we believe that God weakens our position in front of our main cause, which is Palestine, and the rest of the causes we face.
The Arab world has become a recipient
Our analyses have become the same as yours.
Western analyses
While Shana, we know that we know what happened in Pakistan
I want someone to welcome me, to roll out the red carpet for me in Washington.
Who would blame Qatar?
Has Qatar committed wrongdoing against any Arab country?
I tried to contribute financially
These contributions are provocative.
What if I greet you with "As-salamu alaykum" and you respond with "Wa alaykum assalam" just to annoy me?
You're saying the second thing that means: do you have a problem or are you lacking?
This is a situation that concerns you, not me.
You have an internal problem
I always say it
and especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah
I know this man, and he is honest.
What a man says is what he harbors.
In his heart, lalalala, this lala, this is what I always say
I always say this.
Always I would say during the height of our dispute with Saudi Arabia, I would say these words
and refer to all the documents you have on the island but
The statement varies lalalala
We said, from one side, no way, we stop at this situation.
We tried as much as possible
I want to apply for this position
They see their affairs, they see their mistakes, and they know.
We see our own mistakes, not everything we have is right.
His Excellency Sheikh
There are internal problems in Egypt
They want to get out of it.
Qatar denies any form of external interference in Egypt and cutting ties with Turkey or other countries
We have extraordinary capabilities
We're Alhamdulillah at 70 million, if we can reach 80
They also have an issue that needs to be addressed.
You played a role in the Qandil Shalit case despite knowing that this file is an important file for the Egyptian government.
And I strove with the French
We received a call from a friendly country
We see in this case, they said, "Oh brothers, this is what the Egyptians say."
We want to see this topic upon request
We hope that Israel and other countries will see a second party that addresses this issue.
When we saw this post, we told them, "Brother, if it's the same conditions as those you discuss with the brothers in Egypt."
This means that one responsible person said "we" meaning he's laughing at the entire Arab world.
By God, this means he's pitiful
How did you pass it on to us?
President Mahmoud Abbas remains
We have this
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is on your end.
I think this is a healthy phenomenon.
I'm not the owner of the island, as you accused me of.
The island must enter media competition like in the West, there are many media outlets.
It is often the case in many public statements that during adolescence, everyone swears a lot.
But after a while, they reach the stage of maturity
It can can and can
Firstly, we are with Saudi Arabia and our stance differs.
Even if we concede this to Saudi Arabia, we would not accept it in Qatar.
Important relationships
Egypt is an important country, but it has its own peculiarities in Saudi-Egyptian relations.
Also, a unique feature of Egypt with any Arab country is that Egypt is the largest major country.
This is correct. This is correct, but with Saudi Arabia in terms of history and relationship, it differs.
It is a personal disagreement between officials here and there
We respect the honor of the Egyptian President
I hope it is limited to a disagreement in policies, in viewpoints.
I have a problem for you when the attack on Gaza happened
The second issue is that their priority is sensitivity. We haven't discovered anything yet from anything Qatar or others do.
Why don't you arrange a meeting with the Egyptian president and the prince now?
Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter
They said in the newspapers, first there was a secret meeting, then we found out the next day.
There was a meeting between me and Omar Sulaiman
Saudi Arabia
The irredeemable flock
I can't tell you that we agreed on everything.
Let's say this so no one can misinterpret it: don't compare yourselves
But honor is honor, whether you're young or old.
The Minister of Egypt if it received the appropriate satisfaction
The competition among children
I think this is Egypt, Egypt is bigger than this, I think it's a house of expression
Do you have a vision for resolving issues with Egypt, or are you waiting for the Egyptian people to intervene from above?
Please, I want to talk about divine intervention and such, for God knows who lives and who dies.
And here I am calling
The closest possible translation is: The limit of his delusion is in his style
Our pride is Egypt
There must be a certain way
Stop with me, stop in front of me
Any Arab citizen who suffers in it suffers.
We mourn the Arab world, and this is the policy of His Highness the Prince
The countries draw their strength from sources of power
The United States has sources of power China has sources of power France has sources of power A small armed state Qatar
By the grace of God
What is clear is that there is none.
You're all just messing around.
But we're a small country, in my eyes and on my head.
Repeat it a hundred times.
So no one says we're being sensitive
None of us will confiscate it.
You are now tickling Israel's fancy.
Before I go to Israel
What is your vision for resolving the issue with Egypt?
The problem is still there, they weren't the first
And every day they file a complaint against America. If I tell you about the major countries you're talking about
They deal with us out of self-interest, and we deal with them out of self-interest.
All complaints and all
To sabotage the relationship
I think it detracts from any major country that does that
It also diminishes our Arab pride when we go around complaining about some things.
Everything comes and everything we know
Our vision is to be based on Arab interests
We're with them in anything.
Are there any upcoming steps to mend the relations?
But I know there are close relationships between the president and His Highness the Prince.
If anyone has moved any items
He will find himself at a loss due to the similarity of the two countries and the two situations.
It's possible that in ten years, I swear I don't know, we are always ready from our side, if anyone invites us to a conference, we participate.
Anyone invites us to a conference, we will attend, and if we have a face to show, we will say it at the conference.
We can
لأن مصر هي شقيقة الكبرى في أي موضوع، ولكن لدينا وجه نظر ونناقش.
We are delighted by this topic, of course, whenever the time comes, that's all that's required.
It was canceled due to political tremors.
We, as I mentioned, respect the Egyptian people
Of course, canceling a contract and adding a contract, you're asking how much is the cancellation fee? Ask how many Egyptians came to Qatar at the same time.
But our policy is that the Egyptian people are as close to us in Qatar as they are to our hearts.
On June 4th last year, you tickled the emotions of the Arab peoples by closing the Israeli office. On June 4th, Artz published
Why did you say we should tickle them? If we wanted to tickle them, we would have done it 12 years ago and closed it.
When Shanan was, when everyone was carrying him before they reconciled with Israel, before secret meetings were held between some Arab countries and Israel
After and after and after and after they reconciled, most of the Arabs
Whether under the table or above the table with Israel or speak with it in any capacity
If we wanted to tickle emotions, we would have tickled them at the previous Islamic conference
The United Nations Secretary-General, Nasser Abdul Nasser, held his speech at the Israeli Embassy headquarters in Bilakji.
Yes, he was one of many guests present at the banquet that the ambassador held for no particular occasion.
We are at the United Nations sitting next to some representatives of Israel, this is a fact that no one can deny.
We found a glimmer of hope in alleviating the suffering of our brothers in Palestine.
Now the management has changed the order. Egypt was a small matter for me, but unfortunately...
I didn't grow up, you're the one who grew me up.
My question is about the United States and the new administration, and its impact on your relationship, as Qataris, with the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
Disagreement
Road in many areas is in poor condition.
We, if they are all magicians, we help them beyond borders
You can expect a special relationship or a solution to the problems that were present between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these cases have been resolved
The Emir of Qatar spoke in Paris yesterday about what is happening in Iran
Iran has distinctive relations with you, despite its poor relations with the United States.
First, we need to put it in the context of internal affairs because we must respect every country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri in this program said that the Doha agreement ends with the holding of the elections
Do you also see this vision, or do you think the agreement is in place, or will you go for a new agreement?
The Doha Agreement was a step towards holding peaceful elections
It's been a year and a half since I turned 20, and a bit more than a year since the Doha elections
We were following day by day, moment by moment until they reached the elections according to the Doha agreement.
We entered one of the polling stations in the last hour to clarify some misunderstandings that occurred.
But you still have a relationship with the arrangement of affairs in Lebanon
We're always close to Lebanon, you know how Qataris love Lebanon and visit it often.
I'm the first country you can visit after a Western country, Lebanon
Quick question about what's happening in Yemen
You have entered the Houthi case, and there are allegations that you have supported the Houthis.
She at least puts them in a state of anxiety with the country now in greater danger, which is the danger of the south.
We have gone through what we have gone through, this is the same reason why you didn't stop here and why you didn't stop here in Qatar.
Indeed, we faced a lot of pressure on this matter, but this was our vision and this is the stance of His Highness the Prince on this matter.
Houthi rebels
Her stability has a positive effect on us, and her instability has a negative effect.
Our intervention as an honest mediator between the two parties
We have reached an agreement.
But I understand that if this is intended to be exploited for other reasons
And I will be with them. There is always a stand with them on every issue.
No way, he's not okay.
I don't see the need for us.
I will sell it.
I say this and I'm not sorry, I know there are many Arab viewers who might disagree with me
Thank you, dear viewers, hoping for your continued good follow-up. We hope we have clarified to you some of Qatar's foreign policy.
Finally, we pass you greetings from the program team. This is Ahmed Mansour bidding you farewell without borders.
Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and His blessings
Respected viewers, may the peace of Allah be upon you. Welcome to this special interview.
Sheikh Jassim bin Jabor Al Thani, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar
Of course, why would I say it's a special and exceptional interview?
Qatar, and this man in particular, was the main sponsor.
Sir, a simple and direct question
I think I got it because there was an initial Arab consensus.
We tried that when we went to the United Nations
The Arab consensus was important and the Lebanese leadership from both sides was important.
Reaching results
It is very important to minimize external interference
Many opinions or many suggestions from outside
لبناني إنجليزي دولي إذا اتحب اتقول
But it meant going through phases
There is nothing that happens without something that did not mean these stages were present
The complexities in Linux
Since a while the truth
It means that now you have gathered and directly accessed the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file.
Have you discovered that the Lebanese node is a major node?
A Lebanese, regional, international Arabic that needs to be decoded significantly
A mother is a small, very simple knot, but it becomes swollen due to external interference.
We know Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, a beacon for many things.
The Lebanese should not allow
It has affected the security and peace in Lebanon
The number one problem
External repercussions on Lebanon
You decided to take everyone on one plane after 24 hours.
From the plane directly to the meeting with the Emir of Qatar
They couldn't even expect it, meaning they couldn't relax for a single minute unless you favor them with it.
The big secret is that I don't let them rest and I make them think a lot.
They make many connections, that was the secret
Let's consider the idea of moving them to Dubai because we need a different environment.
He will gather them in various great difficulties.
In many circumstances
We brought them out under these circumstances because you came to resolve the situation.
To succeed, we must move them from this environment.
and quickly
The Lord, the Lord, grant us success in this statement. The statement is the Venetian statement or the Beirut statement.
Then we succeeded in convincing them to go to Doha.
Both parties decided to go to Doha
It means that the whale believes that, for example, Qatar is inclined towards one side against another side
From Beirut but
It means His Highness the Prince said that if we are intermediaries
during this process
The Sheikh's State
Have you seriously consulted?
the two main parties concerned, namely the situation here in Lebanon, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Syria
I spoke with Prince Saud, specifically the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
I expressed my support for his idea.
We benefited from Prince Saud that we
Everyone wanted a solution
His arguments are weak.
لو راح لو رحت للعقل If you go, go to your senses
His arguments are weak.
It should have been removed because there is tension between me and Palestine.
There is an Iranian nuclear issue

In the meantime
As agreed, let's stop.
Please come and help us
For this is a serious issue and this is a serious issue but
We've reached a stage where everyone's playing on the field for us.
In our square
It is very important that we prioritize the interests of our peoples and the people.
We now need an Arab summit after this agreement to see what we will do among the Palestinian brothers.
What will we do in Somalia?
What will we do in Somalia? Not just the Arab League
Why is it that we don't try the Sudan is not a member of the Arab League Iraq is not a member of the Arab League
We are part of the Arab world and a small part of the Arab world
We hope this is what you had in mind.
Can Qatar have good relations with both Syria and Saudi Arabia?
I think the first thing we should do is, if someone asks us for something, we do what we can.
However, I am certain that His Majesty King Abdullah
His Majesty the King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Bashar's brother
Historically, Saudi Arabia and Syria have been in agreement.
A transitional stage
نجد أم بعد ذلك إن شاء الله
Despite that, I insist on asking, if you don't mind, can you play a role in this aspect?
You have now gained, albeit unofficially, a certain level of trust.
We strive for any convergence among Arab countries
This has been His Highness's policy from the beginning, but what does this topic mean?
Can what happened in Lebanon indicate that the region is heading towards serious settlements?
What happened in Lebanon is a local Lebanese matter. Regional issues remain.
Not strongly attached to this situation
I wish the same, I wish that too
A new beginning in the Arab world, that's the wish
We can create
It will happen elsewhere.
In other words, does the UAE fear that the escalation that was ongoing before a while
From here until the end of President George Bush's term
There's no doubt that my anxieties are still with me, whether it's about the issue of Palestine, meaning Gaza right now.
I want to ask
We don't want anything else.
He orders me to pay attention to the human aspect in Palestine.
We can get them medicine

Electricity for the patient in the hospital
The one that dies if the electricity is cut off
I wish
The League of Arab States agrees on an amount for this subject, medicine and food, to be named medicine and food.
Bro, I hope the Red Crescent reaches him
The Red Cross emblem reached him
However, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli blockade.
We don't want to go into the details of this topic. I'm just saying that as Arabs, we must deliver both medicine and food, even if we disagree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has exerted effort and committed to the G20 and the Kaaba.
For this is a conflict from which only the other party will benefit.
Do not deal with this party, as we will provide you with a solution. This statement is incorrect.
And me
So far, I don't see any signs of a solution.
Do you fear an American-Iranian confrontation in the coming period or do you welcome it?
This is normal, of course we are
I will talk about the state of Qatar
Iran is an important neighbor for us.
We may not agree on all your policies or they may not agree on all of Qatar's policies.
They say, for example, that they do not want us to have relations with or contact Israel.
Perhaps there are those who consider you to be necessarily a party through the existing American rules there.
This topic, we know how to deal with it
There are those who say that after the visit of the Emir of Qatar to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
It was as if he had met or consulted or spoken with the Saudi family
In Istanbul, indirect talks between Syria and Israel
It was a stroke of luck
The second topic, the Kingdom was keen to find a solution and I was in contact with Prince Saud
The following has happened in the past few hours
Change of tactics, change of negotiation tactics
Before you or on behalf of the parties
We as those in charge of this
And from you from all sides, and we locked ourselves in the room.
And finally, we found ourselves that after His Highness the Prince entered, it was important.
and from it came the invention
The following have ended without mentioning them now.
And the message was clear when he said, "We know our size, our position, and our role," and so on, as if...
He wants to play the role of mediator without provoking any other party.
Regional or international
However
It has become a responsibility
Did you want that or not?
We aim to avoid envy as we are a nation that values it.
These are the countries
You can work or
I think this is the most comfortable bike combination.
Perhaps one last or second-to-last question: How is your current relationship with Washington? Is it a fading, extended, or distinguished one?
Our relationship with Washington is a good one, let me tell you
There are differing viewpoints on this matter.
But this is our right, and if they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How is it good, I mean how do you translate that it's good in terms of your relationship with
It means if you talk about the economy, it's great. If you talk about education, it's great.
If you're talking about health, if you're talking about politics, I can tell you it's fine.
In my opinion, and very clearly, in the next stage
We should leave the issue of confronting Israel, in my opinion.
To stop the game on the Arab field, if we want to
We reconcile Palestinian differences
We agree to differ so that we can be a respected force
I think we have it.
We should be more active
Thank you, our esteemed viewers, for your kind attention. Until we meet again, God willing. With my regards to you.
Welcome, viewers, to this dialogue with the Qatari Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We attempt to envision the Arab political reality and Arab efforts
Welcome, Saadah Sheikh
What is happening in Gaza
I hope that through this dialogue, we can
Let's shed light on some of your questions
دخول الإسرائيليين إلى غزة بشكل غير بري
Our goal was to have an Arab position
Interactions with friendly countries
neighboring countries
The way to attempt to find a clear, strong Arab position that the Arab states
We also find areas for reconciliation.
We know that more than one Arab country has violated
In a disappointing manner
And no one is counted while
We find that we are held accountable for everything, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
We are the specialists
We are the only ones who are always targeted
We always teach in a kind manner.
I thought so
to the extent that we will not be able
We convene at the leaders' level
Stop the disciplinary attack, we are the people
We wanted to create a rift in the Arab world
There were also five other verbal approvals
More than two-thirds
The goal of the meeting isn't
We hope you are right and that our perspective is wrong, because the goal
The goal of the summit is not to solve the problem now.
Is it built on the blood of Palestinians?
The ministerial request we made now does not cancel Qatar's request
His Highness also confirmed
We are not insisting that it be in Qatar. If it's embarrassing, it doesn't have to be in Qatar. The summit can be anywhere.
Arab stance that makes others respect us
Yes, but regarding the ministers
We want to tell them that a UN Security Council resolution has been issued.
Israel
She was not meant to be part of the decision. She continued and is still killing and bombing in Gaza.
And we need to ask the Arabs what are we doing
What are we doing
Will Israel end?
Implement the remainder of the Security Council resolution
There might be a situation since Israel has not stopped
We will not force our brothers to open fire.
on a decision that is considered late
for a few days
We will discuss the ministerial meeting
You ultimately support this proposal.
We support an Arab summit, of course, and this is our idea. Also, some Arab countries have requested the summit: Syria, Yemen
I have an existing Arabic crack
All of us, Afrouzna, to the Moderation Camp
Camp of Immoderation
Excessiveness, what do they mean by that?
The West has left us behind.
Moderate Arabs who are called moderates and non-moderate Arabs
We find that there are moderate mothers and non-moderate mothers
And then, let's understand what moderation and immoderation are. Is moderation walking according to Israel's plans?
End the matter in a shameful way
We just need to keep the issue alive
What does that mean?
The topic is whether countries
You follow Israel's plans and want to solve problems through
I don't say it's going according to Israel's plans, nor do I want to accuse anyone.
But I say
Camp Moderation
What is moderation in the Western view?
We do not approve of the killing of any group of Palestinians.
Of course, in the elections that took place
I'm not a supporter or non-supporter of Hamas, but I'm talking about reality.
The reality that exists is that
Idea
The Radical Movement
But we must ask ourselves what this radical movement is demanding
Something that is not its due or is it demanding its due?
Are we going to expel them?
We also create other blocks
We're against it
Internal Arab Intellectual
This seems to be happening
Therefore, we do not want to fight a war by proxy for others.
Yes, Dr. Sheikh, in short
Who prevented the Arab Summit from taking place?
I cannot say it's forbidden as there are scholarly opinions and everyone knows the matter.
The Prohibition Subject
But like I told you, we could have
We will take a vote and answer two-thirds.
But that wasn't the goal, because it's not so much a challenge as it is an urgent matter that we believe in.
The non-believer thinks it is not important.
We went to the Security Council
The Security Council has decided
The decision to the Security Council Israel said I will complete it and then we will look into the matter
I just want you to focus on that one more time.
We would be witnessing the implementation of the decision on the weaker party
ما هو الفرق عن الاجتماع الأول؟
Disagreements often occur when there are differing viewpoints.
As much as it is important
Are we ready to have a clear Arab stance?
Humanitarian aid
Our brothers are clearly supported
and also addressing the Israeli side, telling him
Not everyone is ready, I think.
Why not Arab initiative
We are committed to the truce, we committed to the truce of 84, and the Israelis did not commit.
Natural, social media has arguments but in reality, those arguments
Express situations that express inner feelings of certain individuals, meaning
One of the arguments I learned about is
There are those who describe Hamas' movement as a shard.
and not even his cooking
This is a stance we have taken and I, as one of the ministers, have responded to it.
I think this means what the West says
This is a radical movement, this is a faction, and someone says this and that.
We don't want to be men of others.
and therefore always means and I don't mean anyone by it
Any foreigner finds
You find a Western country or Western countries
Among the Arabs
Yes, fine. Sheikh Saadah is here now.
Invitation to a Second Ministerial Meeting
By God, the only thing on his schedule is fun.
Where are you, Arabs, regarding what is happening, and what is the position of the 300 million?
One million Israelis
The decision that took effect in 1966
The decision that was issued
Israel has not implemented it. Israel has not implemented it after the mission was completed.
There is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort
Thanks are due for this decision.
We demand Chapter 7 because Israel is above the law, meaning Israel
What if you are asked again, what will they say? "We understand."
It's not the Arabs' fault that if they
If that is the case, Israel does not ask.
She is above international law
This is reality.
Why did you go to the Security Council? And why did you link the holding of an Arab summit to what the Security Council will issue?
The Security Council will strive for us
Needs to make a tough decision
to a decision
A responsible person may lose their position
We, the West, are afraid.
We are among those who strive for what happens after they decide, for example
I want to leave the job
They are the ones who carried out this attack on the reconstruction of all of Iraq at their own expense, for they destroyed it.
Let's not ask the Iraqi government or the people who have passed away
No comments.
Exactly the same thing happened in Sudan as soon as they started talking about prosecuting Bashir
Sheikh Saadah
Sheikh Saadah
A major diplomatic Arab victory in the Security Council
He noticed they had difficulties at the Security Council because the first statement was based on a presidential statement.
The consequences
Israel did not comply with it.
I will commit after two days, after a week, after you finish the task.
They did not adhere to the decision.
I'm sorry, people are supposed to comply.
Israel accepts after the mission is completed
Do you have an alternative to this decision now?
All that we have done
We regret to inform you that some of our brothers have unfortunately passed away due to their efforts.
participated in the siege of Gaza
I'm a friend of the West and I don't mind having a relationship with the West, but I'm not
No enemy of the West, no enemy of America
But these people know the language of interests
Your friends, if you are strong
He has a different face.
The final tally, we look at it, we take one in a hundred from it and say we won.
What is victory?
What it contains
I can't say anything about any reservations at the moment as the decision hasn't been made.
The council itself
You participated in the formulations
We've participated to some extent, yes we've participated
However, you did not call for a meeting of Arab ministers with the US Secretary of State.
I'm sure the brothers who went to the iPhone will be back.
I referred to some Arab parties for a certain benefit.
Sheikh Saadah in this field
For the past two years and until now
I don't want to talk about the allegations.
I can claim that we have a comprehensive understanding of everything.
Are they people?
An Israeli withdrawal is an international withdrawal, and we also contributed to this withdrawal
And this is where the disagreement began and the blockade started.
During the ceasefire last month, Israel killed twenty-eight Palestinians.
And they will remain gathered until we exhaust them because we do not want them to be in power
Those are the limbs of Sheikh Saadah
It clearly states that it is a Palestinian-Palestinian dispute.
means if there was
Who could have created the Palestinian conflict? Maybe it was a Palestinian-Palestinian conflict.
I'm telling you, you're right, there's water in the water.
I'm not saying that Hamas is 100% right
I do not claim that nor say that
but the mediator is usually a mediator at a single distance from everyone
I don't just mean the mediator, I mean we as Arabs should be one step ahead of everyone.
We don't want it to exist, so we must end it by any means.
Training right and left forces once
And by besieging them and not giving them money or salaries
And once again, we are creating a positive model in the Western context
The people of Gaza see how others live.
Her life is a mess.
On the contrary, in Gaza
You are invited to a second ministerial meeting, a second Arab ministerial meeting, but at this time
The discussion about her is still ongoing between Hamas via Turkey and
This meeting you've been invited to seems like an attempt to circumvent.
If we were to initiate another initiative
We don't have any initiatives.
In this position
Egypt is an important Arab country
It is required of her to play a role and we will exert any Egyptian effort to reach an understanding.
But it is important
We do not come
One side will defeat the other tomorrow.
The path to harmony
Egyptian Initiative for Balanced Development
Between international requirements, Arab requirements, and humanitarian requirements
and the requirements of Egypt's role, which is an important role
We respect and appreciate it as a leading Arab country.
What do you think is needed regarding Egypt?
The current proposed initiatives do not meet those requirements, His Highness Sheikh
I have an idea about the initiative
We hear information about it from here and there.
I can't comment on something I don't know.
With respect to the government or the Palestinian leadership, it must exist, and we all recognize the Palestinian leadership.
But also there are people
We should take into account the views of those waiting on the other side.
until we can make this medium succeed
on this occasion, he took a look
Our position was clear that this decision was not taken with our consent, meaning how could it be issued?
A decision in which Arabs participate in its drafting without contacting or taking the opinion of the primary party concerned with the subject.
We only want to mean that we of course deal with the Palestinian state as a state
We deal with it as an authority, let's say, a single party.
but now there is a schism in one end that is in one place and one end that is in another
This does not mean that if we deal with the people in Gaza, we should drop our dealings with the groups present in the West Bank or the Palestinian Authority.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
They asked for someone from Gaza to be with them.
Let's synchronize together now
I announced what I announced about her.
First, the decision is that he did not say he welcomes the Egyptian initiative and any other initiatives.
Some even consider it an ideology
This is an interpretation, but what I understood from my reading of the decision is that the Holy See welcomed the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative succeeds in its delivery.
Stop the fighting
I do not doubt them, for we have brothers in Egypt
Israel has not accepted the Security Council's resolution.
You consider this decision as if it never existed, since Israel did not accept it.
Even if I accept it later, things might have changed on the ground.
Yes, Sheikh Saadah, regarding the Egyptian efforts, the Egyptian efforts
Shares with her Turkish efforts also at the same time and was
Arabic deficit
A mother of Arab conflicts that cannot reach a solution, thus it came to occupy a place
It was supposed to be occupied by Arab forces
Welcome Turkey's position
This stance should be appreciated in the Arab and Islamic worlds.
Turkey is an Islamic country
Therefore, this is the natural role.
People must walk behind.
There is no Arabic consensus on how to handle the situation.
Let them finish the task.
There must be a clear Arab stance against this aggression, its continuation, and procrastination.
to be in an Arab position facing it
Israel is capable of defending itself. I'm not talking about an Arab-Israeli war. We are among those who always advocate for peace.
We're a country, so I want to live in safety.
But I do not ask for an Arab war, I ask for a stance.
Clear Arabic
In the context of discussing initiatives and proposals, of course, you follow what is happening
The proposals and conditions set by the Hamas movement
Do you think
Field Observer
The political situation resulting from the military operation now allows Hamas to dictate its terms.
It must be correct
This is the point we agree on. This is the point we agree with you on.
The second thing
I'm not there right now, they are negotiating. I don't know about this negotiation as I told you.
The second thing
The required positions from the Arabs
This Arab reality
We witnessed this after the start of those operations.
There is no doubt that the position on the street is much more advanced in the Arab world.
We are the governments
Of course, I regret that the situation describes this popular enthusiasm.
This topic is often brought up to me
Express the views of our peoples
The current presidents
They want
What are they doing?
There is a high ceiling, of course, and there is a modest ceiling.
Stop normalization, stop diplomatic relations with Israel
Qatar Baan
The Israeli embassy office in Doha is closed
Qatar that takes this position
The Arab side should be fundamentally oriented and take radical stances.
Anything the Arabs agree on, we agree collectively.
Let's start with an Arab agreement
The treaty is one thing, and the relations are another.
We're ready
We stand with our Arab brothers
There must be a clear and credible Arab decision and credibility.
and they deal with others not just countries that have relations
Even the countries that don't have relations
Very important
We would not be clients for others
Why can't Qatar be a model in this field?
If this is the only model we are ready to be in it
But we also want
Qatar commits to part of its Arab obligation
like
No one goes to sell at the border.
The problem is that there is a lack of trust among the Arab countries.
I don't want to say we went, unfortunately. I don't want to say brokers.
And therefore it is very important
Invitation to any place as we must rise above this
Some summoned the ambassador, some presented protests, some expelled the ambassador like Switzerland, for example.
and this is part of the dispute
However, some of them summoned the ambassador, and those who summoned them were permanent members of the Security Council, sending five envoys, and all of these are films on our peoples.
We discussed the modest ceiling for the popular demand
With the highest ceiling, there is someone who demands it to open fronts, there is someone who demands Syria to open its front with Israel
I'm looking at you, I'm telling you, we call for peace, not for fighting with Israel.
We do not seek to fight with Israel
Fight against Israel
How did we agree?
What is the problem anyway?
We were allowed to speak with each other to overcome our differences.
Entice me with what Sheikh Saadah said that
provided that countries do not sell to each other
What do you mean?
means now
The street won't have mercy on us
Sheikh Saadah
Is what is happening today a continuation of a project that began sixty years ago with the Lebanon War?
Do you think there is a difference?
I do not believe there is any difference in goals
means Lebanon had a land that was liberated
The rest of the parts, of course, are under the UNFCCC. I assume it will be a deposit with the United Nations.
or similar
We have dealt with the Lebanese issue on a larger scale
Israel of course needs weak countries around it
Until you dominate and have the upper hand.
Obviously, in countries supported by foreigners
And that's why she wants to remain the only power in the region.
and they want
They change this example in Gaza
In Lebanon, how many sects do you speak with?
How many sides?
While Lebanon is drowning, Palestine is talking about one side only.
But I assure you that the Palestinians' problem is that they have listened too much to the Arabs and to foreigners.
Two parties, and from here emerged the conflict, with each side believing they can dominate the other.
What do you think, K K K, as an observer and follower?
According to the plan, it ends with a bone fracture
Do we, as Arabs, accept this? Because this example might be repeated with those who resist.
His opinion
Whether for Israelis or others in the future
We gave an example
The highest form of obedience and assistance in breaking the bone
I'm not saying that we, me and my cousin, are against the foreigner, but me and my brother are against my cousin.
We currently have no dispute with Hamas, and I do not claim that Hamas or any other party is infallible or above error.
Everyone makes mistakes
We must not let this issue pass.
on the kneeling side
The failure here won't be the failure of the group.
Sheikh Saadah from Qatar has been proposing suggestions for some time now.
And initiatives have been achieved in Lebanon
We'll talk about Darfur, we mean this topic, even briefly, in a bit.
We
We don't want to move to our brothers because sometimes there is sensitivity.
We don't have any objection if a country takes all these initiatives, as long as the issue is resolved.
We're not aiming to put Qatar on the top headline right now.
means that it was not one of the goals of His Highness the Prince
How can we stop this bleeding?
We will stop this tyranny
Beyond imagination
and we are in Qatar
We don't know anything they don't know, I don't think.
But the most important thing is to have the intention.
Honesty to reach a noble solution
Discussing initiatives means it is useful to know where the initiative stands regarding Darfur's Justice and Equality Movement
The Sudanese government in Khartoum
It will be special because it will solve the Darfur problem, as the Darfur problem started
The Arabs helped
But what are the results of the issue we have reached internationally?
We need to take revenge on the system, and now we have to dissolve the issue, but we don't know how to solve it.
We always strive, as you mentioned at the beginning, to implement the decisions. We are the best people to implement the decisions.
Are there also competition issues in the Darfur case?
What do I want to occupy in this position?
Before we conclude this conversation, Your Excellency the Sheikh, there is an economic summit.
Will this summit be held? Will you attend this summit?
We will ban the summit.
We hope it was held in a different atmosphere than the current Arab climate, but it is scheduled.
It would be a shame
If the Arab leaders attended this summit
When the blood of Palestinians was flowing in Gaza, and here they are gathering for financial and economic reasons.
Help with tagging
But it doesn't seem like anyone is afraid of this street.
What do you know about the circumstances, I mean of course we don't wish for anything to happen to us except safety.
We will be safe
But I mean, no one takes someone by their little hand
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.
Dear viewers, wherever you are, greetings.
What is the point of this celebration and how genuine are the statements of the High Commissioner for Human Rights?
People with disabilities are the group most exposed to neglect in the world.
And what about our Arab region and its level of interest in this issue?
We are posing these and other questions to our guest on today's episode.
The former United Nations Special Rapporteur on disability
She holds a Bachelor of Arts in Social Work and Sociology from Qatar University.
Similarly, a Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policies from the Egyptian University of Helwan
Occupied various positions in the field of people with disabilities
A founding member and the general coordinator of the National Committee for Persons with Disabilities
2098
Vice President of the National Committee for Persons with Disabilities 1999
up to 2023
Contributed to the establishment of the Shafallah Center for Persons with Disabilities
People with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest presided over the launch of numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
Activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world
Contributed through lectures and participation in seminars, conferences, and forums
Welcome, lady, to our episode.
The approved term is people with disabilities
In the beginnings, we used the term "disabled" in the eighties and before that.
Be more educational when
Those who provide them with that education.
In 1993, an important document appeared at the United Nations
Before we delve into the details, let's discuss this term.
The rest of the regions, although there are regions that are not or classified as developing and are classified as poor
Latin America, and particularly Latin America itself, is a reality where this trend may be stronger than in any other region.
However, statistics have shown otherwise.
The trend towards a rights-based approach is present in the Arab world, you can find it in many countries
It's possible that the resources are available and the political will exists.
Sure, here let me tell you some statistics that you might already be aware of.
Eighty percent of them are from poor countries.
UNESCO states that around 90% of children with disabilities in poor countries do not go to school.
How do you feel about these statistics?
She's very genuine.
I saw firsthand in Darfur, in Gaza, and in areas that experience such events like wars and conflicts
There is no difference between a disabled person and a non-disabled person; the numbers are large.
The illiteracy rate among girls, for example, is approximately 53% or 52%.
and in other countries
There are many obstacles preventing these children from reaching schools, even if they do not have disabilities.
The city doesn't even have any underground infrastructure, so even if that school existed, this child wouldn't find it.
He can reach it.
For the children and for other residents as well
Such projects and agendas sound wonderful, but we rarely hear about them in reality.
But when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated a few days ago, what is the point of this celebration?
The position in the world
The best employees are those who have no disabilities at all.
There are organizations that have arrived and established many projects
Implement a very important health strategy
Through this strategy
There is an overlap between the human condition and working with specific marginalized groups, such as people with disabilities.
The Arab world is currently at a high level of awareness.
At the point of awareness, we pause to receive connections and continue our conversation.
Thank you
I have two questions I would like to ask as it is a previously agreed agenda item at the United Nations.
The second point is what?
The United Nations laws that call for, for example, combating systems that cause disability to the child's community, such as building the Syrian intelligence system
Is there a law that allows me to file a lawsuit against the regime, as many people in Syria mean?
Yes, Sulaiman, your idea is clear. Sulaiman Karw, we have Naif Al-Saeed from Kuwait with us. Please, Naif.
Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and His blessings
And peace be upon you
Good evening
Good evening, please come in
I have an intellectual disability, if you'll permit me.
The Arabs say, "A free man understands a hint."
Glory be to Him who has given us speech and given speech to all things.
I've been sitting for more than thirty years, maybe I speak, you know, one or two words a day.
Glory be to God, may He make me speak.
He was sitting talking seriously and then I found out, I mean
This implies an attack on me, claiming that I exploit the Quran and that I am a hypocrite, intending to target people and so on.
They are pointing at me and calling me names, down in the lowest depths of hell.
I only got slander.
And they do not let the adulteress stray.
A house made of glass shouldn't throw stones at people.
and physical and mental disabilities
It is located within this definition, the question posed by Judge Solomon regarding
Programs of the United Nations or their reactions regarding the causes of disability, such as political objectives or others
Approach to various organizations and agencies
I apologize, to what extent
There are topics and issues of disability on her agendas in the sense
UNESCO is the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the reality is that these organizations actually marginalize disability
It is one of the programs that tries not to overlook children with disabilities
Appropriate opportunities and schools
From different environmental and other aspects
Also UNICEF
There are also shortcomings that we must admit there are shortcomings in the performance of the United Nations as well.
The main weaknesses and shortcomings that you mentioned are what?
For the United Nations
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
I was directly present in my hometown in the state of Qatar
But there was a routine and bureaucracy that hindered
Sometimes, I see it in particular during the limitations or shortcomings.
People with disabilities struggle and fight for recognition.
Until I reached a point that was somehow satisfactory, I did not put it in a separate subject as the International Movement for Disabled People wanted.
but it occupied a somewhat suitable part
Unfortunately, there is no agreement between them.
This is one of her most significant weaknesses
The survey that was conducted by the Special Rapporteur and applied to countries
Within the staff or among the employees of those programs
Unfortunately, we have only received three responses out of forty-eight organizations and agencies.
Do not put
The condition of being permanently, stably, and continuously disabled for many years, despite this condition being a first-degree human rights issue.
For the past couple of years, thank God.
The issue of disability is at least being raised through activities such as seminars and others
السلام عليكم
Why are there no binding laws and decisions regarding Arab countries, and who is responsible for implementing these international laws?
For Arab countries, for example, allocating salaries, such as allocating a salary for the disabled
Are there funds allocated by the United Nations?
Does this money go to governments or to offices specific to the United Nations, and does this aid actually reach the disabled?
Note that, in the end, there were no binding decisions regarding the Arab states.
Thank you very much, Ahmed Al-Halabi, for talking to us from Greece.
Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia, please meet Ibrahim
Wa alaikum assalam
And peace be upon you
Adopting this proposal

0.1% of the annual net profit
Let's go back to our guest to answer the callers' questions
He says that doctors advised him to undergo surgery but
It costs a lot and he can't afford this procedure, so where will he turn?
He is from Algeria
It is important to meet the needs of the other person.
Like any other rights, it means the rights of persons with disabilities
All these rights and duties, this citizen must certainly obtain.
To join the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this is a binding and legal agreement.
Satisfaction of the rights and needs of individuals within their national scope
or even at the level of non-governmental organizations
Binding on all states, with oversight to ensure the implementation of these laws
At least at the level of top management, there must be awareness.
So at least if we work on these documents in this way
Even if there is no significant commitment
Was there a response to the reports you were monitoring and was there interest?
But do not forget the rules, the standard rules are an ethically binding document, in reality, not legally.
To be committed and to believe in it
We understand that these issues will be resolved, discussed, or raised within the context of an audience facing many problems and challenges.
Naji Zakarnia, Director of the Qatar Deaf Center and sign language expert at Al Jazeera Channel
The matter begins with Mr. Ali extending his sincere thanks to Al Jazeera Channel.
Thank you for broadcasting this special episode.
I am very proud
She was a maid for all those with special needs in the place where she was and still is.
We support her and stand by her side always and forever.
I also say that there are many people with special needs
Some of them do not know this agreement because there were no training sessions.
Regarding it, especially if it is in schools, hospitals, or in government and private institutions.
My view is that this agreement should be published.
It is as if there is a law concerning people with special needs in all countries of the world
This is confirmed and it is incumbent upon the countries
I adopt this agreement and sign it.
Countries like Qatar and some others have signed this document with the aim of serving people with special needs and serving us.
Thank you very much, Naji. You mentioned Ali on behalf of us.
Thank you both very much
Your opinion might make a decision.
The former UN Special Rapporteur on disability might start with the proposal submitted by one of the callers, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia
Establishing a Support Fund
It is a donation box and accepts any contributions from abroad
This box is intended to fund the activities that the Special Rapporteur carries out when exercising
And even the Arab countries did not offer donations except for one country, which is Syria.
Therefore, fulfilling those commitments is a problem that exists in the United Nations
the box
Unfortunately, the major countries have not complied and have not paid attention.
Many people say this unfortunately, meaning that we don't care about the circumstances now.
It's a fact, the issue of commitments
Human Rights
The human in its general broad form
It doesn't matter.
But that is why those documents exist
If these countries fulfill their obligations, it's a good idea that the brother initiated.
It is essential that there is not only a separate, independent box in shape but also the organizations that already exist in the region.
Budget
Fundraising for disability-specific projects in Gaza
Assistance for people with disabilities
The issue is always intertwined, meaning political factors always intervene.
His state or government has greatly supported him.
Unfortunately, the number has decreased
For symbolic amounts
There is the father disabled
Of course, I withdrew my nationality from him.
The girl he had was a girl of her age.
Sometimes
Problems in teaching
We travel or go out, we're hit by a state of confusion.
Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and His blessings
And peace be upon you
We can
Rebuilding themselves with knowledge
I wish the Arab countries would allocate a portion of their budget
Thank you very much, Behjat Kravan, Behjat from Kuwait
Aisha Mohammed from Qatar, please proceed.
Wa alaikum assalam
And peace be upon you
Good evening to you and good evening to Sheikhah bint Khalifa
I just want to send her a thank you and appreciation message.
Over the past years
With our best wishes, we, the parents of children with special needs
In continuous support of their elderly shareholder
Welcome, the noble flag bearer of Tunisia
There is another level, which is genetic.
Believing that care at the genetic level reduces the percentage of disabled
In our Arab customs, a cousin always takes his cousin, his uncle's daughter, his aunt's daughter, and so on.
This refers to this level, which is the level of disability. Thank you.
The comment came in response to what was mentioned in the viewers' calls.
The truth is there is no such thing as what I said at the national level
Be aware that there are advisory and supportive programs
Located within the health services
under the umbrella of Hamad Medical Corporation
The Higher Council for Education also believed in the psychological clinic and the LLL programs in education.
I honestly don't know if the Special Education Department still exists.
But it is certain that it is within the health services. Yes, there is support and there are medical services.
and provides a taxonomy for these cases
Prevention is better than cure, and he pointed to the genetic factor of consanguineous marriage. Are there campaigns?
For example, to raise awareness
In this field
This is a very important and critical point.
And it is the only thing that I and others have touched upon in many words and many contributions.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns that are not only directed
Implemented by the World Health Organization
Similarly, for UNICEF
Currently, in many Arab countries, including Qatar
Confirmed Tunisia
The mandatory decisions for early examination are in effect now.
and which has been applied in many countries
All of this on the preventive side
Did such campaigns receive a response?
Positivity, especially when it clashes with habits and traditions.
Of course, that's the difficulty—it clashes with societal culture.
To be in a position to be in strategies to be in a will to confront it and commit to it
Early examination, for example, is a very important issue before marriage.
Are you asking if there are statistics about people with disabilities?
and especially for people with disabilities in the Arab region
Qais is the name of the Arab region, meaning that
and especially
With the recent events in the region
The regions and in conflict zones, in wars in relation to wars and conflicts and others
For every person killed, three people become disabled.
Events in Lebanon, in Darfur, in many regions
Never, no way, not enough, first the problem is me.
With human rights principles
There must be a means for people with disabilities, their programs, and plans.
Within the government and non-governmental institutions and organizations, there are already existing agendas.
In situations like those of wars or disturbances
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay
In the world, and more strangely, what the International Monitoring Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said about demographic statistics
This degree means that people with disabilities are not included in the general population statistics.
Not always declared
For example, in the state of Qatar, when the census was conducted, it was believed to be more than five years ago.
But honestly
with the cooperation of the device with the Planning Council and with the
The Council reaffirmed the fact with our participation as the Office of the Special Rapporteur.
More employment leads to more disability classifications.
The needs that are expected to be present in me
The quality of all these important details that must lead you to a result
Is there a disabled person or not?
Exactly, but at least
Somewhat, statistics are advancing in this regard
Wa alaikum assalam
Dear Madam, I thank you for this program and I thank Sheikha Hessa
But I thank and praise God that I am Qatari and receive this attention from my country, meaning
My daughter is now a student at an independent school and is receiving a good education, praise be to God.
I would like to thank Mrs. Hissa
And its motivating role and the role that makes us not fear or worry about our children
All praise, gratitude, and immense thanks to God and to those who support this category.
Thank you, thank you very much to Fatma Al-Dosari who spoke to us from Qatar. We remain in Qatar with Latifa.
Hello
And peace be upon you
Our dear sister, the actual and expected reality, which we hope will solve the problem of our stateless children.
Our Qatari children are the hope for the future.
I hope she responds to this question.
السلام عليكم
I bear witness to the services provided by the State of Qatar, particularly for the hearing impaired.
Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Program
The Supreme Council for Persons with Disabilities
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability
Civil society organizations such as the MGU or other communities
The reality and practice is that if I compare over five years
What was offered to people with disabilities five years ago and now
Thank you very much to our generous guest, Karim Nasim, who joined us from Jordan. Let's return to our guest.
of course the the
The community as a whole, its individuals, and especially families that have
Children with disabilities have big dreams and high expectations from life.
Whether at the planning level or at the executive level
However, regarding one of the points you mentioned, which is a very important one
Children who cannot obtain documents or otherwise, whether in Qatar or elsewhere
The international agreement, like many international documents
Commitment to translating it into plans and strategies
Automatically providing those services
Starting from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, sex, or sexual orientation
Sure, here is the translation: "Okay, sheikh, she participated as a special rapporteur before in the United Nations concerning disability. After six years of work,"
You both wish
Perhaps you didn't have the time. Perhaps the financial aid wasn't enough.
There are many achievements that have been accomplished and I am proud of them.
Through my participation, through the existing organizations, and through the government institutions in many countries
focused on the Arab region in particular
There should be more research and larger studies
We embarked on a global survey that yielded more than one report from us
Raising awareness is a continuous process that must be constantly and significantly worked on.
Coordination among Arab countries
Among themselves, persons with disabilities and their organizations, because they are
But they have a duty that must be fulfilled.
They fight for his sake
Thank you very much
Thank you
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode, I would like to thank everyone who shared their opinions and comments with us.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will meet with a new guest.
Join us with your calls and messages in a new episode of Live with Until We Meet.
Morning of the rose
I am very happy to have you with us
At the beginning, before we start and ask the different questions and get acquainted in this morning
Hello Shimaa, I can't, I'm busy
The entire Middle East deserves this global achievement
Qatar has indeed put us on the world map.
Thank you, Qatar
يا علي على تفضّل يا علي
أهلاً وسهلاً بكم.
Congratulations on the inauguration and to all the people of Qatar.
And God willing, as Sheikh Muhammad said, meaning
Before the dream and now, hopefully it will become a reality and work will start from today or from the announcement period.
You are expected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
I wasn't worried in this area, in this specific topic, even with strong files like America, Japan, Australia.
I'll be honest with you, I'm about 70% sure that I'm not the one who did it.
Our file is very heavy
View actually implements global charts and competes
We were the ones who were competing.
Why are you afraid?
But thank God, the Qatar file was indeed strong and deserved it.
It is true that the FIFA World Cup file and number 22 are hosted in Qatar
What does it mean for the philosophers themselves?
It will definitely bring them immense joy in this field, hopefully.
I want something like that. We were unsolving before the weather, but I wanted to listen to the weather like that.
At the moment of announcement
Where were you? How did you receive the joy? How was the shock? I don't know, tell me, tell me. You tell us and tell the viewers.
Radio
We're all with you.
Here is the translation: Draw in the announcement and high F
How I Healed Global Media
Check out the level of sports channels in general, no one has insisted especially the Arab countries, I mean, thank God, everyone has supported it.
Just an announcement that Qatar winning the right to host.
All Arab countries and it's not strange that this generous offer came from it, announced that it is ready to offer Qatar whatever is needed.
Volunteer Human Resources Available
Shimaa even at the level of external media
I mean, I went to celebrate, but it turned out badly.
Included them among those who were included was the French news agency, which was also photographed.
We also have meetings
means no one insisted at all Qatar became hello let me first daily you remember
Hundreds of times a day, from the smallest spot on Earth to the largest spot on Earth
I expect everyone will know Qatar, those who didn't know Qatar, it's all over the internet now.
The owner of the 2022 World Cup
Any footballer dreams of serving their country, of being part of the national team.
Of course, any player in the Qatari league would want to represent the national team.
That means something positive when one sacrifices themselves in matches
Even if Idris succeeds and makes it to the national team, he will put everything he has into it.
It means whether in exercises or in matches, because the team's logo is on his chest, so he has to give everything he's got.
By God, the officials did not fall short, whether in their attention to the players, especially the young ones. This means they teach them professionalism from a young age.
Food, sleep.
Tell me about your experience. You've played in more than different stages. How was your experience and what was the most important to you?
By God, it was, of course
From the grassroots to the first team
Train with clubs with the club with the national team
Every stage has its own unique character.
Yes, we're alright, thank God. You were like that, always moving around.
We've gotten used to you now, football.
Every time we see you, you're always like this. We like to take information from you and find out the sports news through you. So, what's the sports news with you?
I mean, honestly, we don't see much difference in terms of variety. With variety, we used to host stars but in their own fields, and we also host stars in sports.
Like Ali and others in their mathematical field
On the contrary, physical activity
How about us, we were the capital of sports
Qatar, welcome, we have become the capital of sports and world football.
Instead of when you are in variety shows, offer social, economic, and cultural programs.
You have different fields, you have soccer, basketball, different championships
After that, sports
Great, excellent
I wished I were a bird.
I wish I were 25 years old, I wish I were 10 years old.
F I hope that the young players have received a great opportunity and a bigger chance.
They hold it, like they say, in their hands.
Hey guys, hope you're all good. The word I want to address to the players is...
The young newcomers will hopefully have a bright future ahead of them, God willing.
Of course, I would love this opportunity and I must, I mean, take advantage of it.
This is a golden opportunity they say.
They need to take greater advantage of it.
ما الجديد معك؟ ما أخبارك؟ ما الجديد الآن من البرامج التي سأقدمها؟ أنا أعرف أننا شوي جبناج من الإجازة.
Tell us about your news, inshallah
Staying in constant touch with the event, hopefully we'll be ready for the Asian Cup in a month.
We've just finished the Gulf Cup in two days. Congratulations to the Kuwaiti national team on this occasion.
It's still available on Al-Akhbar, so with intuition, we're keeping up with intuition.
I'm definitely the first to think of Qatar TV, the first glimpse for viewers was through the Qatari screen.
I categorically deny this well-known fact.
Wa mashallah, they will convey the media message through various channels.
Private channels, sports channels, or any other channels
Happy Birthday, Qatar TV
We definitely wish you the best, always with God's will, success and we are still in this position
Firstly, I would like to thank the management of Al-Wakrah Club for
Fans of Al-Wakrah SC, who among
My childhood and I in the factory
A sheikh was with us yesterday. Sheikh Nasser was with us.
from the club
I am the son of Al-Wakrah and the boy of Al-Wakrah
Just like we did before this professional program
Applies to every individual in the State of Qatar
Young people, we all know that young people love sports and are addicted to them just like that.
How can we get a sports enthusiast into the social arena?
Media awareness at the first degree means that the media has a very important role in spreading sports in various magazines. Let's make sports a way of life.
You have young people who are addicted, but currently, sports have started to enter schools. Sports awareness has become a part of schools.
Do you have any sports events to celebrate? They organize celebrations for them.
You've got the Qatari street, meaning we see our kids walking the signs on the streets as well, these are considered sports awareness.
The female element, depending on what it specializes in, may have a place in the stands or anywhere else.
Women's awareness or let's have a sports anorak for women's participation in the sports field
After that, we will have a Qatar women's national football team.
I imagine that, thank God, sports seem to be expanding
I also expect that the time period
To carry out many and varied projects on the topic of sports and I expect this period will be sufficient
If you study correctly and work correctly
Hey, that's enough and it's the same thing that we must take advantage of properly, just like that.
After that, in a nutshell, I wanted to take advantage of how the younger generations can take advantage of the team.
All capabilities, expertise, and equipment are available
It's also important in his job that we, thank God, in Qatar, this thing is very well known among the Gulf and Arab communities that they love sports a lot.
How can I attract this audience to follow sports news permanently on the internet about the matches happening in Qatar?
and to the attendees at the same time
Most Qataris love sports, they love football, but the problem is the weather.
You'll find that there's more attention, especially in forums dedicated to certain clubs or where the majority are fans of specific clubs.
Great interest in football in the league
You as a player, you as a Qatari citizen, what is the solution that you feel could attract you to distance yourself as an athlete, distance yourself as a player?
How can your friends in the neighborhood watch the matches?
He depends on himself, meaning like a general thought or something
Some of them like to read on television or mean gatherings.
means, for example, Japan Japan has implemented a larger plan to attract the public on a larger scale to attend
عندما تحضري المباريات بجمعي نقاط ما بعرف شو يعني عم بيسوا هلا ليلاؤوا حلول ف انشالله When you prepare the matches with all the points, I don't know what they mean. They are just making things up. Hopefully, there will be solutions.
the Arabic
The most important point for every player will hopefully be in Qatar, especially in the 2022 file, what do you think we need?
What's the most important thing that actually needs improvement, not just material support?
Providing the means that can be provided to the generation that truly deserves to be called the Qatari team and participates in the biggest World Cup.
The time when he said the scheduled time has almost ended. When did I think of a rule to say when? Mashallah, the time is up, hurry up with the sweets.
Making the impossible possible and turning the dream we thought impossible into reality, but thank God, we are living it, welcome to the land of reality.
It's as if Sheikh Mohammed is moments away from celebration, but the work has just begun.
Insha'Allah, the 22nd of February will be an event worthy of Qatar's name
I congratulate every person on Earth, especially in Qatar, and I say honestly, Qatar has now become a landmark among the world's landmarks.
222
Thank you for the elegant press release, Lana. We wish you all the best, inshallah. I will always follow you to benefit from your knowledge.
Thank you so much, I'm definitely happy with the prince's eyes.
Qatari Youth Talents
And continuing, they will unveil a new collection of songs during this period.
But in the form of a question on the website Music and Fast Beat
and a group also from rap enthusiasts, God willing
Be with us, our viewers, and let's start our journey from this moment. Good morning.
We try to cast a glance at it
In short, we can define rap as fast vocal music.
Performs it with a stutter, not a fast rhythmic singing of the song's lyrics
Comprising a large number of rhymes, it addresses various topics and diverse issues
and which may sometimes be a person
Political Emotional Meeting
often controversial
and largely free
Our rapper viewers do not sing the song's lyrics
He repeats it
and is reflected in his voice as a secondary factor
The voice is generally not important in rap songs.
and that's why he's not called a singer but a rap performer or rapper.
The rapper addresses the following racism in the songs
For example, the flow of synchronous streams, for example, or the broadcast.
The sad follow the sad, The sad are their audience, The sad love them.
They've got a unique rap style
I expect they'll give you a bigger and better idea than I can personally.
Good morning, Hala
By God, first of all, it was a period when he liked that we do something new.
We stand out for something
Why can't we sing rap?
After that, rap means an art form that exists in every country in the world.
Not available in Egypt
We said, so we invent something new
We'll give him an idea of it in a message
In it, I speak about the negatives and positives that occur in our society.
It means that first, we receive a message, and second, it's like a shroud, you know.
This art is one of the diverse arts, and perhaps this information means that it has addressed many social and psychological problems among the youth on a larger scale.
Every time I expect changes, and as time changes, I expect.
He was a bit weak due to his illness.
We sang from the five hundred and five, the taghrib was weak at the beginning.
We say about ourselves that the new beginning for us is 2010.
In ignorance and more popularly
She likes to try singing and adopt the same rap style during this period. She noticed this.
A lot of people probably agree.
Also in his work, we will talk about it, they established such a group
A beautiful band, they have a lot of concerts. We can talk about this band.
How was it founded and how did the idea come about that one person can actually create a band and how many of you are there?
And God, in the beginning, we mean before the team was established
The rapper reached Doha, meaning he started in the fifties.
Everyone means they love the idea of rap, that he sings rap, he was singing, he would go on the website
I go down, Salman goes down, so-and-so goes down, so there's competition.
We got to know people
We have become competitors to each other.
After that, after some time, meaning after all these years, we reached the year 2010.
There was a system of groups, like this group for this condition, so three or four together
We've finally decided that we should all be one group under the name Rappers Tar.
He's a lazy MC.
We've agreed on this, it's settled. We all said in one voice that we're all in this together, hand in hand.
We went out, meaning we represented this thing and said the idea is the same.
Approximately twenty-five percent
Five and twenty W's, Mashallah, a large collection
Sure, here is the translation: "Okay, someone plays or everyone performs rap songs."
He is the one who arranges and he is the one who composes.
You can say something personal
How is that number sorted by the group? Excellent, how are the twenty-five sorted?
Everyone is for themselves, they have their own capabilities.
Every member of the group can create a complete song
Without seeking help from anyone else
But it's possible that the skills differ, for example, if Salman is better than me
I hear her saying, "No, the words are just comforting, nothing else."
One can adjust for the other.
Sure, I can help a little.
Until there is an official body that adopts these actions or even a company that you sue
and it will have healthy distributors
It means that the work should appear as such, with a certain style, meaning sophisticated, and it should indeed be something formal for you.
We swear, we hope for real, we hope for support, that they support us, they say, "Tina, a company that builds," they tell us, "Come on, we'll go produce an album for you."
We don't have any problem, I mean
Some things are a bit difficult.
Therefore, why don't you think the first initiative should be from you?
Even a single person can recognize the first CD.
You might attract partners later.
2007 I made a CD
May He distribute it among the youth.
الاقبال كان كبيرا
By Allah
Text text for the two thousand and seven perhaps I grill rap what what can continue with strength in the Gulf
I can't do that anymore now.
We were preparing Insolv to not go out, meaning for example you hear a large group of young people between Valencia and Chiastau.
Let's talk about it
They told us we'll arrange a party for you.
It means covering all costs and all procedures, and the coordination was good, and the work was, to be honest, we didn't expect it to be at this level.
We had a great time, honestly, and it was amazing work.
There was a bit of pressure, I mean there were no ads, there was nothing, just the party.
There was nothing in the ads, nothing at all, two days before the party.
We said, like, no one was going to come, like, two days before the announcement, no one was going to come.
So, we're inside, right before the party starts
This means that's a point in our favor.
It means that our voice reaches families, not just the youth.
Our perspective is that the idea is simply a right that belongs to the youth
We've realized at this stage that there are, like, multiple, like, groups, like, listening to us.
In a certain specific song, there was a big interaction with the audience and the band.
But most songs had interaction
Most of the songs weren't familiar, but there were a lot of songs and we were a large group.
The group completely in English
What are the words like to address different issues
We're talking about the situation we're in, but it came suddenly.
Cook on low heat, even if it takes a long time.
Even if they have spoken before, it wouldn't be me.
You need to generate random sentences
It means that the rhyme comes out
means criticize disbelieved in it we write this no to write this word this better
Sure, here is the translation: "Okay, we have a song, let's check it out."
One of the songs you made
I'll continue and see what the public thinks about this topic as well.
I hope they also enjoy such words
Thanks for liking the introduction as it contains my program's name
With you, KD and DJ Mister Bobo on the program Sabah Al-Duhail
Good morning ladies and gentlemen
This is Mr. Bobo and this is Mr. T. One hot to be.
Don't forget the program starts at nine-fifteen in the morning, meaning everyone should be sitting in front of the TV.
With us in preparation Hassan Na'ama With us in presentation Sheema Al-Hammadi
With us in the studio is Nasser Al-Malki, the host of the episode, Rabeez Qatar, of course.
It really contains the name Al-Bashir. Thank you, guys. May God grant you well-being. I am
I applaud you and the right of youth is above the control room
She was recorded last night.
Who made the words in you or who
Everyone writes their own words
If I were to write words about Yusuf
Love of singing, love of emotion
I expect you have to write about the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup, I think you might be able to enter them, right or wrong?
We're definitely doing it for ourselves, meaning we're definitely releasing a song, so in this matter...
But I don't have to be formal or anything, I'll just mess around.
You'd expect there to be Qatari songs about the homeland and love for the homeland.
Hip-hop, yeah, that's the art of rap, right?
Yes, I expect that today everyone is waiting for
We're seeing it live right now
The cup, of course, arrived and adorned the streets of Doha.
Our viewers, as we have seen, Doha is dressing up to welcome the Asian Cup.
All concerned devices have completed all arrangements to be ready for reception.
The cup and it's expected that there will definitely be a larger crowd than what we've seen.
I expect the length of the corniche from start to finish before frying
Sure, here is the translation: "Of course, it's important to welcome this important sports event."
In upcoming events, hopefully, I will follow them in the coming days, hopefully.
We heard that you said you would organize a party for us
Things are still a bit complicated, you know.
The procedures are definitely in place.
I saw Yusuf and I saw so-and-so, for example.
I saw some people who have fathers, I have a song assignment. I saw the three of them.
Amanasbin has the right to the song
The possibility that we can sing
I am sitting at home
I'll smash him right to Yusuf Alaaimail on the net
You have the part of the song, Yusuf.
They traveled abroad for leisure.
We enter this field and they have, meaning, millions of fans
We're not trying to copy, but one hears what's best.
A strong competitor with his style
What's stopping me from taking their ideas and copying them on things?
Flip it, take the idea, change it, and apply it to my song in a second form.
They made a special group for the hum and now they have more than one CD per person.
Talk about a person named Abdullah Aldail
He has the experience and the ability to discover groundwater.
The ability to detect groundwater sources.
A resident of the city of Marrat
There are many experienced people
Locate water sources before drilling wells
And it may require or may dig many wells and there is no water
With the help of copper rods or pomegranate branches
The presence of fig trees can indicate the location of water sources.
What tools are used?
Groundwater Discoverer
This is the old one
but now they have been replaced with copper probes
Place the two rods parallel to each other using a clamp.
Let's walk now at a leisurely pace, a light walk.
We see as we pass by a watercourse
The two doors will open
We are currently crossing this stream.
It has now opened in this way
When we exceed, it begins now
in the middle of the stream
and and of the and from here will be the middle
We can now determine the course of the water pipeline or the water pipeline under the ground using this method.
The process is repeated multiple times at multiple locations until we find the strongest site.
asserts Abu Ibrahim
Reaching an advanced stage in this profession
To be very precise in his discoveries
In the region sometimes and outside sometimes in Shqra and in Ahreimleh and in Athithiya
More than 150 wells have been discovered.
The error rate was not more than five percent.
You need training, experience, and a gift from God, glorified and exalted be He.
Outperforming advanced devices and modern laboratories
In a very short record time
Abdulrahman Al-Murshid
Good Morning Doha Program
Riyadh's sister city in the northwest
We followed up on this report and promise you, inshallah, with other reports from Arab and international countries.
إن شاء الله
We have joined you now, viewers, in Manshetat and different addresses, but they all share the same meaning.
The Big and First Title
I expect there will be a large number of Gulf youth in the Gulf itself.
In certain people, you look up to them
But it doesn't mean, for example, that you should imitate them, but you should feel the need to follow their work first.
They are generally the best team in the Gulf, with strong bonds among them.
It means I'm not competing in competitions, I mean I released a song.
I will talk about the topic
It means being competitive, as you say, in a targeted way.
There will be a connection between us, but only with one specific person.
In Saudi Arabia, Qusi is doing well, Mashallah.
He became very famous, had his own CD, and gained his own fan base.
He ended up with more than one company that could adopt it
We hope you have reached this stage, and perhaps even surpassed it, God willing.
Insha'Allah, we wish you all the best with the permission of Allah the Almighty through this group.
Sure, here is the translation: "It's available, of course, and the reception of this important sports cup, the Asia Cup, let's see the clips available on the corniche."
In addition to a group of Qatari youth
Moving west but with a Gulf style
Also emotional songs, rap songs, and a distinguished band of twenty-five people
It's essential to follow your news first thing in the morning.
I expect you must have an email, a specific website on the internet, or a forum.
How can one reach you?
God, there was a time when we had our own special website
but there were some problems with the company, the employment company
He meant sometimes drunk, sometimes not knowing what.
We faced some issues with it and finally, we got tired of it.
The site is definitely down.
What's the alternative now until you solve this problem, as a team?
In the UAE, or Saudi Arabia, or Bahrain, or Jordan, or even in Morocco, or in Egypt.
You should keep in touch with us, let us know your news, and show us the songs you produce from time to time.
What's the alternative now?
Currently relying on specific pages
What exactly is your name?
He is a software engineer at Google
Qatar Rap or Qatar Rappers
You create video clips even for your statuses
We worked on the program yesterday
We've uploaded more than one video to YouTube.
Song and pictures
A song and the same shape in the form of a video, but with pictures in the background.
I expect that you will develop even more.
You need a place other than everyone having their own device at home.
nuts, computer, piano, guitar
I swear, honestly, I really hope we get some support.
means for example a company means
We produce CDs for you
I'll make a special place for you.
From ourselves
But in the end, it's still our personal business.
We don't want it to be personal.
By Allah, my words do not differ from the words of Yusuf.
We need a video clip.
The album
The spread of the video clip is very important, I expect.
To convey information more effectively
If there is support, everything comes with it
Your sweet voices reach everywhere
is considered one of the different arts that address problems and treat cases
Thank you to Yousef Al-Nuaimi and Salman Al-Abdullah for joining us
We see it and we wish them, of course, all the best. In the name of our program, Good Luck for the Youth.
These projects were a blessing.
The XX project is almost ready, but it needs some further technical development.
End date Price
You've reached the cashier, you're at the total with all the details ready.
Get to know the beast by holding each of its parts, see its components and their effects
He was walking on the trolley.
The user can choose the material they want more precisely.
Of course, most projects come as a reflection of the child's feeling about a problem
He also has different activities and goals
The center is now a set of programs designed around a central idea.
We have ten objectives that Her Highness Sheikha Moza established for the foundation of the center.
It might be possible
He goes directly down to the underground, moves under the earth, gets on the underground train from his home.
The main idea is that it's about clothing.
Find all the stores in Qatar that have black t-shirts
The house key and the car key are in the same place. I have a button I press.
Where did you get the key from? Give it to me.
Sure, here is the translation: Yes, let's go back to the projects that you will hopefully carry out through the cultural center.
Early childhood education
Developing his skills and nurturing the gifted
We move between a set of children's skills, whether media-related or research-related.
The personal skills in public speaking are in persuading the audience
We create a dedicated program for each of these diverse skills to serve them.
We started with the future announcements and achieved a major milestone. Now, we have reached the final year projects and their completion.
We have also reached a large number of child speakers
Their innovation
You have some quite young presenters as well
Returned to television means and it is necessary that they offer children's programs
We're sitting, we're counting them for the TV.
Qatar TV
We'll finish with them in about eight and a half years.
Welcome to them, wherever they are.
National Television
Our need to attract, gain, discover these talents and develop them
Statement to Researcher
to special cases of thinking
To readers in many diverse fields
In such cooperation, your data takes on new ideas.
In every field, for example, the Khateeb Al-Waad program with the Ministry of Awqaf
The LLL we have inherited from previous generations, this too
The Scientific Club played a significant role in developing projects and also provided technical support for these projects.
The Supreme Council of Education also plays a major role, as well as their support for schools and partnerships.
Professor Abdullah, your move to Katara, this grand building
The one that also gathers a large collection of activities and amazing events
Is this considered a push to the center imam?
However, you are taking a separate building such and such.
Away from this grand edifice
We have a platform to interact with the public more easily, meaning
Innovative projects as well, very good
Hosting guests and introducing them to the nature of the cultural programs that offer programs for children
Our main project over these three years
The National Project for Developing Children's Reading
Under the patronage of Sheikha Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
She has adopted this project and provided it with enormous support.
This is a major project aimed at developing children's reading and storytelling skills.
Cultures that are related to reading in particular
There are, of course, many programs
We've recently moved.
Redefining the activities now means reorganizing.
Design and develop it in a way that suits the nature of your visitors, which often means a lot.
We definitely wish you all the best, Insha'Allah, through this center.
The one that gathers within it very important ideas
Of course, the first thing is to thank you for this generous hospitality
The more we interact with children, the more we discover about our own kids.
Children today are not like children of the past. Their childhood is not like ours was.
They require us to give more attention, focus, and time.
Give him enough listening to his interests and his imagination.
I continued to engage with him intellectually.
They work, meaning their way of dealing with their children is like a hotel that provides accommodation.
It is a bank that offers him money.
He is a child who lacks someone to listen to these ideas, to listen to this imagination.
We actually lived, they moved us now during the past days to the exhibition, they moved us to twenty-thirty.
Through this exhibition
We wish all the awarded projects good luck, God willing.
Thank you for joining us, Professor Abdullah Al-Jumaily, Director of the Cultural Center for Childhood. We wish you all the best, inshallah.
Even these projects become a reality and exist in real life, not just a dream forever.
Welcome, viewers. The Cultural Center for Childhood concluded its activities at the Diplomatic Club on the evening of Monday.
National Exhibition for the Dreams of Generations under the slogan "Dreams of Generations, Facts of Tomorrow's Homeland"
which was organized on the occasion of the country's National Day with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar's children
Our viewers witnessed various activities and different competitions
Innovative projects for children
We are pleased to welcome our viewers, Professor Abdullah Al-Jumaily, Director of the Cultural Center for Childhood. Good morning and welcome.
Good morning, my dear sister, may God protect you
Thank you for taking the time to participate
Speaking about this distinctive event is a reality
We are also pleased to have you join the program to cover, to the extent possible, all the events that took place during this exhibition.
This National Vision for Future Generations
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Of course, this is the exhibition.
Contribution of the Cultural Center for Childhood
Celebrating National Day
And he had, of course, a very significant stop. He had a very important touch with every child.
To enable children
He lives with a dream
With the project
This project or dream
The dreams of children are vast.
Its scope is wide, we defined it within the desired framework: a diameter of twenty to thirty.
Other key areas for Qatar National Vision 2030
We begin by training the children in four stages
How brainstorming techniques and a set of tools expand a child's thinking scope
What exactly do you mean by this sentence?
Facts of the Homeland Tomorrow
What our children dream of today
This project grows with this project
It was true, meaning this is the explanation for this vision that children start living from this day.
A big dream
Environmental field, health and human development field, and other fields
serving the homeland
I expect that when we know there are children in a certain place
He is in a certain state
Was all of that there?
There were guests of honor at the event
Honored guests are those who children can learn from as role models.
The Arab fall last week or three
He was also among the winners of various awards in the Arab world
There was a table to present their projects
Yes, and the pictures definitely mean evidence of your statement, Professor Abdullah.
This is a collection of photos that were present at the exhibition and various events.
This is also the owner of the last project, the forest owner.
The inventor or the creative one
This is one of the children's innovations, Mashallah. It's a very beautiful idea. We can make it more enjoyable for the viewers.
We'll tell you the story. What exactly is this thing? The colorful ball.
Four or five projects roughly addressed this topic, one of which was Colorful Ball.
He also called it the Smart Stadium.
This ball, if you kick it out of the field
It changes color
We expect to return in a bigger way in future matches, inshallah.
What's next after these dreams, I mean?
It also relates to something that concerns his interests
I expect that, especially when there are responsible icons, they will consider these small projects from small minds.
But we don't know if these projects actually serve us. Okay, here's the head of the Qatar Football Association.
Our opinion is that we agree with the idea of the colorful ball.
Yes, I love the idea.
Very expensive to visit him, of course, and he stopped at the projects that he hated.
Road stop. And these projects are built at the moment.
A great opportunity for Al-Ma'aridh at this moment and to establish these projects
The public also gave voice to a large number of projects submitted by our children
Dear friends, so what are the projects that we can say had a bit more spotlight and speak up about
Sure, here is the translation: Of course, we have the main evaluation method in the evaluation committee.
These are the projects that won the awards: the first, second, and third projects.
She came from the forest and won the first prize
He has very precise details about the project and the project was ready to start.
means, besides administrative of course, needs many administrative aspects
I delved into many very detailed aspects and distributed them in the visitor's brochure as well, meaning it was ready for her project.
These are definitely the pictures we are sitting to watch
This is a collection, yes this is a collection, also many projects I participated in
Maybe they feel like they have something, I mean it's not like they're just sitting around watching movies or cartoons.
It is not actually linked, but part of it may be realized by institutions that have adopted it.
For example, what are these project names?
Here's how you can benefit from za'ida at home, how to dispose of, collect, and reuse it:
47 students
The State of Qatar celebrated the graduation of 337 students from the 33rd batch yesterday.
His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al-Attiyah, Minister of State for International Cooperation
A large number of guardians and preachers of the educational body
The university celebrates today the graduation of seven hundred and twenty-seven students.
Of course, we thank our colleague Salman Al-Mujaddid, and we will remain in the same artistic atmosphere. Today, we will have a dear guest with us.
From the series of episodes by artist Abdul Hamid Al-Sharshani
Confirmed his presence with many works, including the series "Hearts for Rent"
They toil to prove themselves on the artistic stage.
Artistically speaking, there are no compliments
From which it means
Hello and welcome, viewers. Good morning and I hope you had a good night's sleep.
On the contrary, the program is much better in Cast truthfully.
I'll see something very simple from one of your works and start with the dialogue with you
You're laughing at me

We ask for your participation this year in the second part
I'll tell you a bit about my roles that I loved in the series "Tasanif". Each episode has a different topic.
What does your participation tell us about you?
Of course, after

The pearl that poets have sung about throughout time
When history is a witness and remains in the memory of cities

It is said that he is attributed to Imru' al-Qais of the Tamim tribe.
Excelling in its springs, the sweetness of its water, and the pleasantness of its air.
Sung by poets, enchanted by her, her fame is linked to her renowned mountain, Kawa.
It is said, Ghadir Khumm
Of course, the city of Marat is an ancient city.
And before the advent of Islam
There were ancient things whose history was unknown, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.

This was the reason.
A series is being made, and all Qatari artists will work in it.

Less common side effects include joint and bone pain, headaches, thyroid issues, and weight gain.

Be keen on truthfulness and be keen on caring for others. You were created to be a servant of Allah.
To serve people, that's the first thing. The second thing is, I'm not a religious scholar or a sheikh, I'm an ordinary human.
Thank you, Professor Abdulaziz, I appreciate this pleasant meeting. Of course, thank you to our guest who is with us.
May Allah give you a thousand blessings. InshaAllah, and may you succeed, O Lord.
His Excellency Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of Public Health at the Supreme Council of Health, will elaborate further.
Good morning, Sheikh
Let's start directly by looking at these activities
The Truth: A Healthy Steps Program Towards Qatar
It is a program that is one of the components of the national strategy for the treatment and combating of obesity
Four of the world's ten most obese countries are from the Gulf.
We have started at the Supreme Council of Health with a strategy, of course, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and other entities, to combat obesity.
Fear of its further spread, Mr. and Mrs. Soon
Steps towards Qatar for a healthy lifestyle
Work together on this competition and it will be an international competition.
The program consists of six weeks
Every week is different from the next.
Raising awareness among seventh and eighth grade students about the importance of health at this age
They seem to understand themselves at this age, as it's the beginning of their life.
The first week, as you may remember, was about what your favorite fruit is.
Week two walking
You have to walk, so of course every time you walk, you earn points.
It's like a map of Qatar, and every time you collect points, you take a step forward in your journey, a step forward in your life.
There will be a nice competition among the students
During the third week, he drinks only mineral water and sparkling water.
Drinks May instead of many carbonated waters. Whenever you're thirsty, take May. I don't drink May.
Next, we have the fourth week your favorite sport
Some of them like playing games at school.
We're looking for a sport he loves.
To make him exercise.
The boy is eating a healthy meal
His family knows that he needs to make sure his son eats a healthy meal.
and Al Jazeera Academy, a boys' and girls' academy, to take
Of course, this is the same eye with its success, God willing, we will increase the experience in the coming years.
Of course, the students are bored, I don't know how they feel, they say our activity is more.
We had more fun playing games with our classmates.
Girls say their skin has improved, acne has lessened.
Correct, correct, exactly, that's when he becomes aware.
Parents know about their children
And their colleagues in the second rows say, "What's up?" and they learn from them and their colleagues and the brothers.
Praise be to God, it has started to spread that there are many enthusiastic schools that will participate in the upcoming year, starting now.
Insha'Allah
Of course, the official sponsor was QUT in supporting this
We had an Espoir Zone that provided sports competitions for students and awareness.
Knock knock knock on the dining table means
ف الحمد لله، عده جهات يعني منها، يعني، يعني هذي ذكرتها، و في بعذها يمكن فاتتني Translation: Firstly, all praise is due to Allah. Several parties are involved, including those I have mentioned, and perhaps there are others I may have missed.
But thank God, everyone contributed a part from themselves.
Some of them, the brothers, used to have competitions on Saturdays.
There was variety
We tried to create several types and include as many people as possible
The generation of the future
To ensure that this experience reaches or spreads to as many people as possible in Qatar
You're staying for the first time, so there are a few things you might want to adjust.
After its widespread use, praise be to God, now the results are positive.
Insha'Allah, we will publish it because there are people now demanding, saying why haven't you included us?
You've finished eating healthy food, so you've reached this point. What's the problem?
When we reach this age, starting from a young age, he will reach puberty at the age of twenty or twenty-five.
You mentioned a set of titles each week that had a title
If we go back, we will try in our segment today to be about the conclusion of the activities
But also, if we go back to remind people, in our program, we had more than just hosting.
We go back, we repeat, and we go back every week with the information we want to reach the students
Insha'Allah, my sister, first of all, for example, the favorite fruit in the first week
Sure, here is the translation: Of course, fruits in general, a part about the fruit, what are its benefits?
What is the benefit of fruits that contain vitamin C?
He starts to figure out what he likes in fruits, not all fruits are his enemies, you know.
It could mean that he might be allergic to one or two types, but why can't he eat the rest?
The second week people think walking is just for little kids, why do they walk?
I mean, when I grow up, I walk
On the contrary, you walk because it guides the mind and the brain.
Walking helps to relax the mind, meaning mental clarity improves.
You were hitting them as the students walked.
Not all of them are required to walk, whether at school or at home.
They record their points through grade schools.
Because they are like, not every day, you know.
This was an event where people organized a march. The girls' school organized a march.
We want to be creative, meaning we have innovative ideas.
The competitive spirit and teachers bring forth new ideas. How can we give them ideas that they can build upon?
Everyone had their own skills in this area
Of course, in the third week, we drink water, of course, all the time. We try to drink it so we don't get thirsty and crave to have sparkling water.
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite sport.
If we can reach his favorite sport and support him in it
He is passionate about sports.
He loves sports, he's just playing it, he's just playing sports without realizing.
As we previously discussed, we will talk about the Qatari Association for Multiple Sclerosis Patients
Let me welcome our guest for today's episode, who is lighting up our studio.
Welcome, you are most welcome.
Welcome with us in this program
And there is this disease, which perhaps many of us have not heard of
In the beginning, as Egyptians say, I'll get straight to the point.
It's a chronic disease
Affects the nervous system in the human body
Affects individuals aged between 20 and 40 years.
This disease also has no known cure at the moment and no known cause for this disease or its infection.
The active group in society, which is the youth, is usually affected.
Cancer treatments used to keep you away from evil and other diseases
This refers to inflammation of the nerves in the brain and the spinal cord.
It is the central nervous system in the human body.
The body is near another body.
The neuron is composed of
This cable covers the electrical wiring.
White blood cells, first of the leukocytes, kill or dissolve the insulating layer.
This leads to the absence, weakness, or disruption of the nerve signal.
Keep far from evil.
To this day, despite the advancements in medicine and the progress of medical science, Professor Abdulaziz, we have not yet found a cure for this disease.
Sure, here is the translation: "Okay, apart from the solution, let's see how we can approach this, I mean."
Also, one must have precautions regarding this topic.
The direct cause means the nature of life, the nature of food, the circulations of life.
The exact direct cause that makes a human susceptible to this disease.
All that exists currently are theories.
By virtue of marriage
They try to solve the health problems that humans face now
Yes yes
These topics may stir up some controversy within society.
We still don't know the reasons.
The age group that can be affected by this disease, multiple sclerosis,
both genders
Of course, after reaching forty years, the disease begins to calm down with the person.
But so far, we have not found a cure for this disease.
Does this imply that there were actually many people in the Gulf, the Arab world, or even let's say in Qatar?
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, statistics indicate that there are twenty-five thousand cases.
and also Qatar means
I personally became aware of three to four very specific cases recently, just in the past week alone.
Currently, we have 25 cases registered in the records.
Many people, when diagnosed with this disease, turn to treatments from other countries.
Are you saying, Professor Abdulaziz, are there some effects, for example, on a person who contracts this disease?
Are there any signs that indicate to the family of the affected person or to the person himself that he has multiple sclerosis?
It seemed that this virus would wipe out
It seems like it's a virus
The nervous system is the control center of the entire body.
Let's head somewhere or give a specific reason for a specific place, like, by God, the nature of food and, by God, the nature of coffee.
Please provide the text you'd like me to translate.
