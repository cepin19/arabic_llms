Who is the greatest?
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Then Jesus called a little child to Him, and set him in the midst of them.
He said: "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
"And whoever receives one such child in my name receives me." A warning about stumbling blocks
"But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for them if a large millstone were hung around their neck and they were thrown into the sea."
Woe to the world because of offenses! For offenses must come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh!
Therefore, if your hand or foot leads you into sin, cut it off and throw it away from you! It is better to enter eternal life with one hand or foot than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.
"And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you! For it is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire." The Prodigal Son
Jesus said, "See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven."
For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.
What do you say about a man who has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray? Does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountain and go in search of the one that strayed?
I tell you the truth, when he finds it, he will be more happy with it than with the ninety-nine sheep that did not go astray.
Thus also, your Father who is in heaven does not want one of these little ones of mine to perish. Reconcile with your brother.
"If your brother sins against you, go and point out his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over."
But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. #two or three. 16:18 See Deuteronomy 19:15.
If they refuse to listen to them, tell it to the church. If they refuse to listen to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
"I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. Whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
I tell you the truth, if two of you agree on any matter, whatever you ask for, my Father in heaven will do it for you.
"For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them." Unlimited Forgiveness
Then Peter came to Jesus and said to him, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
And Jesus said to him, "Not seven times only, but up to seventy times seven!" #Seventy... times. 22:18 That is, without limit.
Therefore, the kingdom of heaven can be compared to a king who decided to settle accounts with his servants.
When he began to settle his accounts, a man who owed him an enormous sum was brought to him. #An enormous sum. 24:18 Literally: "Ten thousand talents or a hundredweight, which is equivalent to about 300,000 kilograms of the currency used at that time."
And since he did not own what could pay off the debt, Mr. decided to sell the debtor with his wife, children, and everything he owned, and to use the price to pay off the debt.
At that moment, the servant knelt before the king and pleaded with him, saying: 'Grant me an extension, and I will pay you all the debt.'
The gentleman took pity on him, forgave his debt entirely, and let him go.
While he was going, he saw one of his fellow slaves, who owed him a small amount. He grabbed him by the throat and began to choke him, saying, 'Pay what you owe me.'
The servant fell on his knees before him, and pleaded with him, saying: "Give me time, and I will pay what I owe."
But he refused, instead he took him and threw him into prison until he paid all his debt.
When the other slaves saw what had happened, they were deeply saddened, and they went to inform their master of everything that had occurred.
"Then his lord called him and said to him: 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.'"
But should you not have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?›
And his master was very angry, and delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all that was due to him.
"In the same way, your heavenly Father will treat you, unless each one of you forgives his brother from his heart."
Marriage union
After Jesus had finished giving these instructions, he left the region of Galilee and went into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
And large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
And some Pharisees came to Jesus, testing Him and asking, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?”
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that from the beginning 'God made them male and female'? #Created … and female. 4:19 From Genesis 1:27, 5:2."
Then he said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.' #Leaves ... one. 5:19 from the Book of Genesis 2:24.
"And thus they are no longer two, but one. Therefore, let no one separate what God has joined together."
They said to him, "Why then did Moses command that a wife be given a certificate of divorce and send her away?" #Certificate of divorce. See Deuteronomy 24:1.
Jesus answered them, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.
"Therefore I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery."
Then his disciples said, "If this is the case between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry!"
Jesus said to them: "Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom God gives the ability to do so."
There are men who cannot marry because they were born without the ability to marry. There are men who cannot marry because people have taken away their ability to marry. And there are men who have chosen not to marry for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Let those who can accept this teaching accept it." Jesus welcomes the children
Then they brought him children to put his hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.
Then Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven."
Then Jesus placed his hands on them, and left that place. The obstacle of wealth.
A man came to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?"
Jesus answered him, "Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only One who is good. But if you want to enter life, keep the commandments."
The man said, "Which commandments?" Jesus said, "You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal.
Do not bear false witness. Honor your father and your mother. #Do not kill … and your mother. 19:19 From Exodus 20: 12-16, and Deuteronomy 5: 16-20. And ‹Love your neighbor #your neighbor. 19:19 By referring to the Gospel of Luke 10: 25-37, we understand that the intended meaning of 'neighbor' is every human in need of help. As you love yourself.› #Love … yourself. 19:19 From Leviticus 19: 18. »
And the young man said to him, "I have obeyed all these commandments from my youth. What do I still lack?"
Jesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
When the young man heard that, he went away sad because he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to His disciples, "Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
I tell you again, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When His disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and said, "Who then can be saved?"
And looking at them Jesus said to them, "With people this is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God."
Then Peter said to Him, “Behold, we have left everything and followed You! What then shall we have?”
Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, in the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
"And whoever has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake, will receive a hundredfold, and will inherit eternal life with God."
Many are those who will be the first to become the last, and many are those who will be the last to become the first.
Like seasonal workers
And the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is the owner of an estate, who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He agreed with the workers to pay them one dinar per day, then sent them to work in his vineyard.
He went out, the generous host, around nine o'clock, and saw some men standing in the market area doing nothing.
He said to them: "You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will give you the wage you deserve."
They went to work in the vineyard. "And he went out again around noon and also around three o'clock, and hired other workers."
And around five o'clock, he went out again and found others standing in the market area, so he asked them: "Why have you been standing all day without work?"
And they said to him, 'No one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You also go into my vineyard.'
"At the end of the day, the generous host told his agent: 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the one who came last and ending with the one who came first.'"
Those who had booked the hour came at five o'clock, and each of them took a dinar.
Then came those who were hired first, and they thought that they would receive more, so each of them also received a denarius.
They took it, and began to complain about the generous host.
They say: 'Those who were hired last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat!'
He said, the generous host to one of them: "I have not wronged you, my friend! Did we not agree on working for one dinar?"
Take your pay and go. For I wish to give the one I hired last the same as I gave you.
Do I not have the right to do what I want with what is mine? Or are you jealous because I am kind to others?
"In this way, the first will be last, and the last will be first." Jesus prophesies about his death and resurrection
While Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, he took the Twelve aside privately and said to them:
"Behold, we are going to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death,"
And they will hand him over to the unbelievers to mock him, flog him, and crucify him. But on the third day, he will rise from the dead. The greatest is the one who serves.
Then came to him the mother of Zbedi's sons with her sons, and she prostrated herself before him to ask him for something.
Jesus said to her, "What do you want?" She said to him, "Command that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and the other at your left, in your kingdom."
Jesus said, "You don't know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup #the cup. 22:20 the cup of suffering and agony. Also in chapter 23. that I am going to drink?" They said to him, "Yes, we can."
He said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right and left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom my Father has prepared them."
When the remaining ten heard this request, they were very angry with the two brothers.
Then Jesus called them to him and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them."
But this should not be among you. Rather, whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant.
And whoever among you would be first, shall be your servant.
"Likewise, the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many." Jesus heals two blind men
As they were leaving Jericho, large crowds followed Him.
And there were two blind men sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David."
The people rebuked them and told them to be silent, but they cried out all the more, "Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David."
They came to Jesus and he asked, "What do you want me to do for you?"
And they said: "O Lord, open our eyes."
And Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they saw and followed Him.
The king lives
And when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
He said to them: "Go to the village that is before you. You will find a young donkey tied up next to its mother. Untie them and bring them to me."
"Should anyone say something to either of you, reply: 'The Lord needs them, and will return them shortly.'"
It happened so that what the prophet said would come to pass:
"Say to the beloved city of Zion: #Beloved Zion. 5:21 Literally, 'Daughter Zion.' '<Behold, your king is coming to you, humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.>'"
The two disciples went and did as Jesus commanded.
And they brought the young donkey and its mother, and put their clothes on them, and Jesus sat on the clothes.
Most people spread their mats on the road. But others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
And the crowds that went ahead of him and that followed were shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" "Hosanna in the highest heaven!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred. And the people asked, "Who is this man?"
The crowds that followed him said, "This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus at the temple
Then Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them: "It is written, 'My house will be called a house of prayer' #My house ... prayer. 13:21 from the book of Isaiah 56:7. But you have turned it into 'a den of thieves!' #a den of thieves. 13:21 from the book of Jeremiah 7:11."
And some who were lame and blind came to him in the temple, and he healed them.
And when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children in the temple courts shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they were indignant. "Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him.
Jesus answered, "Yes; have you never read, 'Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise'?"
Then Jesus left them and went out of the city to the town of Bethany, and spent the night there. The power of faith
While Jesus was going in the early morning to the city, He was hungry.
And he saw a fig tree by the wayside, and he went to it, but he found nothing on it but leaves. He said to it, "You will never bear fruit henceforth." And immediately the fig tree withered away.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and asked, "How did the fig tree wither like this?"
He answered them, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what I did to the fig tree, but also if you say to this mountain, 'Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' it will be done.
"And whatever you ask for and believe, you will receive it." Doubting Jesus' authority
And Jesus went into the temple of God, and as He taught, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him, saying, "By what authority are You doing these things? And who gave You this authority?"
And Jesus answered them, "I will also ask you a question. Now tell me, by what authority was I doing these things?
"Where did John's baptism come from? From God or from people?" So they began to discuss this among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From God,' he will ask us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
"And if we say, 'She is from among the people,' we are afraid of the people, for they all consider John a prophet."
So they answered Jesus and said, “We do not know.” And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.” Parable of the Two Sons
Jesus said, "What do you think about this parable? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said to him, 'My son, go and work in my vineyard today.'"
The son replied: "I don't want to go." But he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to his other son and asked him the same thing. The son replied: "Yes, sir, I will go." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did the father's will?" They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
For John the Baptist came to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but tax collectors and prostitutes did. And even when you saw what they did, you did not repent and believe him. The parable of the vineyard owner's son
And listen to another parable: There was a man who owned some land. He planted a vineyard, put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress, and built a lookout tower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away.
When it was time to harvest the grapes, he sent his slaves to the farmers to get his share of the grapes.
But the peasants seized their slaves, beat one of them, killed another, and stoned yet another.
So the owner sent more slaves than he had sent the first time. The peasants treated them in the same way.
And finally, he sent his son, saying to himself, "They will respect my son."
But when the peasants saw that this was the son of the owner, they conferred with one another and said: "This is the heir. Let us kill him so that we may seize his inheritance."
They arrested him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
"What do you think the generous host will do to those peasants when he returns?"
They said to him: "He will deal with them terribly because they are wicked, then he will give the vineyard to other farmers who will give him the fruit in the season of harvest."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This is the Lord's doing; it is marvelous in our eyes'?"
"Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit."
"Whoever falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and it will crush anyone on whom it falls!"
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard these parables, they knew He was speaking about them.
Therefore they tried to seize Him, but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.
Wedding feast
And Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
And the king sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come.
The king then sent other servants and said to them, "Tell those who have been invited, 'Behold, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.'"
But the guests did not care, and each went his own way. One went to work in his field, another to his business.
But the rest seized the king's servants and beat them and killed them.
Then the king grew angry and sent his army, who killed those murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those who were invited did not deserve it.
Go, therefore, to the main streets and invite to the wedding banquet everyone you find.
They went out into the streets, and gathered everyone they could find, whether they were wicked or righteous, until the banquet hall was filled with guests.
When the king entered to see the guests, he saw a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
The king said to him: "Friend, how did you come in here without wearing wedding clothes?" But the man remained silent.
And the king said to his servants, ‹Bind him hand and foot, and cast him into the outer darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth.›
"For many are called, but few are chosen." The Pharisees are trying to trap Jesus.
The Pharisees went and took counsel together how to entangle him in his talk.
So they sent their disciples to him along with members of the Herodian party, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are sincere and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You do not show partiality to anyone, for you do not look at people's status."
"Then tell us what you think: Is it right to pay the taxes to Caesar or not?"
But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said to them, "You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?"
"Show us the money you use." So they brought him a dinar.
He said to them: "Whose image and inscription are these on this denarius?"
And they said to Him, "They are Caesar's." And He said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were greatly astonished and left him and went on their way. The Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection,
On that day, some Sadducees came to him. They are those who say there is no resurrection. They asked him:
O teacher, Moses said #Moses said. Deuteronomy 24:22 Look Deuteronomy 25:5,6. If a man dies and leaves no children, his brother shall marry his widow and beget a child who shall be reckoned to his brother.
There were seven of us brothers. The eldest got married and died. As he had no children, his brother married his widow.
And this happened to the first brother, the second, the third, up to the seventh.
After they all died, the woman also died.
Which of the seven will be the wife on the Day of Judgment? They all married her.
Jesus answered them, "You are mistaken because you do not know the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
Understand that in eternal life after the resurrection of the dead, people do not marry nor give their daughters in marriage, but they are like the angels in heaven.
But regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God has said?
"I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." #I am ... Jacob. 32:22 Exodus 3: 6. "And He is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
When the people heard this, they were greatly astonished at his teaching. The greatest commandment
When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
And a scholar of Islamic law asked him, attempting to trap him, saying:
"Teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the law?"
Jesus replied: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." #Love the Lord... your mind. 37:22 From Deuteronomy 6:5.
"Here is the first and greatest commandment,"
The second commandment is like the first: "Love your neighbor as yourself." #Love your neighbor. 39:22 By referring to the Gospel of Luke 10:25-37, we understand that the neighbor is every person in need of help. Just as you love yourself.' #Love your neighbor... yourself. 39:22 From the book of Leviticus 19:18.
The entire Sharia and the books of the prophets are related to these two commandments. Christ, the son of David.
And when the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them:
«What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?» The Pharisees replied, «He is the son of David.»
He said to them, "If this is how it is, how then did David call him 'Lord' when he said in the Spirit:
"Said the Lord to my Lord: Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."
" If David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?"
No one could answer him, and no one dared to ask him any more questions after that.
Jesus criticizes the religious leaders
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples
He said: "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat."
Keep and practice everything they tell you, but do not do their deeds. For they say, and do not do according to what they say.
They burden people with heavy loads, yet they themselves are unwilling to lift a finger to follow them.
All the righteous deeds they do, they do to be seen by others. They display their piety, but they have made their phylacteries broad. #their phylacteries. 5:23 Some Jews would write certain passages from the Scriptures, place them in small leather pouches, and tie them with cloth straps to their forehead or left arm, thus showing their religious zeal. And they lengthen the tassels of their garments.
They love to have the best seats at banquets and the front rows in assemblies.
They love to be greeted by people with special greetings in the markets, and to be called: "Oh, teacher."
"As for you, do not let people call you 'Teacher.' For you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers."
Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven.
Do not let people call you 'Sir,' for you have one Master, the Messiah.
The greatest among you should be your servant.
"God exalts those who exalt themselves, and He exalts those who humble themselves."
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to."
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Therefore you will be more severely punished."
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are."
"Woe to you, blind guides! You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold in the temple, they are bound by their oath.'
You fools and blind! Which is greater: the gold in the temple, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
"Ye say, 'If one sweareth by the altar, it is nothing; but if one sweareth by the gift that is upon it, one is bound by it!'"
O blind man! Which is greater: the gift on the altar, or the altar that makes the gift sacred?
For whoever swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it.
And if anyone swears by the temple, he swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the heaven, indeed he swears by the throne of Allah and by Him who sits upon it.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former."
Ye blind guides, ye strain out a gnat, but swallow a camel!
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence."
O ye blind Pharisees, cleanse first that which is within the cup, that the outside of it may be clean also.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean."
Thus you also appear righteous outwardly, but within you are full of hypocrisy and evil.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous."
And you say: "If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not have taken part in the killing of the prophets."
And thus you confirm that you are the offspring of those who killed the prophets.
Complete what your ancestors began.
O ye serpents, generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?
Therefore, I will send you prophets, wise men, and teachers. You will kill some of them, crucify some of them, and flog others in your synagogues. You will persecute them from town to town.
You will be held accountable for the blood of every innocent person shed on the earth: from the blood of innocent Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, #Abel ... Zechariah. 35:23 First and last to be killed according to time and text of the Old Testament books. (See Genesis 4:8 and 2 Chronicles 24:20) Killed between the temple and the altar.
I tell you the truth, the punishment for all these sins will fall on this generation. Jesus warns the people of the city of Jerusalem.
O Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you! How often have I longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing!
Your home will be left empty and abandoned for you!
For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' #Blessed ... the Lord. 39:23 From Psalm 118:26. »
Jesus prophesies the destruction of the temple
And Jesus went out and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.
Jesus said to them, "Do you see all these buildings? Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? What will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered them: "Be on your guard so that you are not deceived."
Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Messiah,' and will deceive many.
You will hear of wars and revolutions; do not be frightened. These things must happen, but they are not the end of the world.
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes,
But all these will be the beginning of birth pains.
And they will deliver you up to tribulation, and kill some of you, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.
At that time, many will abandon their faith. They will betray one another and hate each other.
And false prophets will appear, and they will deceive many.
And because of the increase of lawlessness, the love of many will grow cold,
But he who remains faithful to the end, he will be saved.
And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
When you see "the abomination of desolation" #the_abomination_of_desolation. 15:24 See Daniel 9:27, 12:11, and also Matthew 11:31. The one Daniel the prophet spoke of, standing in the holy place – to understand this speech –
Let everyone who is in the region of Judea flee to the mountains.
The one on the roof does not come down to take his belongings from the house.
And the worker in the field does not return to his house to take his coat.
"And how difficult were the conditions of pregnant and nursing women in those days!"
But pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath.
For at that time there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again.
But if the Lord had not shortened those days, no one would have survived. But for the sake of His chosen people, He will shorten them.
If anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or 'There he is!' do not believe it.
For many false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders to deceive the elect, if possible.
Here I have told you everything before it happened.
"Someone may say, 'Look, the Messiah is in the wilderness,' do not go out there. Or, 'Look, he is in the inner rooms,' do not believe it."
For just as lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
Wherever you find the body, you will also find the vultures.
Immediately after the tribulation of those days, ‹the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.›
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. Then the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
And he will send his angels with a mighty blast of the trumpet, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
Learn from the fig tree. As soon as its branches become tender and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
Thus also, when you see all these things, you will know that the time has come. 33:24 Compare with Luke 21:31. At the door.
I tell you the truth: This generation will not pass away until all these things have happened.
The heavens and the earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
But no one knows when that day and hour will be, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
"As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be when the Son of Man comes."
In the days leading up to the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving their daughters in marriage, right up until the day Noah entered the ark.
They did not know what would happen, until the flood came and took them away. So too will it be at the coming of the Son of Man.
At that time, two men will be working in a field; one will be taken and the other left.
And there were two women grinding at the mill; one is taken and the other is left.
"Be vigilant, for you do not know when your Lord will come."
Be assured that if the homeowner knew any hour of the night the thief intended to come, he would wake up and not let him raid his house.
Therefore, you also be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour you do not expect. The faithful servant and the evil servant
Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of his servants to give them their food at the proper time?
Congratulations to that servant who, when his master comes, finds him performing his duty.
I tell you the truth, he will entrust him with all his possessions.
The wicked servant says to himself: "My master will delay."
He begins by beating his servant companions, and starts eating and drinking with the drunkards.
And the master of that servant will come on a day he does not expect, and at an hour he does not know.
And He will punish him and place him among the hypocrites. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth.
The ten girls
At that time, the kingdom of heaven will be like ten young women who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them are stupid, and five are smart.
So the foolish ones took their lamps, but they did not take extra oil with them.
But the wise ones took extra oil in their lamps.
The groom was late, so all the girls got tired and slept.
But in the middle of the night, someone shouted: "The groom is coming, so go out to meet him."
Then the girls woke up and prepared their lamps.
The foolish ones said to the wise ones: "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are almost going out."
The wisemen replied: "We cannot, it is not enough for us. But go to the merchants and buy oil for yourselves."
While you were going to buy oil, the groom arrived. The virgins were ready, so they went in with him to the wedding feast. Then the door was shut.
"At last, the rest of the girls came and said: 'Oh sir, oh sir, open the door for us.'"
"But he said, 'I tell you the truth, I do not know you!'"
Therefore, stay awake, because you do not know the day or the hour when the Son of Man will come. Like the three servants
And the kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling, who called his servants and entrusted to them his possessions.
He gave one of them five bags #five bags. 15:25 Literally "weights or containers," and a weight is equivalent to about 27 to 36 kilograms of gold, silver, or copper. Of the money, and gave the second two bags, and the third one bag. He gave each according to his ability. Then he traveled immediately afterward.
He who took the five bags immediately invested them in trade, so he gained five more bags.
And he who took the two bags did like the first, and gained two other bags.
But the one who took a single bag went and dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money in it.
After a long time, the master of those slaves returned and began to settle accounts with them.
He who took the five bags, and earned five more bags, said: "My lord, you gave me five bags, and these are five more bags that I have earned."
He said to him, his master: "Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master."
Then came the one who had taken the two purses, and said: "My lord, you gave me two purses, and here are two more that I have earned."
He said to him, his master: "Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master."
Then came the one who took one bag and said: 'Sir, I know you are a hard man. You reap where you have not sown and gather where you have not scattered.
I was afraid of you, so I went and hid your bag in the ground. Here is your property.
And his master answered him: 'You are a wicked and lazy servant. Yet you knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered.
Why didn't you deposit my money in the bank, and when I returned, I would take my money with interest?
Take the bag from him and give it to the owner of the ten bags.
For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
But the servant who is useless, throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. The Son of Man is the judge
"And when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne."
Then he will gather all nations before him and will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep on his right, and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on His right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you since the foundation of the world.
Because I was hungry, you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger, and you welcomed me.
I was naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and you took care of me. I was in prison, and you visited me.
"Thus the righteous will answer Him: 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink?'"
And when did we see you a stranger and give you shelter, or naked and clothe you?
And when we see you sick or imprisoned, we visit you.
The king says: "I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me."
Then the king will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.'
Because I was hungry, you did not feed me. I was thirsty, you did not give me drink.
I was a stranger, and you did not take me in. I was naked, and you did not clothe me. I was sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.
"Even the wicked will ask, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not help you?'"
"Then the king said, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did not do for me.'"
"Thus the wicked go into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."
Jewish leaders are plotting to kill Jesus
After Jesus finished saying these things, he said to his disciples:
"You know that after two days, the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified."
The chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest Caiaphas.
And they planned to seize Jesus by deceit and kill Him.
They used to say: "We should not do this during the feast, to avoid rioting among the people." A woman pours perfume on Jesus.
While Jesus was in the town of Bethany in the house of Simon the Leper,
A woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was eating.
When His disciples saw this, they were indignant and said, "Why this waste?"
"It could have been sold for a large sum of money to be given to the poor."
Jesus knew what they were saying and asked them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me."
The poor will always be with you. #ThePoor ... always. 11:26 See Deuteronomy 15:11. But I will not always be with you.
I have poured perfume on my body to prepare it for burial.
I tell you the truth: wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be spoken of in memory of her.” Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests.
At that time, one of the twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
He asked them, "What will you give me if I deliver Jesus to you?" And they set for him thirty pieces of silver.
And from that moment, Judas began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus. At the Passover meal
On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
Jesus said, "Go to so-and-so in the village, and tell him, 'The Teacher says: My appointed time is near; I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.'"
And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover meal.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve.
While they were eating, He said to them, "Truly I say to you, one of you will betray Me."
And they began to be sorrowful, and to ask him one by one, saying, "Is it I, Lord?"
Jesus replied: "The one who dips bread into the bowl with me, will betray me."
"Truly, the Son of Man is going as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man. It would be better for him if he had not been born!"
Judas, who was about to betray Him, asked, "Rabbi, am I the one?" Jesus said to him, "You have said so." The Last Supper
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
Then he took a cup of wine, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying: "Drink from this, all of you."
"For this is my blood, the blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."
"And I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."
Then, they sang some hymns and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus foretells Peter's denial.
Then Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away because of me this night, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'"
"But after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee."
Peter answered him, "Even if everyone else loses their faith in you, I never will."
Jesus said to him, "Truly I say to you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
Then Peter said to Him, "Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!" And all the disciples said the same thing. Jesus prays alone
At that time, Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
He took with him Peter and the sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me."
And Jesus went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, "O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: #the cup. 39:26 The cup of suffering and agony. Repeated in verse 42. But not as I will, but as thou wilt."
And he came to his disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter: "What, could you not watch with me one hour?"
"Stay awake and keep watch, so that you may not undergo it. Your spirit is willing, but your flesh is weak."
And he withdrew a second time and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to pass away from me unless I drink it, your will be done."
Then he returned again and found them asleep, for sleepiness had weighed down their eyes.
And he left them and went a third time to pray, saying the same words he had said the first time.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners."
Arise, let us be going. Behold, the one who is to betray me is at hand.” Jesus' arrest
While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, appeared, accompanied by a large crowd with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and elders of the people.
The traitor had given them a sign and said: "The one I welcome is the man you want, so seize him."
And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body. And they laid hold on him.
And Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you came for." Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him.
Then one of those with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you not realize that I can call on my Father, and he will send me more than twelve legions of angels immediately?
However, if you do, how will you verify the books that declared these things will happen like this?
And in that moment, Jesus said to the crowds: "Have you come out against me with swords and clubs as you would against a bandit? I was with you day after day in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me."
But this had to happen to fulfill what the prophets had written." Then all the disciples deserted him and fled! Jesus before the Jewish leaders
After that, those who had arrested him took him to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
But Peter followed at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus that they might put him to death.
But they did not find any evidence, although many false witnesses came forward and told lies about him. Finally, two men came forward,
They said: "This man #This man. 61:26 Any Jesus, his enemies avoided saying his name! He said: 'I can destroy the temple of God and build it in three days.'"
And the high priest stood up and said, "Do you not answer anything? What is it these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
Jesus answered him, "I am, as I have told you. And I say to you, from this day forward, you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the throne of God, and coming on the clouds of heaven."
At that, the chief priest tore his clothes and said, "He has blasphemed! Why do we need any more witnesses? You have just heard the blasphemy from his own mouth."
"On what charge do you condemn him?" They replied, "He deserves death."
Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists and slapped him.
And they said to him, "Prophesy to us, you Christ, who is the one who struck you?" Peter denies Jesus
At this time, Peter was sitting in the courtyard outside. A servant girl of the high priest came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus of Galilee."
But Peter denied this before them all and said, "I don't understand what you're saying!"
Then he went out to the gate of the courtyard, and another servant girl saw those there and said, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Peter denied it again, and swore, "I do not know this man."
After a while, those standing there came to him and said to him: "You are indeed one of them, for your accent reveals that you are a Galilean."
At that moment, he began to curse #curse. 74:26 He swears by himself, cursing if he is a liar! And he swears, saying, "I do not know this man." And immediately the rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.
Jesus before Pontius Pilate
On the morning of the next day, the chief priests and elders of the people assembled and consulted together to put Jesus to death.
They seized him and led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate. Judas hanged himself.
When Judas, who betrayed Jesus, saw that they had decided to condemn Jesus to death, he regretted what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
He said to them, "I have sinned in betraying innocent blood." But they said, "What is that to us? See to it yourself."
And Judas threw the pieces of silver into the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.
So the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, "It is not lawful for us to put this into the temple treasury, because it is the price of blood."
They decided to buy the Al-Fakhari field to be a cemetery for strangers.
For this reason, the field is known as the "Field of Blood" to this day.
And thus was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet Jeremiah: "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel."
And they bought the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me. #They took... the Lord. 10:27 See Zechariah 11:12-13, and Jeremiah 32:6-9. Jesus before Pilate
And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked Him, saying, "Are You the King of the Jews?" And Jesus said to him, "It is as you say."
When the chief priests and the elders accused him, he said nothing.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?"
But Jesus gave Pilate no answer to any charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed. Pilate then took Jesus and had him flogged.
It was the governor's custom at the Passover to release a prisoner chosen by the people.
There was a famous prisoner of Barabbas. #Barabbas. 16:27 Or "Jesus Barabbas" as in some Greek manuscripts.
He then said to them, "Whom do you want me to release to you: Jesus who is called the Messiah, or Barabbas?"
Pontius Pilate knew that they had handed Jesus over to him out of envy.
While Pilate was seated on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message saying: "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much this day in a dream because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.
The governor said, "Which of the two do you want me to release?" They said, "Barabbas."
Pilate asked them, "What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said, "Let him be crucified."
And Pilate said to them, "Why? What has he done?" But they shouted more, "Crucify him."
And when Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took some water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood. It is your responsibility."
And all the people said, "His blood be on us and on our children."
Then Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. Then the soldiers mocked Jesus.
Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus to the governor's palace and gathered the entire company of soldiers around him.
They stripped him of his clothes and put a scarlet robe on him. #They put on him... color. 28:27 Or purple, in mockery of him, for this is the color of the kings' robes.
And they twisted a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And they knelt before him, mocking him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
Then they spat on him, took the reed from his hand, and began to strike him on the head.
And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and led him out to crucify him. Jesus on the cross
When they went out, they found a man from the city of Cyrene named Simon, and they compelled him to carry the cross.
When they came to a place called Golgotha, which means "the place of the skull,"
They gave Jesus a drink of vinegar mixed with gall to drink. When He tasted it, He refused to drink it.
And when they had crucified Jesus, they divided his garments among them by casting lots.
Then they sat there guarding him.
And they placed above his head a sign with the inscription: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews," as a charge against him.
Two criminals were crucified with Jesus, one on his right and one on his left.
The Maronites would insult him, and shake their heads.
They said, "You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, if you are the Son of God, save yourself and come down from the cross!"
And he mocked the chief priests and the teachers of the law and the elders, saying:
He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him!
He placed his trust in God, so may God save him now if He truly wills it. Did he not say: "I am the son of God"?
Similarly, the two criminals crucified with him were insulting him with similar words. The death of Jesus
From the sixth hour until the ninth hour, there was darkness over all the land.
"About the third hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying: 'Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?' #Eli … sabachthani. Psalm 22:1. That is, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?'"
When some of those standing there heard this, they said, "He is calling Elijah!" #Calling Elijah. 47:27 The word "Eli" in Hebrew and "Eloi" in Aramaic resembles the name "Elijah," which is a well-known prophet who lived around 850 BC.
Then one of the bystanders hurried, took a sponge, soaked it in vinegar, put it on a long reed, and gave it to him to drink.
But the rest said, "Let us wait and see if Elijah will come to save him!"
Then Jesus cried out again in a loud voice and gave up his spirit.
The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. #TheCurtainOfTheTemple. 51:27 The curtain that separated the "Holy of Holies" from the rest of the Jewish temple. And the Holy of Holies represented the divine presence. The earth shook, the rocks split,
And the tombs broke open, and many bodies of the holy ones who had died were raised.
After Jesus had risen, those bodies came out of their tombs, entered the holy city, and appeared to many.
The Roman officer, #Roman officer. 54:27 Literally "a commander of a hundred." And the guards who were guarding Jesus' body, when they saw the earthquake and the other events, were very terrified and said: "This man was truly the Son of God!"
There were also some women looking on from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him.
From among them are Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. #Sons of Zebedee. 56:27 James and John. Jesus was buried
When evening came, a rich man named Joseph, from the town of Arimathea, arrived in the city of Jerusalem. He was also a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. So Pilate ordered it to be given to him.
And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a new linen cloth,
Then he placed him in his new grave, which he had dug in the rock, then rolled a large stone over the entrance of the grave and left.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb, guarding Jesus' tomb.
On the following day, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate.
They said to him: "Master, we remember that this deceiver said before he died: 'I will rise from the dead after three days.'"
And he commanded that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him away and tell the people, ‘He has risen from the dead.’ And this last deception would be worse than the first.”
He then addressed them: "Take some troops and go, make sure of everything yourselves."
They went and secured the tomb. They placed a seal on the stone, and set guards from the soldiers to watch it.
The Resurrection of Jesus
After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
And at that moment there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and went to the tomb and rolled back the stone from the door, then sat on it.
His appearance was as bright as lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow.
The guards were very afraid of him and became like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified."
He is not here; he has risen from the dead, just as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.
Then go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead, and he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him.' Look, I have told you."
At that moment, the two women left the tomb quickly, their fear mingling with great joy, and ran to tell Jesus' disciples what had happened.
And suddenly Jesus met them, and said, "Peace be with you." So they came to Him and took hold of His feet and worshiped Him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me." The false report
While the two women were on their way, some of the guards went into the town and told the chief priests everything that had happened.
The chief priests and the elders gathered together and took counsel. Then they gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They said to them, "Spread among the people that Jesus' disciples came at night and stole His body while you were asleep."
"And if this news reaches the governor, we will convince him, and keep you safe."
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus speaks to his disciples
And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they prostrated themselves before him, even though some of them had doubts.
And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go, therefore, and disciple all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
And teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And remember that I will be with you always, to the end of the age.
John the Baptist
This is the beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah: "Behold, I send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way."
"a human voice cries out in the wilderness, saying: 'Prepare the way of the Lord. Make his paths straight.'"
John the Baptist came, baptizing in the wilderness and calling on people to be baptized as a sign of their repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
All the residents of the villages of the region of Judea and the city of Jerusalem went out to him. He baptized them in the Jordan River after they confessed their sins.
His clothes were of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
He would proclaim and say: "After me will come a man greater than I. I am not worthy to stoop down and untie his sandal."
"Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. But John would have prevented him, saying, 'I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?' Jesus replied, 'Let it be so now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.' Then he consented. And when Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him; and lo, a voice from heaven, saying, 'This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.'"
In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And when He had been baptized, immediately He went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him.
A voice came from heaven: “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.” The experience of Jesus
And the Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness alone.
And there remained forty days in the face of the trials of Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels ministered to Him. Jesus chose some of His disciples
After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
He says: "The time has come, and the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe in this good news."
While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting their nets into the sea—for they were fishermen.
And Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
They immediately left their nets and followed him.
Then he went a little farther, and he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother in their boat, preparing their nets.
And Jesus called them, and immediately they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed Him. Jesus cast out an unclean spirit.
Then they went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.
They were amazed by his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.
There was in the assembly a man with an evil spirit. Then the spirit cried out:
"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God."
"Jesus rebuked the demon, saying, 'Be silent and come out of him!'"
And so the unclean spirit entered the man, causing him to convulse, then cried out loudly and left him.
Everyone was amazed and began to say to one another, "What is this new teaching? He commands the evil spirits with authority, and they obey him."
And news about him spread quickly throughout the Galilee region. Jesus heals many.
Then they left the synagogue and went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
And Simon's mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever, so they told Jesus about her.
He approached her, took her hand, and seated her. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.
In the evening, at sunset, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed.
All the city's inhabitants gathered at the house's door.
Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases, and He drove out many evil spirits. But He did not allow the spirits to speak because they knew who He was. Preparing to proclaim the good news.
In the early morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up and went to a solitary place, where he prayed.
And Simon and those who were with him went to look for him.
When they found him, they said to him, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered them, "Let us go into the neighboring villages, that I may preach there also, for this purpose I have come."
And he went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. Jesus heals a leper
And a leper came to Jesus, and fell on his knees, and besought him, saying: "Lord, if you will, you can make me clean."
And Jesus put out his hand and touched him, saying, "I will; be clean."
The leprosy left the man, and he became clean.
Then Jesus sternly warned him and sent him away.
He said to him, "See that you don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded for your cleansing, #as a testimony to them. 44:1 The priest is the one who, according to the law, declares someone clean. Offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, #as a testimony to them. 44:1 See Leviticus 14:1-32. Then people will know that you have been healed."
But the man set out and began to spread the news of his healing everywhere, so that it became difficult for Jesus to enter a town openly. But he stayed in lonely places, and people came to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a paralytic
After several days, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and news of His return spread.
And a great multitude came together, so that they trod one another down, and he began to say to his disciples first of all, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy."
And they brought to him a man who was paralyzed, carried by four men.
But they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd. So they went ahead and uncovered the roof above the place where Jesus was. They made an opening in the roof and lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Some of my religious teachers were sitting there, so they began to think to themselves:
"Why does this man speak in this manner? He blasphemes God with his words! Only God alone can forgive sins."
Jesus knew their thoughts and said, "Why do you think these things in your hearts?"
Which of these is easier: to say to the paralytic, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Get up, take your mat and walk"?
"But I will show you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." And He said to the paralyzed man:
"I tell you, rise, take up your bed, and go to your house!"
And he arose and took his bed, and walked before them all, so that they all marveled and glorified God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!" (Matthew) Levi follows Jesus
And Jesus returned again to the lake. He taught the crowds that followed Him there.
While he was walking, he saw Levi sitting at the tax booth. He said to him, "Follow me!" And he got up and followed him.
While Jesus was reclining at the table in Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples. For many followed him when Jesus called Levi.
When the Pharisees and the teachers of the law saw him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they asked his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners." A question about fasting
And it came to pass, that when John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, they came and said to Jesus, "Why do John's disciples and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.
No one mends an old garment with a piece of new cloth, because the new cloth will shrink and tear the old garment, making the hole worse.
No one puts new wine into old wineskins; or else the new wine will burst the wineskins, the wine will be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined. But new wine must be put into new wineskins.” Jesus: Lord of the Sabbath
On a Sabbath, while Jesus was walking through some fields, His disciples began to pick some heads of grain as they went along.
The Pharisees said to Jesus: "Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath!"
He said to them, "Have you not read in the book what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and those with him?"
He entered the house of God during the time of the priest Abiathar, ate the consecrated bread that was set before God, and gave some to those who were with him, even though it is only lawful for priests to eat that bread. #26:2 See 1 Samuel 21:1-6.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
"Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath."
Jesus heals on the Sabbath
And Jesus went again into the synagogue, and there was a man there with a withered hand.
Some people were watching him closely, to see if he would heal him, so that they might find a reason to accuse him.
He said to the man with the withered hand, "Get up and come forward!"
Then he said to them, "Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath? To save a life or to kill?" But they remained silent.
And Jesus looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand," and he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
And the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might destroy Him. Many were following Him.
Jesus went with his disciples to the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd from Galilee and Judea followed them.
From Jerusalem, Idumea, and across the Jordan, and the region around Tyre and Sidon, a great crowd came to Him because they had heard about the things He was doing.
Jesus asked his disciples to prepare a boat for him so that the crowd would not press upon him.
As Jesus had healed many, everyone who was sick tried to reach Him to touch Him.
And the unclean spirits were falling down before Him, and crying out, “You are the Son of God!”
She strongly warns her not to reveal who he is. The selection of the twelve.
Then Jesus went up the mountain, and called to him those whom he desired, and they came to him.
And Jesus chose twelve men and called them apostles, to be with him, and that he might send them out to preach.
And He gave them authority to drive out evil spirits.
They: Simon, whom he named Peter.
James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John, whom Jesus surnamed Boanerges, that is, "Sons of Thunder."
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, #the Zealot. 18:3 From an Aramaic term meaning "the zealous one." That is, belonging to a Jewish political party that resisted Roman rule, called the "Zealots."
Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. The power of Jesus came from God, and Jesus returned to the house.
And people gathered around Him and around His disciples again, so that they did not even have time to eat.
When Joseph's family heard about his arrival, they came to take him with them, for people were saying he was mad!
But the teachers of the law who came from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul," #Beelzebul. 22:3 One of the names of Satan. He drives out demons by the prince of demons."
And Jesus called them to him, and said in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
For if a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot stand.
A house divided against itself cannot stand.
