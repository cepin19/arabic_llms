When attending a funeral, it is appropriate to dress in a conservative and respectful manner. Here are some guidelines: - **For Men:** - Wear a dark-colored suit, preferably black, with a white or dark-colored dress shirt. - A tie is usually expected, and it should be conservative in color and pattern. - Dark socks and polished dress shoes are a must. - **For Women:** - A dark-colored dress or skirt with a blouse or sweater is appropriate. - Avoid bright colors, flashy patterns, or anything too revealing. - Flats or low heels are suitable for shoes. - **General Tips:** - Avoid wearing anything too casual, such as jeans, sneakers, or t-shirts. - If you are unsure, it is always better to err on the side of being too formal rather than too casual. - Consider the cultural and religious norms of the deceased's family and adjust your attire accordingly.
