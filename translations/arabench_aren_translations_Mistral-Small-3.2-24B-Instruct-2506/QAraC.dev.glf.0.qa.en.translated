I'm saying what you don't want to understand, Saleh.
No problems, Saleh. Open your mind. Open the world around you. Open the people around you. The world is changing.
My uncle's brothers
What he wants is to develop himself and develop what's around him
Don't be reckless, Saleh.
No no no no, I don't need you.

Two dates and two cut dates
You're welcome, my friend

Do not eat.
He agreed.
I don't know where he lives.
Sure, here is the translation: Do you want some with that?
This is our chance, by God, it will take us back to our old days and its models have failed.
Try you, try you with him after a while and whoever delivers
These are normal and well-known matters.
The bull only has what he owns as a personality.
Wallahi, who's afraid?
I'm the one who's breaking my heart, mom
The budget is in his hands.
What is this project you're holding?
A Larger Government Project
Beneath and what is revealed
It's my right to take
You are in one ministry and your friend is in another ministry.
Call him, mom, I forgot him
Car wash day
I mean I
I consider myself a contributor among them
What happens, nothing comes up for me in the project, oh dear
I don't have anything.
It means that its meaning is that I am contributing after
Welcome, we all take
This government project
He'll understand the boy's point.
I understand him.
Hello, kick him.
This is a government project.
Here's your chance
Like Kirk, he's a big shot
Good morning, my dear friend
Take your bite and put it in your mouth.
Ariel was in his cave
I am Abu Rahi, listening with my mind.
Government projects are well-known
One third was suctioned
Saloum's son
Going to the souq
The single fenrir is twenty-eight ariel
They put them in the scales.
80 riyals per month
They didn't do anything.
I would like to be with him.
I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed devil.
I just feel like his head started spinning a bit.
Insha'Allah, my Lord
God is the head of the committee and everything is under His hand.
Don't forget us
A quarter of you are asleep
We have to be together somehow.
This government project is an opportunity
Sure, Ali.
We can't do without you
What do you want us to recommend, Ali?
InshaAllah everyone who is part of the project team
This is definitely something
Last night, I and the quarter were chilling with Insolv.
You guys, from your side, you are
Members of the project committee are reassured
Afraid of Saleh, the head of this committee.
They say that
Congratulations, Ali
Assure the group
يا الله يا بو فهد
You're sharing God's goodness with me, but you didn't tell me.
Don't forget, Saout
No, no.
Insha'Allah, everything is going as well as possible.
I agree with this opinion.
May God have mercy on you.
My mother gave me the rash and the itch.
It means
Sure, here is the translation: "Well, as long as you're with us in the section, you're a contributor to the project."
The most important thing is that there is no problem between us.
Pan-fried Chinese bread with minced meat
You need to eat.
Happy and healthy
There's something
If I cook, I'll fire Jady.
We will finish.
On this rate, we'll never finish.
If you have any questions, just say.
We are determined and we cooperate
How are you? Let's take our share.
A reasonable family
Write on it
We'll be the ones taking it.
Everyone who contributed to the project demands its completion.
Why not?
Without fear, ya Saleh
We are the ones who set the budget.
He bought a piece of land today and registered it in his name.
I found her later
He says what he buys
Where are you from, my friend?
Connected today
She says she called your brother, Amsker, on the phone.
There is good in every evil.
Let your brother know quickly
The second planet
The one who sharpened the earth that I bought for him yesterday
They agreed to sell it.
He said to call him and he said if he wants it, he should register it in his name.
He wants to put twenty on her eyebrow.
Our right
We consider ourselves contributors to it
Even if we're not contributors
A bite bigger than your mouth, you'll choke on it.
It's unreasonable to reduce your brother's rights and your mother's rights with you.
I don't want anything from you
We are contributors to the project and we have the right to demand our rights
Say it, say it
I was at the Sultan's yesterday and asked him to raise it.
I didn't let him.
You are mistaken if you think they will allocate a budget for the project.
The first stage
You're not less than others.
Members of the committee present
Listen to Isolde on the phone with them.

We serve with the project
I can't recall anything.
We divided the tasks, Adel
You, Saleh
I'm leveling the cement, bricks, and concrete.
The rest of the things are electric and what's not, is on me.
Hey guys
Claim your share
By God, I swear
I'll say I took a lump sum
I often say
Leave it to fate.
No problem, Saleh, no problem
Take what you want and the way you want it.
The most important thing
See you later
It will be in this week
Each person determines the amount they have in mind
For example
After two days, he surprised himself
I want to increase it by 15,000 after the mother's share.
What does "ai aad lish" mean?
You're not being fair.
I'm with you
Even after the contributors
Keep your job, that's none of your business.
Do you have a halal butcher?
Increase the budget, increase it, increase it, increase it, increase it, increase it.
Eat up, it's wide, praise God

Through your discussion of the project, Professor Saleh, I noticed that it is a vital and important project as well.
This is a blessing Allah has bestowed upon you, not just for this generation.
Yes yes
Tomorrow is the opening of the next phase of the project.
We are delighted to have you here and extend our warmest wishes to you.
I am pleased

They are afraid for my share and invest it.
I have a small portion of jujube.
Brothers, what they give her is a shekel from her father's share
We don't know these questions
This is a legitimate right.
You think this is a trust issue, you don't trust us
How is your mother?
I liked what my brother Rashid said.
I'll go and return to the same place they send me to every three months
This is my right.
Everyone says
You don't trust us
Clarity is essential in matters of inheritance and money.

الآن عاد خلص اتفرغ حق الراحة
لم تفي يا بو عبدالعزيز مع السلامة
May the Lord bless you.
No job.
You're not related to him, right?
For this beauty, for my memory
Human resources
Thank you, thank you, goodbye
Aki Zahró organized a party yesterday to celebrate her son's success
C'mon, cake
I'm not sure what you mean.
I have a pending transaction with my father that I need him to complete for me.
Zahra was upset.
Uncle is finally coming
My dad got a job.
God will be with you in your help now
He worked a lot, let him rest already.
He's resting
He told me to make him a sandwich.
I made it, prepared it, and packed it.
حدث خطأ
Fear Allah in this matter, have mercy on him, have mercy on his age.
It's your turn
I'm eating.
The poor thing wants to rest.
To your health, my friend.
He's the one who came back
I'm tired
I do not approve of their conduct.
I don't care what they say.
I was planning to do the bank transaction while I was going to my workplace.
وامهدد واذا تاخر احد يا ويله "Be quick, and if anyone is late, woe to them."
My love, my dear
I'm working
Get lost with that nose and those small eyes, this Chinese woman, goodbye forever
Busaid
This is what I tell you every day, I will rain blessings upon you wherever you are.
Saeed, you're a good guy.
It's forbidden, oh his smell
In my nose
Antique dealer
Main symptoms
I'm not surprised by the branch that's near the market
There is a spirit there
I won't go to the branch in the market again after they told me they weren't sure if I was there.
InshaAllah, yallah, ma'assalam
The sun struck him.
Tsetsetr Shamss
Entered my neighbors' house
I recognized the worker.
I'll heal you
May God guide your steps.
I'm feeling so happy, oh Saeed
Where is your dad now?
from the Louvre
Which bank is this after I tell you?
They said the documents are incomplete.
Take a taxi.
We had a meeting with the manager
أبي كيف حالك إن شاء الله
I'm feeling a bit under the weather, I have a headache.
I am telling you, it's true.
Leave your father to rest.
Poor things, oh Saeed
They must adhere to attendance after these reports are written about their actions and accordingly.
How are you?
What's up, Mr. Hawk?
You can tell me what you think and what you don't think
How do you do?
The first of the years
It is written for us to suffer.
I declare war
Bound to assist them
Poor people tell me
I swear, you don't have any sense.
The youth nowadays who don't have fathers don't complete their studies
Returned to work M work different
It allows you to leave your job.
May Allah reward you for your kindness.
I'm just the coffee behind you.
Where is Uncle Saeed?
With a sincere heart, I dealt with my son Said
I'm the one who made this coffee in this ministry.
باخذها بوديها الاراظي بعد الله ايعينا
Goodbye
I'm so excited, okay. I'll see you later bye.
I wish you the best
This is what I warned you about.
I heard you say something about Said.
Your father is generous.
I don't need anything from you.
ترى أباكما إذا ما اشتكى إليكما
We won't stay silent about it.
speaks
خافوا الله في هذا العالم
Wake me up with your screams, keep going to me, is there something to celebrate?
You were a government employee and you know what an inventory is.
They are writing this first
Sometimes after a while, they become like this.
Please confirm the last day of receiving transactions at Al Tanmiyah Bank for Al Quruz.
لا أحد يقول
Enough, my friend.
I'll tell you two words and believe me
He says he has a committee to audit.
Switchboard
Hi, how are you?
Keep your spirit high and conclude the transaction.
Nothing, nothing, nothing
He returned from the trip silent.
The word that comes to mind
No life, no shame
Don't let your dad's anger take a stance against you.
I hope you are satisfied with my performance.
يبارك الله فيكم خيرًا ما قصرتم
Welcome, I was calling you
He's calling from bed, he's got nothing.
Dear and precious Yabeh
You never shortchanged us in our lifetime.
Wipe me down
I'm on it
Enough, my friend!
I will honor and respect.
Khanehforush Khanehforush
Welcome, Zak
May God bless you, my son
May Allah bring good.
We've decided from that day on
We have completed our transactions ourselves.
الحمد لله
What the hell is wrong with you, you idiot?
Consider it the last one
ما نصبح
Call me now
I'm not going to the minister's place, he's the one who should come to me.
The minister is angry with you.
It's necessary for me to go after he goes. No, no, no, this statement is nothing but the minister.
I don't know where I'm going, I don't know what to tell you, I don't want to leave you.
I won't tell you, and I won't say to you.
Your treatment of me is considered pure and ready.
Hey, you're on your way and you're about to finalize a deal with Saeed, right, brother?
The one who made you submit, oh fool
Consider it the last deal, finish it for me.
What are you talking about, man?
Your son was supposed to sign this paper.
Take it, I'll bring it tomorrow.
Honestly, I advise you to take it easy today.
The transaction was not entered.
I'll look at you after two months
Let me leave it to him to make it happen.
I don't need anything
Call him back in two minutes.
I'll be sincere with you
You mean you don't know Saeed?
No permission taken
What comes but the evening.
None of them have a quarter of what he has.
Where are you from?
I said I'm at Said's
I'm waiting for my shift to end.
Enough, man!
Have you finished your papers yourself?
John Tarashteh welcomes you
How many children do you have?
I miss my uncle
Please come in, Uncle.
You fell short.
No use.
I will leave you
Go to the House of the Helpless
I don't know what to tell them, where are they going?
اشبتقول لهم يابو سعيد I'll tell them, Abu Said
I'll write them something else
Alhamdulillah
He was released from prison yesterday.
I swear to God, my brother.
We've been doing that for a while
Stop talking on the radio or television.
We only have trouble in it.
يا الله الله إهداه ويصلحه إن شاء الله
يالله يا اخويتي مع السلامه الله ايحفظج = Take care, my brother. May God protect you.
He is the prison's devil
I was traveling
Hey bro, I'm struggling
This is the program they call the Millis.
And you, my brother, greet the Real.
I want Khalid Jassim
We're in a mess
He's back, my love, listen to them, a quarter to five at work
He was talking to his son about the government
It's cool, his story is full of oil money.
Mother, mother, I'm crying over this boy
No one cares.
Those who were envious of him and used to say to him, "Do this and do that."
All of them disowned him.
He is the One whose guidance you should seek.
I'm back, my brothers, let me go and check out the chef
The need of God
Come here, you fool
Come here, sit down.
You're a bunch of brats, my children
By God, Yabeh, I'm exhausted and fed up.
She is in a critical condition in the hospital.
ما تستاهلون والله يمه You deserve it, I swear by God, mom
I wish the same had happened to you.
I didn't kill you.
What's up, bro?
He sat down and started to cry
I'm staying with you
يا حبيبي هذه المرة عدت
This is what I tell you
Ava Alig yama
Please specify the subject.
We are the Destroyers
Why is the manager so miserable?
It's forbidden that after all these years we're still asking you the same question.
ما تفهم الكلام يا صالح What do you understand, Saleh?
We are the Destroyers
Give us one more.
Call me Saleh
You are a human who has experienced these things
You're doing well, may God bless you, you follow public affairs and criticize.
It's easy
Delete one person
You are one of them
You're not the one meant.
Goodbye, take care
Mr. Saleh
Hopefully, your uncle Bou from Minya doesn't know.
Get out of here, you fool. May God be with you.
من أين تعلم
If I faint
Tell him to work.
May they finish it for you, otherwise.
I asked my mom and she said that my dad works.
You must
You must be afraid of your mother
It's a shame, I'm with her right now.
Our daughter is involved with him.
What you practice
Give him a two-week extension.
But if I work by God, no wire from my ears and the court's valleys and I say release
You enjoy this now
You're not as cunning as a snake, except for what's in your head.
You're the best, honestly
I want to know
What's up?
I think you want to go.
Your heart, oh my love, is captivated by coffee.
I want to solve it and connect it.
يالله روح قرفتك ونام يالله = Go to sleep, my darling, go to sleep
Good morning, wake up, it's time for work.
Insha'Allah, I'll get up tomorrow, I mean
I've told you, I've quit that habit for good.
Enough, I swear to God
I'm really fed up with these annoying notifications.
We don't accept any broken or damaged goods.
Junk DNA
Not just us, we're the troublemakers of our time
Where have you been, uncle? You look like you've been frozen in time. You're one of a kind, uncle.
We heard, we heard, we heard the news, we heard.
We are the Destroyers
We are the Destroyers
Saleh is present
Able to lie down
My son did something wrong yesterday and I don't know what.
We just want Jifna Saleh to be present in the coffee.
Here you go:
No one can fix it.
They were people who existed
You're just Nadiah.
You're wasting your time with me
A guy is at the door, he's really dirty.
The hunger is on you
Greed is what didn't make him stop at your limit.
My son and the bread of my hand, I know you're beautiful, aren't you?
You're like the one who throws tantrums
You may or may not fast, you may or may not pray, you may or may not say, but I will say: we are ruined, or I will say: we are ruined.
This is what I tell you
I sent it via radio.
Walla Saleh Bsena Kharabeet
Professor Saleh, you are a man with a very high sense of national pride.
We can keep you busy
but Shenshui returned
Come on, he's forgiven us again.
Hello Saleh, how are you?
John, you've tired yourself out. You're precious to us.
By God, no
Brother, I tell you every day, but you're just a mess.
Hey, you, you are a brave person, don't be afraid.
Just say "I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah" once.
I am God, I have forgiven you.
Call him a fool, say it, and the one who will save you is the ruin of Allah's creatures.
Come on, the Riyal is at the bottom again. I hope it comes back alone, just alone, for the memory.
Awesome, bro!
Live long and prosper
For the job
You deserve it, you're a human, a patriot, and precious to us.
We were trying to reach you to inform you
John was a very old man whom God had created
You're from your youth.
Everywhere I go, they tell me there are no vacancies.
Poor things, they want to work but there are no jobs
How are you and your mom doing at home?
and don't forget after
Four people have the yaal.
God is generous
Don't be sad, my love
I hope you have hope.
I will not stop
You need to go look for a job for me.
So my dad doesn't cause us problems
I swear to God, I'm ready to do anything for you, Manirah.
I repent after saying we are trash.
We played marbles
ما زلت أفكر في هذه الأيام
I told you
يا بو فهد، الله يهديك
What do you hear?
I'll go myself and tell the truth about the minister Al-Balaawi who is sitting and causing trouble
I think the minister
Sure, here is the translation: He will definitely understand it, honey.
You're right.
This is something
What is overlooked
You know the rumor that he's going to replace you and that you're going to fight back strongly and fiercely.
I'm walking down the street, keeping an eye on it.
Does anyone feel like they have a stake in this matter?
Your idea is correct.
I keep thinking about him/her.
The way to remove Sultan from your tray
Have you heard about Saleh Saleh? He's a disaster.
May God give you this from our farm.
I wish you a long life
Our modesty, oh righteous brother, is protected by your voice.
No, Saleh.
I'm one of your biggest followers
ماشالله، لا صالح بعد ما يحتاي
Insha'Allah, I'll try.
You hear his voice and you miss him.
He himself asks about you
Say not, O righteous
Why did you stand?
By God, it means a lot of problems, psychological and health issues.
You just want to fight.
You are considered a debater.
We've heard that before.
God God God I asked for you, Saleh, to return
Just once, for old times' sake.
I want to hear it on the sink
Saleh says it's done.
Lala ya jama'a, it's really hard, I swear, it's really hard, honestly.
May you be healed.
The riyal rejects
I am cutting, Abdurrahman
Then you didn't tell me to look for a job
This is it, your chance.
Sure, here is the translation: "Khal Real listens to you and waits for you. Go to his office the day after tomorrow and ask for the job."
Heart if it tears you apart
I want what's best for you.
How are you?
Enough, we don't want to go to your house.
Enough, we don't want to.
Stop it, my brother, stop it, be patient, my brother, let them be.
Enough, let's go, we don't want to.
Decorate, decorate
I guess if I ever went back, like for the last time, I'd probably cut it off, but it would be the last time.
For example, Shihab means Bo Bo Bo Bofhd hears, I love to hear
Shally Iansah means identifying problems and major crises that are far and wide.
What do you mean by that, or do you like, for example, protests? I don't know, you tell me.
According to the contract signed
Here are his responsibilities:
87 centimeters
Lost the job
Until you interrupt me
Why are all the employees the same?
Little by little
Stop me.
Seventh, Mr. Saad Al-Wezir
Why is the employee
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters
Dude, those cars belong to his brother
You guys are just a bunch of troublemakers
We thought you'd come back with your voice, we don't want you to leave us again.
People who support me, I mean, last time
Or else, I'm serious, I'll cut it off, you know.
What did you say? You said it's over?
You're the one who stopped me
Oh, my daughter
This is what is called Bsna Kharabeet, exposed on air
I heard it too, but they told me.
I suspect there's someone in the ministry who's leaking the information.
The weather is nice today.
The weather is terrible.
The minister is present, seeking.
I don't care
Your entire time belongs to the ministry. May God preserve you.
Live long and prosper
I swear, I said it just for you.
He gave me a weird look.
He didn't talk to me.
Abdulrahman says, "Leave me alone."
He didn't talk to me.
By Allah, you are pitiful, Ya Saleh.
Heartbreaker
I am a secretary at Wafid.
All the previous knowledge
The group exploited you for a specific goal they were building.
Unfortunately, they reached him.
It's been a while since the last one
Abdulrahman Walid Freijkum
God who planned all this
What are you doing, it's impossible.
One day, I ended up in the same situation as Sultan.
You are well-known.
It's impossible to know what you're thinking.
I want the court to release
I found the solution.
We are the best society in the world
Flawless
We have
We don't have any flaws at all
We're comfortable
Intermediate snow
Even if someone who knows you tells you to hold the door
Because the system
He takes his rights more than a stranger.
We do not rely on strangers
We have
Our work has flaws, we have flaws
None of the adults
I'll go and put you to bed at home.
We don't have any of that.
With my best regards
Saleh Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Bahahiri
Saleh Bsna Kharabeet
I don't want dinner
I was sitting down to run, then I turned around and the shirt tore.
A new shirt looks better on you than it does on me.
A boy wearing the yellow shirt that we and you bought from Villagio was seen.
This is his cat's whisker, meaning it's the best of the best for him.
This is good, isn't it?
I'll put it on my conscience
You, being just, when you saw a boy who was troubled, you hesitated about him.
Based on how
Why is Walid's t-shirt difficult?
Your shirt is wrinkled. You should iron it. I was about to tell your dad to buy you a new one.
Take care of yourself
Why did you hate Walid's t-shirt?
حتى أقول لك
Don't let me give you a slap on the forehead
I say, my brother Sultan
Why did you release it with a case and then lower it like that?
استح هذي يا أهل اصغير يا أهل مب قدك ذي
This is it, people! This is it, people!
Hey guys
People who are fair and just will love and respect him.
مب ايخلونه Let's not leave it
Price of your words, oh Sultan, and the Kharabeet
School is boring, man. I'm bored, man.
Your whole life is arrogant
Train your children with justice.
You all are uneducated and incompetent.
I respect myself now.
And I didn't make a mistake with him and I shook him a lot.
Brothers, your elders
By God, may you enter justice and prosperity again, or nothing else.
There is no one to blame but himself
I'm wasting my time with you.
Respect yourself again
Sure, here is the translation: "Point it out to me, let's go to her."
What will happen to them
Hey there, old times
Pure intentions
يالله بالعفو والعافيه = May God forgive and grant pardon
Bro, you don't have more than this, do you?
There is no translation for this text.
Give all that you have in your hand and come quickly
The void of the disaster that befell us
I want you to tell me exactly what I should do.
I'm sorry, but I can't translate that.
Adjustable pants
This is the act of a resentful, envious person, filled with hatred and loathing.
This is what Sultan did.
Where can I find someone who can cut all these clothes?
My new clothes, I didn't boast about them, I didn't wear them. Allah is sufficient for me against them.
I need to tell him
Sit down, let me talk to you.
If you go when he has time, he says "Yahal" and similar things.
What do you think?
You're my beloved child, do you know how to ride a bike?
Do I know?
My love, Walid
What should I say?
Just say
Where did you put the scissors, Mom?
Under the bed
May God destroy their lives.
However, there are some drawbacks.
I don't talk about it
This is a Minion from Despicable Me.
The most important thing now
And what has changed?
But this old computer of mine is acting up.
Waves of the sea
To raise our son to be honest, their family's computer broke and we don't know.
My soul invites her My soul invites her Either he fills his stomach with her or not
Get away from you, the destroyers, oh Fohod.
Leave my quarter alone Make others laugh
I tell you it's unfair
Spirit, make others laugh, oh Fuhud
I'm good, no need
Time of the generous hearts
Pure intentions
In Yahal
I'm the one who's going to turn around and leave.
ضحك على غيري يا سلطانو
To falsely accuse me
Scissors lead
Respect yourself.
Oh, Abdurrahman, tell the truth, oh Yabeh
You owe your brothers Fahd and Sultan.
Hey, you all, every day like this, you guys.
I don't know
Session like this
We're supposed to sit it out.
Pour examiner nos travaux
Works of our predecessors
And what will we become?
We take lessons.
and we learn
The meeting of peace be upon you
Like a camel
Do you have children?
He doesn't understand anything.
My role model is my father, not yours.
His role model is his father.
You, O Sultan
You, Fahd
I am your elder brother
For you
At the price of the computer
You're the one who reached out to him.
They reconciled.
I don't want to, I'm not in the mood to deal with you.
Stop bothering Abdullah Rahman, he won't shut up anyway.
Where is he going?
I swear I won't.
You're making it happen
Don't worry
If you're the real champion, I'll call you the champion.
You didn't say that Abdulrahman judged on some.
But I swear, if he doesn't give me back my room key and I have to break in, I will break it.
Your brother
Natural product
Your brother has a normal hairline
Sometimes when I'm surfing, I take the incoming wave
Fahd on his head on his head
Keep quiet, keep quiet, you kids. I'm just sitting here minding my own business, they're not ashamed of themselves and they don't care.
Your kids are so cute, but oh my, but.
I swear to God, I'll tell you, I'll tell you, I swear to God, I'll tell you.
Oh no, oh no, oh mom, oh no, Why did you make her grow up?
Auntie's blood
My heart wavers with this scream
Oh God
Let's check our situation
That's a shame
I am gathering your words and your judgments.
I won't hold back with them
Day turns into night, they reconcile.
He didn't have time, mom.
and he is responsible for it
Mashaallah.
Your argument is eloquent.
But oh my
May Allah guide you.
Welcome, you who soothe the soul
Firewood, O Yama, is not wasted.
May you be well, oh Lord.
Woe unto you, Abdurrahman
I need your help, I've become Pharaoh
You, oh wise one, may God guide you.
Two days ago
One by one
God forbid, may He guide you.
Our neighbor Saad is reading to us and laughing at us.
We want to tell the officer, we want to tell him.
Block the officer.
They're the important ones they deleted all three
Please
Hey, don't come to me again, don't come to me again.
The officer forbade it, believe me, I'm getting it from above.
He heard the officer ban it.
Far away
My brother is telling the truth about him.
Please, you have now signed that you will not divorce your spouses again.
Thank you, thank you
مرحبا اخي مرحبا اتفضل
The officer banned them, how did you let them go? I'm sure of it.
Listen to me
I didn't want to tell you all this before.
This is Abdulrahman, their brother, the oud player
Deputy Minister
The second one is their middle brother, the director of the authority.
Take two drops of valerian and relax.
The officer banned any pendulum.
You have two pendulum earrings.
Allah is sufficient for me against the enemy
My sufficiency is in Allah against the enemy
My sufficiency is in Allah against the enemy who has made a game of me.
Yeah yeah yeah, what's up, what's up?
Hey, who's coming from there to here?
This is his dad's hand returning. What should I do? Should I delete it?
Do you believe in fate?
A generous, well-respected, and well-mannered man with many children.
He says this is the daughter of the poor.
Even if
It's catching up now.
He did not lower his eyes from the oil lamp.
I hope you're well
That's all until the opportunity arises
It means when you were passing by, you looked up.
It means "by chance" or "accidentally".
You turn as she turns at the same time
Sure, here is the translation: "Of course, there is something."
I notice when you walk around.
I feel like she's glowing from within, filled with joy and happiness.
Hey soul, say it, give me a pen
Take your notebook.
I don't know her name anymore.
Excessively romantic
You're not a fool anymore in the twenty-first century
By God, you're really starting to look like shit.
I want to go out.
Since we've been sitting like this
Do not rejoice
From today, I plan to dedicate myself to you.
Take a break and rest for a while now.
He returned specifically yesterday for an outdoor photoshoot.
No destruction by Allah, my brother. The secretary informed me. Look, I don't want any press interviews, TV interviews, or even contracts.
Let me focus on my family properly.
God will be with you
Even while you're busy
First thing that came to my mind
I have her number today.
I'm late for what?
The land was cultivated and inhabited from ancient times.
Cave of Series and Acting
She says that they are poor people and in their current state.
Our share is our share in it.
Good morning, uncle
Good may be what is evil
Hey, this car every day and the second one is on us
The visible battery is your father
No problem, I don't mind. I have the files and I'll send them to you now inshallah.
May God bring goodness
Present, present, my uncle
Hello
What Walid said is correct.
I'm done with your salary, so I won't rent it to you and I won't live there for any of you every day.
Finish us off, if you have any.
Enough, please.
Please be seated.
What's up, Walid?
Rashid Abdullah
Same name
Returned to the right path of Abu Jusayf
I believed her
I was overjoyed the day I found out that Rashed Abdullah, the actor I love, is coming our way.
All people praised him
They say he is diligent and kind.
The bird before the house, yes indeed.
I'm just taking pictures, man
I'm working on it, I swear
Our house is right next to actor Rashid Abdullah's house.
Word word, so I can believe.
Jove of the world
What he likes on TV
I hope to see you.
Alhamdulillah, our boy is up. Alhamdulillah, please God.
I wonder if they'll like the gift I got them
I'm just watching, guys. I'll take it easy on him until you call for it.
The news has reached you
By Allah, I did not fall short. May Allah increase the good in him.

But if you choose me
Our blessings upon you, Uncle Walid.

The sofa returned to Rashed's sister.
We are neighbors today

May Allah bless you, dear brother Rashid
I've heard a lot about your kindness.
God bless the love
Oh my daughters

When did you last see the old furniture?
I need to change it
Insha'Allah
I was a sailor before, my friend
If you need anything
Consider me like a sister
May my eyes never tire.
Where is my trip, my love?
Yesterday you called me and forgot Ahwash.
My love, I'm so tired.
No more
See you later, take care
I'm being honest, I was talking to her.
People are not of our kind.

We agreed that we are family
Who owns the car?
Insha'Allah soon
I called to thank her
They love goodness, yes indeed.
By Allah, you're telling the truth, Yabeh.
Even if our people don't want to.
My name is definitely with them
Are you sure?
The misfortunes that befell us
I'm so confused right now, my head is spinning from this news, I don't know how to react.
روح روح روح روح روح روح You now, hopefully, hopefully Good, thank you May God grant you goodness May God grant you goodness
خير اصاير يا بو علي translates to "Good morning, Mr. Ali"
The committee met today
The list of names to be transferred has been released.
My name is Wiahm
What did the manager say to you?
What's the use, Ali? What's the use?
His need is great and there is no hope.
The great artist
Consider your name not to be lowered on the list.
استلم ما قصرت والله يا بو سالم
Please return, if you would be so kind.
I'll take pictures with you to show the kids
Oh, my kids are playing now.
Insha'Allah, may God grant them to you.
Picture of an artist
At your command, God willing, I submit to you.
Please, please
Woe betide you, woe betide you, present
You and those who are dear to you
Say it a day or two earlier, better.
Come on, come on, mom, get ready
Get ready, get ready, listen up
I hope you feel better soon.
I have no objection.
I'm fine, thank you
I'm gonna go for them.
Oh, my son, you're back
I feel like we're just ordinary people, given our circumstances.
You need to wake up
Where am I supposed to wear this?
Your looks got me into trouble with people.
I'm seeing these jewelry pieces for the first time.
It's my right
Right of Ali's mother
Ali's mother is asking for her son's rights.
I want clothes and I want to cook jewelry
On her saying, she wanted to show them that the most important people are those who are coming and have goodness, meaning
Oh oh, MashaAllah
Her Excellency
Mashallah, these are my earrings, they've lengthened and turned blue.
Mashallah, I can't even speak.
Mashallah, may you be blessed with a son
You need to prepare now
They say let my dad meet his dad
I'm definitely not going to my dad's to get clothes.
First, they put their hands on their heads.
No one can cook better than my mom.
Her son's mother, she didn't hold back, she showed her disdain, then she cooked for them.
I love you
We have to become like them after all.
Why didn't his mother go propose to him?
Those two women
I need to go to the bottom of the world now.
والله يسلامك مثل ما انت جايف
May God keep you safe.
People of goodwill did not fall short
They were short, so we stayed in the coat.
I came back, I took it from you, I completed the count now.
Everyone has their own way.
How are you, my brother Rashid? I want to give him a gift, what should I give him?
Sure, here is the translation: "Just come and see first."
This needs to be sweetened.
Oh, you're teasing me
اشوي عود عليك الثوب لكن شوف I'll iron the dress for you, but check
May this be your God.
The left hand inside the cloak
Endangered in this way
The coat was pulled from under him.
God God
Oh my!
Walking, walking, heavy, you want heavy, I'll make it heavy.
Hey you
Become a Millionaire
I'll give it to you inshallah in a moment
The left has declined, the right has risen, this is the color.
I know my friend Aisha
No life is without pain.
I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget.
I say, because you are my best friend and we don't want to drift apart.
Saying the truth, my brother is going to propose.
Say something nice about your sister-in-law, don't say anything bad about her and embarrass yourself.
People have been giving empty speeches these days. Every day, I tell Soad she wants her uncle's rights, and today, it's her brother's.
They are taking my beloved away.
I'm sitting and reading
What they know most about is the relationship between us
We're just colleagues.
Enough, man!
They should know the price.
Why did Walid spit?
I am screaming
You are dismissing my son Walid
The actor is more honorable than you hypocrites
But you
Represent yourselves throughout your life
Welcome, everyone
Serve people
You attract people.
Put on your acting clothes, for life is but a stage, and Allah and His creation are the audience.
The outfit I wore on TV
I and you all
You wore the accessories, gold, and jewelry
My role model
You got married
منظر شني
One walks alone once
He hung his hat on two pegs
He does not look to the right or to the left.
Hey, remind me of that brief you guys were talking about that you had in the office.
Come with him, a boy and a girl
Why did you come back?
As they say
God be with you, Real
Keep walking, my lady, do not stop.
Poor thing, they have no personality at all
You laugh after you've cried
We have clothes for you
لالالالا I'm back with something sweet and you're just sitting there
Get up, walk around, don't just stand there.
طلبتك يا خميس طلبتك
Call him to come here.
Come over, I'll cook for you.
Where are you going to sit and I'll cook?
I'm feeling better now.
You will be satisfied with your choice.
Oh, Khamees
Cancel the television if a news anchor appears
I'm scared, I'm causing you problems
By Allah the Almighty, at work
He's sitting, I swear, sitting with Salem, my work friend.
Pilgrim
The line is blocked.
The phone sometimes causes me problems at home.
Sometimes you say, "Why don't you just leave your friend with me, just this once?"
Insha'Allah, maybe one day, God willing, I'll receive the package
And she kicks you out after
You're the first teacher to have done this.
I can't understand what you're saying.
Sweetest mother, in her grave
My mother always advised me to
She told me not to let go.
لا يمكن.
I'm looking for something you have
Lalala Kh Kh Kh Khlek Khlek
You seem completely normal.
I don't come with you
Tell me, I want to understand what's happening
I can't believe you're saying all this.
Salem himself is considered one of the good young people we have in the area
I'm telling you, divorce her.
He said, "Just divorce her, just divorce her, I mean, just do it. He's like a bull, just divorce him."
You look so official, my Thursday.
Let me, let me, and the one who will make you submit.
Our family's men and our spirits are being humiliated.
May God guide you
The poor one is blind of heart
I want to give him the message, it's important from the minister's office.
May God guide you
Hala Lala, Walashi Walashi
Bring it here, I'll give it to him.
To meet with the women's delegation that we have tomorrow
Women's delegation
Get well soon, get well soon. You're sleeping today.
Waleed Al-Salem
I am your brother, Khamis
I swear to God, I'm talking to you while I'm awake, I swear to God.
Hey bro
Remove my name because I'm not allowed, you son of a bitch.
How do you want me to delete your name?
The only one who can erase your name is Saadah Al-Wazeer.
Dear brother, this is a meeting at the ministry.
Official meeting
I challenge you
Salem Salem Salem
Say the word.
I was looking for you and you were hiding behind the tank.
Safe, safe, by Allah, safe
What are you arguing with Salem for?
How else would you say it?
I am
I'm sorry, I can't help with that.
It means the product is defective.
No way, I'm casual after.
I doubt you, you son of a bitch, that I need anyone
He returned to his normal life.
The one who saved you, Salem, called.
The one who supports you to be believed
God told you to call.
Are you the boss?
Mind your own business, or you'll see how I handle you.
I complain about you
You are Wo.
How are you living alone? The days are long.
Let's start the meeting now.
Long live your good health, I'll call you Thursday
Let's discuss the real estate owner's budget first.
Please come in
I'll do it, God willing.
I tell you, as soon as they saw the women, they were afraid.
I left you in charge of everything while you're just relaxing here.
The gang's waiting for you in the meeting room, come on!
I can't sit with the women.
يا خميس، مرتك اشلون تدري؟
I'm afraid to call.
بالتبيها، أشك فيني عاد بال يا أخي، ما تفهم انت
I'll be back home after I finish my work.
Your wife will only call at this time.
Of course, you are a large company
This project that your company is implementing for our ministry
The largest project in the ministry's history
Hey guys, fix the table, it's shaking
May you live long enough to see this table's end.
Please have a seat.
Who's with me?
Who is that student?
Call me
Moment by moment, I'll tell you
He's not even in his right mind because he's scared to go to their house.
Her brother is so...
I'll tell you, my sister, if you die at work, it's these women who will clean the house.
To request this, I submitted a letter to the ministry to have them transferred from our department.
He himself told me that the minister agreed to move it, meaning whatever you want, book it after.
What's up, bro? This time.
This is a mistake
What should I say, Ya Khamees? I'll solve it with whom?
I'm telling you, I'm not asleep.
What are you going to do when your wife and kids come tomorrow?
I swear, I don't know what I'm doing
Why did you fulfill her request? Did you not go back home and see your children?
To confirm officially
She gave him the papers.
I did this, I gave her sister the paper.
To ensure the minister's signature is seen and confirmed
InshaAllah, I'll agree if you agree. InshaAllah, maybe we can go home tonight.
Dear Sir/Madam, this is the Minister's signature.
After confusion
Tomorrow, I will start at the new department.
I'll be at the office tomorrow and working on something different from what I was doing before.
Where is the section that God may protect you?
O God, preserve him and this is the minister's reference.
I swear, I swear, that's on your right hand.
Oh joy, oh joy, praise be to God, peace be upon him.
Your desk is ready, sir.
A large office, yes, with Saad, Abd al-Qadir, and Mashallah.
Goodbye
كيفية طلب نقل
The whole department is women, you know.
Madame
No one can make a decision a second time except the minister himself.
You have to keep going until the minister returns.
Hey, you agreed with your friends, right?
Call them by the name Riyal for your wife's sake, so she doesn't find out.
I left work two hours later than the official working hours
The female employee intended the male employee
We have been waiting for the minister's office to send the real ID for days now.
من صجج From the screech
A man who looks like you, imagine a Real Madrid player between five harem girls, his form is antique.
They say to his wife, "Someone else has taken a liking to him, beware."
Auntie Ghareh
Poor thing, look at his state
We were told by God that if his wife calls, we should not speak to him and remain silent.
Any Abdulqadir who is with you in the office
This is all that matters to you, you're obsessed with it or not.
My son called and said, "Mom, come to the office."
I'll be quitting soon
Right first door
This is the Social Services Office
Five women
Hello, six employees
He is present, I contacted him and he responded.
I'm not sure about these movements
This is the second time I'm visiting.
I'm sweet
May God guide you, Sultan
We just want to know where we've reached
My uncle who became that I and my brother Saqr were at the bank yesterday
Look, from this side, the project
Hello to you
Bro, I have an important meeting at work.
يالله عد روحي المطبخ ابسرعه يالله
I'm about to go out.
The kitchen is definitely the best place
We have a harem, we don't obey the men, by God
The scorpion, if it angers God, is enough to ward off its sting.
It's really raining hard, look look
Look at my uncle
Aisha and the one who is being interviewed contacted the secretary and informed her to notify the employees.
They say her immunity has postponed today's meeting until tomorrow.
Insya Allah
They issue such orders
Woe betide us if we do not execute
The well-known ones know that he is a big responsibility
Communication and Responsibilities
The only thing that matters to them is that she is a maid.
I've never seen people in my life who despise women as much as they do.
We're living like this for now, first time ever
You're not going to work, you're not cooking, and you're not coming home.
Services and amenities
The second one is confused, she has a week
Even the maids did not escape their insults.
They have the right to extinguish it.
God will help.
The notes from the bank are simple.
come
What do you mean by "my uncle is a sheep"?
A residential complex without a garden is not worth it at all.
Water the garden now
Before you start, make sure to take a break from the topic.
My dear Fatima, I have to go to work late.
May God adorn your speech with beauty, say what is on your mind.
You say or I'll go
Play it at school
Returned to the Women's Union Committee
I was chosen by the school to play with them on the team.
Who do you think you are?
الآن اتقول لي بتروح المنتخب
You'd know if I had any thoughts, you'd say they're right, my brothers and uncles are the ones who are messing up.
I blame only myself
We warned you.
I was just saying to myself that I should greet her, but I haven't seen you in ages, my friend.
I'll turn you into a monkey.
Your wife or else
والله يهديك
Who takes someone who is neither educated nor has a certificate nor knows anything, may God guide you.
لا لا لا ما يعيب الريال أن مو متعلم
After that, this is Thursday, the Scorpion child
He was bitten, so he grabbed it.
A law that cannot be taken except alone at its level
A needle like it
God will help.
شسوي يا عايشه translates to "Wake up, Aisha"
The minister traveled and all transactions are being converted for me.
Mustafa, the head of the Human Resources Department, will be right with you.
The ministry's statement arrived today
Do you have the program?
Hey, Aisha, I'm all yours now.
Here is Mary

They come from nowhere but the Muslim Brotherhood.
My mother is a nurse
My dear, you must apply compresses so that the swelling doesn't increase.
We warned her and said, "Don't tell them."
She told them to go to hell and they did as she asked.
You would know if you told them you hated it.
I'm tired of you for a long time
You play volleyball.
He broke his neck this time.
Who are you talking to?
The wooden scorpion

My uncle is the only one who can beat Sultan, no one else can.

Selection from the delegation
I appreciate your circumstances.
Give me another chance, please.
I'm being honest with you
Are you interested in big data?
And he was chosen from above
He's right.
Brothers and sisters, and those who are like brothers and sisters to us
It's impossible they'll agree.
I'm surprised by them
Installments are deducted from my salary.
I'm the one who spends on the house
I wish I hadn't said I would travel with him.
We're planning to get her married this week.
What do you say?
The idiot who doesn't even have a middle school certificate
Marry him and travel with him
The path of knowledge, oh God
By God, it's forbidden for them to do what they're doing.
If you raise your voice, they will slaughter you.
Listen, I'm telling you again
I won't go back.
من باجر من باجر ان شاء الله
It doesn't matter to me if you're a Scorpio born of Scorpios.
Even if it's not the case
I don't want to marry on Friday.
I'll go to the kitchen.
Put them in the hall
Tonight is the match between Real Madrid and Barcelona
InshaAllah we won't lose to Valencia

Thank you, may he live long.
Long, long ago, there was a man who traveled.
There is rain there.
Her efforts

May your life be long and prosperous
Good afternoon, Minister
Yes, may you live long.
I washed the dishes
The soul of coffee is the captain Emad's right
Finally, eventually
We're traveling to China tomorrow, we have a match there.
Any Captain Naseeb, after introducing you to my sister Maryam
Where is Uncle going? He's going to his father's. Hope.

Your oil is what got us into this mess that we're in with the committee.
This is a problem, I'm sure it's not a secret.
He stopped us at the unit.
To inform you about art, family values, purposeful art, and the Mudejar arches, whatever that may be.
Here's what they submitted to the committee
The minister is the one who messed up the committee
You, me, and Hamad can influence him, but here's the thing
Impossible
There's nothing that proves it's mine or Alhamdulillah
Even if I go to the Ministry of Economy and ask
We find our names
May God grant you the company, registered in the name of Hamid's wife.
I won't hold back from this side.
Then you can ask the committee chairman, not me.
The last word is decisive.
Hey, everything's great, how are you? How are you?
Tony spoke to them and agreed on everything.
Wa alaikum assalam
السلام عليكم هلا أستاذ راشد تفضّل
You know what I'm talking about, you know that this gathering is dedicated to approving the series "Conscience Rape."
Wahwa is a production of the Modern Art Institute
A weird, bold, action-packed cool series
I am with Hamid
Honestly, the series' story is really beautiful
I'm with you, Hamed
What I found even more surprising was when my mother took the gun and killed our neighbor.
She was about to get scared of the gun, John cut it off in the car.
You don't know that the owner of this car had an action with the police yesterday, so they searched it.
Her son came home from school.
What's up with the cartoon, Briole?
John gives him the strong hot sauce, makes the carton fly, and puts it through his mother's room door.
Surprise gift
Oh my, this clip, this clip and the cartoon were in mom's room
It's wonderful that a local company has advanced to this level of work.
We need to cheer them on and take them with us.
We haven't heard Rashed's opinion yet.
You guys left him in there, Uncle Rashed
With respect to your opinions and impressions about this series called "Rape of the Conscience"
Violation of human values
Surprises and foolishness
Two and a half men in each episode
The text is missing for the next episode.
A series written without social awareness
It does not carry a meaningful message that elevates society.
Tears falling means the audience must cry.
Rashid, if you please
I said my opinion, he said his opinion, she said her opinion, let's ask teacher Rashid for his opinion.
It's clear from the silence
It means I can smell a deal between you.
I'll sort things out
Some people understand this and it's their specialty, and others have no relation to the matter.
I love this series.
I'm afraid he'll get us into trouble and cause us problems.
I have no claim on you.
I'm tired and can't do anything.
I walk my talk
John gives me the juice and says, "This is from Mama Samira."
I don't know what to do anymore
What are you saying, Nasser?
I'm sorry, but the text you provided doesn't seem to be in a language I can translate. It appears to be a mix of Arabic and English words, but it doesn't form a coherent sentence in either language. Please provide a clear and coherent text in a specific language for translation.
I don't know if they are raping their daughters.
We are shown so much good
The first good thing, of course, is this beautiful ring in your hand.
How are you?
The name of Hamad's wife who lost the ring
And of course, my husband's role was to manage things and issues.
5% of the work
Nice role
Tony played a memorable role in the series "Amani Tayeha" (Lost Hopes). He was excellent.
On second thought
This text cannot be translated.
rape of dreams
Why do all the names sound so similar?
You have, for example, most of the series were all about girls.
You find that the series has more than eight girls and ten boys.
Dorje Mzhamon
We have Jam Meshaal.
Oh oh, he stood up after a misunderstanding
Hello Omar
No worries, no worries
Sorry my love, I have to go to work, I'll call you later.
A minute and a soul
He says he needs to see her, it's urgent and important.
I need to go there
I know that Rashid went and met the minister.
He told me he sat with him for half an hour.
He said it, Hadeel, to your detriment
قل لي إنك شكوتنا، أقول لك: حسنًا.
The situation now is that the minister's office is calling me to request something.
I feared after the minister believed him
I am meeting with the minister
The riyal reached its goal, looking at the series
No more
That's true, as long as you live.
But first, I, Minister Sa'ah, wanted to clarify a point, which is not in my nature to talk about a colleague artist with me who is not present
May God protect you, Rashid, and everyone knows this feature in him
He resents everyone around him.
All material benefits
but he is a specialist
Keep your blessings to yourself, not everyone is like that, and if they are, replace them in artistic matters.
especially television works
A series about raping the conscience God save you what we are working on
A bold, monumental work
May God protect you, we will have prior notice
and massive spread
You're experts in this field and know more about it than I do.
Empty condition series Ibiṭ al-Wayh
And it elevates our name above
But what the journalist Abdelhamid wrote is Listen Listen Listen
However, one of the actors commented saying
The series contains inappropriate language.
He laments the decline in moral and artistic taste in the work.
By God, bold words and strong criticism
They will mock your group if you are seen with the journalist Abdul Hamid.
When their words reached the authorities
Some people are smart and know how to handle them.
A gang of thugs
We want to create a private website for us
We put all the company's activities in it
What did the company tell you its name was?
Today and going forward, you are the media advisor.
And it is considered the series "Rape of the Conscience" produced by Mercury Art Production Company.
A qualitative leap in Arab drama
It carries noble ideas and values.
It's a series aimed at developing the community
The journalist Abdul Hamid himself, who has been criticizing them all along
He returned with a reasonable amount of his mother's juice, eighty degrees.
How is it that this Abdulhamid is accepting this situation for himself?
Journalist Abdulhamid Abashin
Rest assured, Professor Hamid
He told me your opinion about the series. The series is a hit across the Arab world.
God hears you
Our artistic sense tells us that our series is going to be a hit.
We don't know where to put it.
He puts his suitcase and leaves.
It all started
You guys are all the things they show in the series, we haven't experienced them in our lives or heard of them.
IBAN is derived from its address
All your creators say hello
It would have been, if it hadn't been.
Wishing you a smooth journey, step by step
What do you think?
It seems he is very happy
We measure up to trivial series
No one can understand it or catch it the first time.
In hidden threads and dimensions, it seeks focus so that one can comprehend what it wants to say.
This work seems to have a political agenda.
It's forbidden to show off to people.
May you be healed
The one who feeds you says you're eating well.
Last night, in the evening, Ali and I were standing in the market.
Sitting in a coffee shop
He gave it to me.
I'm Nasser, I agree with you on this topic. If Saad Al-Wazir is upset, this is a big problem.
During one week, we all stay at home
God and the series are just. Everyone who has seen it says he is a failure.
I heard that Rashid is planning to visit him.
Sure, here is the translation: He definitely tells him, "I didn't tell you that this series is a failure and has no action."
I'm sorry, but I can't translate that.
Please clear the subject.
Nasser Ashbissawi
Listen to me, Eli
From today onwards, no post criticizing the series will be allowed on your page.
Please, Eli.
I submitted the job application a few days ago. There's no feedback yet. I think it's because they're still working on it.
Please, don't make me upset with you
He was sentenced to
I once had a chance
I would never say such words if it were up to me.
I'm glad you enjoyed the series.
Unprecedented success
Goodbye
Allow me, Rashid.
I believe you, not the newspapers.
Rape of conscience in the television industry
Long may you live, this journalist agrees with you
Listen to the second newspaper, two letters
Read, read in the readers' page
My heart stopped.
They only say to cook.
يا أيها الوزير راضي عليكم
By Allah, I swear, ya Nasser
Prepare for the second part of the conscience rape.
I just don't want this to go too far, bro.
First and last series I wrote
I'm fed up with my job, it's driving me crazy. I wish I could quit this job.
Part Two After Hallelujah
Third and fourth
You're not benefiting from what you're doing.
One of the four is sitting in his place
We're in it.
The magician said
to the leader
Happy Eid!
Praise be to God for the success
Doubt is the enemy of success.
I am surprised
How come Evo's got the award, while Baykh and Fail are not?
There are no specialists
We definitely won't let them give us the awards.
We have prepared a second part of the series for you
Insha'Allah, long life
They said a magician is only a magician.
Remembrance of Rape of Conscience Part II
I saw you standing with the minister at the beginning of the event
We agreed after the TV festivals.
Listen to him say they'll prepare later in part two
same thing
Dirty money is deposited into banks to be laundered and comes out clean.
I skip the low-quality, weak, worthless, and trivial series.
Enter them into the Gulf and Arab festivals
So they can wash them, clean them, give them awards, and become high-quality series among people, they clean them.
What's reasonable about it not being reasonable?
The arbitration committees themselves are the parties that produce the series.

But I'm in a situation where I have to develop, as the fans, meaning the public, consider the most important player on the field, player number twenty-six.
He is happy that his parents are visiting him in Iraq again.
We are people who are signing contracts with them
It was when God said to me, "My son, play the first cricket match, I missed it."
Listen to your teacher and obey him.
Anything else
At that time, he wanted to have some fun with his employees, so he made them play together, watch them, enjoy their company, and relax. As a result, he was criticized.
ما قتله لا يأخذ موظفين
You might need employees who are all cut from the same cloth.
The important bakers
Oh my God, may He guide you, may He tear you apart, you take the important loaves after they become
Second time if you take employees say
No no, this deal, let Hamdy review it for me.
Hamdi is in the hospital
How come no one asked about your age?
I'm done with work and I'm going home, I'll take my car.
Listen to me, Nasser. May God lengthen your life. I'm looking at you.
I walked on it.
The goalkeeper who plays with us told me he hasn't seen him, and we have an important match tonight.
We had a goalkeeper who didn't show up and we arrived at the stadium
What did the goalkeeper say?
I've never played soccer or held a soccer ball.
This is a mess
He who is not cautious about it
From tomorrow, you'll find a job for yourself to work in, come on, no excuses, no football, no nonsense.
Let me tell you
You're seeing the best team and the goal is fair.
Yes, that's correct.
I hope Zain will be fine, God willing, but I ask you to pray for him.
Get out the team and ruin the final match
لالالا in this and that is the boy's right
I'm tired
Congratulations on the victory
Nasser Bourita won the cup
We wanted to know how you planned to win
I'm taking care of the team, mentally, physically, and intellectually, and thankfully, the coach hasn't fallen short.
Inside the hotel
Congratulations to all of you, and the party was just as I promised you.
I say your dad is so cool
I'm afraid it's embarrassing and pretentious.
We wish you the best of luck in winning the World Cup, Abu Nasser. May Allah bless you and grant you victory.
The Mighty Triumph
God bless you God bless you No no no
A moment-by-moment picture without a shirt, hold on a second
No.
There's a mistake in the cloak
Without a doubt, your great care, significant interest, and creative ideas played a major role in this victory.
The coach's plan
but in the final he played 5-5-3-2
And you're a great athlete who knows that changing the plan can confuse the players. However, the Bakery team was not confused and put on a great match.
The coach's plan
As the first athlete in the international bakeries, what advice would you give to players?
To the end of time
Hello hello
May you live long.
Long live Hamoud Sultan with them
May God bless them, what an honor to have them join us again for the first time.
Dinner tonight
May God bless you, O father of Abdulaziz
is considered a contribution from the private sector
The team is lost
We wish we could go back
No one cares
Mr. Abdulaziz
Agents we use in the factory
How are you?
This is what you were hoping to learn about.
Football introduced us and I caught his eye
Stop it, you son of Abd Al-Aziz
Stay away from hatred your whole life.
You're the toughest.
I see the soccer ball in my pocket, it's about 50 centimeters away from me, so I'm close to it.
We just arrived, Abu Nasser
Might not come today either, I swear to God.
In a seminar about sports injuries, the platinum sponsor must be present.
I haven't seen anything yet
I saw the building behind the bakeries that was supposed to be workers' housing.
Welcome, he's a soccer fanatic.
Like we always do, dear viewers, before every match, we meet one of the icons of the sport and have a conversation with him
This man, who inspires the bakery team with his great ideas
We heard that your team is undertaking a comprehensive development process.
It's all about these offices and this work.
A measly amount, meaning I'm working all this for just one million dollars.
لا يبه عاد تبحبح اشوي تبحبح Don't be silly, stop babbling, I'm cooking, stop babbling
It was your fault, Haidi, not mine.
It's my fault.
I'm fine, I made a mistake.
But you didn't tell me that players are needed in the Gulf
Prices in the Gulf are reaching astronomical levels.
The player who has 1000 lives
He's in the Gulf, they're offering him three to four million dollars.
فهمني يا سي مسعود اشلون Understand me, Mr. Masoud, how?
Fax stable from me here
I am a human and I exist.
My dad bought four tickets for the team, except for the manual one that has four tickets
He came back with this, look what he has here, this is amazing. I'll put you Pelé and Ronaldinho, all this is in his treasure trove.
12 wishes
Correct, correct, my brother. This is God's price. May He bless you. He had it from a Turkish club.
2.8 million
What are you looking at me for?
Can we check the glasses?
Sure, here is the translation: Of course, your grandfather
The man's duck
All of that
I'll give you everything wrapped up.
Mashallah, she's so cute.
This is a pivot, this is a fulcrum
The voracious shark
This dark, heavy ball is the most important thing for a player if you choose it after it has no use.
I fell short
We are trying to get Adryioulak to send them to us. The club is the one that matters. I am the one that matters.
Call them.
Let's go, Hamdi.
Little by little
May God protect you, little ones
I am indeed bringing them from the jungles of Africa, I swear to them.
They grazed them, they raised them, they fattened them, then they returned them, they brought them down in the arenas.
I didn't ask for anything. I didn't ask for your anger. Take it, Yaba. Take it. There's space in the car, or I'll take you in the pickup.
They saw us as a threat.
The striker scored.
Kakakanoa Makalali Dandhu Lae
The defender descended
Cashew monkey will lolololo this guy who goes down
Our coach is a cheater.
Insha'Allah on Mars
Not Spain, hopefully on Mars
I liked the way he read the match reports.
This is going off track.
The match has its principles
Insha'Allah, in two days
Heal your voice and keep it going strong
He was born in Spain
He wants to convince himself that the coach is a red and doesn't understand football.
Listen listen Mitsu says stay
It is known that the struggle attacker Silolwathakwawa is from the Gaza region, as stated by Ahmed Al-Tayyeb, and it is known where he is based.
Your head will be spinning
Stay away, you.
I know how to deal with that coach.
Why did the team retreat? Why?
The coach sitting there now will make the international bakery center team think he's changing half of the match field
Players don't play in their positions
The player Takulamakakukulalalalu is not in his natural position, he must move to the place where he always plays.
The coach's right words change it
Kukunali Huboway Malalo
Insha'Allah Insha'Allah Insha'Allah
I'm just sitting around, being lazy.
The one who is sitting will not be the lucky one if he is not between the team manager.
Coach of the team
There's something I want to tell you after the game
The time is now, everyone is a spectator, everyone is a performer, and the show is in front of the camera.
The ball is in play, so the fourth goal for Al-Najah team.
He scores the fourth goal and he is the star of the match today
The coach is riding his head.
His words are final. Uncle Bonasser wants you to be the real coach of his team.
And you, what did you say after hearing?
I'm watching the match on TV, and you're sitting on the bench of the substitutes, and what I'm about to say will happen.
My dear child, don't let your spirit be troubled, it's not beautiful.
الآن باجرب عندنا مباراة. أشلون نلعب بدون مدرب؟
What are you doing, dad?
Enough, Rashid.
My dear, my heart's child, console me, tell me to console.
Divorce me, mom, divorce me
How are you? How are you?
Mama, my mama, Mama
How have you been since we got married a month ago?
By the Almighty, I don't know, I don't know what
It means that I and Al-Tariq are divorced.
Mom, mom
I swear to God Almighty, I don't know what happened to me, he came to me and said, "Get up, go to your people's house."
He kept asking why, I said it's over, I divorced you, you're divorced.
I don't know what happened in the past, I swear to God.
People say we're a mismatched couple getting a divorce
I'm with you
I swear, I'm fed up with you
I didn't even know he divorced her until now, from you.
Sit for a minute and say goodbye.
Her high morals
Barcelona Saturday
Abdullah's personal view
Yani returned with a tear on his cheek
He says, "I left Barcelona and came here to die in this team. He respects him a lot."
You hurt him and wounded his feelings
He told his mom, "I left Barcelona, I told her it's over, let her handle the divorce. He'll bring you someone else."
He said your daughter got divorced because she left Barcelona's team.
Get her out of your group because of this reason.
I don't need anything from you.
It's an easy emotional wound.
His wife accuses her husband of disloyalty.
I'm the most honest person you'll hear.
The girl who doesn't respect global differences doesn't belong with us
This time, he made fun of Messi.
الصراعات بين الزوجين تزداد والمفروض نحن
Change the unit to
The girls are wide and my daughter is the only one, I hope.
Listen to me, daughter of people.
I keep hearing nothing.
And that's why I told you, don't go in there, my child, I know it's not right.
We told you not to enter.
I've been so angry at you.
ولا يهمك يا أمي لا اتحط في بالك Don't worry about me, Mom, don't let it bother you
Change the unit to
I'll smash their faces in later.
But no matter how much you try to fulfill her word
Real Madrid is better than Barcelona
Present my love
Poor thing, heal her, please.
Hi, my name is Mena.
I got married a month ago and got divorced.
I won't go to you on purpose, why didn't you inform me? I'll die laughing.
We're going to take care of our interests together.
No benefit, my dear, with a guy like this. Divorce him once and for all, for the sake of the soccer team.
I've heard about his past, no way I'm getting involved with him or getting stressed out with someone like that.
You're so stupid, you don't even deserve half of these certificates that you don't even have.
How do you say to them that I am not in agreement
Let her say what she wants.
Blessings be upon you
Death to her, death to her, my sons, do not cut off her sustenance
لو على رزقها طقاق ايطقها If she depends on her sustenance, she will be content with it
Her sustenance and ours were cut off.
The building over there
I'm not saying no.
My sufficiency is in Allah against this vile Halkovera, mother of the Sualf and the Hajji.
Rumors they hear and spread.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Understand her and tell her not to cut off the path of goodness that opens up for us.
He knows how to convince her.
You're being silly now, so you're saying you believe Real Madrid let Barcelona go just like that?
Leave the bad boys alone and don't become like them.
I don't recognize the opportunity when I see it
And she instilled it in him, the reason, and there's something or a flaw that made him call her.
Listen to me, daughter of the people, don't go overboard with Bou Brjin.
A year and a half after the two towers
However, they soon discover they are two towers
They named his father Shahin Bu Burjin
God gives life
I'm so sweet, thank you, Magsy
I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean.
Your life is over, they've asked and you've agreed, and the money has been spent.
Your focus is not centered and it's clear that you have a lot on your plate. This has been going on for a month now.
This is the first anniversary of the wedding. Now, it's Abdullah's new wedding.
He was previously married and divorced.
By Allah, this is the third wedding this year
This is your usual nonsense, you idiot.
Real, this is a tough generation
The opinion and the other opinion
Congratulations, congratulations, oh mother
Don't forget to take the fur coat I put on top of the suitcase.
To take it in your hand while you're on the plane
My son went down to London
Hey, are you guys planning to go to London?
Hello, my dear
No more nonsense.
So she comes with us and does some shopping for once
Malaysia
Malaysia, take the fur with you
Goodbye, Yama
Heal her right now
I'm proud
This is the old God, ask his eye, do not look at his face.
I'm feeling a bit down today.
He put in it what he gave her.
A girl from Ahiya
You're not even the most famous honey, she looks at you with her eyes, serves you, and her little world.
It's reasonable, it's a rule, and you're pouring it out.
I don't like that cup, don't bring it and don't pour for me.
Alone, not worried
I was born to her, I am the one my mother breastfeeds with her own hands.
Heal her, please.
She was deeply saddened by it.
This is what she has with her.
Hi, her name is Mashael.
Poor thing, she found out during the honeymoon
I won't be bored if you call me.
May God bless you, my aunt. Greetings to you.
I'll miss my aunt's advice after you're gone.
I don't know where my mom booked us.
Welcome, my mother
Where did you book us?
I'll go with her, there.
There is no power nor strength except with Allah
Break it up gently at the airport and break it up with the kids
There are differences among them
Right now you're asking me to differentiate between them
By God, I miss him/her.
A man and his wife
She was in her room, talking to herself with that crazy reality.
Now she tells us that she has been calling him for two days and he is not answering.
I only met him now
We're waiting to see what's going on.
He's saying that Mazayek's son is tired from outside and wants to rest his hand.
Every day I tell her to peel me an apple, and she never does. Every day she makes me mad.
You later realized I don't like apples with their skin on.
Any apple that is peeled
I say
You are divorced.
And again, if necessary
O soul, O gaze of my eye
I sacrifice myself for you
Hey there, Manirah, you're looking tired.
Stop teasing me after that.
I have contacted him three times, tell him "I divorce you."
Shut up and mind your own business
My mother, may she be blessed, took me to the disco in Spain and he went and said that.
He doesn't have anything left from before.
Anything true has a past.
I'll dance two dances for her, three.
After that, whoever wants to marry my daughter, I will only let God do it.
How are you?
Come here, where are you going?
He's gone, may his soul rest in peace. He had so much in him, but he didn't care.
She has a peacock-like tail.
Set with gold, ruby, coral, and amethyst
Girls are a game for some men and some boys.
They don't even have mothers to mourn them.
They have a refrigerator at home.
We unleashed them as we pleased
What you drank, what you released, it caused Barcelona to release her, let her go.
The one who's going to dance

My son is the one who obtained the license
Allah has accepted; may He bless you in you.
Congratulations on the license, ya Saqr
May God bless you

Your request won't get a response if you say "tamam".
Just say "done" for as long as you live.
A gift from me to him
The one who made you submit, don't reject me
I'm busy
It means you're fine, I met him and told him to buy it.
You won't become a cheater.
What's wrong with you, Uncle Nasser?
How do you think I handled it?
I was served by circumstances
We're sitting at his place
Good son, Saqr, take the license.
I have a gift for Saqr.

I say, Yad, this is a new employee we have.
You've been around for a while, but you sent a car for repair and they took my car because she's an ad agent for a company that's going under and didn't bother to get rid of the car.
You might need your car
I don't need the car at all today.

Some people are just naturally inclined towards business; they love it.
You're right, Doctor.

Of course, that depends on upbringing.
No worries, Doctor.

Hello
What's wrong, Nasser?
I called Mohamed and he told me that Uncle Nasser is hospitalized.
He told me once that you guys listen that a falcon's son wants to take over his father's car dealership.
The agency flew away from you.
You can never satisfy the world.
The father is the one who helped him so he could open the market.
He's the one who opened his eyes to trade.
The doctor says his condition is very serious.
That's how it goes.
There's nothing that doesn't happen.
Hurt him back, not supported at work, I'm telling you, divorce her, I mean divorce her.

How are you, Anoud?
No no no no no
You said the dress would be ready in a week. Yesterday, I received a message saying it would be ready in ten days.
You want him to take a break, have a rest, and more.
Insha'Allah, now I'll play with Anoud and have fun.
Why are we so few?
لا لا لا لا العالم غاضب لا وما غاضب عنود

Please come in, Fadi
Thank you, brother Fadi
Sure, here is the translation: "Which dress should Fadi wear this week? He's taking the dress. Goodbye."
How can I help you?
Sure, here is the translation: "Please iron the dress at home."
I didn't like it.

It means we lost.

We were forced to return to our country.
Sure, here is the translation: "Okay, you pay."
I'll pay for it.

My mother wants to go out
Do you believe, O Umm Nasser?
They had six days before a customer would take their place.
لا واليوم العصر ابشرج ما افتحوا مره وحده صكوا No and today afternoon I swear they never opened it once they just hit it
If you hear that it's for sale
Piece by piece
They can't even sit outside.
I'm done, I'll drink and go to him.
Where is God coming from, where am I coming from, where is he coming from? What is this problem?
You seem to have a grudge against something.
May God protect you from anyone who intentionally causes harm to the place with bad intentions.
These are chemical materials
Are you sure someone has a bad smell in the store?
You're all like the children of Uncle, some older, some younger, they're all treated the same.
This means that the night is cold and the smell is unpleasant in the place.
What do you think I smell like? You guys.
About the mistake
You yourself are the one who pledged to the police
I don't understand
I'm here.
Prepare a hellish plan for him
No one can hold you back.
By God, everything is natural.
What's confusing me
I don't know what's happening, I swear this is the fourth day we haven't had any customers or orders.
I don't know this place, the second place, let me find out what it is, God willing.
Dr. Washqallaj
I see the store is empty, no owner or customers.
I don't know if I should tell him the truth or lie to him.
The women and girls don't all head towards the store.
I'll tell you, I'll do magic, the designer Saad Wahsh template

Magic exists and that's a fact.
Zein Allo is now lying down or sitting.
Get in, man! I'm scared the ceiling will collapse.
You lost, Sultan. You lost.
My mother brought it.
It's a beast
Treat yourself, bro. I won't stop until I die.
My mother doesn't know what they are doing.
Teach me, my love, to do it so they say to you, "He's on his feet, they're helping him financially and he's paying off his debts."
The designer who has

You said to him, you said to him
ما تدرون وين راح Where do you think you're going?
The stars are shining, the stars are shining, The nightingales are singing, they're dancing their dances.
Call the Real again, maybe he has a bag.
What's up, Uncle Ahmed?
What's up, Uncle Ahmed? You're back here and leaving the drill running. Tell me what's going on. Where are the extras you promised to bring?
Get off my case, it's better for you. I called him and he's on my head until I ask teacher Abdullah.
Firstly, I won't yell because we're actors. We need to relax a bit, we need to focus on our roles. Secondly, Real Madrid called me several times. They offered me...
Shit shit shit shit He says, "Oh, teacher Abdullah" Shit says
Hey Mr. Abdullah, what should I do? This guy is ruining the scene and he's blaming me for it.
Come on guys, come on you beauties, the next one, the next one
Heh heh heh, oh teacher, n n n n we'll finish, but this rehearsal that's not working, it doesn't capture the scene at all.
What do you want someone to shout at you, Zain Jidhi?
Finish your work quietly and without shouting
That's our whole situation, screaming from morning; we need to focus.
I found a solution for you.
I hope you're doing well. I think you should take care of yourself now. It's a beautiful scene, God willing. I'll get you an actor who will do the role right.
He's been working on the same scene for ages.
But this scene is the most important scene in the series
Sorry, but you didn't send any pictures.
But if you were ready, I would have done it today.
Above the youth, oh God
What's up with a Filipino guy?
You never knew me as Walid, did you? He's always saying someone who reminds him of the cabaret must be from the cabaret and Egyptian.
Sir, I'll put a hat on him, but he won't keep it on, you know.
You're being childish, you're acting foolish, you're just being ridiculous. This is not acceptable, respect people's feelings, respect people's intelligence.
You're carrying everything on your shoulders, Alaa. Delegate tasks and relax.
Give it to me so I can think with my mind, maybe Rima can remember someone from the neighborhood
From menu
Remember Ahmed, one in Frij Esltlh named Saud Aknar
Saad Akennar and no one else
Saudi Qawati said
The hole in your pocket wants a rich man and your fear is feeding it.
My love, finally, a supporting actor, meaning a rich guy and his wife gives him a supporting role.
But Rima's makeup is a bit messy, and she needs a clean coat, dress, and a decent car.
InshaAllah it will be beneficial.
How do we get there?

How are you, my dear? There's nothing but this jet lag that my uncle brought back from his trip
You don't have anything but what you're wearing.
I feel like I'm suffocating under my clothes.
The gang is waiting for me at the door to complain
God, God, may you be successful, my dear
It means today you're on the air and they're filming you on TV.
They said on TV that I'm one of the big guys
Sit down, you fool
Come here, Ash, this is on you

I hope, I hope he does a good job, he's trying hard so they give you a longer role next time.
How are your parents?
A happy person was captured on the edge of the first
Oh no, oh no, are you Saudi?
I started wearing glasses.
The slave has grayed.
I won't change my mind, I regret nominating you.
The one who is being prepared to play the role of Abu Abdulaziz
Hey, my friend! Hello, by God, hello, hello!
This is our exit, Mr. Ghafil, so we'll stop here.
The most important thing is that you're not afraid of the camera.
My brother, I fear none but my Lord.
Just relax and listen to the director's instructions. Hopefully, he'll tell you what to do.
Brother, brother, if you don't mind, you'll play one role in the cabaret, one of the singers. Do you understand or not?
Come here, boy. Come here, boy.
I'm talking to you
This one is light, the room needs a heavy one.
All is acceptable to some people
Why did you move away?
Sure, here is the translation: "Hey, take this mirror for taking pictures. Listen, take the makeup room key and go to the room."
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Please come.
We got to know her as a habitual offender.

Imagine yourself as the frankincense merchant
What are you saying?
I'm telling you, be patient, don't rush, I won't disappoint you, Mr. Abdulaziz, you're Mr. Abdulaziz, just say.

Why don't I tell you to leave?
You're as cool as ever, I swear. May God protect you. Peace and blessings be upon the Prophet, peace be upon him.
Clean your room
How are you? What's up?
Sir, the house owners are asking us to evacuate and want the hall. We will not allow the scenes being filmed in the hall, and then we will photograph the gaps outside.
How are you? What's up?
Yes, they are coming, they are coming, but wait, they are filming a different scene and we are behind them, hopefully.
Leave them alone, iPhone is coming for you.

Here you go
You should get them something for the graduation.
What's up, bro?
Look at the thing that's causing us to fail
His car is a piece of junk.
On our own, let's go
This is all part of the service, they eat it.
Let's go to the park.
Say it like you saw it.
This is the premium class for high-end people

Congratulations, congratulations
Welcome to Abha
The small hall's fence and the food for Glagah
Ferry Geb
the lam of the said wedding at the Asaad house
Sure, here is the translation: Of course, everyone says the same thing.
I'm afraid of this.
My love, my darling
I'm saving up my money.
I don't care what people say
Let's go to the park.
We would be grateful if you could provide us with something suitable for us according to our circumstances.
There are people who borrowed money and others who sold their houses and cars just to have a lavish wedding and not to be talked about.
You just need to learn from the past and that's enough. The sufficient is what you want, we failed in it.
You yourself said that the manager admired the Chinese and wished her the house
You guys chose the hall and the couch, and you prepared everything, so go ahead.
Insha'Allah, we'll see what we choose.
It doesn't mean anything, but I'm saying the place we went to was expensive, its price was wide, reasonable.
This is the place where I had my wedding at home, right?
Someone used it before
By God, to be honest, just once
May the long-lived Aba'ras have a blessed daughter.
I don't feel like doing anything.
We are the first people in the world to use the Abi Koussa.
What do you want to stand out?
I'm fine, and you?
Hedi Al-Kousha enters Qatar for the first time
Inspired by the information age, meaning Facebook and Twitter
Modern, more talkative
Price of the couch including accessories
Hello, it's for you, Yaha, but not from 52,000.
Yallah yallah, look how fancy everything is, our money isn't enough. Everything is more luxurious, better, and unique. Look at all this, it all costs money.
All people are equal.
Shut up and whoever saves you
The sky is blue.
ما الذي أعجبك في هذا؟
The ship of Noah
Two of them are ancestors, but the most expensive is Noah's Ark for 20,000.
I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
Be quiet, you! My father is Noah's ship
Here are the weddings and their costs. Do you see us as middle-class people?
You need to prepare 50,000 cups of water and 50,000 plates. These are the ones you booked, the Royal Hall, as per your request.
We didn't say it was magic, but the appearances deceived everyone. Everyone wanted to surpass the second one, and everyone wanted to do better than the second one except for him.
The only beneficiaries of the battle of appearances are the owners of celebration halls.
Those who know that everyone wants to stand out exploit us and underestimate us.
I know a friend of mine whose brother has a wedding hall.
He says the sofa costs 200 riyals.
I didn't lie, I swear to God, his father may he succeed.
Enough, the man is acting up.
Just like others before you, young people who got married and behaved.
Hello, Dr. May you live a long life
How are you?
I know you love to stand out
And that's why I'm like this
For the first time, it comes to Qatar, designed by world-renowned artist Peter Salerno

With the ark of Noah's ship, something very nice comes out
There's not a single one of us in Qatar who hasn't used the nine planets at some point.
Enough, man!
25,500
No conclusion.
May God give you tranquility
Thank you.
You're spending a lot, and I'm your brother.
I generally think I couldn't handle all eighty of them.
All I could do, sixty thousand, twenty thousand, I took them from my brother.
ما قصرت ما قصرت والله يا أخوي يا فهد I didn't fall short, I didn't fall short, I swear by God, my brother, oh Fahd
Oh, my dear Fahd, oh, my dear, as long as we are proud and you are showing off at the wedding, we are sixty donkeys.
Without appearance, without adornment
You'll definitely receive the cards you mentioned.
InshaAllah, we'll start with the cards this week.
If our wedding turns out to be better than theirs
The cards that Jovi's son is making for the wedding
Where does this guy live?
People now travel to countries just to get wedding cards
Aminah's family went to Italy, designed the cards, printed them, and brought them back, and Aminah's house.
People are going to France even those who don't have a penny, and if they go to Lebanon, they go to Lebanon and bring their cards.
We're not going to deviate from the country's path.
Why and which country are you planning to travel to, hopefully?
We have some awesome Wide cards
She's a very expensive girl.
No one has been as exceptional as her before.
Zahra is not sweet.
I say gold is better, it shines more.
Brother, it seems he can't afford the wedding expenses.
He dug his own grave.
And leave us with this nonsense and nonsense at the wedding and the things that are of no use.
The only ones benefiting from our mental exhaustion are hotels and wedding venues.
Poor thing
Leave me alone, let me go. It's forbidden for me to find someone who wants me.
May you live long with your stick
لا تتقصر يا ناصر
Hey, groom's family, after the congratulations, who's staying with you?
Just once, just one time.
I mean, we don't necessarily need a grand ballroom in a fancy hotel.
Our daughter is better than any girl you might find on the street or elsewhere.
Everyone is aware of this issue.
Who told you I got married?
At least some people don't have this arrogance.
It's all simple parties and expenses as usual.
And then come on, Real, these days people are having wedding parties on Facebook
أرخص وأقل تكلفة
You mean you're not married to your siblings?
Forget your appearance here
I'll spin again
If you want to do something for my son Abdullah's wedding, please guide me or Nawal.
I look better than her.
I say my darling
Madame Voldge has a national insurance number that we gave her after contacting her.
Bye my love, don't be short on anything. Goodbye.
We were agreed, dude, on this DJ, he's really good.
I wish I were better than I am.
You forgot who you are and who we are.
The younger they are, the better they do than us.
The topic isn't important, but I'm worried about my brother Saleh. He's breaking my heart and I don't want to pressure him.
You've broken my heart.
Oh my!
When is the hospital appointment and which hospital?
Our mother has dropped a bombshell on us.
I heard that, John is going to drop on us
He didn't have a previous one, so he didn't know what to do after preparing everything and people started saying it's not a wedding.
He wants us to fail.
Dr. Ha Ashqal
He wants us to fail, my sister. He wants to cancel the wedding.
Insha'Allah, nothing but good will happen.
Don't burn her heart
You're the real deal, you're the one who brings the money.
Soul, soul, wind of her heart
By God, if I say all this truth about Yusuf, it will stop his heart.
ما تدرى الوزير ليش امخلي بويوسف للحين
He's been retired for three or four years, I think.
There's nothing that helps me
You're right by God, I'm not awake yet.
You understood I've been a young man since then
Leave it, let him keep the papers and receipts until you get your money back.
This is called cooling delay.
I don't know why you're talking like that. What, are you scared?
There's nothing to it, and in the end, I'll return the money.
I know they're watching me I know they're watching me
The engaged, the organized
Uncle, uncle, I tried but there's no other way.
Your gift and the subsequent financial audit
Their condition is for God, so the scrutiny does not please me. Hurry, hurry.
Love, love, love so fast
Love, I've devoured it, devoured it.
We'll be in the hall by 7:30 PM inshallah to welcome the guests.
We were never there in the first place
The talk of the whole town will be my son's wedding.
Surprise
Decorate, my dear Fatima, I want to talk to her
I'm worried about you, my son. They might envy you if you show off your wealth in your traditional attire.
He's got a nice long coat.
The police are coming
O Allah, make it good.
Six of you are like brothers to me.
حَسْبِيَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكَ يَا صَلُوحُ
Your marriage is a divorce.
Birdcage with lock when prison cage
They found the papers I hid for the bail. Oh God, now they've caught on to me and stopped me.
Why are you bothering yourself?
I've heard bigger than that
Returned Sangoul
Respected, dedicated employee
The Ministry of Labor has contracted a company to carry out maintenance.
The employee, out of his dedication to his work, went to ask about the materials.
She met him at 10,000 riyals.
1,800,000
The minister will go and punish Lala, I don't believe this talk
Why don't you believe me?
This is Saad and Saad has arrived
He must have the full news.
He was fired from his job.
Statistics of the world and values
Why don't you call the library manager?
He said: "Khaled Hamad instead of Osman"
Prohibited thereafter
daughter of the same company's manager where I applied for the maintenance job
The one who Osman revealed
This doesn't make sense.
You're all surprised, aren't you, Saleh?
Nobody owns the company.
Who has it?
We've become a source
What do you say?
About the uprightness of this poor employee, Osman, and his mistake
His fault is that he is a trustworthy and dedicated employee.
The manager is currently in his office.
ما الذي حدث أمس؟
Heal her, world.
We have observed strange shapes
I'm with you, Uthman. He doesn't deserve it, but there's no other way.
It's a shame that you've been with him for so long, having seven children, and he still doesn't have a marriage license.
Where is he hiding? He's been out of work for ages. Where can he show his face? Where is he going?
You saw what happened
The female employee whom the minister appointed
The plain of Uthman's office and Uthman the poor wanted to take his belongings and she prevented him, she said to him, "Go and I will spread your belongings with the bed."
It's time.
The tables have turned, Osman
This is the last one
The will of God and what He willed to do
Blessings be upon God
May God be generous, O Osman. May God not leave you, inshallah. Goodbye.
It's possible that your voice doesn't sound natural.
I know, I know you're very sensitive
I can't, I swear I don't feel like continuing. I'm done, I'm leaving.
I'll miss my mom and I'll go back to the village.
I'm back, I don't want to see your ugly face
I wish I could cry for you, I am your mother
I am screaming, I am howling
Listen, it's normal, my dad, you're riding with him, your dad's brother.
Where do you live now that the world has changed?
I miss you, mom
شلو
People have been liberated, the world has become a small village. Where do you live?
However, it's tough
Keep up with the times and make the most of your time, don't fall behind.
Nazli Al-Aghras, hurry up, please cancel the shaving appointment, please extend the eyelash appointment, please, Scree adjust
Hope what's good, Saleh, heal you
You're not yourself today.
And so she screamed at the maid, who had done nothing wrong.
You'll realize they've been unfair to me, I swear.
I'm feeling broke.
To forget the misery that dried you out
My love, I can't write
Dad, I'm cooking today with za'atar.
We are delighted to have you with us for a long time.

Correct, long-lived one.
Tell me the benefits of the employee who doesn't take bribes
What's the point?
I want all of you
There is no place for us here for the dedicated, principles, and outdated values.
I might one day discover
There is no one to blame but himself
We don't take any blame at all.
So that I can count on your cooperation
لو شكيتوا If you doubted
Keep me posted
Thieves and children of thieves, and of course, our women are not to blame.
Noura, if there's even one day I don't take a bribe, the government will come and take my house.
Mashallah Mashallah, enough already! Look at this mamoul from you all. I don't have any, but all of you do. I want you all to be like that.
May God bless you
So my dad can leave the procurement department and become my office manager
You honestly knew how to choose, you chose the right thief for the right place.
Enough, Umm Saud, enough, don't torture me anymore.
I didn't want to go to prison.
My sufficiency is in Allah against Satan, who has caused me to err and made the trust appear fair to me.
He said, "Become trustworthy."
You're a real piece of work, kid
Act with honesty and sincerity
You've lived your whole life as a thief and been comfortable.
I've become noble
Let me solve it with Abu J.
I'll bear it, do it again one more time
One walks, his master begs, he eats, and he lives comfortably.
My father is in jail because all his money is ill-gotten.
Enough, enough

We are a respectable family.
Mabrouk 'alayj

Why not?
You are neither alive nor modest.
Cover up, bro.
In those days, she was shy.
I wish I could make you laugh
Jovie produces her own work.
In a respectable unit, one would wear such an outfit.
I'll walk down the street inshallah without showing any part of my body.
I don't want you to listen to what people say.
I'm not falling short in it.
يايبه لها ذيك الثياب الشفافه اللي ما يحتاي Hey, she's got those see-through clothes that don't cover much
Beware if you see him, he hasn't worn pants under his robe in days.
And whoever is warned, is preserved.
We are praying to God to keep you safe.
InshaAllah, just games and secrets.
He visited his father
I miss you, my grandfather
Where can we find an honest riyal like this?
I don't respect my uncle, I'm black and what?
My dear daughter Sarah, she is the most precious to me, and I wish for her future.
It doesn't mean that there are listeners for it.
Praise God, Mashallah, I heard she got married
I'll be home at 3:30 PM.
It's almost 5 AM, praise God
Yo yo, what's up
Come take me from the bar
Get your shit together and come pick me up from the bar.
This is the first time I'm leaving my son and I can't hear his voice.
Come on, stop moving, do your job properly, come on, wait.
I love you too
I love you, I've disappeared, disappeared, disappeared.
Basically, my father is here.

I'm sorry, but I can't translate that.
Introducing my best friend Maged
Abdulaziz wasn't impressed by that boy friend before him.
Hello, I'm Colt. Hello, I'm a chance, a weed.
Arab and Israeli satellites
Many Palestinians have not trimmed their nails.
In accordance with the commitments made by the State of Palestine in the comprehensive peace agreement
Generally, the United Nations meets today to decide on Israel's request to send special teams to inspect the Palestinian people's fingers
If their nails are long, otherwise not.
There was a condition: nothing in Palestine should provoke, irritate, or cause bloodshed.
State of Palestine
I call on the entire international community to visit Palestine.
The Comprehensive Peace Agreement
We make it from cork.
The figs, you scoundrel!
It's five o'clock, it's five o'clock, it's five o'clock, it's five o'clock
We, the people of Nakhon and our Arab brothers, demand that the international community
Inspection teams for Palestinian nails
And now we begin voting
The girl has reached the level of her father.

You must have a strong personality, Rashid.
It's now, bro, that school you always go to is starting with a new semester.
I am a teacher like you.
I wish I had changed my school when I started teaching.
Any character you like
The problem is that his personality is weak.
The most important teachers he has with him, based on his opinion

He was never going to write anyway, let alone mayonnaise.

All he's afraid of is telling the truth about his father
You said his father is traveling.
A woman traveler said, "My father is gone, meaning they took him away, they said he traveled."

Peace be upon you
Standing for the inspector Sitting
Yes, sir
Come on, sir, come on, sir.
I'm no longer upset.
I'm not joking, Zoul, I'm asking you to finish your statement.
You're belittling yourself and the teaching profession this way. Either finish it or don't, but don't leave it hanging like this.
Enough, enough, Zain Zain
Raise your voice a bit more
I will raise my voice. First of all, I know this boy was born from

You're late, you brought time with you.
Respect yourself, it's better for you, and take extra lessons even if they're forced upon you. May you be pleased or how are you?
Later, you go, go, go, get up and shine.
InshaAllah, we'll be out soon.
How are you, we told you, my boy, people
You need to stop at a certain point.
Just a moment, everyone, just a moment

After I delayed, I hurried to go out. Come on, hurry up, hurry up.
First thing when your appointment decision as a minister comes out, immediately resign. You have a nice job.
I don't know how to say "come and take the job" in English.
Here are some job options, and I'll choose the most suitable one for you.
Brother Minister
I swear, I haven't enjoyed the calls I've been receiving.
Mashallah, everyone is blessed
They say, "Oh my God, he's lost his mind."
This is a normal thing, every minister does his job and his team automatically follows.
I'm fine on this side. Don't worry, nice to meet you too. Have a C in.
We all know I'm becoming a minister
Spray me with tire paint
Our best days are treasures that open up for us.
Welcome back
Allah bless all the people who went to support the Minister Al-Yadid
Yalla yalla yalla
Congratulations on your efforts, Minister
Long live His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, congratulations.
Congratulations, Minister, you deserve it.
You deserve it, Minister Saad.
May we be able to bear the responsibility, brothers. God willing.
On their word, a coincidental choice befell their people
You went out after I told you to call Salim.
I was far from him, grilling.
Don't worry about it.
The love story that happened to him once
It's very easy for Sultan.
Sure, here is the translation: "Oh yes, he won the car door."
Enough for you that you fell short.
Waiting for our brother to become a minister
They said, "Go away, mom, you're the one who didn't believe me."

After Rilha died, he said that I was the one who killed him.
May He conceal, may He conceal
You've got nothing important to say.
Get up, let's go, don't be lazy, get up, let's go.
I don't mean anyone in particular.
Take it easy, you.
I just gave them a piece of my mind because they were provoking me.
Does anyone have a right?
I just didn't want to say all this, Mom. You know, Mom, you're embarrassing us.
Anything you hear, you spread, they call it gossip. We don't want the scandal.
I'll find you a replacement if they take you away.
I asked
You'd be the first one in line.
I never thought they would take it away from you at all.
I'm not sure about that.
Afa Alij sees his shadow like he used to see it before.
He's charming.
The plan I have in mind is well-organized and effective.
Plan of burning and stopping
All activities are prohibited in the country.
That's the hour it burns and it comes to him the burning comes to him the pause comes to him the pause. The caravan is fine.
I swear, bro, I don't know, how would I know, I can't tell you
Your current state is called patriotism, reflecting your love for the country.
You mean you're scared of me?
You are a statesman today, you have to be in the picture.
You must participate in everything. Forgiveness is long-lived. Forgiveness. Forgiveness.
Before I forget, thank you for the sheep you sent me yesterday.
Long live the old man, this is a simple sheep, it's not on your level, long live him. You've lived long, are you coming with me today?
Where is the riyal going?
You teach the truth openly
I want to go
Millet millet from the rice millet
You're the minister today, correct your speech and act as you say. You're a social personality, act your age.
God has made this good money subservient to you
Welcome, welcome, welcome
I can't imagine me
Give give
Today, my friend, is like an evening and a wedding. If it claps, it claps with its mother's picture.
I'll bring you something nice later, I'll bring it to you.
I heard you organized a great educational activity
Any empty space shines I am its father, it shines Shines, shines To polish the world I am the shine of this
Congratulations, congratulations! May your bicycle be blessed. In sha'a Allah, may your picture be blessed. The minister gave a picture, gave a picture. I, I will not go far, give.

National Participation
Remember Allah
This is the fourth friend of mine calling me today.
Everyone praises your activities, Khaled. You're called the active social activist.
Yesterday, I heard a word that hurt me.
Yesterday, Sultan took me to a party.
The celebration of the seedlings' swimming victory
One man, one vote.
I don't hear them.
The minister says
I want to buy a birthday gift for my nephew.
Hello hello
I will put you in the newspaper every day, Dad.
Right, right
What are you doing, Wajed Noor Baba? You want me to do it, Baba?
No worries, I'll cover it. No problem.
Your minister's words don't mean anything, and I won't be swayed by them.
I am I, Minister Bousalah
I'm waiting for him to give me a place.
He made me sit in the first row and went to his car to relax.
I don't want anything from him, God will guide him.
I'll be back, God willing, and may He have mercy on my parents. I'll call you later to confirm.
You have started to connect from within yourself.
People are sitting down making us discounts
I told you
The work is very beautiful
He came back, this iodine.
Allah is the greatest. I bear witness that there is no god but Allah. I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and messenger. Come to prayer. Come to success. Allah is the greatest. There is no god but Allah.
Hello, hello, Minister's effort
I swear I'm exhausted today.
Sure, here is the translation: "Alright, if you have that enthusiasm, Tamer."
You're the best, but my brother Saad will pick you up and hopefully find you a great event.
Throw a party
Today, Lala has no activities.
Wallah, there isn't.
Where can I get oil?
Thank you, thank you very much
I say no one asks him
May the spirit of God be with you
I tell you to lie down and relax
A moment of joy
InshaAllah, anything will do.
What's up
at a later time
A mere speck in the compartment, and the hollow is just a picture, leave it as a small picture in it, just a collection of images.
يالله زين يالله مع السلامه Come on, let's go. Goodbye.
I missed you
I hope to participate in the reserve league match, God willing, I will go to the field.
This minister has decided for us
Reached the peak
It's over, the end is near, damn it's been a long time.
Your whole life has become more famous than you.
Live long if you go somewhere and take advantage of it.
Long live
Shining star
I'll clean it and return it to its original size.
Arrived, arrived, arrived the minister, arrived the minister
I can't imagine, I can't imagine, I swear to God, if one of you takes a picture of me, I'll break you all, I'm not even coming down.
Brooke broke Kim's camera while taking a picture.
Hello, how are you?
I missed the train, as they say.
This is my brother's eternal one.
There is no power nor strength except with Allah
Why are you like this?
This is my first time flying.
First time I'm seeing you
First time in years
Where
This is my eternity.
Come over, my love, come over to me.
I'm used to it, you know.
لا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله. رديتي على نفس السالفه
Get out, I'm telling you, get out, don't just sit there blowing up my head. I'm going back from the wedding at 3 AM.
Just let me relax, it's not that old.
Your brother's sons
By the Almighty, I will tell the truth. My father, Shamsi, has become a demon to you, and his sons are demons to you.
It was as if he was just playing.
Eey was playing, I tell you, with gothic makeup and was playing in it.
But this is Saud, I know him well.
Come back, Khaloud, and may everyone be like him.
On these posters and the bugs that he shows to his brother
Hey my loves, come say hi
How are you, my loves?
I won't bother you when I go to Spain this summer.
Disagreers

Hi Hamada
Listen to me speak
There is no power nor strength except with Allah, the Most High, the Most Great
My beloved's hope is the one who chooses.
No translation possible.
What I say is that what's on the sea is the most beautiful.
We'll have a yacht in the near future that we can take from home straight to the sea.
We and our children
Let's set a wedding date.
It's finally over, it's been a whole year and like a month.
What's this, a new perfume you're wearing?
I honestly hope I'm not Khalid's sister, I don't know how.
كل شيء مختلف عن أخوج سعد
عاد غير والا مب غير كل واحد يا عمري حر ابتصرفاته
After that, this backward preacher doesn't know that there are perfumes for both genders.
I say, let the preacher keep his sermon to himself.
I don't care
Khalid Mashadq
You're just like women with the perfumes you use.
You even use their colors
Why did you come, Khaled?
Oh, I don't have that old thing.
You're always like this, why don't you stand up to him? You're not scared of his actions and behavior.
These times, perfumes are for Tuesdays
I thought I had warned you.
Did you see the Bluetooth?
Listen to the quarter Isolfone in the Miles, they say it's popular in Dubai
I've heard about him, Rauna.
شما جوعان بعدين نقول لكم
Oh, my love, how do you dance
Yes yes yes yes Joe movements
This is Layla's daughter, Juff. This is the one I was talking about. She dances, does justice, and makes moves that are known. Who is this? This is Khaloud, the daughter of Uncle Muhammad.
My cousin Khulood's dog
But I'm telling you about it
Look at Saad's brother, Ayi.
Why are you making him a fool and I'm making him a fool? Saad, turn on his Bluetooth so he can see them.
Wa alaikum assalam
السلام عليكم هلا هلا
Definitely defeated
The shining nephew of the hollow aunt is sitting far away.
Your Bluetooth is on
No way, I won't send you anything.
Thank you, madam.
Be quiet, you're talking nonsense.
You're welcome, Saad
Je pars en voyage demain.
I'm not going to leave the country.
Where did you put your hat, where did you put your hat?
What do people say?
They say their son guided them and traveled. Do you want to create a scandal for us?
Oh my!
The one who made Khaloud pregnant, this is pride and honor.
A terrible first impression.
They said this is the girls' brother
He said: traveled, treated, studied, worked, committed suicide, anything
The important thing is that I live in a place where the scandal chases me every day.
Where is he going and coming from?
With a spirit of sixty geniuses
This is my final offer.
I don't know where he put it, and this is where he leaves his suitcase when he travels.
We don't even know where he wants to go.
I'm expecting.
You're making me feel better now, my love, because you're being gentle with me, you're healing my heart.
I was saying I care about it
I won't let him have his way.
You didn't know about it and it doesn't matter.
Your father is busy at work and leaves the responsibility to you.
I miss you, mom
There's no hope for your sister's sake.
You're right here.
We are all immortal, we possess eternity among people.
I am not able to do that
You killed him for something.
This is my father's biggest mistake.
We're in a weird situation, Khulood.
I didn't kill him.
Give him the CD.
I'm going to the airport
I'm scared and worried about him.
Please ensure our house reaches this level, dear Amal.
Don't be surprised
Khulood and her friends were accused by the people of their town.
They heard from their brothers and sisters
Whatever religious values they may call upon
They'll go and dance, they'll celebrate.
In the evil box
I swear, you're driving me crazy, Yabouk.
Goodbye, Baha
Take care of yourself, my friend.
I have a small gift for you, my dear.
A gift for me
I've put the CD in the laptop. I'm scared of what's going to happen. Walk with me.
Yalla yammi
It's reasonable, mom. Dad will be back soon. The CD is only three minutes long.
It can be taken out
Where does he go? Where does he take him?
Reply to Ashfaq, may God bless you, O Abu Saad
Sure, please provide the text you'd like me to translate.
It's okay, Aml
I'm so tired, I could sleep for days
To improve my behavior
But forgive me
God willing
I say you guys, come up to the roof.
My love
We are in the age of freedoms
There is no limit to the era of human rights for us.
The one with the Arial font takes the thousand, oh my eyes.
Of course, all this talk of God will make America my beloved.

My sufficiency is in Allah, upon you, and you who stopped with Adrill. I asked you about your pension.
I'm looking for a job.
He's always complaining about his salary, it's useless. He's been working with them for seven months, take the lesson and add a zero to it, that's it.
Complete the year with an increased pension.
This one is greedy and he's deceiving us.
Just come back, just come back, just come back, you're just great, just come back, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, and we're all waiting for you.
It's easy for you, that word is easy.
Leave him, I don't want to ride with him in the car.
It's empty, I told you.
You guys told me before that I'm the man of the house, I'm the one who makes decisions, you be quiet now, you're done talking as well, the one who makes decisions.
Get out, I want you outside, go.
Come here, stop.
I don't know what he's saying, you go.
He says, "What are you not bringing inside the tent?" He doesn't say anything else.
Dad, this one has no friend. This is my uncle's brother's son.
Give me five minutes with him, inshallah.
Five minutes
What's inside your mind is what makes you beautiful.
You're always telling him to demand a raise, demand a raise.
Everything is fine in the world of the poor.
After working for eight months, he gives
Dad, I'm in trouble inside the country
This driver is inside a hole in the heel and the four hundred thousand four hundred.
In bad possible the F in bad three hundred above the F papa
I'm just thinking.
I've had enough, I'm done, done, I'm shutting up, no more after this.
You're talking nonsense, you're just adding more water to it.
Sunni Saying
I said I'd be there
Water without benefit
Two hundred useless.
I'm scared, Shashi.
Not like.
Everything is fine, I'm just bored.
23,400
A snow problem inside the house is useless, bring good money outside.
I am feeling afraid
This wool is a cashmere sweater
How many in
five hundred and fifty
In fear, its condition is that this comes, and I am imprisoned.
No COVID-19 here
I've done my bit, what about you?
I say, if you wear two layers, you'll be fine.
I'll call him and find out.
He was only a prisoner of his own repression.
Her maidservant is a year older
My trust is in God concerning it.
I'm leaving with my heart
I went to the police station
You're off the hook, you've done your part, no responsibility on you.
We'll do our best, God willing.
You might be able to see a response from me in the fridge after you've looked.
No money, no food, he goes to surrender himself
I hope they lose to them, I hope they beat them, I hope they eat their car's training.
Based on how
The competition starts when Dash Dash enters the best.
We were afraid to tell you
The foxes' team and the foxes will easily reach it.
If we score more than three goals, including their meaning, we didn't win. We need ten, five to spare.
Mockery is clear Mockery is clear Let's be honest Clear mockery
The foxes' team will advance if they win more than three matches in a row.
I say to you, take it.
The soul, the game, and the performance
He has something to thank his Lord for when he rises. If it is less than three, they thank their Lord.
Our team is currently facing these upcoming opponents, the Foxes team, and they are giving us a hard time.
They scored a goal comfortably, now they can relax.
I'll wait a bit longer in statements, otherwise that's it, I've had enough.
This is a student who is present, this is in your mind, you see me, me, there is no presence, you are in the capital's turn, this is a student who eats chicken.
I don't have a car.
You are my friend, aren't you?
What did you hear him say?
It's a very tricky fox.
You're in such good shape, no one can compare.
Yeah, dude
You don't know, or what?
The one who is always complaining about the cold.
He sometimes appears on TV shows to chat.
They will be defeated, they will overcome.
Wallah, you're doing it, brother. You're a team that never loses, always victorious.
The fox will talk about today's result
What does this give in the result?
The result of this class is foxes
This guy comes to take his share of money, he's doing a tire.
We have to be realistic to some extent, you know. I'm not saying the foxes won and flew away.
Foxes Papa
This is a fox taking a chicken and eating it.
Long life to you, you've never seen anything like this in the stands.
The audience is dying of laughter
Zaher is inside the lab and Salama is yours.
A true fan is someone who has genuine loyalty to the club.
This is like driving with the big Qataris who go to the malls and all that.
Coffee tempted me with a cappuccino.
Look at the world, my brother
He gave me fifty riyals and paid the bill.
I heard the poem you wrote about our match against the frogs
Members of the Arab tribe Al-Hajarin
You are a frog
You're not a team player, all you do is cause trouble.
سب سب النادي والفريق شوف شيصير Go, Go, the club and the team, let's see what happens
There's nothing to say.

Hello Hello Hello to the four tribes of Hatharin
Every month we gather to choose the ideal fan
Mashallah, and may the one you've chosen this month be worthy of honor, inshallah.
Members of the Board of Directors are the most important people who make decisions
Hello everyone, and welcome to each one of you with open arms.
The management of this large club is a fox.
People, the people of Juf Al-Dariyal who were displaced from our area, are being shown on television.
Sometimes it is like this
This seems to be a correction of this sentence.
You're not a good person, he said.
I just found out how he did it.
Oh God, bring out the audience

I just want to make an investment.
May God increase your generosity and bless your investment.
What are you doing, you beautiful girl?
ما شاء الله، إسلامك، كرمك الله
Come on, beautiful, let's have some tea together.
May Allah bless what you have and what you will have. May Allah bless your endeavors.
I'm telling you, I'm sure this is fine. I don't want us to fail with the cabaret.
May He conceal.
Yama Yama I'm Yama
Your dad is a bit of a show-off here, it's not common.
What did you mean, Yama?
You shouldn't speak ill of your father, mom.
Your dad is turning the house upside down on our heads.
You're definitely going to get slaughtered now.
I swear I'm not breaking it with work
Why don't you go and get some gum and stick it on?
Paste it in there, dude
Where can we find one like her? I'll buy it for you, where should I get it from? Should I bring it? Should I bring it as a gift?
I swear, I'm worried about you because of him.
I'm afraid my dad will scold me
Knock on his door so I can see a solution to this issue
Yallah, hurry up and go to your room.
Uncle, uncle, uncle, you are my uncle
Uncle, you're breaking the vase, Uncle
Where are you, Walid?
No, my mother, it won't happen to you.
He ran away from home, mom, he's afraid of his dad.
Forbidden, my mother, fear Allah for the child
Oh my God, this is not how God raised you to behave.
It's been a while, man
I don't know how to act
I'm just worried about him because of the cars on the street.
God willing, He will protect him. I think he might go to the shop or go to the neighbor's house to play with them.
Oh, what a ransom for a child so sweet and kind, where do you love, oh mother?
May Allah protect you from the devil and may you not be tempted. Insha'Allah, it will only bring good.
Goodbye, my mother (informal, used among friends)

My dad is teaching me.
My father is slaughtering me with his words.

Come here, Yabeh, come have a drink, I'll prepare some tea for you and you can relax in my room.
It's turning yellow
May God fix it, may God fix it, come on, mother, come on.
Come on, Karim!
I'm afraid my dad will hit me.
Stop it, you idiot.
Do not interfere in my son's upbringing.
This is my son and I am raising him the way I see fit.
The boy is a devil, he's always causing trouble, terrified of anything different, you idiot.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
Close to open
The bag hit the vase by mistake, believe me, that's not what he intended.
You, you must defend him.
You're not telling him anything so that I can forgive him this time, the boy breaks from fear
He's just been going back and forth, now he's sitting with you for this piece.
We have a lot.
Where are you?

I have nothing to do with you.
What do you hear the speech?
Come on, everyone, go get your books and study.
Enough, my brother, put your phone in your pocket, we will handle it, my brother. Enough, I'm not saying the truth about my uncle.
Wallah yema, she's confused, she doesn't know how to react
I'm afraid if he finds out, he'll cause us trouble.
Sure, here is the translation: "Of course, I will ask him to bring his hospital admission papers."
I wish you would fix it for me, you said to him
If he knows that Walid has Ebola in his bed, he will kill him.

Nuclear energy
It constitutes 60% of the world's oil reserves
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia leads the global reserves with a percentage of twenty-four percent.
Libya, the United States, and Nigeria
3% for each of them, and the rest of the world is shared at 15%.
and then
as well as from the production
Perhaps this is one of the secrets and reasons for the scramble for this region and its countries by major industrial powers.
At the top of the list is the United States of America, the world's largest consumer of oil energy.
Prices of oil are in a continuous rise
Coinciding with a decline in the dollar rate against the US dollar
The lizi is taken as a unit for oil pricing
where the price of the barrel reached yesterday
This has led to an increase in the income of producing countries and, at the same time,
to increase inflation in it
Inflation in some of those countries has reached fifteen percent.
The most important source of energy in the world
Living costs and commodity prices
That in a direct dialogue with the Deputy Prime Minister
Minister of Energy and Industry of Qatar
Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah

Office hours Welcome
I would like to start with the unprecedented prices that oil has reached
Where can prices go?
Of course, where can prices go? This is a puzzling question.
Market Forces
OPEC
The producing countries
The producing countries or OPEC are not related to oil pricing.
The relationship between price, supply, and demand.
It's not even the demand and the request is not significant.
What are the factors if
Other factors, in addition to supply and demand
For investors
They felt immense pressure and turned to oil, gold, or what is known as commodity marketing.
Investors have lost confidence in stock markets.
and gold as well
Raina's gold has risen from three hundred and fifty dollars in recent years to reach nine hundred and seventy today.
He still owes me around $109.
But it's all an increase, unless it decreased slightly.
Let me remind you that in the first quarter of this year
The second quarter is expected to see a decline in prices due to lower demand for oil.
But we found the market in an astonishingly exciting and ever-changing state
In the second quarter and at the beginning of spring, it rises above $100
But that means the previous factors that determined the increase in prices relative to winter and consumption have changed, and now there are other factors.
Economic growth
At the same time, we see that oil prices are rising to this extent
I discussed the political factors and said that political tensions play a role in this matter.
Do you expect Iran to resign under the political complexities?
Its owner and today topped most of the American newspapers and the world press may affect oil prices
By the hundred, A to A today A
Today we are in the age of globalization and the impact comes quickly.
can non-real factors affect
They create a kind of disruption in the market.
And also created a kind of political rumors
He said there was no plan, but he did not rule out other options that could also be taken regarding Iran.
Always the regime interacts with the markets
Of course, it is not certain now that America is at war with Iran
I am one of those people who do not see this scenario
It may be Fallon, and there may be something we haven't seen yet. What will it be like in the future?
We who work in the energy sector
We see that all these political tensions
Global oil supplies
On the contrary, there are very comfortable supplies
What does it indicate that there is oil going into storage?
There is absolutely no shortage in oil supplies
Perhaps readiness for the upcoming war
Under this reassuring picture you paint of supply and that there are no obstacles to supply
In the event that U.S. President Bush and the United States decide to implement their plan
This is something else
Prices are soaring to record numbers.
The price of oil may reach
Global oil reserves
You are here. This is here. Today, the Gulf represents the most important.
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and other Gulf countries
They now represent more than sixty percent of oil reserves, so it's definitely what he wants.
You today
A very minor incident occurred
Therefore, it indicates
That means that in the event of any war on Iran, it means that oil prices cannot be guaranteed to what extent they can reach
God knows, and we might reach today. We have arrived without...
Wars for $107 and $110 and may jump to $110, God knows
Today, oil is, as you said, living under psychological and political tensions.
Tensions rose among the observers and they withdrew from these tensions
Only an oil investor
It's not called an investment, of course it's not a real investment, it's not buying futures or futures marketing.

Jelly is the owner of this project, as many politicians and journalists have said.
I don't know what's in my jelly bag.
I can't predict what that will mean.
Will it ignite a war?
America is in a transitional phase
Why doesn't the son do something else?
Let's see what happens if we talk about April. April is very close, just a few weeks away, and we will enter April.

In a way you don't speak in front of

You are very generous with Americans, insisting on holding onto your currency.
You said the oil price should be eighty dollars.

The price is now 100.

Of course, it is in my interest at the moment for the dollar to depreciate.
The U.S. cannot establish a balance sheet for the weakness or stagnation in the American economy.
What happened during this weakness and economic stagnation?

It is in their interest to have their currency high, expensive, and elevated.
On the contrary, not on the contrary
Here is their loss
One euro imports a barrel and a half.
You are the losers because your currency has decreased as it is tied to the dollar.
He also suffered a huge loss.
The relationship between currencies here in the Gulf is a historical one.
In the seventies, the dollar was the world's strongest currency. Do you remember?
You are now associated with secession when you talk.
This is like marriage, when you get married
You come with divorce. Divorce is not easy.

It's not like you're the only ones focusing on this topic.

Non-specialists want a political decision
We'll wait and not rush. Let's see what happens today.
People started to mean
Of course, in a complicit position
The deputy's efforts mean that the inflation rate in Qatar has reached 4.4% in 2007 and will increase to 5.5% this year.
You eat people's salaries and devour people's salaries. Here are the salaries of the workers here.
Residents in Qatar have seen their salaries decrease by 35 to 40 percent.
We'll be back after a short break to let you know the size of the salary increases.
Employees in Qatar are in high demand for the upcoming period. Stay with us
Welcome back to Boundless. In this episode, we host the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy.
Qatar's industry minister Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah on the staggering price increases
The oil revenues that have brought tens of billions of dollars to the Gulf countries and producing nations
For oil, and my question was about the expected increase in employees' salaries, but before that increase, I would like to give you some important information.
The UAE has reserves of 79.8 billion and expects 26.1 billion.
Tonnes only and the burial from Kuwait Times economic report revenues of the Gulf from the largest
Saudi Arabia's revenues in the year 2010 and the expected revenues for 2011 are 199 billion.

There were three hundred in Bahrain
In Oman, it was 7.5, increasing to 7. In Qatar, it was 12.75, rising to 15.5 in Qatar
Residents of Qatar should brace for further increases in commodity prices and the cost of living.
Life is being devoured, prices have risen significantly and more in Qatar
We feel for everyone.
You should have two processors
Treatment aims to control the swelling
They will increase the salaries by fifty percent.
They say you're against raising salaries
This is not right and in general
against the minister's salary increase
There is a problem and the solution must be the optimal one.
There is no patch solution.
There is a balance between the elderly
This will be it.
The main thing is the treatment of swelling
and here in Qatar in the committee
His Highness the Deputy Emir has issued a decree forming it.

and they also work with the government, not just with the private sector
The private sector is completely neglected.
The case of the increase should also be looked at fairly.
I don't know where you got these notes from.
We live in Qatar, the deputy lives in Germany
I'm telling you the opposite today: the private sector seems to be the one driving (things).
Most
Many Qataris who used to work in the public sector have moved to the private sector.
Due to the high salaries

She moves to the private sector because the private sector is vital and dynamic.

We refer to what is called market forces
Market forces
They don't come with very high-level specializations.
Do not come to Qatar because Qatar is the least in terms of salaries or the least in terms of living costs.
They come with the costs.
Sure, here is the translation: "Alright, with our full understanding"
I do not predict events nor do I say that there is an increase in salaries.
No hope left.
Control this proliferation
Let's give it some time.
Gain control over this proliferation
God willing, this means that the report says Qatar is at 8.8%.
Insha'Allah means I will say that
We expect these numbers to improve.
Bribe people a little
It's a process that means we are a professional process
Of course, with professionalism and everything else, but

For spending
The large number of different projects
Allow me to ask some questions from the viewers and I hope everyone asks directly. Abd Al-Aziz Muhammad from Morocco, your question, brother Abd Al-Aziz.
This command is based on the ruling families in the Gulf
Do not assume that the reason is the OPEC disagreement.
Secondly, all oil revenues go directly to the ruler.
Then for the ruling family, and the rest is spent on development.
In the absence of an accountant, Faysal will leave things as they are.
Peace and God's mercy
Welcome, my brother Ahmed
I, your brother, will not prolong the conversation. I mentioned earlier regarding the governing systems and the issue of pegging the dollar to the riyal or the riyal or the currencies of the Gulf to the dollar, but...
America wants to globalize the world under its flag through this.
The US trade deficit with China has reached eighty-two billion dollars
$86 billion
This means that all global policy directions are against the dollar.
We bear the consequences of this as an Arab country and a Gulf oil state.
A showdown between the U.S.
Between the world's leading countries such as China, Russia, and others, and it may become the issue
Military jargon
The explosion of China's bombs, Russia's bombs, Japan's bombs, and even America's bombs
Thank you very much for this clarification and this information.
Your question, Muhammad
Welcome! Your question
Could you lower the volume of the TV and ask your question?
What is your question?
The only thing I see is that the deputy's efforts are determined not to cooperate.
The topic of decoupling from the dollar, as the dollar is declining.
And he will descend, God willing, to the perigee
He is a kind person
It is unlikely that he follows the style of his Arab brothers.
Thank you, brother Mohammed. Thank you. Thank you. The last question from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. Your question, Ahmed.
May God keep you in goodness tonight.
Thank you and it was a pleasure meeting you.
May God will, things will get better. We don't mean he who is meant, what?
We are facing problems in our colleges, including delayed salaries.

Thank you, Ahmed. Thank you for taking your time.
The issue of high prices is an important one.

The one who has nothing is better than the one who has a billion here.
We mean we are for some of the brothers, of course
Those who don't know Qatar
This is not correct with regard to the State of Qatar.
The day after tomorrow, Qatar will see what the triple-A indicators show.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar? ##
Highest growth indicators in the world
Where is this happiness going? What will you do with it?
What is in the context of the response?
He's just saying that the request from Morocco is not genuine and not real.
The person who does not see with his own eyes
If the person who matters comes and sees Qatar, what significant developments do you achieve there?
You've grown a lot, haven't you? Yes, you have.
And everyone has the right
You all, as residents, will have to report people from here.
Will there really be an excess import of wheat from China?
We won't import, God willing.

What angered the system in Egypt
From Qatar, anger reached the point of accusing it of conspiring against Egypt
Qatar was not far from important files
Like Darfur in Sudan, the Houthis in Yemen, and even the Israeli soldier prisoner

They write to us via our website www.aljazeera.net
Your Excellency Sheikh, welcome.
To the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, on the twenty-second of September of the year two thousand and seven
This visit marked a significant milestone in the bilateral relations, at least in recent years.

The introduction you gave was long and required many answers without your last question.
I thought I was pregnant
In particular, in the context of Saudi Arabia
What is the precise
Saudi Arabia is an important country for Qatar.
There is a presence between the two countries
I spoke about the island's silence
I spoke about a revolutionary movement
Both sides have made these things clear.
We have previously explained

She always had bright, honorable, and trusting relationships.
I want to attribute it to a misunderstanding between the two parties.
This position is open and there are no conditions.
In solving any problem
There was an understanding and a genuine intention from both parties.
To resolve this stuck issue
A relationship that is not seasonal but strategic.
We wish for it not to last, but to evolve.
Beautiful diplomatic language

I'm not used to speaking diplomatically, which would have helped me avoid many problems.
I have always said what I believe in.

on Saudi accounts
The disagreement that has been going on within the Gulf house
On the contrary to what was before
Political agreement
No, no, there was no agreement except for an agreement of love and an agreement of interest.
But if anything contradicts that, this topic asks the Jazeera administration: Have you built the strategy of AlUla?
Agree between you and Saudi Arabia to avoid what happened before
The relationship was actually built on a close strategic basis.
Let's do it one, two, three, four
There must be unity
I reconciled some of the differences based on this principle.
Between some Arab countries and work to resolve other differences
For now, if we notice the differences in the Arab world, they are differences in points of view.
When we have an opinion on a certain policy, a certain action in a certain situation, and another country has a different opinion
This represents two viewpoints.
Some observers believe that you take pleasure in criticizing Saudi Arabia.
Under the direction of criticism towards her
Have you gotten tired and decided to head in another direction, then turned towards a larger country, which is Egypt?
It means the same thing.
We neither enjoy nor are we lazy.
We do not deal with any other party in this manner.
The reasons for the dispute with Saudi Arabia have ended
بيننا وأنا أعرف أن هناك تفاهم Between us, I know there is an understanding
Very big and you know we founded
There will be a type of model

They now say they have discovered what they call a conspiracy.
I also said the name means we, I want to say to the house, may it be protected. Syria and Iran will defend ourselves, I won't defend them.

Why does Qatar want to change or intervene in a matter of this kind?
The pyramids do not speak of desire

We
We do not interfere under such circumstances.

No small state stood this fight.
Of course, I know that some of the brothers in the government have also wronged Egypt, not for anyone other than Egypt.
When they said that after

The Israelis were informed a day before that there would be a meeting to stop the fighting before any speech or anything.
What is
They've brought in medicine and food during the bombardment they're subjecting our brothers to.
They say the gate is narrow.
What did the trucks bring in?
They say to us, "By Allah, there is an agreement with the other side and we must be there."
It's not time for us to bring in Fatah or bring in Hamas
I don't care about Fatah or Hamas, what mattered to us was the million and a half and eight hundred thousand who were sitting watching.
They have medications.
When we start talking about this topic and talk about the Gaza Conference
and Qatar's involvement in the issue causes sensitivity in the Egyptian regime
She's not coming in.
We haven't discussed how Egypt is handling the situation, as this is Egypt's jurisdiction.
One of the officials said we have uncovered a major conspiracy behind the issue
We still don't know what the conspiracy is.
We, meaning this person in charge
This is a big deal for us, Egypt.
Sure, here is the translation: "Okay, brother, we understand that Egypt is a major Arab country and we always say that Egypt is a major country."
Therefore, we always demand many things from the great nations

We were coordinated and our position was unified.

I would be happy if I saw it enter through our brothers in Egypt.

If Egypt wins or makes a good political move
We believe this is in our interest in Qatar and in the interest of the Arab world
The stability of Egypt is important to us.
It's important to us if you do a good job
Let me finish, your question and introduction were 15 minutes
The question you asked me but
I'm not like that, I'm like that, I'm like that now, I mean from anger
The wrath of the Egyptian authorities is upon you.
We are the ones who failed the Doha Summit
The second issue is their failure at the Doha Conference

We want to treat the allergy. We take allergy medication. What do they call it, allergy?

Some of the brothers in the Fatah party in the government
They want an internal failure.
They want to draw attention to a coup in Gaza.

Everything that is easy

We'll find out what happened, okay?
The issue must be addressed locally.
I'm not treating

My priority is to first look at the issues that concern my country.
And then, I will see if I have enough time.

But Qatar tried to fix

When the initiative for reconciliation was announced and the presidents met in Kuwait, we were optimistic. I came out with a statement welcoming this subject.

The Egyptian official who revealed his skills
I don't think I will respond to that interview on TV or whatever.
I have a response to each point.
However, to preserve at least a minimum of the relations that bind us and bind Arab interests
Response to the call mentioned by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques
But all I advise is him and others
They try to fix their mistakes, both internally and externally.
In politics, economics, or otherwise, just like we have mistakes in politics and economics, and so on, no one is infallible.
They are shaking Qatar with accusations from their own homes.
You deny any relationship between Qatar and anything related to Hezbollah's cell.
This is a funny topic
To undermine Egypt's relations and thwart its role and connections with Turkey and the European Union
We are first and foremost a small group.
We are capable of doing our part
This is incorrect information.
There are accusations against you personally.
To pressure to pay money to the detainees' families until Qatar is humiliated and is humiliated, and to increase pressure on the Egyptian role in the matter
He always accuses us of paying money upfront. We never paid any money and we never even discussed paying money with anyone.
But this is the case
We wanted Egypt to be solved as we wanted Egypt to be, and we still want it to be solved. The issue between the Palestinians
God willing, the Palestinian president will remain until this issue is resolved.
We were present and the first to support the State of Qatar
The authority remains and the Palestinian institutions continue until the dispute is resolved.
And We said, "Be!" and it is.
The Arab University says no we didn't pass it because we believe there are people who don't want this topic
But we handled it intelligently
Does he mean he is addressing his boss?

They decided last April in the number of 12, the Shrouk newspaper broke the news
The political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a news satellite channel to confront the media noise known as Al Jazeera Channel and put an end to it.
All days will pass, matters will end, and things will be settled.
But you fear that the island will become a thing of the past
We're currently experiencing a political adolescence.
You relinquished to Saudi Arabia and the Emir of Qatar sat with the King of Saudi Arabia.
We did not concede, and they did not concede to us.
Our interaction with them as brothers
A small country that concedes to the large country Egypt

Disagreement on the main political issue
I don't have any personal issues with you. I respect the Egyptian people.

We talked about everything
Things were clearly deteriorating and not getting resolved.
No no was in in no see
I can't tell you that our relations with Egypt are...
They have complaints and they have every right to them, as brothers.
We also have grievances against them as younger brothers
We don't want to compare ourselves to any major country.
Egypt means more than just the pyramids
It's not a matter of life and death that I mean, but that the solution comes from the sky.
We, for our part, if someone is waiting for an apology
Someone is waiting for a style
Qatar
You deal with him in a way that is not friendly or brotherly.
We are proud of Egypt as a major country.
But if someone deceives someone
This means that I know Israel is following us.
With the previous American policy and also the previous administration, I had a negative experience.
They probably want to emulate neither Israel nor America in this matter.
They are also pressured from external parties to take certain policies.

Let me finish, I don't want anyone to interrupt.
We don't want to compete with anyone.
They say what they say, whether it's Qatar or any other country.
But we have our own point of view.
We first expelled the Israeli embassy staff and then closed it.
Glory be to God, they used to say the office is drunk, we are drunk from the office, they got angry and left saying to the Americans, look at this Hathila
They lined up with those called the Devil's Team
What are they saying?
For Americans and Europeans, these are our friends, and we know how to deal with them.

We don't mind the Egyptian style you have
If someone extends their hand to us, we will extend our arm a meter.
His Excellency the Sheikh
We're not used to being stepped on.
We are ready to support Egypt, but only on a solid basis.
I stand with Egypt
There are currently many rumors about Egyptian workers in Qatar being affected by this issue.
And there are contracts for Egyptians working in jobs, whether in groups or major jobs
He's the one who knows first about this issue, it's not Qatar's nature to cancel jobs and cancel
Because these are people who have no stake in what's happening.
This is a market where there is a change in demand, one is removed and one comes.
He is wanted and sought after, and under other nationalities, he hid under increased nationalities.
Sure, here is the translation: "Okay, answer quickly."
The office was present
We're worried about the office, like, we should probably vacate it now.
We used to tickle them in the days when they were carrying him, that all our losses in the negotiations with Israel are due to that office.
Hey, we closed it, let them solve the issue with Netanyahu
He was a job
It was one of their conditions, and we usually invite all accredited ambassadors in any foreign country.
I wasn't formally invited, Akram Gabriela Shell
لا والله، ما اكرمنا قبله لما كانت العلاقات مثل ما بيقولون "اكويسه". نكرمها الآن شوي صعبه.
There is no reason at this time to reopen the office.

This is a document that determines how Iranians solve their problems.

They are handling it in their usual way, and I'm sure its importance surpasses this crisis.

It is important for our region, the Gulf, and we share common borders with Iran.
Of course, we have distinctive relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
We are a country that advocates for peace and stability in this region.
We used to intervene whenever there was a party that wanted to change or alter the Doha Agreement
I believe that Saad Hariri said
The strategic talk between the president is now over.
between the Lebanese groups
How to see
For Yemen, do you have a role or have the Yemenis taken a stance on you?
See, first of all, we know that we supported unity when almost the entire Arab world was against Yemeni unity.
We are the only Arab and Gulf country that stood with the Yemeni unity.
We have discussed the southern issue with Yemen, and I have sent His Highness the Prince twice to meet with the Yemeni President.
Our goal is to stabilize Yemen, as Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
Neither party respected this agreement, and I don't want to say what each side did.
But deep down, I'm truly heartbroken.
Qatar, which took this stance, is accused of paying money to the Houthis and senior officials.
Yemenis, because we do not interfere in these matters
He who stands with unity does not stand against it.
and another goal for the benefit of Yemen, whether political, economic, or otherwise
We don't have any objections, but honestly, I was shocked.
For I have been to Yemen more than ten times during the fighting. His Highness the Prince sent me among the Yemenis.
This accusation is strange, I'm sorry to say.
Time is up, but very briefly, do you think the problems you anticipated from your efforts to solve problems will change your policy of intervening in other Arab issues?
By God, if His Highness the Prince heard my words, he would agree that I see no point.
We have shown you a large amount before.
More than five billion dollars at this point, if we invested it, would be fifty billion, better than a headache
I'll say it and I believe it, because maybe the time in the Arab world now means
It is allowed here under these circumstances.
Thank you very much, His Excellency Sheikh

How did you get the miracle of Doha?

We noticed in Doha that both parties were keen

We knew the committee, we knew

Unfortunately,
External feedback
The issue among Lebanese, even if there is an issue, is not the number one issue
I know it might not be too early to talk behind the scenes.
What happened? Why did you come here?
You stopped, if I may say so, the ground fighting
Don't be late even for a second, okay?
I knew exactly what was going on. Even the Lebanese leaders at the time were telling me what happened.
I wish I had been from the beginning.
When I spoke with His Highness
We died when we arrived in Lebanon
His Royal Highness the Prince has endorsed and supported this idea.
All Lebanese leaders are present in it
Because you're here in Beirut, look out for everyone in your area.
You are all in the same hotel and in the same place.
You met and talked on the same plane.
We created this atmosphere, but from the beginning, we had this idea.
This was the most important decision, the most important of all.
Of course, it was
This is what I have from the Arab University
We will be impartial intermediaries

To reach a solution that is satisfactory to both parties
There is no solution where everyone wins.
Before you take your step
We had a consultation at the Arab University and found support
what we have done in it
I speak their language and we are there.
If we succeed in Lebanon, we will transfer them to Doha
And it was my advice that
Sugar them, distract them, and take their phones away.
We managed to bring them there and the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria also supported the position.
And without the initial Arab support, the committee would not have been able to do anything
They wanted to know why they wanted the solution.
I think the situation in Lebanon and the ongoing escalation are
and this tension
There is tension in Somalia. There is tension in Sudan.

We are in the Arab world facing immense and significant challenges.

As Arabs, we are below the minimum required by the agreement
Unfortunately, we complain

Our position on this matter is well-known and has been communicated to all concerned parties.

There is no regional ambition for us.

The international efforts made to put an end to what is happening in Gaza.
And we begin with your request to convene a meeting of the Arab University Council at the level

Request for an urgent Arab Summit meeting
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. To begin with, I, Saeed, son of Hassan, am glad to be in this program.
If only the circumstances

Circumstances require us to do a lot
Qatar did not act despite the Arab summit
We actually, when we went with the idea of the Arab Summit before
not only by the decision of the Security Council but also through
You are not always stepped on and disrespected.
Let me put it another way
We educate ourselves
The Arab street can no longer bear it if you, as its leaders, continue to bear it.

When we were in Cairo
From ten to twelve written approvals
Some of them spoke at the meeting and it was possible to hold the meeting
We will hold it to the extent that it is in Arabic agreement.
I don't blame those who think that there might not be a meeting they can attend.
He or she and the problem-solving method
It's falling apart
This is the important subject
Our goal is not to preach or advertise, our goal is to find.
They didn't change their mind about the summit
And among them, we ask ourselves
I'll go so we can put the poor thing out of its misery
The previous and the following and the Security Council resolution, but let's stay only on the topic of the Arab summit. The Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
The situation may require an Arab summit to be held with all parties present.
We found that the majority of the brothers support holding the summit.
By whom is it forbidden?
I don't know what they mean by moderation
We are the only nation.
Only the Arab nations mean if we go to any countries in Asia, Latin America, etc.
Without a solution
Countries classified as temperate
Balance, in our view
No, we will not give up the Palestinian cause.
What we like
Should we intervene in the Palestinian issue in a certain way?
It means that there is no mother who allows everyone to enter, distinguishing between the good and the bad.
The likes of Hamas and Hezbollah don't know that tomorrow another party might emerge.
Is she a student?
Can we be part of the Arab body?
It was planned for us to enter into internal Arab infighting
Sure, here is the translation: "Okay, and if I go to the Security Council"
There is no decision by the Security Council
I hope that after Israel completes its tasks
The second Arab Social Ministerial Meeting to which you invited
The one that was dominated by heated debates, disagreements, and sharp disputes
He's at a crucial point.
This is not what's important

Are the ministers ready for that?
One side says we don't have to wait
We are in an Arab initiative
Les négociations de paix avec Israël sont au point mort
We say that we are on the side that says we are losing in this matter
In a loss greater than what we're currently experiencing. We have always been respectful, polite, and committed to the decisions since the ceasefire.
Says Sheikh Saadah that AI conflicts are not important
Then there are those who wish they could go back to Hamas and the like
This reflects a political stance rather than a dispute between one minister and another, and so on.
Unfortunately, this is a situation that has occurred.
Not everyone
We do not want to speak on behalf of others.
It's very important that we are men of our own, men of our country.
We manage our country's policy
Who acts on her behalf in such matters
I think means
I don't think they will respect us after all.
Yes, are there people who perform roles on behalf of the West?
I swear to God, I'm not accusing anyone. I don't want to accuse anyone in this matter.
After the Security Council's decision
What will be his schedule?
The situation seemed to be a decision in the Arab effort
Here lies the disagreement if Israel implemented the resolution immediately
We can say in a decision
But Israel has not implemented this decision.
Are we ready to go and request Chapter 7 now? I know there are difficulties, of course.

Ceasefire
The Palestinian people in Gaza remain and will remain, starving for two years.
It's okay.
For Israeli security reasons
It's clear what we want, this ruling doesn't concern me, I'm in Qatar.

What's up? And who decides?
Not every country has sovereignty in its choice.

He is the one who can say yes and can say no
This is an important point.
Resolution 1866
We have a Palestinian Arabic issue
We don't want to hear one side.
But I would have liked it when the Palestinian delegation left
They asked if anyone from Gaza would go with them to the university.
We've shown the Israelis now that these are our brothers, we are with them.
This is an important point.
We do not make the authority
Our goal is to protect and we build our policy
Staying in power
The Sheikh Al
I don't know if it's possible to discuss the Egyptian initiative since you haven't been informed about its terms.
Do you, in principle, believe that she is suitable to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1976 as some have stated?
Balanced role
now, not tomorrow or the day after tomorrow
Every day passes
In the blood of our brothers, there is spilled.
We do not want the Palestinians or the Israelis to monopolize this issue until they complete their mission. We start by proposing this initiative.
I'm certain that our brothers in Egypt are aware of this and are keen on it.
And this is what I want to clarify, everything I say
You must address the issue now.
I don't want Israel like this
This statement highlights Turkey's role since the beginning of the crisis.
Does it mean expression?
Arabic void
There is no doubt that it was a remarkable stance.
and it has an Arab depth
Entry into it is only in a state of Arabic deficit.
We know there is an Arabic deficit
Part of it is due to disagreements
Part of it is due to everyone's perspective, I think I believe my perspective is the best.
Someone believes that their opinion is the best.
And not in consensus on how we can make people respect us and know that there is an Arab decision
They do not single out any one of us.
One says, "No problem, let's give them two or three extra days to discipline them and then we'll gather the team so they'll be at the same level and the issue will be resolved."
We must rise above this and not accept it.
They might have mistakes, but we hold Hamas accountable.
Arabic Arabic
But now
I'll tell them no.
In this context, Qatar is also required to comply, as we have heard, we will return to this point but
You also heard about Medanya at the same time
Khaled Meshaal, head of Hamas's political bureau, yesterday
Firstly, it's not necessary that everything said by Brother Khaled Mishal, with my respect and admiration for him,
Why don't we sit with Khaled Meshaal and talk to him as Arabs?
Response to the Arab Society and say
This is important talk.
From Hamas
Imposing Israeli conditions also means imposing conditions
Let them impose conditions, it's forbidden for them to impose conditions, and Israel can impose conditions.
First, what do you think of this popular Arabic proverb?
We shouldn't listen to the riffraff or the masses. They told me to say I didn't hear what was said.
It's completely different, first of all, free your country.
Liberate your country from the Nazi occupation, with allies and without allies.
We are the ones being talked about
We are proud of our Arab heritage.
The dismissed presidents represent the views of their peoples.
The Arab peoples in all those demonstrations we have witnessed
It can be fulfilled from these rows the requirements
Also, many of those who criticize Qatar in this situation demand
In light of what is happening and the office and representatives, it remains open.
They're talking the same talk.
We are not going to sever ties with all Arab countries.
End all relations, even if someone claims to have a treaty.
We want Qatar to show only
We
This is more important than the relationship
Not just in this decision, but in even harder ones.
This decision
There must be a unified Arab position.

One should not sell one to another based on the gains they might obtain from it, whether moral or material, or it is called
Yes, so before we close this file, on this topic as well, there are countries that have taken individual steps.
Good Chavez's thesis differs, Chavez has a dispute with America
Our people do not need us to call upon them.
Five great ambassadors and we present these arguments are films
We're done with that street now, it's smarter than that.
The highest ceiling, Sheikh Saadah
He or she calls on the resistance forces in Lebanon to confront the Israeli aggression and so on.
Do you think that if this matter is carried out within a single Arab framework, it can succeed?
We call for an Arab stance that earns us respect from people.
The Arab states are ready for combat
We're not motivated either.
How do we get to Syria and get to Lebanon and get to the other countries, and in Arab countries that don't speak with some?
You should have
A qualitative shift in Arab relations
This is the current policy among Arab countries.

We know how to make Lebanese coffee.
There's no doubt that Lebanon
She gave an example: "If I return their feelings."
The situation in Gaza is different. The situation in Gaza, they are still...
Surrounded from all sides
This siege
Provides a different nature
Yes, I mean here the goals regarding Israel, meaning the operation's goals regarding Israel.
Day of punishment for so and so, day of punishment for so and so, day of punishment for so and so, day of satisfaction for so and so
And therefore, the example that happened in Lebanon regarding them is not a good example.
The solution model that was obtained in Lebanon
considered suitable
to Gaza
The problem with Gaza or the Palestinians is easier to solve than the solution in Lebanon.
Should we return it today or tomorrow?
Disagreements on power
Decentralization
This is different because their fabric is closer to some.
The intellectual fabric in Lebanon
Therefore, the solution is easier.
Here is the problem
Sheikh Saadah
What remains for us is just a few minutes if we were to summarize this topic, where could it lead?
A diplomat means
How can this process end?
For the Palestinians in Gaza
Let me tell you
He may refuse.
Please assist
The one who didn't walk with us
We failed to be Arabs
From a strategic perspective
But on the Palestinian side
There have been some efforts, but we have not seen a comprehensive initiative.
Neither before nor now, why
It's not as much of a bold move as we think it is.
We help solve the issue without mentioning Qatar's name, as some people might be sensitive about it.
Our goal is not to bring a summit, as we already have a summit in March that will take place.
I don't think we would be better than our brothers if we initiated.
We won't pressure them.
History won't spare us if we oppress them.
We are proceeding with this initiative; we have seen all parties. There was a meeting on Thursday, postponed due to going to the Security Council.
We hope to make progress, God willing. We kindly ask our Arab brothers to assist us to the best of their ability in this matter.
We consider removing him from the competition topic.

We always have wishes at hand for any summit.
But won't he fear that it might turn into a political peak?
Of course, given that time imposes itself

Good evening everyone
People with disabilities have taken the legal path or the path of human rights culture.

With the change of terms such as what you prefer, is there a change in the view of this category of listeners?
Yes and it is measured in

The special thing about this topic
The Arabic world is characterized by or differs in
However, there is a legal approach present, a culture of human rights exists, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons may be due to a lack of financial resources, not so much.
Of course, this is what I wanted to say: culture exists, but there is sometimes a lack of resources, sometimes a lack of political will.
Sometimes the legislation but
But unfortunately, awareness is somewhat lacking, and also the culture of human rights is not present.
10% of the world's population has disabilities
Eighty percent to ninety percent of people with disabilities in developing countries are of working age.

This is one of the things for which, thank God, we have been able to accomplish through our work at the office.
I tried with the organizations present in the state of Qatar

She values the work agendas of these humanitarian organizations to include those centers.
In light of the deteriorating situation of people with disabilities worldwide
I can't call it that or agree that there's been a regression
If it is in retreat in the Arab region due to the disability issue
We cannot expect the condition of persons with disabilities to be the same in the social context, political context, and economic context.
and they are among the marginalized groups
In a country like Gaza, like Darfur
On the contrary, I cannot absolutely make it so that there is no improvement in the situation.
Sure, here is the translation: "And indeed, I translated on the ground, for example, if I can give an example."

Welcome, Kmal from Syria
Good evening, Sulaiman Qaro
I'm sorry, I can't help with that.
Best regards to you and to the respected Mrs. Hafsa
Firstly, is there a mental disability within the laws of the United Nations?
A person who was previously healthy, due to some stress, became a stressor and experienced intellectual disability.
The disability resulting from his torture and imprisonment has caused him to suffer from a mental disability until now. He has been undergoing treatment for six years.
I know of about 400 people, between children and disabled adults, as a result of prisons.
Is there a law at the United Nations?
The truth is that I
Understanding means knowing, they know as they know their children

There are values in the West
Agreed, but some people
It is not taken from those who are understood to be apostates or have been overpowered regarding Islam.
Thank you very much, Naif Al-Saad, speaking to us from Kuwait.
Let's go back to our guest for her comments on what was said.
Is there an intellectual disability?
Yes, in terms of classification
Intellectual and mental disabilities, as they are known
There are sensory disabilities, meaning visual or auditory, and physical disabilities.
Of course, as you mentioned, the obstacle is
Action and reaction occur within a specific audience context.
in the Arab world or in any other regions
It is certain that combating disability has taken a long time.
Even at the level of the United Nations
Here's an example of what I've tried to address and work on during my experience and work as a private tutor:
For everyone, literally.
until they are ready
Various recreational activities to ensure their entry into schools, also organized work, work
Works on vocational training that includes people with disabilities
I came with a lot of improvements
especially after the reform
It is generally present in this international organization.
I'm also like a special course
The practical reality of this was positive for me, even if not directly related.
and which supported this position
I saw him at many meetings, for example, the international agreement

For example, with regard to legal capacity
This is one of the fundamental points in the world of disability that
The United Nations, unfortunately, had a significant setback during its preparation and drafting.
Regarding organizations and agencies
For example, and it ends with this
The world's governments and non-governmental organizations, the major powers of the United Nations
We sent a final survey
For the United Nations and its agencies in the different regions
We want to know to what extent disability programs are on their agenda
If you are posting budgets, if there is participation for people with disabilities

Not only development cases
Sure, here is the translation: Alright, we are now receiving more calls with us, Naji Al-Mashri from Algeria, please go ahead, Naji.
And peace be upon you
I wanted to ask my sister from Algeria and she will tell me exactly
I would like to ask, I am originally a person with a physical disability
Sure, here is the translation: "Okay, I will direct this question to Naji Meshri, who is joining us from Algeria. Thank you very much, Ahmed."
Ahmed, from Greece, prefers Al-Halabi
Good evening, madam. Good evening to your guest.
Healthcare, housing, clothing, seasonal Even taking them on seasonal tours, this is what happens in Europe
Yes, is the mentally ill person considered disabled?
especially as they may cause harm to others or to themselves
All that we're discussing in this unproductive space, and thank you.
I mentioned my sister's share of the financial shortfall.
Poor countries, especially in Africa and Latin America, and I call on them
Establishment of the International Disability Support Fund and allocation of one percent of the net profit of every institution in the world
It shall be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
Many people with disabilities, war victims, and others will be discouraged.
Thank you very much, Ab Ibrahim Abdullah, for speaking to us from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Meshari wonders and presents his problem: he is disabled
On the local or national level, meaning through Algeria
The needs within the local community must be met within this community.
The same rights that should be afforded to any other person
In truth, life first, then truth in housing, truth in health, truth in education.
Therefore, I am calling on governments, particularly Arab governments, from this podium.
For the benefit of this citizen and this individual
For the sake of clarity
Those needs and rights are already included in the existing agendas.
No, there's no need to create any devices.

She can, and in fact, she must be committed to practicing it.
I would advise him first to return and go back to the responsible authorities at the government level, if possible.
For that is within the national scope and must be done within this scope.
Mentioning the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, many countries have signed it but do not comply.
Here we present a question from one of the callers who asked, "Why are there no laws?"
It's definitely true that we live in a human society, meaning there are many mistakes and many rights.
Certainly, many agreements and certainly many documents do not have literal commitment in them.
Many countries have committed to numerous similar initiatives, such as Sidaou.
But there are violations and infringements, and we are aware of that.
However, the issue is adopting an agreement and organizing around it
Firstly, we will ensure, at least we will ensure, that there is awareness.
This awareness begins at the top of this pyramid, which is the decision-makers
and officials, then gradually extends to the entire society
Our commitment to provide reports, and these reports reach the United Nations
The issue of awareness, understanding, and raising consciousness
Have you served as a rapporteur at the United Nations?
Yes, based on what I have seen and what I have recorded, there is interest.
Therefore, I believe there is a relative advantage to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
Therefore, I advise, encourage, and invite
It is also important for people with disabilities

Our esteemed viewers, welcome once again to our new episode today, Sheikha Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani.
International Fund for Disability
The proposal would make it mandatory for all countries to provide funds. What do you think about this proposal?
United Nations has a fund called the Disability Inclusion Fund
Unfortunately, those contributions are very weak.
Task of monitoring the application of standard rules
For the past six years, there has been virtually no support.
China and Austria only
She always means I thank this country for this support
The main supporting country is my country, Qatar.
We established the office through which we were able to carry out many activities and projects, praise be to God.
Yes, this lack of support indicates what?
It's like what we initially proposed and this point is always raised that
Behavior of ordinary people
How do we care for people with disabilities or care for the disabled?
It means that there was a real, genuine, and serious commitment
In all its forms, for all categories
People with disabilities, children, women, migrants, refugees
We might actually reach a level of what is called
Equality of opportunity, participation, and equity
And there are those voices that always demand, never tire, never weary.

Mrs. Shaikha Saada
My question is about prevention.
Prevention is better than cure.
There is another level of disability regardless of wars and traffic accidents.
For the genetic level, it might be a result, meaning due to negligence by families, which is marrying relatives.
I think this is a large percentage
leads to disability
Thank you very much to our guest Sherif Al-Lawai who joined us from Tunisia and we will be back to our guest.
First connected, Hamad Al-Marri asked about
He has a girl with a disability among people with disabilities, a psychological disability.
Where is it heading?
In every country
There are certainly services available for all types of disabilities in the state of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether they are mental disabilities as we mentioned or any psychological disabilities
For schools
There was once

I talked about this aspect

I believe according to the state of Qatar
It takes time for sure, but with habits and traditions.
especially in tribal societies
But over time, there will be a response to it, but it is necessary to have a legal obligation.
Yes, Karwan Bahjat asked and proposed that one percent of the budgets of the Arab states be allocated.
To assist people with disabilities, let me first
Yes, there is the statistical assessment that was applied by the World Health Organization globally.
There are forty or approximately forty million people with disabilities.
Half of them are women
But these numbers double
There is a study in South Africa that showed
It is certain that the statistics that emerged about the war in Iraq about the war in Gaza
Every deceased person is equivalent to three disabled individuals.
Our region has become a conflict zone without dispute.
The proposal submitted by Bahjat Qur'an
One percent won't be enough
Assisting people with disabilities in the Arab region if
The issue of lineage is relevant to people with disabilities or other marginalized groups
I honestly and truly do not see that it agrees.
Addressing their issues and needs
People with disabilities are the most neglected.
Governments generally do not count the number of people with disabilities.
Correct, this is also related to the culture of society and sometimes the restrictions.
The societal meaning when a census is conducted by
The devices in question
There is a disabled person in the house.
Is there a person with a disability or not?
The relevant section and through the concerned parties, there
Let's collaborate on preparing a form
We recommend providing more details.
First, indicate whether this disabled person is male or female, if available.
Does he wake up his assistant or not?
The fact that even the number, as you know, is correct, is why we did not reach the precise result.
Welcome Fatimah Al-Dosari from Qatar. We are delighted to have your interest in progressing with us.

We welcome the elegant presenter of the League and Cup channel, Lana, good morning Lana.
It is also a pleasure for me to welcome the captain who has joined the ranks of Al-Ittihad Club, Captain Ali Qasim.
Hello and welcome, Ali
Welcome to Vij
Good morning
I'll leave the field for congratulations, each one will congratulate as they please, I'll keep quiet.
I had an open studio for five hours and yesterday I had two hours.
The State of Qatar congratulates its government and people, who undoubtedly deserve this global achievement.
It is an opportunity for me to congratulate and bless His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
His Highness Sheikh Tamim
Sure, here is the translation: "Yes, of course, you are one of those in the sports field, one of those working in this field and knowledgeable about these lines and this field to a greater extent."
Even we
We deserve it as we got 186 votes, compared to 184 for Qatar and 8 for America.
We're not afraid of the night because our file is rich and comprehensive, supported by many ambassadors, heavily supported. Let's take over the fields.
Some people were afraid that maybe there would be something like America
Perhaps in some countries, these matters might already be ready and they might not need to prepare stadiums or prepare some of the projects related to this event.
We are ready to go live.
They were afraid of this point
Captain Ali, you are heroes. I expect this is a very important achievement for the athletes.
I expect he will enter the field of political economy and health
Beastly
What does this achievement mean for quantum computing?
Of course, a great achievement, especially for us, Christians, even non-Christians have seen their joy, how?
Insha'Allah, I will inform you as soon as it is announced.
By God, I was coming out of the exercise and we were hearing on the radio
We used to watch him, and I was one of the four with him.

We both screamed, of course we ruined the opening.
My friend came out of the window
The world is upside down, our work is dangerous, and our journey is a nightmare.
We've been together since the beginning
Alhamdulillah, it was not a very special day, I expect, and perhaps all the channels focused on this event in a big way.
You're probably part of this topic
and especially the sports channels
They celebrated this occasion and this is how they reacted.
There were media outlets with many channels from around the world
The main trend has now become clear on the well-known map of Qatar
It's certain that the presence of the player in this team is a very important matter.
I expect this to be a much greater responsibility on his shoulders.
What do you think about this specific point?
What qualities should a player have to be part of this team, Captain Ali?
At more than one sporting event, Riyadh is coming with the wave.
We need to raise a strong generation now
It means and it has fundamental rules and techniques in football in a studied way
What are the rules and fundamentals that must be present in this player?
Professionalism ensures everything
Excellence in exercises Consistency in exercises Discipline in exercises
Here are some basic things to help the player put everything they have into the matches or training: - Maintain a balanced diet to fuel your body. - Stay hydrated before, during, and after exercise. - Prioritize rest and recovery to allow your body to repair and strengthen. - Warm up properly before training or matches to prevent injuries. - Practice regularly to improve your skills and fitness. - Set clear goals to stay motivated and track your progress. - Communicate effectively with your teammates and coaches. - Stay positive and maintain a good attitude, even in challenging situations. - Respect the rules of the game and your opponents. - Always give your best effort, both on and off the field.
Every stage has its own meaning, I don't say it has a special stamp.
She has her own drinks and feelings
From various programs, from entertainment to sports, where and where is the most beautiful for you, where and where do you feel more at home?
It's so beautiful
You really make me want to take care of myself. You know how I plan to do that? Through sports. That's the most important thing.
After that, you have football, the beloved of the masses, followed by everyone passionately. You were forced into it, but you wanted to become a fan.
We are limiting the media to one side.
What restricts you like this and puts you in a certain corner
Football is not a must, but I hate it.
Both sports are great. Sports are awesome.
Ali also means that there are some important things we should talk about
I wish you'd come back like this, ten years younger, to reach two thousand twenty-two.
What I wished for this job
Of course, we all wish for this, especially when it's the World Cup, as every player wishes at some point.
It means that if he plays in the World Cup, he will be happy and proud. So what if he plays in the World Cup?
I hope they are in good faith, inshallah, and that's their chance, inshallah.
What is the word you want to say from a professional player who is proud of what is the word you want to say from your heart to them
We hope you were with us during the break
By God, just like the current situation, I mean permission, but.
Returned to competitions after an absence of nearly 10 years from the Gulf Cup tournament
You're definitely saying Mashallah, you have a beautiful smile from Qatar TV and sweet memories
Mashallah, it's as if Qatar TV has become a university graduating a large group of journalists now.
Our national team is a strong team, God willing, it will reap many different awards
Let's talk about their performance in the Al-Ittihad mission
شو حالك؟ اهناك؟ شو أخبارك؟ اهناك؟ إن شاء الله مرتاح
Of course, thank God, honestly, Am Assal.
Yesterday, of course, he was with us in the studio. We talked a lot about the players.
I expect that some of the young people who are watching us right now might feel like you're one of them at this moment.
Desired
It means naturally in the Qatari professional league and the transfer of players
I'm glad I got my chance to shine, whether as a director or as an actor.
I'm proud that I secured a spot in the Asian Cup with the team, thank God.
I'm grateful to God, it's been good working with the team.
How can we make sports a social event?
How can we introduce sports to women, children, and youth?
Connects them together means everything complements sports
You have different roles for women in various sports fields
Awareness of physical education is spreading among us, from the youngest to the oldest in the community.
About six to seven years to reach this occasion, I think that's enough time
The new generations are still emerging with the unexpected.
In a generation that is growing old, but in the next generation, people must be made aware of sports from a young age.
About Us Espyr is a company that we are proud to acknowledge. Espyr was founded by a visionary.
The real number one for the new sports generation
All we have to do is set our intention and go for it.
They particularly love soccer.
How can I engage the audience to keep interacting throughout all the different matches, even between clubs?
Wallah, Jufi, to be honest, we have a problem with the Qatari league that he's in, the fans have said it.
The issue here is the ticket prices. The Qatari Union hasn't found a solution to attract the crowds yet.
How can we attract them to follow these matches?
depends on himself means they prevent what they don't like the stadium
Media plays a major role in shaping public opinion about voter apathy.
They now operate a ticketing system or a points accumulation system.
Lala is the union that means it has a plan with several steps to attract the crowds
Some clubs have methods like Al-Rayyan to attract crowds. Of course, Al-Rayyan is rich, it doesn't need a crowd.
Some clubs must ensure that some club administrations organize activities and events.
The right of the public, motivating the right of the public, but I think these are the means we have
The player means the new generation
Their love for their work is their faith, more than their abilities. And not just material support, emotional support helps a lot too.
We definitely mean to thank you for this pleasant meeting, praise be to God.
We would like to take our final words from you on the occasion of this great victory, of course, Qatar winning the bid for the 2022 World Cup. Stay with us for the beginning.
We will return from where we came. Qatar insisted on the opposite, it backed down and complied. It always threatens and when it makes a promise, it breaks it.
By the will of God, may Captain Ali have the final word he wishes to address in this meeting.
I say to them "Mabrook" (congratulations) and "InshaAllah" (God willing) for the Imam, InshaAllah.
Thank you, Captain Qasem the player, and we wish you all the best, with the permission of Allah the Almighty, in your sports career and in your life as well. May Allah guide you, O Lord.
Let's love sports more and more
Topic of the episode: Youth Talents
Some young people think that this period is just a phase, that these songs are just a current trend, but they have a deep and very significant history.
A group of young people singing Arabic or English lyrics
We're going to continue this topic today with a group of rap enthusiasts
We will get to know them much better through our upcoming live meeting.
Welcome, everyone. Wherever you are.
Since years, a new type of singing has spread in the Arab world and the Gulf.
Coming from the West, specifically America, it's rap singing.
And before diving into the topic of rap singing
There are arguments for using any term without any reservation.
Anyone can sing rap.
Writing lyrics
Almost all rap singers write their own lyrics.
Generally, all these details are numerous and important. We will get to know them through two insiders in this field who are very knowledgeable.
Form a nice group
Good morning, Yusuf Al-Nuaimi and Salman Abdullah Yusuf
Hello and welcome, Salman. Good morning.
Good morning, Hala
I'm very happy to have you with us through this program, of course.
And also, through of course the topic of rap singing
What's your take on the matter, Yusuf?
We saw that rap meant the art that was not supposed to exist in our country
Batrgha ehla
By the citizen's tongue
From it, there is joy, there is sadness, there is what means political topics.
Yes, I do rap.
These songs, when they are good, are an art form, just as visual art creates a painting, the poet writes a poem.
The singer can sing, the musician can play any instrument.
There is a sense of acceptance from the Qatari community and the Gulf community for this type of music.
210
It feels like people have started to love having playlists for rap songs.
Different ages
There are consequences, and there are people who have become more prominent and are being heard more.
It was like a website
How many of you are in this group so far?
Everyone can say words, write poetry, and deliver it in a rap style.
The rapper, I swear, just like you said, you can say he sings to himself.
He is the one who sometimes plays music and he is the one who composes the words
Got it, okay.
I swear to God, I recorded this song.
Sure, here is the translation: "Okay, now all these songs that you produced from Salman, from Yusuf, from any person in the same group."
What do you think, it could be available on a specific CD sold in the markets?
But you know that when you're a personality, I mean, I go and make an album and put it in the market, it's difficult, a commercial register, procedures, I mean.
Why didn't you think about it? There are twenty-five of you. The lone hand never claps.
ماشاء الله عندكم خمسة و عشرين يد الله يحفظكم جميعا كشباب و اخوة
Promote this CD. You can promote it through more than one website.
Do you have Facebook? Do you have YouTube too? Also through local newspapers.
There are probably twenty-four songs.
Registration is now open
A bit old but it was quite clear
The quality is a bit weak, but it's not the same time, but it's clear.
About fifty CDs
There's nothing I can say about it because some young people might have known this art for ten years
The registration power and the expected distribution during this period are currently different.
especially since there is a large collection of music, a large collection of techno music genres at the moment
These are the guys or these are the artists who produce a large number of sweet songs
We also talked about the events they participated in.
By God, look at the party that's happening in Doha, we participated in a single party
Of course, the Al-Sadd Club organized it for us, so they didn't force us.
The audience was captivated.
I saw something I didn't expect that number
The thing that surprised us is that the extended families are more
Families are more than just young people.
From to was organizing meant awesome
We were a bit disorganized and it was our first time in Doha.
No expected interest
The audience's reaction was amazing.
It was a long period with many benefits, meaning the songs
Sure, here is the translation: Alright, let's listen to a song or some lyrics that you've composed, for example, and it was released to the public and was well-received by the youth in particular.
For example, let's listen to some words and also show them to the viewer.
You might be able to hear it on the radio.
Yourself, please.
Please stay safe
I'm the problem, I'm messed up, you know
Let's hear it
Mom
With us now is the program Sabah Al-Duhail
الوحيد ييجي له يقوم الصبح نفسيته مفتوحه
Salman, like a mountain, has been in the rap game for five years.
The one, even if not accepted, is miserable
I brought a lot of people to their senses.
I need to censor the words
Give me a sentence from one of the songs you sang.
He's not just showing random songs, what he said now is the most important, they call it in English freestyle.
on the same weight
But when we sing a song, the words come together.
Thanks, let's keep it going
We can say good morning, my homeland, good morning Qatar with the program Sabah Al-Doha
You all are present here, live, directly for the viewers.
I see them, one and two and one, they are amazed, cooking up from the arts
With us is the Sabah Dooha program
The beautiful song you saw, of course
I'm currently focusing on the youth, insisting that she should be present online and everywhere.
How are you? When did you register it?
It was a cooperative.
Everyone among us has a right to themselves.
I feel like Yusuf can't accept my words, swallow them, or let them go.
Everyone takes words
We definitely expect that every artist, every painter, every poet always has
It's also possible to write about the love of nature.
In the love of the homeland itself
They definitely participated in the National Day through the march.
Through beautiful songs, as you are Qatari youth, you also represent Qatar.
Doha is dressing up to welcome the Asian Cup, of course, and there is a big march on the Corniche.
To welcome this event
Here are two rules we transfer to you these clips for reception, of course
Doha to host Asian Cup
From Doha Airport to here
Let's continue these clips live together
For there to be a demand, there must be a supply. The existence of this crowd, our students, means
I arrived early this morning at Doha's Hamad International Airport for the Asian Cup to complete
Preparations for hosting the major continental event
Let's revisit our guests Yusuf and Salman, who are managing the studio.
The importance of the Arab Gulf rap scene, specifically the Qatari scene
We can say about you that you are excellent.
God, I mean, we currently mean
Sure, here is the translation: "Enar, arrange a party, but definitely."
You're currently working on a specific event, and we'll announce it soon, inshallah, Yusuf.
InshaAllah, I mean, not necessarily, I mean, at least at first, the journey
We wish you all the best at the start of your journey. We are sure that our program, hopefully, will be your supporter with all our hearts.
Where is Salman and where do you all meet, as twenty-five young people?
Where is the meeting held and how are ideas presented? How do you write them down with others?
Sure, here is the translation: There must be some collaborative songs.
It's not necessary for one person, like Salman or Yusuf or any one of them, to sing a whole song.
There should be some harmony between you when you gather and where you gather.
By God, look at twenty-five of them, each one is difficult, gathering all of them at once.
I'll call Yusuf, I'll call Afran, and I'll call them so that today we can maybe meet up somewhere.
To come up with an idea for the song and the lyrics
and in its second way
I'll note down what you say.
I'll smack him and he'll keep going
This will be the end for you, Yusuf. I'll register and come back, I'll come back, I'll crush you, I'll finish you off.
Check out the external LLLL experiences available.
Take means acquire some of the great ladies for great artists
Take some experience, take from them, meaning with some techniques
Hey, we're always like that, right?
Artists who have years of experience in this field or have expertise and a presence in this field
One hears them, their methods, their ways, he tries to create a style, not to imitate.
It means that if I do the same style, the same tone of voice, the same level of words
I'm just sitting here, imitating. I'm not doing anything new, I'm doing something special for myself.
We use them for grilling.
Yes, I also expect there to be a large number of Gulf youth in the Gulf itself.
We will follow this report together in a primitive manner, benefit from it, and also enjoy seeing some of this report.
The fog still surrounds that talent which some people possess
Using very primitive means

A pomegranate branch or a fig branch
We are now practically applying the process of detecting water pipes.
Start now, go back standing. This is the end of the path.
Go back one more time
Go back, go back
It comes back to this, if the original comes from here, we'll put a mark.
And here ends the watercourse.
Experience and patience are greatly required
To enable the discoverer to access the motion sensitivity of the tools
I went to more than one area
95.5% means success
Of course, this is the method and the way to use the copper bars
No one knows, of course, an exact scientific explanation.
To this method
What is surprising is that the success rate of those who practice this primitive profession
More than 95%

Glory to Allah, man knows what he does not know. This is a report, of course, the one we took, of course, from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Insha'Allah
We should also take this opportunity.

The only hope is the music video
Insha'Allah, we wish you all the best through this team.
We hope that your songs are always, inshallah, present in the Arab world and beyond.
Indeed, this is a sophisticated art, a widely heard art.
It contains messages like you mentioned

Identify the person who shops at the F L Supermarket or elsewhere
Anything you want to put in the car, anything you want to buy, you can.
A larger screen is displayed, displaying the components of this product
This was also a great idea and feasible.
Just a barakot escan works, the item will be revealed in the car
It provides the buyer with an easier purchasing process.
It takes full details on a special screen.
I expect it will be healthier.

Mashallah as well, the cultural center for childhood
Let's also discuss, Professor Abdullah, the various activities that we will hopefully see in the coming days.
Yes, by God, there are surprises of course, I mean but a quick pass
Here are some ideas if you'd like, mention them from some of the projects you've seen or not:
The main clever or creative idea behind this, for example, this movement under the ground, is that...
Everyone who leaves their house has a reason.
They gather at a specific point.
These are, of course, all the pictures that we are sitting and watching. I expect you will enjoy them.
Children's AI Creations
Exactly yes, this is for example in the same cash machine
I have a card, for example, for women.
I need a black t-shirt, for example.
This is an example, like some stores now or for example, I have some missing things at home, a key, I don't know what to do.
I don't have much time, for example, the office keys, the car keys
Our main goal is to elevate the status of the museum, of course.
His Highness the Prince

One was chosen from among 300 children.
We also have promising speakers in Ramadan

We truly want to open our hearts and doors to all children who wish to present their programs.
After them, they set off
Our need for their support and presence is a top priority for us.
These projects and programs serve this main idea.
The diversity and variation in children's skills
الترجمة: Self-development
We have some cooperation with various different youth clubs in Qatar
There are also scientific clubs present in Qatar.
We of course build all our programs on partnerships
All our programs are specialized partnerships

We're walking around in it now, especially us. Right now, it's the time of caution.
Building a promising scientific future for all children, upcoming generations, and the youth to come, God willing.
The word I want to present to the guardians, the youth who follow us, and the children who want to be present through the center
What we are giving now
Times of our childhood have ideas we do not belittle or consider insignificant.
We must pay attention to it, whatever these ideas may be.
Because indeed, whoever is interested in this idea will develop this idea at least to cultivate the child's love for thinking.
This is very important that I pay attention
I connect with him spiritually. I'm connecting with him now. Our big issue is that most fathers
Offers him support
Encourage him, we urge parents and educators
Children with autism today are our future. They are the essence of that future.
We really lived and wandered around this exhibition among their projects
I was living in a dream
It means that in a dream, all ideas are vast imagination.
And now the dream definitely means reality. There are many dreams that have come true and have become a reality.
الحمدلله, فنتمنى إن شاء الله التوفيق لاطفالنا الذين كانوا متواجدين
Our hopes are with you, inshallah
With His permission
People of all ages and genders
I reached seventy projects
Innovative and newly implemented projects
To discuss this exhibition further
The National and the Cultural Center for Childhood as well
Professor Abdullah Al-Izaa initially gave us a brief overview of the exhibition.
What brings together a multitude of activities in its essence? What can we say concisely about this exhibition?
It was a new way for children to express their love, loyalty, and belonging to their country.
Minister of Education and Higher Education
In his tour, the inspector came to this inspection.
He starts to grow with him until he reaches twenty, thirty.
Sure, here is the translation: Of course, we started training children to see Qatar 2030 through its five pillars.
Human development Economic development Sustainable development Environmental development
First, it's known that Qatar will host the World Cup in 2022, where will it reach?
Then he starts to think about how his way of thinking is.
How to excel and come up with creative ideas
I expect it means his field is vast, praise be to him.
But when we give it certain symbols and help it
I expect his thinking will grow much more.
Professor, you have launched the exhibition under the slogan, as its name is, Dreams of Generations, Facts of Tomorrow.
She is the emblem of today's generations' dreams
He will be part of Qatar's future, Qatar Next Generation.
We indeed felt this while walking with the children when the child speaks, he says "For Saad al-Waezir".
I want you to launch my project. I invite you to visit my project on the 20th of March.
The child thinks after twenty years
He expresses his love for his homeland and what he means to cherish from his field.
Sure, here is the translation: It is definitely accompanied by various activities and events.
There was the winner of the Science Stars award among them

The colorful flag, of course, was also part of the vision and children's dream for Qatar's future.
I was thinking about twenty-two twenty-two
How can a child contribute to a creative project on April 22nd and enjoy it
Its main idea is to have a slice present in the sphere.
Provides color when judging
If, for example, you go to, let's say, every match, everyone watches the referee's movements through
He and his movements on the field, and what changes in it through this electronic brochure
The one who is present in the sphere
Ideas, of course, are creative. The main idea is that many people might be surprised and ask us.
These are the projects
We always say we've reached the children
At this stage of developing or nurturing these skills, it's about broadening their horizons.
Giving them the idea of expressing love for the homeland through these projects
Giving them the confidence to present their project to the public and explain their idea.
In his areas of interest, whatever he likes, all of this is considered an achievement.
And he provided support that meant a lot to me, and I am grateful for it.
The input is currently in the development stages.
In the support of some officials, the committee's support, and I expect public support as well
The forest was not the second forest because this is the girl.
Method for members to enter the channels that the pipes that visitors enter under the ground

The visitor can stroll around and see animals, excuse me, reptiles under the earth.

In the marine environment and entering it in any innovative way
The reason for her success is also her extensive, detailed imagination.
This, of course, is where its people are from.
A tourist city under the sea
In those who speak of a city of butterflies
In the one who speaks of his forest, his forest is above the earth.
Those who talk about many tourist ideas
It's exciting
Perhaps this is what children's minds are like now, maybe at 35, 50.
Perhaps these things will actually come true in the future.
Three projects
I adopted this from the Scientific Club, these are the projects I need now, I want to work on them.
Project, for example, the one that wants the water, the air conditioning
I see the Arab newspaper now
The news says Qatar University celebrates graduation

Complete control is in the hands of the ruler.
Good, this deception will be added to the student's file.

He sees how much his son has grown, so to speak.
He also sees his grades and pays attention to his teachers.
We truly enjoy the intelligence of this beautiful little girl.
We have brought most of the children present at the center and send them our warmest greetings.
I entered this center with a compliant teacher present through this center
