There were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the time of the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from that time to the birth of Jesus Christ. The birth of Jesus Christ
The birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way: His mother Mary was betrothed to a man named Joseph. But before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.
But her husband Yusuf was a righteous man and did not want to expose her, so he decided to divorce her quietly.
While he considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
"She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."
Thus it was done to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through the prophet:
"Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name 'Immanuel,' which means, 'God with us.'"
When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took his wife home.
But he did not know her until she gave birth to the child whom he named "Jesus."
Wise men from the East
And when Jesus was born in Bethlehem in the region of Judea under King Herod, some wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.
And they asked, "Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
King Herod was disturbed by these words, as was everyone in Jerusalem.
And Herod gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, and inquired of them where Christ should be born.
They said to him: "In the city of Bethlehem in the region of Judea, because this is what has been written by the prophet:"
«You, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means the least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people Israel.»
And Herod summoned the wise men and met with them privately, and he ascertained from them the exact time when the star appeared.
Then he sent them to the town of Bethlehem. "Go and search for the child," he said. "And when you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him."
And the wise men listened to the king, then they went. And there, the star they had seen in the East went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
They were overjoyed when they saw the star.
And they entered the house and saw the child with his mother Mary, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Then God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod, so they went back to their own country by another route. The flight to Egypt
After the wise men had departed, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph took the child and his mother by night and went to Egypt.
And he remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son." #Out of … my son. 15:2 From the book of Hosea 11:1. Herod kills the children of Bethlehem
When Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him, he was very angry, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, according to the time that the wise men had told him.
Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:
A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping. Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted, because they are no more. The return from Egypt
After Herod's death, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream in Egypt.
He said to him: "Rise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead."
Joseph took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned by God in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,
And he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene. #Nazarene. 23:2 Referring to the city of Nazareth. It is also a word similar to the Hebrew word meaning "branch" found in Isaiah 11:1, referring to the promise of the coming of the Messiah from the line of David.
John the Baptist
In those days, John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
He used to say: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the one about whom the prophet Isaiah spoke, saying: "The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.'"
John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
At that time, people began to come to him from Jerusalem, from all of Judea, and from the region around the Jordan River to listen to him.
And he baptized them in the Jordan River after they confessed their sins.
"When John saw that many of the Pharisees and Sadducees were coming to his baptism, he said to them, 'You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?'"
Show your faith through your actions.
Boast not, saying: 'Abraham is our father.' For I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
Behold, the axe is laid at the root of the trees. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
"I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me comes one who is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
He will carry his sheaves in his hand, and he will winnow his grain, gathering his wheat into the granary, but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire.” The Baptism of Jesus
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, so why do you come to me?"
Jesus answered him, "Allow it now, for it is fitting for us to fulfill all that God requires." Then John permitted him to be baptized.
And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him.
And a voice came from heaven, saying: “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”
The experience of Jesus
And the Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
After fasting forty days and forty nights, Jesus was hungry.
And the tempter came to him #the tempter. 3:4 Satan. And he said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
But Jesus answered him, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”
Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
He said to him: "If you are truly the Son of God, throw yourself down from here. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you,' and 'They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'"
Jesus answered him, "It is also written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
Then the devil took him to a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.
Then he said to him, "I will give you all of this if you bow down to me."
Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'"
Then Satan left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him. Jesus begins His ministry in Galilee.
When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee.
But he did not stay in Nazareth. Instead, he went and lived in a town called Capernaum, which is by the lake of Galilee, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali.
"See, it is written what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet Isaiah:"
Land of Zebulun and Naphtali, the way of the Mediterranean Sea, beyond the Jordan, the land of Galilee, where the nations live in strangeness.
The people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light; on those dwelling in the land of the shadow of death light has arisen.
From that time on, Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chose some of his disciples
While Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
He said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
They immediately left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus went from there. He saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. He saw them in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their fishing nets, and He called them.
They left the boat and their father immediately and followed him. Jesus teaches and heals.
Jesus was traveling in every region of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. And He was healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
And news about him spread throughout all the land of Syria. So they brought to him all the sick, those afflicted with various diseases and pains, demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics, and he healed them all.
And a great multitude of the people followed him, from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and from beyond Jordan.
Teaching of Jesus
When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him,
And he began to speak and teach them, saying:
"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
Congratulations to the bereaved, for God will comfort them.
Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. #They will inherit the earth. 5:5 See Psalm 37:11. This may refer to a future spiritual inheritance.
Congratulations to the hungry and thirsty for doing God's will, #for doing God's will. 6:5 Literally: "to righteousness." For God will satisfy them.
Congratulations to the merciful, for Allah will have mercy on them.
Congratulations to the pure in heart, for they will see God.
Congratulations to those who work for peace, for they shall be called children of God.
Congratulations to those who are persecuted for righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Congratulations when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely accuse you of doing evil because you are my disciples.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven. Because that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you. You are the salt of the earth. You are the light of the world.
You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its taste, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
"You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden."
And do not light a lamp and put it under a basket! But put it on a stand, that it may give light to all in the house.
"In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven." Jesus and the Law of Moses
"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil."
I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter or the least stroke of a pen will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.
"Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be considered the least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever practices and teaches these commandments will be considered great in the kingdom of heaven."
For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. "Anger"
«You know it was said to your ancestors: 'Do not murder.' #DoNotMurder. 21:5 From Exodus 20:13, and Deuteronomy 5:17. And whoever murders deserves to be judged.»
But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, 'Raca,' is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.
Therefore, if you are presenting an offering on the altar, and there you remember that someone has something against you,
Leave your offering there in front of the altar, go first and be reconciled with that person, and then come and present your offering.
Forgive your opponent quickly, as you walk with him on the way to the court. Otherwise, he will hand you over to the judge, and the judge will hand you over to the jailer, who will throw you into prison.
I'm telling you the truth, you won't get out of there until you pay the last penny. Fornication
"Have you not heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' #YouShallNotCommitAdultery. 27:5 From Exodus 20:14, and Deuteronomy 5:18.
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
Therefore, if your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and cast it from you. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be cast into hell.
And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell. Divorce
It was also said, 'If a man divorces his wife, he must give her a certificate of divorce.' #If a man divorces … that. 31:5 From Deuteronomy 24:1.
But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
"Have you not heard that it was also said to your ancestors: 'Do not swear falsely, but fulfill your oaths to the Lord.' #Do not break your word … to the Lord. 33:5 See Leviticus 19:12, Numbers 30:2, and Deuteronomy 23:21."
But I tell you: Do not swear at all.
Swear not by the heaven, for it is the throne of Allah, nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet. #Footstool of His feet. 35:5 Meaning, He is above it and under His command. Nor by the city of Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
Do not swear by your head, for you cannot make a single hair of it black or white.
If you are willing to say "yes," say "yes"; if you are willing to say "no," say "no." Anything beyond this is from the evil one. #evil. 37:5 The devil. Resisting evil
"Have you not heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth'? #Eye ... for a tooth. 38:5 From Exodus 21:24, and Leviticus 24:20.
But I tell you: Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other cheek as well.
And if anyone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.
And if anyone forces you to go with him one mile, go with him two miles.
And if anyone asks you for something, give it to him. Do not refuse to lend to one who asks you to borrow. Love everyone.
"Ye have heard that it hath been said, ‹Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.› #Love … thy enemy. Matthew 5:43 Leviticus 19:18."
But I tell you: Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you,
Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. For he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
If you love only those who love you, what reward do you deserve? Don't even tax collectors do the same?
If you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even pagans do the same?
"Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
Giving
"Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven."
When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
That your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you. Prayer
"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full."
But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
"And when you come together, let each of you be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath. For the ungodly man speaks every harmful thing as well as the evil thing which he has done; and these things abound through many. My brethren, let not many of you become teachers, knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment. For we all stumble in many things. If anyone does not stumble in word, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body. Indeed, we put bits in horses' mouths that they may obey us, and we turn their whole body. Look also at ships: although they are so large and are driven by fierce winds, they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires. Even so the tongue is a little member and boasts great things. See how great a forest a little fire kindles! And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. The tongue is so set among our members that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire by hell. For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and creature of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind. But no man can tame the tongue. It is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the similitude of God. Out of the same mouth proceed blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be so. Does a spring send forth fresh water and bitter from the same opening? Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh."
Therefore, do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be Your name,
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
And forgive us our trespasses, as we also forgive those who trespass against us.
And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. #theevilone. 13:6 The devil (Iblis). For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.
For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Fasting
"When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full."
But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face.
So that people do not notice that you are fasting. Your father who does not see you, sees it. Then your father who sees what happens in secret, will reward you. God or money
"Store not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break through and steal."
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
"The light of the body is the eye. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light."
But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is really darkness, how great is the darkness!
No one can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth. #Wealth. 24:6 Literally "Mammon," an Aramaic word meaning "wealth," in its negative sense, representing here a god that people serve instead of God. The kingdom of God first.
"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?"
Behold the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?
Who among you can add an hour to their life when they are worried?
"Why are you anxious about what you will wear? Look at how the lilies of the field grow. They toil not, neither do they spin."
But I tell you, no one has ever been clothed like one of them, not even Solomon in all his splendor.
If God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
"Therefore do not worry and do not say to yourselves, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'"
For these are the things that the people of the hereafter seek, and your heavenly Father knows that you need all of them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you also.
Do not worry about tomorrow, for each day has enough trouble of its own, and tomorrow will have its own worries.
Judging others
"Judge not, that you be not judged."
For he will judge in the way you judge others, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye, but do not notice the large plank in your own eye?
How can you say to your brother, "Let me take the speck out of your eye," when there is a large plank in your own eye?
You hypocrite! First take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine! For they will trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Persevere in asking
Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.
For everyone who asks receives, and everyone who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.
Who among you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a live one?
You, despite your wickedness, know how to give good gifts to your children. Is not the Father in heaven more willing to give good gifts to those who ask Him? The Golden Rule
"Treat others as you would like others to treat you. This is the meaning of the law of Moses and the teaching of the prophets. It is the path to heaven and the path to hell."
"Enter through the narrow gate. For the gate that leads to destruction is wide and the road is easy, and many enter through it."
But the gate that leads to life is very narrow, and the path to it is filled with difficulties, and only a few find this path. Warning against false teachings
"Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves."
You will know them by their deeds. For people do not gather grapes from thorn bushes, nor figs from thistles!
Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, and every bad tree bears bad fruit.
No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You will know the false prophets by their fruits.
"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven."
Many will say to me on that last day: 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name? Did we not cast out demons in your name? Did we not do many mighty works in your name?'
At that time I will say to them clearly: I have never known you. Depart from me, you evildoers. The wise man and the foolish man
"Whoever hears these teachings of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
It rained, the streams rose, the wind blew and beat against that house, but it did not fall, because its foundation was on the rock.
All those who listen to my words and do not act upon them are like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
The rain came down, the floodwaters rose, the wind blew and struck that house, and it collapsed in a great fall!
When Jesus finished saying these things, the people were amazed at his teaching,
For he taught them with authority, not as the teachers of the law.
Jesus cleanses a leper
Then Jesus came down from the mountains, and many followed Him.
And a leper came to Him and bowed before Him, saying, "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean."
And Jesus put out his hand and touched him, saying, "I will; be clean." And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
Then Jesus said to him, "See that you don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." #Go ... to the priest. 4:8 The priest was the one who, according to the law, declared a leper clean. Offer the sacrifice that Moses prescribed, so that they may learn that you have been healed." The faith of a Roman officer
And Jesus entered Capernaum, and a centurion came to Him, #centurion. 5:8 Literally "a leader of a hundred." Repeated in verses 8, 13.
He said: "My lord, my servant is very ill and bedridden at home. He is motionless and suffering from severe pain."
And Jesus said to him, "I will go and heal him."
The officer replied: "My lord, I am not worthy of you entering my house. All you need to do is say a word and my servant will be healed."
"I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith."
I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
But those who were supposed to inherit the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth!
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go; let it be done for you as you have believed." And the servant was healed in that hour. "He took our illnesses"
When Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed, and she was very feverish.
Jesus touched her hand, the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve him.
In that evening, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed; and He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.
This is to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: "He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases." Followers of Jesus
When Jesus saw a large crowd around Him, He commanded His disciples to go to the other side of the lake.
And one of the scholars of the law came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
And another of his disciples said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm
Jesus got into the boat, and his disciples followed him.
Then a great storm arose on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped with waves. But Jesus was sleeping.
They approached him and woke him up, saying: "Master, save us! We are perishing."
And Jesus said to them, "Why are you afraid, you of little faith?" Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
But they were amazed and said, "What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?" Jesus cast out evil spirits from two men.
Then Jesus arrived at the region of the Gadarenes, on the other side of the lake. Two demon-possessed men came to him from among the tombs. They were so dangerous that no one dared to travel that way.
The evil spirits shrieked: "What do you want from us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the appointed time?"
There was a large herd of pigs grazing at a distance from them.
The evil spirits begged him, saying, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
And Jesus said to them, "Go!" Then the evil spirits came out of the men and went into the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water.
The shepherds fled to the town, and they told the people what had happened to those possessed by evil spirits.
All the people of the town came out to see Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a paralytic
Jesus got into a boat to cross to the other side of the lake, and he came to his own town.
Then some people brought to him a paralyzed man lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Some of my religious teachers would say: "This man insults God with his words."
Jesus knew their thoughts and said, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Which of the two is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk?'
But I will show you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” Then he said to the paralyzed man, “Get up, take your mat and go home!”
He got up and went home.
And when the people saw this, they were amazed and gave glory to God, for he had given such authority to people. When Jesus was followed
While Jesus was passing by, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's place. And He said to him, "Follow Me!" So he got up and followed Him.
While he was eating in Matthew's house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked His disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, He said, "Those who are well do not need a physician, but those who are sick."
Go and understand what the book means when it says: "For I desire mercy, not sacrifice." #I desire … sacrifice. 13:9 from Hosea 6:6. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." Question about fasting
Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast."
No one mends an old garment with a piece of new cloth, because the new cloth will shrink and tear the old garment, making the hole worse.
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; or else the new wine will burst the wineskins, and the wine will be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined. But new wine must be put into new wineskins, and both are preserved.” Jesus raises a dead girl // and heals a bleeding woman
While Jesus was speaking, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him and said: "My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus got up and went with the high priest, and his disciples followed.
There was a woman who had been suffering from severe bleeding for twelve years. She came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his cloak.
She said to herself: "Only if I touch his cloak will I be healed."
And Jesus turned around, saw her, and said, "Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well." And the woman was made well from that moment.
When Jesus arrived at the house of the synagogue leader, he saw people playing funeral dirges and the crowd in an uproar.
He said, "Come out. The girl is not dead, but sleeping." And they laughed at him.
When the people had been sent outside, Jesus went in, took the girl by the hand, and she got up.
And news about Jesus spread throughout that region. Jesus heals two blind men and drives out an evil spirit.
After leaving that place, Jesus was followed by two blind men, who cried out, "Son of David, have mercy on us."
When Jesus entered the house, two blind men came to Him. Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to heal you?" They answered, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes and said, "Be it unto you according to your faith."
And the blind men regained their sight. Then Jesus sternly warned them, "See that no one knows about this."
But they went and spread the news throughout that region.
While they were going away, some people brought to Jesus a man who was mute, because he was possessed by demons.
And Jesus cast out the evil spirit, and the man who could not speak began to talk. The people were amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees began to say, "He drives out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
And Jesus was going about in all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom. And He was healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
When Jesus saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Jesus said to his disciples: "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few."
"Ask the Lord of the Harvest to send out workers into his harvest field."
Jesus sends his disciples
And Jesus called to him his twelve disciples, and gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.
These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon who is also called Peter, and his brother Andrew, James son of Zebedee and his brother John,
Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus,
Simon, also known as "the Zealot," #theZealot. 4:10 From a Jewish political party that resisted Roman rule, called the "Zealots." And Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus.
And Jesus sent out these twelve, instructing them as follows: "Do not go into any Gentile territory or enter any Samaritan town,"
Go, rather, to the straying sheep of the House of Israel.
And they announced that the Kingdom of Heaven is near.
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.
Do not carry in your money belts gold or silver or copper.
Do not carry a bag, nor an extra garment, nor extra sandals, nor a staff. For the worker is worthy of his food.
"When you enter any city or village, search for a worthy person there, and stay with them until you leave the city."
When you enter a house, greet its inhabitants.
If the people of the house are deserving, then your peace will be upon them. And if they are not deserving, then your peace will return to you.
If anyone does not welcome you or listen to your message, leave that house or city, and shake off the dust from your feet.
I tell you the truth, on the day of judgment, it will be more bearable for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city. Jesus warns of the difficulties
"Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. So be wise as serpents and innocent as doves."
Beware of people, for they will deliver you to courts, and they will flog you in their synagogues.
And they will deliver you up to councils and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.
When they arrest you, do not worry about what you will say. For in that hour you will be given what to say.
Remember that it is not you who will speak, but the Spirit of your Father who will speak through you.
A man will deliver his brother to death, and a father his child. And children will rise against their parents and have them put to death.
All people will hate you because of my name, but whoever remains faithful to the end, this one will be saved.
When they persecute you in one town, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
There is no better student than a teacher, nor a greater servant than a master.
Let the disciple be content to be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, #Beelzebub. 25:10 One of the names of Satan. Reference to Matthew 9:34. What will they call the rest of the household? The fear of God, not of men.
"Fear them not, for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, nor hidden that will not be known."
All that I have spoken to you in the dark, speak in the light; and what has been whispered in your ears, proclaim from the housetops.
"Fear not those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell."
Do two sparrows not sell for a penny? Yet not one of them falls to the ground without your Father's consent.
But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
If you are not afraid, you are worth more than many sparrows. Acknowledging Christ before people
"Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven."
And whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven. Christ first
"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword!"
Came: "A man is not divided from his father, a daughter from her mother, and a daughter-in-law from her mother-in-law."
The enemies of man are the people of his own house!›
"For whoever loves his father or his mother more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."
And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
Whoever tries to gain his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will gain it.
"Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me."
Whoever welcomes a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.
"And whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who are my disciples, because he is a disciple, truly I say to you, he will not lose his reward."
John the Baptist and Jesus
When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities. Jesus and John the Baptist
While John the Baptist was in prison, he heard about all that Christ was doing, so he sent a message with some of his disciples
He asked him: "Are you the one we are waiting for, or should we wait for another?"
And Jesus answered them, saying, "Go and tell John what you have heard and seen:
Behold, the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have the good news preached to them.
"Congratulations to those who do not hesitate to believe in Me."
And when John's disciples had gone, Jesus began to speak to the people about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
Why did you come out? To see a man dressed in soft clothing? Those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.
Why did you go out? To see a prophet? Indeed, he is. But I tell you, you have seen one greater than a prophet!
This is what was written about him: ‹Behold, I send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.›»
"I tell you the truth, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist. Yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
From the time of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and the forceful take it by force.
For the law of Moses and all the prophets prophesied until John.
If you want to accept what the prophets and the scripture say, then John is Elijah who was prophesied to come. #Elijah ... his coming. 14:11 Elijah was one of God's prophets around 850 BC. And the Jews were expecting his coming based on Malachi 4: 5-6.
"Let him who has two ears listen."
What is this generation like? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to one another.
We sang for you, but you did not dance. We sang you dirges, but you did not weep!
John came, who did not eat like others and did not drink wine like others, so people said about him: 'He has an evil spirit.'
Then came the Son of Man, who eats and drinks wine like others, and the people said about him: 'Look at this man, he is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' But the fruits of wisdom are what prove it to be true wisdom.' Jesus warns the guilty cities.
Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent.
And he said, "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, and sat in sackcloth and ashes."
But I tell you that the fate of the people of Tyre and Sidon will be more bearable than yours on the day of judgment.
And you, Capernaum, do you think you will be lifted up to the heavens? No, you will go down to the depths! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.
But I tell you that it will be more bearable for the people of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.” Jesus is the source of comfort
At that time, Jesus spoke and said: "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children."
"Yes, father, because you were pleased with this work."
"The Father has entrusted everything to me. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal him."
"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."
Carry my yoke #Yoke. 29:11 The yoke is a wooden tool placed on animals to help them carry heavy loads, and it is a Jewish symbol of the law. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
"Because the yoke that I give you is easy, and the burden that I put upon you is light."
Jesus: Lord of the Sabbath
At that time, Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and eat.
But when the Pharisees saw this, they said to Him, "Look, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read in the Scriptures what David did when he and his companions were hungry?"
He entered the House of God and ate from the sacred bread offered to God, even though it is not permissible for him or those with him to eat that bread, but it is only allowed for the priests alone.
Have you not also read in the Law of Moses how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple break the Sabbath and yet are guiltless?
But I tell you that here is something greater than the temple.
If you only knew what the book means when it says: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." #I want ... animal sacrifice. 7:12 from Hosea 6:6. When you judged those innocents.
"For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath." Healing on the Sabbath
Then he left that place and went to their gathering.
There was a man with a withered hand. Then they asked Jesus, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" So that they might accuse Him.
He said to them, "Suppose one of you has only one sheep, and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath. Will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
"The human is more important than the sheep. If he does good on Saturday, it is in accordance with the law."
Then Jesus said to the man with the withered hand, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and it was completely restored, just like the other one.
The Pharisees went out and began to plot together how they might kill Jesus. Jesus: The chosen servant of God
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, departed thence: and a great multitude followed him, and he healed them all.
They were ordered not to reveal his identity.
"Thus it was fulfilled what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet Isaiah:"
Behold my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, with whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
No one will sue anyone, nor will they scream. No one will hear their voice in their streets.
It will not break until the bent reed, nor will it extinguish until the smoking wick. And it will persist until it makes justice prevail.
"And all nations will place their hope in Him." Jesus the Sultan
Then they brought to him a man who was both blind and mute, because he was possessed by an evil spirit. Jesus healed him, and the mute man began to speak and see.
And the people were amazed and said, "Can this man be the son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man drives out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
And when Jesus knew their thoughts, He said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If Satan drives out demons and is divided against himself, how then can his kingdom stand?
If I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
How can one enter a strong man's house and plunder his property, unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.
"Whoever is not with me is against me. And whoever does not gather with me scatters."
Therefore I say to you: Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
Whoever speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. The fruit reveals the truth.
"To obtain good fruit, plant a good tree. But a bad tree gives you bad fruit. For a tree is known by its fruit."
You brood of vipers, how can you speak good things, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
The good person brings forth good things from the good stored within him, and the evil person brings forth evil things from the evil stored within him.
But I tell you that on the Day of Judgment, people will be held accountable for every word they have spoken.
Your words will determine your acquittal or conviction. Jewish leaders demand proof.
Then some teachers of the law and Pharisees demanded of him, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
He answered them, "This is a wicked and adulterous generation. It asks for a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
Just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
The people of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment against this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and now one greater than Jonah is here.
The Queen of the South #QueenOfTheSouth. 42:12 The Queen of Sheba. She traveled nearly two thousand kilometers to hear the wisdom of God from King Solomon. See 1 Kings 10: 1-13. The day of judgment against this generation and it will condemn it. She came from the ends of the earth to hear Solomon's wisdom. And now here before you is one greater than Solomon. The empty soul
When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.
Then he says: "I will return to my house from which I came." So he goes and finds the house empty, swept, and put in order.
Then he goes and brings seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there. Thus the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So it will be with this wicked generation.” The disciples of Jesus are his family.
While Jesus was speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside and sent word to him to speak to them.
He replied to him, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you."
Jesus replied, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"
Then he pointed with his hand to his disciples and said, "These are my mother and my brothers,"
"For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother.”
Like seeds
On that day, Jesus left the house and sat by the lakeside.
A large crowd gathered around him. So he got into a boat and sat in it, while the people stood on the shore.
He spoke to them at length in parables, saying: “A farmer went out to sow.”
While he was sowing, some of the seeds fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured them.
Some seeds fell on rocky ground, where there was not enough soil, and the grains grew quickly because the soil was not deep.
But when the sun rose, it burned, and because it had no roots, it withered.
And some of the seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.
And other seeds fell on good soil, and some yielded a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.
"He who has two ears, let him hear.» Hearing and understanding"
And the disciples came to him, saying, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
Jesus replied, "You have been given the privilege of knowing the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but they have not."
For everyone who has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. But whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.
For this reason I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.
And thus the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled: "You will hear and hear, but you will not understand. You will see and see, but you will not perceive."
The mind of this people has become dull, and their ears are hard of hearing. They have closed their eyes, so that they cannot see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and return to me and be healed.
Congratulations to your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.
I tell you the truth, many kings and righteous people have longed to see what you see and did not see, and to hear what you hear and did not hear. It is like the parable of the seed.
Listen to the explanation like seeds:
When a person hears the message of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes. 19:13 That is, the devil. (Also in verse 38) And takes the seeds that were sown in his heart. This is the meaning of the seeds that fell by the wayside.
But as for that which fell on the rocky ground, these are they who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with gladness;
But because it has no roots in itself, it stands for a short time, and when tribulation and persecution come because of the word, it quickly falls away.
But those that fell among thorns are like those who hear the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
"As for what was sown on good soil, it is he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty." Like the wheat and the weeds
He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
But while people were sleeping, the man's enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and then left.
When the wheat grew and formed ears, so did the weeds.
And his servants came to him and said to him: "O master, did you not sow good seeds in your field? So where did these weeds come from?"
The man answered them: "My enemy did that." His slaves asked him: "Do you want us to go and uproot it?"
The man replied: "No, because when you uproot the weeds, you might uproot the wheat with them."
"Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: 'First gather together the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my storage.'" For example, the mustard seed and the yeast.
Then Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in his field."
It is the smallest of all seeds. But when it grows, it becomes the largest of garden plants, turning into a big tree, even birds of the sky come to it, and make their nests in its branches.
He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until all of it was leavened."
Jesus spoke all these things in parables, and without a parable He did not speak to them.
This is what God said through the prophet: "I will open my mouth in parables, and utter hidden things, things from of old—things established from the creation of the world."
At that time Jesus dismissed the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He said to them: "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man,"
The field is the world, and the good seeds are those who belong to the kingdom. But the weeds are those who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sowed them is Iblis. The harvest is the end of the world. The reapers are the angels.
"As weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will be the end of the world."
Behold, the Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and those who practice lawlessness.
Then they throw them into the blazing furnace. There, people cry and gnash their teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear. The parable of the treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.
And the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls.
When he found a very precious pearl, he went and sold everything he had and bought it. Like a fishing net.
"and the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered some fish of every kind,"
When the net was full, the fishermen hauled it ashore. Then they sat down and began to choose the good fish, putting it in baskets, while the bad fish they threw out.
This is what will happen at the end of the world: the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous.
Then the wicked cast them into the blazing furnace. There, people weep and gnash their teeth.
And Jesus asked his disciples, "Do you understand all these things?" They said to him, "Yes."
He told them, "Therefore every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old." Jesus went to his hometown
And when Jesus had finished these parables, He departed from there.
When he went to his hometown, he began to teach them in their synagogue. Everyone was amazed and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these miracles?"
Isn't he the son of the carpenter? Isn't his mother Mary? Aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
But doesn't he have all his siblings among us? So where did he get all that he has?
It was an obstacle that prevented them from accepting him. But Jesus said to them, "No prophet is without honor except in his own country and in his own house!"
He did not do many miracles there, because of their lack of faith.
Herod hears about Jesus
At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard about Jesus. 1:14 Literally "the tetrarch." The Romans had divided Palestine into four tetrarchies, so the ruler of each was called a tetrarch. See Luke 3:1. About Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him." The death of John the Baptist
Herod was the one who arrested John and put him in prison. This was because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
For John had said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
For this reason, Herod wanted to kill him, but he was afraid of the people, because they considered John a prophet.
But when Herod's birthday came, Herodias' daughter danced before him and his guests, so Herod was greatly pleased,
He even promised and swore to give her whatever she asked for, no matter what.
But her mother had taught her what to ask, so she said: "Give me here the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was saddened, but he ordered her request to be granted due to his oath, and out of respect for his guests.
So he sent and had John beheaded in prison.
Then he brought his head on a platter and gave it to her, and she gave it to his mother.
Then the disciples of John came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus what had happened. Jesus feeds more than five thousand
When Jesus heard this, He got into a boat and went away to a deserted place by Himself. But when the crowds heard of this, they followed Him on foot from the towns.
And when He came down from the mountain, large crowds followed Him. Seeing the crowds, He felt compassion for them, and healed those who were ill among them.
In the evening, his disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's very late. Send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food."
But Jesus said to them, "There is no need for them to go away; you give them something to eat."
He said to them, "We have nothing here but five loaves of bread and two fish."
And Jesus said to them, "Bring her to Me."
And He commanded the people to sit down on the grass. Then Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He gave thanks and broke them. He gave the loaves to His disciples, and the disciples distributed them to the people.
They ate and were all satisfied. They gathered the leftover food, and there were twelve baskets full of broken pieces.
And the number of those who ate was five thousand men, besides women and children. Jesus walks on water
Then Jesus told his disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd.
After dismissing them, he went up onto the mountain by himself to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.
The boat was in the middle of the lake, with waves crashing against it violently, as the wind was against the direction of the boat.
Before the dawn, Jesus came to them walking on the sea.
When his disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. "It is a ghost," they said, and cried out in fear.
Jesus immediately said to them: "Take heart, it is I; do not be afraid."
And Peter answered Him, saying, "Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water."
He said to him, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter noticed the strong wind, he was afraid and began to sink, and he cried out: "Lord, save me."
And immediately Jesus reached out His hand and took hold of him, and said to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
When Jesus and Peter got into the boat, the wind ceased.
Those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus and said, "You are truly the Son of God." Jesus heals many.
When they crossed the lake, they reached the area of Gennesaret.
And when the people of that region recognized Jesus, they spread the news throughout the surrounding area. They brought to him all who were ill,
And they begged him to let them touch just the edge of his cloak. And all who touched it were healed.
The law of God and the customs of people
At that time, some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked him:
"Why do your students break the traditions we inherited from our ancestors? They don't wash their hands before eating."
Jesus answered them, “And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?
God commanded and said: ‹Honor your father and your mother,› #Honor … your mother. 4:15 from Exodus 20:12, and Deuteronomy 5:16. And He said: ‹Whoever reviles father or mother must be put to death.› #Whoever reviles … must be put to death. 4:15 from Exodus 21:17.
But you say: 'Whoever says to his father or mother, "I cannot help you, for I have dedicated to God what I would have used to help you," is not bound to honor his father or mother.'
And thus you have made void the commandment of God because of your tradition.
O hypocrites, Isaiah spoke the truth when he prophesied about you and said:
This people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
Their worship is in vain, for they teach doctrines that are merely human commands.›»
And Jesus called the people to him and said to them: "Listen to me and understand what I say:"
"Nothing that enters a man from the outside can defile him; but the things that come out of him are what defile him."
At that time, the disciples came to him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard your words?"
Jesus answered, "Every plant that my Father has not planted will be uprooted."
"Leave them, they are blind leading the blind. And if a blind person leads another blind person, both will fall into the pit."
Peter replied: "Explain this parable to us."
Jesus said, "Have you not understood yet?"
Do you not understand that whatever enters the mouth of a man goes into the stomach and then is expelled?
But what comes out of the mouth of a person, comes from the heart. And this is what defiles a person.
For out of the heart come evil thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.
"These are the things that defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile him." Jesus helps a foreign woman
Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman from that region came to him, crying out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and in great distress."
Jesus did not say a word. Then his disciples came to him and asked him, saying: "Send her away, for she is following us and shouting."
He said: "I was sent only to the stray sheep of the children of Israel."
But the woman approached him and knelt before him, saying, "Lord, help me."
Jesus answered, "It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs."
She said: "True, sir, but even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, your faith is great. Let it be to you as you wish.” And in that moment, her daughter was healed. Jesus healed many.
Jesus left that place and went to a region near the Sea of Galilee. He went up on a mountainside and sat down there.
And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them.
Crowds were amazed when they saw the mute speak, the lame made well, the paralyzed walk, and the blind see. So they glorified the God of Israel. Jesus feeds more than four thousand.
And Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me three days and have nothing to eat. And I am unwilling to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."
He said to them, "Where are we to get bread enough for so many in this desolate place?"
Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven loaves and a few small fish."
Then Jesus ordered the people to sit down on the ground.
Took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, and broke them. Then he gave them to his disciples, and they distributed them to the crowd.
And they all ate and were satisfied. Then they gathered the remaining fragments, and there were seven baskets full.
The number of those who ate was four thousand men, besides women and children.
When Jesus dismissed the crowds, He got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
The leaders of the Jews test Jesus
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus to test him. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven to prove that God supported him.
Jesus answered them: "When the sun sets, you say: 'The weather will be fine, for the sky is red.'"
In the early morning, you say: "The day will be stormy, for the sky is red and gloomy." You are good at interpreting weather signs, but you do not understand the times you live in!
This wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, and no sign will be given to them except the sign of the prophet Jonah.” Then He left them and departed. Understanding
And Jesus' disciples went to the other side of the lake, but they forgot to bring bread.
Jesus said to them: "Beware and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees."
And the disciples began to talk among themselves, saying, "But we didn't bring any bread!"
Jesus knew their thoughts and said, "You of little faith, why do you discuss among yourselves that you have no bread?"
Have you not yet understood? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets of fragments you gathered?
Do you not remember the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered of the broken pieces?
"Why can't you understand that I was not speaking to you about ordinary bread, but I was warning you to guard yourselves against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees?"
Then his disciples understood that he was not telling them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter declared that Jesus is the Christ.
When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say the Son of Man is?”
And his disciples answered him, "Some say you are John the Baptist, others say you are Elijah, and others say you are Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
Then Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven."
And I tell you that you are Peter, #Peter. 18:16 From the Greek «Petros» meaning «rock.» And on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades #gates of Hades. 18:16 That is, the power of death. It will not overcome it.
"And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
Then he sternly warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus speaks about the inevitability of his death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.
But Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, "Far be it from You, Lord! This shall not happen to You!"
And Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples: "If anyone wants to come with me, he must deny himself, take up his cross and follow me."
Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? And what can a man give in exchange for his life?
For the Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will render to each according to his deeds.
"I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
Jesus, accompanied by Moses and Elijah
After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
While they were there, the appearance of Jesus changed, and He began to shine like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light.
And suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared before the disciples, and they were talking with Jesus.
Then Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If You wish, I will make here three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!"
When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were greatly afraid.
And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and said to them, “Arise, do not be afraid.”
When they looked around, they saw no one except Jesus.
As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, "Don't tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead."
And his disciples asked him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?" #Elijah ... first. 10:17 Elijah was one of God's prophets around 850 BC. The Jews expected his coming based on Malachi 4:5-6.
Jesus answered them, “To be sure, Elijah comes and will make everything as it should be.
But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wanted. In the same way the Son of Man will suffer at their hands."
Then his disciples understood that he was speaking about John the Baptist. Jesus casts out an evil spirit from a boy.
When they had come to the crowd, a man came to Jesus, kneeling before Him
He said: "Have mercy on my son, O Lord, for he is afflicted with epilepsy and suffers greatly. Often, he falls into fire or water."
"and I brought him to your disciples, and they were not able to heal him."
And Jesus said, "You faithless and twisted generation, how long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you?" Then he said to the man, "Bring your son here."
And Jesus commanded the evil spirit to come out of him, and the boy was healed immediately.
Then his disciples came to him privately and said, "Why could we not cast it out?"
Jesus answered them, "Because of your little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
But this kind only comes out by prayer and fasting." Jesus foretells the approach of his death
While they were going through the Galilee together, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.”
"And they will kill him. But on the third day, he will rise from the dead." The disciples were deeply grieved. The temple tax
When Jesus entered Capernaum, He came to Peter and those who collected the two-drachma tax for the temple, and they asked Him: "Does Your Teacher not pay the two-drachma tax?"
Peter answered them, "Yes." Then Peter went into the house. Jesus spoke to him first, saying, "Tell me, Simon, from whom do kings collect tribute and taxes? From their own children, or from others?"
And Peter answered him, "They collect it from the other peoples." But Jesus said to him, "Then the children are exempt."
But so as not to cause them any trouble, go to the lake, and cast a fishing rod. Then take the first fish you catch, and open its mouth. You will find a coin worth four dirhams inside. Take it and give it to them on my and your behalf.
