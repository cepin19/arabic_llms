All the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David to the captivity in Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the captivity in Babylon to the Christ are fourteen generations. The birth of Jesus Christ
The birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way: when his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.
Joseph was a righteous man and did not want to expose her, so he intended to divorce her secretly.
But when he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
"She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."
This is all to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:
"Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel" which means, "God with us."
When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took his wife.
And he did not know her until she gave birth to her firstborn son. And he called his name Jesus.
The Visit of the Magi
And when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem
Saying, “Where is the newborn king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.”
When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them, "Where is the Christ to be born?"
They replied, “In Bethlehem in Judea, for this is what the prophet wrote:”
"And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel."
Then Herod secretly called the Magi and ascertained from them the time when the star had appeared.
Then he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the child. And when you have found him, bring me word so that I may also go and pay him homage."
When they heard the king, they departed. And the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.
And they came into the house, and saw the young child with Mary his mother. And they fell down and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasures, and presented unto him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Then, when they were divinely instructed in a dream not to return to Herod, they withdrew by another route to their own country. The flight to Egypt
After they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. For Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
He took the child and his mother by night and withdrew to Egypt.
And he was there until the death of Herod. To fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called My son."
Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was in a furious rage, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men.
Then it came to pass, as he had said by the prophet Jeremiah:
A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they were no more. Return to Nazareth
When Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream in Egypt
Saying: "Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, because those who were seeking the child's life are dead."
He took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the district of Galilee.
And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets: "That he should be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea
Saying: “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
"For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
John's clothing was made of camel's hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
At that time, Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region around the Jordan went out to him.
And they relied on Him in Jordan, acknowledging their sins.
"When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, 'You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?'"
Make fruits worthy of repentance.
Think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
And now I have laid the axe at the root of the tree. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water for repentance, but the one who is coming after me is stronger than I am, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
"Who holds the winnowing fork in his hand, and will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and gather his wheat into the barn; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire." The baptism of Jesus Christ
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him.
But John tried to prevent him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"
And Jesus said to him, "Now permit it, for this is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he permitted him.
And when Jesus had been baptized, just as he came up from the water, suddenly the heavens were opened to him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him,
And a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
Jesus Faces Temptation
Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
After fasting for forty days and forty nights, he finally became hungry.
And the tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
And he answered and said, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.'"
Then the devil took Him to the holy city and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple,
He said to him: "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'"
Jesus said to him, "It is also written: 'You shall not test the Lord your God.'"
Then the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor,
He said to him: "I will give you all of this if you prostrate yourself and bow down to me."
Then Jesus said to him, "Go away, Satan! For it is written: 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him alone you shall serve.'"
Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and began to minister to him. The beginning of his ministry in Galilee.
When Jesus heard that John had been delivered up, He withdrew into Galilee.
And he left Nazareth and came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim.
"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:"
Land of Zebulun, land of Naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.
The people sitting in darkness have seen a great light, and those who sat in the region of the shadow of death, light has dawned on them.
At that time, Jesus began to preach and say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." The call of the first disciples
And as Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers: Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
He said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
He always left the nets and followed him.
Then he passed from there and saw two other brothers: James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them.
Always leaving the ship and their father, they followed him. Jesus teaches and heals the sick.
And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.
And his fame spread throughout Syria. So they brought to him all the sick, those afflicted with various diseases and pains, the insane, the terrified, and the paralyzed, and he healed them.
And great multitudes followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond the Jordan.
The Sermon on the Mount - The Beatitudes
And when the multitude saw it, they marveled. But his disciples came to him privately, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field."
And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:
"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you. You are the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
"Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men."
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
And they do not light a lamp and put it under a bushel, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.
Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. Thus have ye fulfilled the law.
"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil."
Verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
Behold, I say to you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
"You have heard that it was said to the people of old, 'You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.'"
But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother without cause shall be guilty before the court; and whoever says to his brother, 'Raca,' shall be guilty before the supreme court; and whoever says, 'You fool,' shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell.
If you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,
Leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.
Be agreeable to your opponent quickly while you are with him on the way, lest your opponent deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.
I tell you the truth: Do not come out from there until you have paid the last penny! Adultery
You have heard that it was said to those of old, "You shall not murder."
And I say to you: Everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you, for it is better that one of your members should perish than that your whole body should go into hell. Divorce
It is said: "Whoever divorces his wife should give her a divorce document."
And I say to you: Whoever divorces his wife, except for the cause of adultery, makes her commit adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
You have also heard that it was said to the ancients: 'Do not break your word, but fulfill your vows to the Lord.'
But I tell you, do not swear at all: not by heaven, for it is God's throne,
Neither on earth, for it is the place of his footstool, nor in Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
Do not swear by your head, for you are not able to make a single hair white or black.
Let your speech be: Yes yes, no no. And what is more than that is from the evil one. Revenge
"Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth."
But I tell you: Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other cheek as well.
And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.
And whoever shows you a mile, go with him two.
Love your enemies.
"Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy."
But I tell you, love your enemies. Bless those who curse you. Do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,
To be children of your Father in heaven, for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?
"Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
Charity
"Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven."
When you give to someone in need, don't do as the hypocrites do, blowing trumpets in the synagogues and streets to call attention to their acts of charity! I tell you the truth, they have received all the reward they will ever get.
And as for you, when you give charity, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
To be truthful in secret. For your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. Prayer
"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full!"
But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
When you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.
Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Our bread for today give us.
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.
For if you forgive other people their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
And if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Fasting
"When you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward."
And as for you, when you keep silent, anoint your head and wash your face.
That you may not appear to be fasting to people, but to your Father who is hidden. For your Father who sees what is hidden will reward you openly. Store up treasures in heaven
"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal."
Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal,
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
The light of the body is the eye. If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
If your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. God cares for us.
"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?"
Behold the birds of the sky: they do not sow, nor do they reap, nor gather into barns, and your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they?
And who among you is concerned can increase his height by a single cubit?
Why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow! They toil not, neither do they spin.
But I tell you that even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.
If the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, is clothed like this by God, will He not much more clothe you, you of little faith?
Do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Condemnation of others
"Judge not, that you be not judged,"
For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you.
And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye?
How then can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' while there is a log in your own eye?
Before you take the speck out of your brother's eye, take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye!
Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you. Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened for you.
For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.
If any of you had a son and he asked for bread, would you give him a stone?
And if a fish asks him, will he give it a live one?
For if you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!
"Whatever you want people to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. The narrow gate"
"Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it!"
The narrowest gate and the hardest road that leads to life, and few are those who find it! The tree and its fruit
"Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves!"
You will know them by their fruits. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?
Thus every good tree produces good fruit, but the rotten tree produces rotten fruit.
You cannot expect a good tree to produce bad fruit, nor a bad tree to produce good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You shall know them by their fruits.
"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven."
Many will say to me on that day: "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?"
Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!' The wise builder and the foolish builder
"Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.
All those who hear these words of mine and do not put them into practice are like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
And the rain came down, and the rivers rose, and the winds blew, and they beat against that house, and it fell—and great was its fall!
When Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching,
For he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.
Healing of the Leper
And when He descended from the mountain, large crowds followed Him.
And when He saw Jesus, he fell on his face and said to Him, "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean."
And Jesus put out his hand and touched him, saying, "I will; be clean!" And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
And Jesus said to him, “See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof to them.” The faith of the centurion
And when Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, imploring Him
He says: "Master, my servant is lying in the house paralyzed, suffering greatly."
And Jesus said to him, "I am willing, be cleansed."
And the centurion answered and said, “Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed.”
For I too am a human under authority. I have soldiers under me. I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my slave, 'Do this,' and he does it."
When Jesus heard this, He marveled, and said to those who were following, "Truly I say to you, I have not found such great faith, even in Israel!"
And I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,
"And the children of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go, and as you have believed, let it be done for you." And his servant was healed in that hour. He also healed Peter's mother-in-law and others.
When Jesus came to Peter's house, He saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
He touched her hand and the fever left her, so she got up and served them.
And when it was evening, they brought to him many who were oppressed with demons. And he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.
The suffering described by the prophet Isaiah: "He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases." The price of submission
When Jesus saw a large crowd around Him, He gave orders to go to the other side.
A scribe then came forward and said to him, "O teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
And another of his disciples said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead." Calming the storm
And when He entered the boat, His disciples followed Him.
A great disturbance had occurred in the sea, so that the waves covered the ship, and he was asleep.
And His disciples came and woke Him, saying, "Lord, save us! We are perishing!"
He said to them, "Why are you so afraid, you of little faith?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
And the people were amazed, saying, "Who is this man? Even the winds and the sea obey him!" He drove out the demons.
And when He came to the other side to the region of the Gergesenes, two demon-possessed men met Him, coming out of the tombs, so extremely violent that no one could pass by that way.
And when they had cried out, saying, “What have you to do with us, Jesus, you Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?”
And there was a large herd of pigs feeding at some distance from them.
The demons begged him, saying, "If you drive us out, permit us to go into the herd of pigs."
He said to them, "Go." So they went and ran to the herd of pigs. And behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the steep bank into the sea and died in the water.
But the shepherds fled and went into the city, and told everything that had happened, and about the madmen.
When the whole town came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
Recovery of a paralyzed person
He entered the ship, crossed over, and came to his city.
Then a paralytic was brought to Him on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven."
Some of the scribes said to themselves, "He is blaspheming!"
"Jesus knew their thoughts and said, 'Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?'"
Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
"But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"—then He said to the paralytic, "Arise, take up your bed and go to your house."
He got up and went home.
When they saw this, they were amazed and praised God, who had given such authority to man. Matthew's call
And as Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, "Follow Me." So he arose and followed Him.
While he was reclining at home, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and His disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
"Go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have come to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance." The question about fasting
Then John's disciples came to him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them, "Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast."
No one sews a patch from a new piece of cloth on an old garment, because the patch takes from the garment, and so the tear becomes worse.
They do not put new wine into old wineskins, lest the wineskins burst, and the wine be spilled and the wineskins ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved. The healing of Yair's daughter and the bleeding woman.
While he was still speaking, a ruler came and knelt before him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”
Jesus set out and his disciples followed him.
A woman who had been bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.
For she said to herself, "If I just touch his garment, I will be healed."
Jesus looked at her and said, "Take heart, daughter; your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that moment.
And when Jesus came to the house of the ruler, and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,
He said to them, "Move aside, for the girl is not dead but sleeping." And they laughed at Him.
When the crowd went out, he entered and took her hand, and the girl stood up.
And this news went out into all that land. Healing of two blind men.
As Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”
And when He came to the house, the blind men came to Him, and Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to Him, "Yes, Lord!"
Then He touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith let it be to you."
And their eyes were opened. Jesus sternly warned them, "See that no one knows!"
But they went out and spread the news through that whole region. Healing a mute
And as they were going out, behold, they brought to him a man dumb (mute) and demon-possessed.
When the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, "Never has anything like this been seen in Israel!"
But the Pharisees said, "It is by the prince of demons that he casts out demons." His works were few.
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.
When He saw the crowds, He had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
"Ask of the Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers into His harvest."
The Twelve Dispatches
Then he called his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every weakness.
The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother.
Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
"These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, 'Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not.'"
Go and freely bring back the strayed sheep of the house of Israel.
"As you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.'"
Heal the sick. Cleanse the lepers. Raise the dead. Cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.
Do not buy gold, silver, or copper in your areas.
And he took neither staff nor bag, nor bread nor money; neither had he two coats. For the laborer is worthy of his food.
«And whatever town or village you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there until you depart.»
When you enter the house, greet it.
May peace be upon your house if it is worthy, but if it is not worthy, may your peace return to you.
And if anyone will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town.
Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.
"Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves."
But beware of people, for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.
And you shall bear witness before governors and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them and to the nations.
For when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.
For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks through you.
And a man's relatives will deliver up his brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death,
You will be hated by everyone because of my name. But he who endures to the end, he will be saved.
And when they shall persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.
The student is not better than the teacher, nor is the servant better than his master.
The disciple is enough like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more the members of his household!
Fear them not. For nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest, nor anything hid that shall not be known.
What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear in your ear, proclaim on the housetops.
Fear not those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Two sparrows are sold for a farthing. And not one of them falls to the ground without your Father.
But as for you, even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
Fear not! You are of more value than many sparrows!
For everyone who acknowledges me before others, I will acknowledge him also before my Father who is in heaven.
But whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.
Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.
For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
And the enemies of man are the people of his house.
No one who loves their father or mother more than they love me is worthy of me, and no one who loves their son or daughter more than they love me is worthy of me.
And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
Whoever loses his life will preserve it, and whoever preserves his life will lose it.
Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.
Whoever accepts a prophet by the name of a prophet, he will receive the reward of a prophet. And whoever accepts a righteous person by the name of a righteous person, he will receive the reward of a righteous person.
"Whoever gives one of these little ones a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, his reward will not be lost."
John the Baptist and Jesus
When Jesus had finished giving his twelve disciples their orders, he left that place to teach and preach in their towns. Jesus and John the Baptist
But when John heard in prison about the deeds of Christ, he sent two of his disciples
He said to him: "Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?"
And Jesus answered and said to them, "Go and tell John what you hear and see:
The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor receive good news.
"Blessed is he who does not stumble."
While these went away, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
But why have you come out? To see a man dressed in soft clothing? Look, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.
But why have you come out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.
Verily I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and the forceful have been seizing it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
And if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come.
Whoever has two ears to hear, let him hear.
To whom can this generation be compared? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to one another.
They say: We played for you, but you didn't dance! We sang for you, but you didn't clap!
For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.'
Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds. Woe to the cities that did not repent.
Then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his forces were stationed because they did not repent.
"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
But I tell you that it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? You will go down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
But I tell you: The land of Sodom will have a more likely state on the Day of Judgment than yours. Rest for the weary.
At that time Jesus answered and said, "I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and have revealed them to babes.
Yes, Father, for so it has become the joy before you.
All that I have received from the Father is Mine. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Bear my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble of heart; and you will find rest for your souls.
"Because Neri is gentle and my pregnancy is light."
Lord of the Sabbath
At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath through the grainfields; and His disciples became hungry and began to pick the heads of grain and eat.
The Pharisees said to Him, "Look, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!"
He said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he was in need and he and those with him were hungry?"
How did he enter the house of God and eat the bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for him to eat nor for any of those with him, but only for the priests?
Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are blameless?
But I tell you: Here is something greater than the temple!
If you only knew what I want: I desire mercy, not sacrifice. You would not have condemned the innocent!
"For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath also."
Then he departed from there and came to their synagogue,
If a person's hand is withered, they are asked, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" so that they may accuse Him.
He said to them: "If one of you has only one sheep, and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not take hold of it and lift it out?"
Man is so much nobler than sheep! If only he would do good on the Sabbath!
Then He said to the human, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and it returned sound, like the other. The chosen one of Allah.
When the Pharisees went out, they conspired against him, how they might destroy him.
And Jesus went about and wandered from there. And great crowds followed him, and he healed them all.
And he advised them not to show it.
As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: "Saying of Isaiah the prophet:"
Behold, my chosen one, my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased. I have put my spirit upon him; he will declare justice to the nations.
He does not argue or shout, and no one hears his voice in the streets.
A fortress that cannot be besieged, and a fuse that cannot be extinguished, until the truth emerges victorious.
"In his name, the hope of the nations." Jesus and Beelzebul
Then he brought to him a madman who was blind and mute, and he healed him, so the blind mute spoke and saw.
And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, "Is this not the son of David?"
But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons."
Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand."
If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges!
But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you!
How can someone enter the strong man's house and plunder his possessions, if he does not first tie up the strong man? Then indeed, he may plunder his house.
He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.
Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.
Make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad; for by the fruit you know the tree.
You brood of vipers! How can you speak good things, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
The good person brings forth good things from the good stored up in him, and the evil person brings forth evil things from the evil stored up in him.
But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken.
"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned." Matthew 12:37
At that time, some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying: "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
And he answered and said to them: "A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign shall be given to it but the sign of the prophet Jonah."
For just as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and indeed a greater than Jonah is here!
The Queen of Sheba will rise in judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here!
When the unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.
Then he says: "Return to my house from which I departed." He comes back and finds it empty, swept, and adorned.
Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there, and the latter end of that man is worse than the beginning. So shall it be also unto this wicked generation.
While he was speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside asking to speak with him.
And someone said to him, "Behold, your mother and your brothers are standing outside asking to speak with you."
And he answered and said to him who told him, "Who is my mother and who are my brothers?"
Then he stretched out his hand toward his disciples and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers."
"For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother.”
Like the farmer and his interpretation
On that day, Jesus went out from the house and sat by the sea,
A large crowd gathered around him, so he got into a boat and sat down. The whole crowd stood on the shore.
Behold, a sower went out to sow
And as he sowed, some seed fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up.
And the last fell into the stony places, where it had not much earth: and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth.
But when the sun rose, it burned, and since it had no root, it withered.
And the last one fell on the thorns, so the thorns sprouted and choked it.
And some seed fell on good soil and produced a crop, some a hundred, some sixty, some thirty times what was sown.
"Let him who has ears to hear, listen."
And the disciples came and said to him, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
And he answered and said to them, “Because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
To whom much is given, from him shall be much required.
For this reason I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.
In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says: "You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive."
For this people's heart has grown dull, and their ears are hard of hearing, and they have closed their eyes, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn for me to heal them.
Blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.
Verily I say unto you, Many prophets and righteous men have desired to see what ye see, and have not seen it; and to hear what ye hear, and have not heard it.
"Hearken ye as the sower:"
All who hear the word of the kingdom and do not understand, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown on the path.
The one who is sown in good soil is the one who hears the word and immediately accepts it with joy.
But it has no root in itself, but only for a time. And when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles.
The seed that fell among the thorns is the one who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful.
But the seed sown on good soil is the one who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.
He presented another parable to them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
When people were asleep, their enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and left.
When the plant came up and produced fruit, then the weeds also appeared.
And the servants of the house came to him and said: "O master, is it not good seed that was sown in your field? So where does it come from?"
He said to them: "An enemy has done this." So the servants said to him, "Do you want us to go and gather them?"
He said: "No! Lest you uproot the wheat along with the weeds while gathering it.
"Let both grow together until the harvest. At harvest time I will tell the harvesters: First gather together the weeds and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.'" The parable of the mustard seed and the parable of the yeast
He presented another parable to them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in his field,"
And it is smaller than all the seeds. But when it grows, it is larger than all the herbs, and becomes a tree, even so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches.
He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until all of it was leavened."
All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and without a parable He was not speaking to them,
To fulfill what was spoken by the prophet who said: "I will open my mouth in parables, and utter hidden things since the foundation of the world." Interpretation of the parable of the wheat and the tares.
At that time Jesus dismissed the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
And he answered and said to them, "The sower of the good seed is the Son of Man.
The field is the world, and the good seed are the children of the kingdom. The tares are the children of the wicked one.
The enemy who sowed is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world. The reapers are the angels.
As the tinder is gathered and burned by fire, so shall it be at the end of this world:
And He will send out His angels with a mighty blast of the trumpet, and they will gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
And they will be cast into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear. Examples of the treasure, the pearl, and the net.
Also, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and from his joy he went and sold all that he had and bought that field.
Also, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls,
When he found a single pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.
Also, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, gathering of every kind.
When it was full, they drew it up onto the shore, and sat down and gathered the good fish into containers, but the worthless ones they threw away.
Thus it will be at the end of the world: the angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous.
And they will be thrown into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Jesus said to them, "Do you understand all these things?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord."
He told them: "Because of this, every scribe who is a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old."
And when Jesus had finished these parables, He departed from there. Nazareth rejects Jesus.
And when he came to his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?"
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary, and his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
"Are all his sisters with us? So where did all these come from?"
They found fault with Him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house."
They did not create many forces due to their lack of belief.
The Beheading of John the Baptist
At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus.
And he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him."
For Herod had seized John, bound him, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
For John had been saying to him: "It is not lawful for you to have her."
When he wanted to kill him, he feared the people, for he was like a prophet to them.
Then when Herod's birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced in the middle and pleased Herod,
He then promised by oath that whatever I asked for, he would give it to me.
She said, having received it from her mother: "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist."
The king is dead. But for the sake of the departments and those who recline with him, he must be given.
And he sent and had John beheaded in prison.
So she brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, who then took it to her mother.
And his disciples came and took away the body and buried it. Then they came and told Jesus. Feeding the five thousand men
When Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place by himself. The crowds heard of this and followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus went out, He saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them, and He healed their sick.
And when it was evening, His disciples came to Him, saying, "The place is deserted, and the time is already past. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food."
And Jesus said to them, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
They said to him, "We have here only five loaves and two fish."
He said: "Bring it to me here."
He ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass. Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he said the blessing, broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
And they all ate and were satisfied. Then they gathered up the fragments that remained, twelve baskets full.
And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children. The miracle of walking on water
And at that time Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, till he had sent the multitudes away.
After the crowd had been dismissed, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
The ship was in the midst of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.
And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.
When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, "It is a ghost!" And they cried out for fear.
"Always keep saying to them Jesus, 'Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.'"
And Peter answered Him and said, "Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water."
He said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water to go to Jesus.
But when he saw the strong wind, he was afraid. And as he began to sink, he cried out, "Lord, save me!"
And when Jesus had stretched forth his hand, and touched him, he said, "O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?"
When they boarded the ship, the wind calmed.
And those in the boat came and worshipped Him, saying: "Truly You are the Son of God!"
When they crossed, they came to the land of Gennesaret,
And the men of that place knew him. So they sent to all the surrounding region and brought to him all the sick,
And they asked him to touch only the fringe of his garment. So all who touched it were healed.
The pure and the impure
At that time, some scribes and Pharisees came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked him:
"Why do your students go beyond imitating the elders, for they do not wash their hands when eating bread?"
And He answered and said to them, “Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?”
God commanded, saying: "Honor your father and your mother, and whoever reviles his father or mother shall surely die."
But you say: 'Whoever says to his father or mother, whatever you would have gained from me is a gift (to God), shall not honor his father or mother.'
You have made void the commandment of God because of your tradition!
O hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied about you, saying:
He draweth nigh unto me with his mouth, and honoureth me with his lips; but his heart is far from me.
"And in vain do they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men."
Then he called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand."
"Not what goes into the mouth defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth this defiles a person."
Then His disciples came and said to Him, "Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this statement?"
And he answered and said, "Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be uprooted.
Leave them. They are blind leaders of the blind. And if a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.
And Peter answered him, saying, "Explain this parable to us."
Jesus said, "Are you still so dull?"
Do you not understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then is expelled?
For what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person.
For out of the heart come evil thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.
"These are what defile a person. But eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person." The Canaanite woman's faith
Then Jesus went out from there and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
And a Canaanite woman from those borders cried out to him, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is very demon-possessed."
He never spoke a word to her. Then His disciples came and urged Him, saying, "Send her away, for she keeps crying out at us!"
And he answered and said, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
And she came and fell down at his feet, saying: "My lord, have mercy on me!"
And he answered and said, "It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
She said, "Yes, Lord! Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table!"
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "Woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was made well from that hour. Feeding of the four thousand men
Then Jesus departed from there, came to the Sea of Galilee, and went up on the mountain and sat down.
And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them.
That the crowds may marvel when they see the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.
And Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have already been with Me three days and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."
And his disciples said to him, "Where can we get enough bread in the wilderness to feed so great a crowd?"
Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."
He commanded the crowds to recline on the ground.
took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to his disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowd.
And they all ate and were satisfied. Then they gathered up the leftover pieces, seven baskets full.
And the men who ate were four thousand, not counting women and children.
Then the crowd was dismissed, and he went up into the boat and came to the region of Magdala.
Request a verse
And the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Him, and testing Him they asked that He would show them a sign from heaven.
And he answered and said to them: "When it is evening, you say: 'Fair weather, for the sky is red.'
In the morning: today is winter, for the sky is red with gloom. O hypocrites! You know how to discern the face of the sky, but the signs of the times you cannot!
An evil and wicked generation seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. Then He left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
And when His disciples came to the other side, they had forgotten to bring bread.
Jesus said to them: "Be on your guard and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
They said to themselves, "We have not taken bread."
Jesus knew their thoughts and said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts? Which of you, if he has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, will not take hold of it and lift it out? Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."
Until now, you do not understand? And do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you took?
And how many salads did you take from the four thousand?
"Don't you understand that this is not about bread? I told you to beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!"
Then they understood that he had not said to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter's confession of Christ
And when Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying: "Who do people say that I, the Son of Man, am?"
They said, "Some say you are John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
He said to them: "But who do you say that I am?"
And Simon Peter answered and said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!”
Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven."
I tell you also: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
"And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus predicts his death and resurrection
From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.
"Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, 'Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you.'"
"Then he turned and said to Peter, 'Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.'"
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wishes to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me,"
He who would save his life shall lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake shall find it.
For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses himself? Or what can a man give in exchange for himself?
The Son of Man will come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.
"Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
Manifestation
And after six days, Jesus took with him Peter and James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
And his appearance changed before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him.
And Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If You wish, I will make here three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And as he was speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.”
And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces and were greatly afraid.
And Jesus came and touched them, and said, "Arise, and be not afraid."
And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.
"And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, 'Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.'"
And his disciples asked him, saying, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
And Jesus answered and said to them, “Indeed, Elijah is coming first and will restore all things.
"But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man will suffer at their hands."
Then the disciples understood that He had spoken to them about John the Baptist. Healing of a Boy with a Demon
And when they came to the assembly, a man came to him kneeling.
And saying: "O my lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and he suffers greatly, and often falls into the fire and often into the water."
"and I brought him to your disciples, and they were not able to heal him."
And Jesus answered and said, “O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you? And how long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to me!”
