The Genealogy of Jesus Christ
Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,
Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers.
Judah begot Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez begot Hezron, and Hezron begot Aram,
Aram the father of Aminadab, Aminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon,
Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth, Obed the father of Jesse,
He is the son of King David. And David is the father of Solomon by the woman who was married to Uriah,
Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asaph,
And Asaph the son of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat the son of Joram, and Joram the son of Uzziah,
And Uzziah became the father of Jotham, and Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,
Hezekiah the son of Manasseh, Manasseh the son of Amoz, Amoz the son of Josiah,
Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, and his brothers in the time when the Jews were exiles in the land of Babylon.
And after they returned to the Jews from Babylon, Kenia was born to Shealtiel, and Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel,
Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the son of Zerubbabel, Zerubbabel the son of Abiud,

And Eliud was the son of Eliezer, and Eliezer the son of Matan, and Matan the son of Jacob,

The generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David until the captivity in Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the captivity in Babylon until the birth of Christ are fourteen generations. The birth of Jesus Christ
And this is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: Mary his mother had been given in marriage to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found with child through the Holy Spirit. Luke
He was her fiancé, a God-fearing man who didn't want to disgrace her, and he decided to secretly break up with her.
And this is how it happened: Mary became pregnant by the Holy Spirit. God's angel came to Joseph in a dream and told him, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for she is with child by the Holy Spirit."
"She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins." Luke
And all this is happening so that the word of the Lord may be fulfilled through the prophet who said:
"Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel," which means, "God is with us."
And being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, Joseph decided to divorce her quietly. But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins." When Joseph woke, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took Mary as his wife.
But he had no part with her until she gave birth to a son, and he named him Jesus. Luke 2:21
The second chapter, the scientists see Jesus among the stars
And in those days, Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod. Behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,
"Kisolo: 'Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.'"
And when Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, he and all Jerusalem.
And he gathered together all the chief priests and teachers of the law and asked them, "Where is the Christ to be born?"
And they answered: "Now Bethlehem of Judea is a small city, where it is written by the prophet as follows:"
And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means the least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people Israel.
And after that, Herod asked the wise men about the star, and he learned from them about the time when the star appeared.
And after they had come to Bethlehem, they said to them, "Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the East, and have come to worship him."
And when they heard the words of the king, they set out; and behold, the star which they had seen in the east went before them, till it came and stood over where the child was.
The star was not enough, they were very happy.
And when they had come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshipped him. And they opened their treasures, and presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
And having been warned by God in a dream not to return to Herod, they took another route and returned to their country. The family of Jesus fled to Egypt.
And after the scholars had conferred, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to destroy him."
Wanad Youssef and Khoda the boy, and Meh by night, and they went to Egypt.
And it was so until Herod died so that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled which He spoke by the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called My son." Then Herod killed the male children.
And when Herod saw that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.
Thus the word of the Lord came to the prophet Jeremiah, saying:
From Ramah, you hear the sound of weeping, much weeping and mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, for they are no more. The family of Jesus returned from Egypt.
And when Herod had killed the infants at Bethlehem in the region of Judea, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt."
And why: "Noah took the boy and did not return to the land of Israel, where those who wanted to kill the boy died."
Wanad Yousef and her son God returned to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Then divinely instructed in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee.
And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, "He shall be called a Nazarene." Matthew 2:23; Luke 2:39; John 1:45
The third chapter John the Baptist to make the way for Jesus
Here is the translation: And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
And he said to them, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Matthew
And here is the man the prophet Isaiah spoke of when he said: "A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight His paths.'"
John's clothing was made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist. He lived on locusts and wild honey.
The people came to him from Jerusalem and all of Judea, and the whole region around the Jordan.
They deliberately put Jordan's heart in his hand, and they admit their mistakes.
And John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? When
Repentance of yours with your honorable deeds,
And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?" He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ." And they asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" And he answered, "No." So they said to him, "Who are you, that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?" He said, "I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the Lord,' as the prophet Isaiah said."
When the locusts are on the trees, every tree that bears fruit is cut down and thrown away. When
I will baptize you with water, but the one who comes after me is more powerful than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
And he will profitably guide her in her studies and gather the grain into his barns, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that will never be quenched. John will baptize Jesus
And then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
But John prevented him, saying to him, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"
Jesus replied, "It is not right for us to do this and violate God's command." And he allowed John to baptize.
And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him.
And a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased." Matthew 12:18; 17:5; Mark 1:11; Luke 9:35
Chapter Four: Satan Tempts Jesus
And after this, Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, being tempted by the devil. Luke
Fast for forty days and forty nights, and after that, the hunger will come.
And there, the devil who tempts him said to him: "If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."
And Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"
And then the devil took Him to the holy city and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple
"Then he said to him: 'If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written: "He will command his angels concerning you," and "they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone."'"
And Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.'"
And after that, Iblis ascended to a high mountain, and behind him were the armies of the world and their glory.
"Wa-llayhi: 'La adAAu hadha lika illa sajdatayni wa AAibadatayni.'"
Jesus answered, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'"
And after this, the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him. Jesus began to preach in Galilee.
And when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee. Matthew
And leaving Nazareth, He came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim.
"Thus he fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:"
The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, along the road by the sea, across the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—
The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light, and those who lived in the land of the shadow of death, upon them has the light shined.
And from that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Matthew 3:2 Jesus began to choose his first disciples.
And it came to pass, that, as Jesus walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
And Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
The rooster left their window open and followed him.
And after that, he walked on and saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, with Zebedee their father, in the ship mending their nets. And he called to them.
They left their nets and followed Jesus. Jesus taught and revealed.
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. Matthew
And the news about Him spread throughout Syria, and they brought to Him all the sick who were afflicted with various diseases: those possessed by demons, those with epilepsy, and the paralyzed, and He healed them.
And a great multitude followed him from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and from beyond Jordan.
The Fifth Chapter: The Sermon on the Mount
And he saw the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:
It seemed as if he was teaching them:
"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
Blessed are those who help people live in peace, for they shall be called the children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Matthew 5:10
If, however, you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. 1 Peter 4:14
"Be glad and rejoice in your hearts, for your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you." Acts 7:52 The salt of the earth and the light of the world
The salt of the earth, otherwise what will restore its saltiness? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by people. Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34,35
We are the light of the world, a city on a hill cannot be hidden. John
But there is not a single person who lights the candle and puts it under the basket, but he puts it on a stand so that it may shine on all who are in the house. Mark
"Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven." 1 Peter 2:12
"Think not that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them."
And we tell you the truth: The heavens and the earth will not deviate, nor will a single letter or a dot of the law deviate, until everything within it is fulfilled. Luke
Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
"Woe to you: unless your obedience is greater than that of the scholars of the law and the Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven." The lamentation
"Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:" (Matthew 5:21, King James Version)
But I tell you: whoever is anxious about his brother, let him control him, and whoever says to his brother, 'You are useless,' let him be controlled in the great court. And whoever says to his brother, 'You fool,' shall be liable to the hell of fire.
Otherwise, I would have brought you an offering, placed it on the altar, and sacrificed you to the right of your brother.
Bring your gift in front of the altar and go until you reconcile with your brother. Then, I will give you your gift.
Make amends with whoever you have a dispute with, none of you will remain on the path to the court, before you reach the judge, and the judge puts you in the hands of the prison warden, and the warden puts you in jail.
You have the right to know: "You won't leave here until you finish the remaining work you have." Corruption.
"As you've heard it said: Do not corrupt it."
But I say to you: Whoever looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If not, your eye would have been plucked out and thrown at you, chasing you. May Allah not make you lose a part of you, nor throw all of you into Hell. When
"Otherwise, your hand could be cut off and thrown into the fire. I pray that you lose a part of your body and not your whole body into hell." Matthew 18:8; Mark 9:43 Divorce
When a man divorces his wife, he must give her her share. When
"But I tell you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery." Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11,12; Luke 16:18; 1 Corinthians 7:10,11
"And you have heard it said to your ancestors: 'Do not swear falsely, but fulfill your oaths to the Lord.'"
But I say to you: Do not swear at all, neither by heaven, for it is God's throne, nor by the earth.
Neither by the earth for it is the place of his feet, nor by Jerusalem for it is the city of the great King.
And you wouldn't dare raise a hand to him, even if you couldn't change a single hair of his, whether it's black or white.
But what is your speech? Say: "It is," or say: "No." And what is more than this is from Satan." Revenge
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
But I tell you: Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other cheek as well.
Leave him to his whistling.
Otherwise, one thing will buzz in your ear to walk with it a thousand steps, run with it two thousand.
Ask those who ask you for something, give it to them, and those who want to borrow from you, do not return it empty-handed. We want your help.
You've heard it said: Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
But I tell you: love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.
Blessed are you, children, for you are the light of the world. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
If you were not writing what you are writing, what reward would you have? And why do you not even pay taxes on what you earn?
But why would you greet others while sitting alone on your boats? How do you expect to be better than others? And what about those who worship idols, will they be left in such a state?
"Eva Kone Kamelin, as with you all in heaven complete."
Chapter Six: Charity
Do good not to be seen by others, but to have your reward from your Father in heaven.
Otherwise, I want you to give something in charity, you won't leave it until the trumpet is blown in front of people in the manner they do to the hypocrites in the prayer lines and the rows so that people thank them. I tell you the truth: these are the ones who have taken their reward from the people.
But you only give charity with your left hand, so that your right hand does not know what your left hand is doing.
"Let your charity remain a secret, and He who is in the heavens and conceals nothing will reward you." The prayer
"Woe to you, hypocrites, who do not pray as the hypocrites do, who stand in the prayer places and in the markets to be seen by people. I will tell you the truth: these are the ones who have taken their reward from the people. Luke"
But if you pray sincerely, He will enter your home, close the door for you, and pray for you what is in secret. He who knows what you conceal is the one who will help you.
And some of them are deaf, dumb, and blind to the guidance, and they do not return. They are like statues that hear no speech and see no sight. They will be answered by Allah on the Day of Resurrection.
"Eva wouldn't be in their state, she wouldn't chase after you what's in the sky, you know what you need before you ask for it."
"Thus shall we pray this prayer: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name,"
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Bread for our daily sustenance,
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
We kept ourselves from being thrown into the test, and we were saved from the devil.
"For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you."
"But He pardoned the people their faults, so that you might pardon those who have wronged you. Fasting"
But beware, do not be like the hypocrites who put on a show with their faces to appear to people as if they are fasting. We tell you the truth: those are the ones who receive their reward from people.
But don't fast too much, oil your hair and wash your face.
"For people, you may seem like a saint, but for those in your secret, for those you hide nothing from, he will reward you." Treasures in the heavens.
"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal. Jacob"
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
"Wherever your treasure is, there will your heart be also."
The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye were ugly, all your light would be darkness. If the light within you were darkness, how great would that darkness be!" God and money
No one can be a slave to two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth. Do not worry
And I say to you: Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will wear. For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Behold the birds of the sky, see how they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Who among you, except for Rafed Al-Hum, can increase and add another hour to his life?
Why should we worry about the future? Look at the rose in the field, how it grows. It doesn't change, it doesn't turn yellow.
But let me tell you the truth: Even Solomon, with all his glory, never wore anything like these roses.
Eva, you have so much faith! If only it were spring in the fields, the one we see today and tomorrow it will be sown in France, may God dress it like this, why don't you dress us nicely?
What are we going to eat? Or what are we going to drink? Or what are we going to wear?
The way those who do not know God ask for things, and you in heaven know that we do not need any of this.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
"And don't carry tomorrow's worries into today, leave tomorrow's worries for tomorrow. And every day is blessed, except for its worries."
Chapter Seven What Do You Rule On
"Rule over others, so they do not rule over you."
Rulers, as they rule, will be ruled over. Speakers, as they speak, will be spoken to. Mark 4:24
Why do you notice the straw in your brother's eye, and not pay attention to the beam in your own?
ولا كيفاش غادي تݣول لخوك خليني نحيد الخشة ديال التبن من عينك، وعينك نت فيها عود؟
You hypocrite, go away! I hope you never return to my sight. At this moment, I see that it would be better for you to remove the straw from your brother's eye.
"Your sacred need for dogs does not harm you, nor do they cut you, and do not throw your essence to the allies, they will not trample it with their feet." Ask, turn, and knock.
Knock and they will open for you. Ask and it will be given to you. Seek and you will find.
The way of those who ask is given to them, those who turn away are turned away from, and those who knock are opened to.
Who among you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
Why would he ask for a whale if he's going to give it to a snake?
Eva, if you can't even provide your children with the basic necessities, how can you expect those in heaven to provide you with what you ask for?
"As you wish people to do to you, do so to them. For this is the law and the prophets." Luke 6:31 The Narrow Gate
Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate that leads to destruction is wide and the way is easy, and there are many who enter through it.
The tree is known by its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.
The way to them is known. Can you gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
And every good tree bears good fruit, and every bad tree bears bad fruit.
The adorned tree cannot yield barren fruit, and the barren tree cannot yield adorned fruit.
Every tree that bears fruit is adorned with leaves and scattered for well-being. When
"By their fruits you will know them». Matthew 12:33 Our concern is to do the will of God"
"Listen to what he says to me: 'My lord, my lord! I am about to enter the kingdom of heaven, but those who enter it are those who do the will of my Father in heaven.'"
For your sake, O day, many will say to me: O my lord, O my lord! And did you not foretell us by your name? And by your name did we not cast out madness? And by your name did we not perform many miracles?
I'll tell them the time: I've never known you! Get out of my way, Google Dior!
The way of those who listen to my words and act upon them is like a man who builds his house upon a rock.
And winter passed and the valleys overflowed, and a strong wind came and the house's door was struck, but it did not collapse, for its people's house was built on rock.
A man who doesn't listen to this advice of mine and can't do anything about it is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
"Winter has passed and the valleys have overflowed, a strong wind has come and the rooster of the house has crowed, it has rained and her clouds were strong."
And when Jesus had finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching,
But he would teach them as if he had the power, walking as if he were the scholars of their religion.
Chapter Eight: Jesus Christ, a Hardworking Man
And when Jesus had come down from the mountain, large crowds followed Him.
And near the diligent worker, he prostrated to him and said: "O my lord, I only want you to be able to return me pure."
He reached out his hand and touched Jesus, saying, "I want to be clean!" At that moment, Jesus healed his leprosy, and he was clean.
And Jesus said to him, "See that you don't tell anyone, but go show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." The servants of the chief of the synagogue recognized him
And when Jesus came to Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, imploring Him.
The servant said: "My master, the servants in your house are lying on the bed paralyzed and are being tortured a lot."
He said to Him, "Lord, I will go that I may see."
The Caid of the Army replied: "I do not deserve, my lord, that you enter under my roof, but say one word and my servants will obey you."
"For even I have authority to sit on the throne and have an army to command it, I would say to this one: 'Go!' and he would go, and say to another: 'Come!' and he would come, and say to my servant: 'Do this!' and he would do it."
And when Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to those who followed Him, "Assuredly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!"
Behold, I tell you, many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. Luke
"As for the Hadoq who were theirs, they were in the kingdom, but they went out into the darkness. Then, where will the weeping and gnashing of teeth be?" When?
And after that, Jesus said to the captain of the soldiers: "Sir! According to the faith you have, it will be done for you as you wish." And at that very moment, his servants were healed. Jesus healed the relative of Peter and many others.
And when Jesus entered Peter's house, He saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
And Jesus took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
And in the evening connections, they brought him a lot of people possessed by madness, and the madness came out at his word, and he healed the sick.
And thus was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: "He himself took our infirmities and bore our diseases." This is how it happened to those who followed Jesus.
When Jesus saw that a large crowd was coming to him, he told his disciples to get into the boat and go to the other side of the lake.
He is close to you, one of the scholars of Islamic law, and he said to him: "My master, where will you lead us when you walk?"
And Jesus answered and said to them, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."
"Another one of his students asked him: 'Sir, let me go with you to bury him.'"
But Jesus answered, "Let the dead bury their own dead. But you go and proclaim the kingdom of God." And another said, "I will follow you, Lord, but first let me say farewell to those at my home."
And when Jesus had crossed over in the boat, His disciples followed Him.
When a great windstorm arose, the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was already filling. But Jesus was asleep.
They approached him and said, "We have freed you, O our master! Now we are equal!"
He said to them, "Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?" Then he got up and rebuked the wind and the waves, and it was completely calm.
And they marveled at the men and said, "Who is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?" Jesus went ashore and saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them.
When Jesus arrived at the other side of the sea, in the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men came to meet him, coming out of the tombs. They were so dangerous that no one could pass that way.
And they did not spare him, but asked Goto and Kigolo: "What is the relationship between you and him? And why have you come here to teach us before our time?"
It was one of the largest pieces of the solution, flying in one place near the dam.
The madness desired Jesus and said to him: "Unless you come out, we will enter this piece of the world."
He said to them, "Go away!" and they entered it, and the whole piece broke off and fell from the edge of the mountain into the sea and drowned in the water.
They fled, freed and hurried to the city, telling of what had happened, and of what had befallen the men possessed by madness.
And all the people of the city went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to depart out of their coasts.
Chapter Nine: Jesus Heals a Paralyzed Man
And Jesus entered into a boat, and crossed the sea, and came to his own city.
And behold, some people brought to Him a man who was paralyzed and lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven."
Two scholars of Islamic law expressed their concern: "This man is speaking blasphemous words!"
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Why are you thinking evil in your hearts?
Forgive me my sins, but do you not say: cleanliness is next to godliness?
"But I will show you that man has power on earth to forgive sins." And he said to the paralytic: "Pick up your bed and walk."
The man got up and walked home.
And you see groups of people doing this, they are afraid and give glory to God who gave people authority in this manner. Jesus chose when
And as Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth. And he said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and followed him.
And after Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples, "You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified." Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, and plotted together in order to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him. But they said, "Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people."
And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
And when Jesus heard this, he answered them, saying, "Those who are healthy do not need a physician, but those who are sick."
Ewa Sero learned the meaning of this statement: "I saw that I do not want mercy for the victim, when I do not come to cry for those who have wronged Allah, but for the wrongdoers." The question about fasting.
And after fasting, John's disciples and the Pharisees came to Jesus and asked Him, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?"
And Jesus answered and said to them, "Can the guests of the bridegroom mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast."
Even if you patch an old garment with a new piece of cloth, the patch will shrink and the tear will grow larger.
"Even one who can drink new wine in old wineskins, but if they are put in them, they will burst and the wine will be spilled and the wineskins will be ruined. But they can drink new wine in new wineskins, so that neither the wine nor the wineskins are wasted." The president's daughter and the women who have anointed Jesus with ointment
A man came to him with this problem: one of the leaders came to him and prostrated himself before him, saying, "My daughter, may God have mercy on her, has died. But come, place your hand on her and she will come back to life."
And a great multitude followed Him, and His disciples.
A certain woman was sick, she was twelve years old and suffering from blood, she came behind Jesus and touched his cloak.
"While it has its risks: 'Only what is not needed heals.'"
He looked up Jesus and healed her and said: "Take heart, daughter, your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed from that moment.
And when Jesus came to the chief priest's house, he saw the scribes and the crowd in an uproar.
He said to them: "Get out of here! The girl isn't dead, she's just not awake!" And they laughed at him.
And when Jesus had come out, he went in and took her by the hand, and the damsel arose.
Good news came to you, all the birds. Jesus healed both the blind.
And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”
And behold, there came to him a leper and worshipped him, saying, "Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean." And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, "I will; be thou clean."
And Jesus said to them, "According to your faith be it done to you."
They delight their eyes, and Jesus rebuked them, saying: "You have it for no one!"
They went out and started spreading the news all over the neighborhood. Zizoun started investigating.
What happened was, they brought out the blindfolds, and then they brought in a man named Zizun who was possessed by madness.
When Jesus had cast out the demons, the mute man spoke. The crowds were amazed and said, "Never has anything like this been seen in Israel!"
The Pharisees said, "He drives out demons by the prince of demons!" Matthew 10:25; 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15 Jesus' trial
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. Matthew
And when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd. Mark
He tells his disciples: "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Luke"
"Eva asked Mol Al-Hasad to harvest his harvest for this harvest."
Chapter Ten: Jesus Appoints His Disciples
And after that, Jesus wept over His disciples, the weak, and gave them the authority to cast out demons and heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.
The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus,
Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus.
وصل يسوع إلى المدن والقرى، فبدأ يعلّم في كنائسهم، مبشرًا بالإنجيل، شافٍ للمرضى، مصلًا للأمراض والأوبئة والأشقياء والأموات. ولما رأى الجموع، اشفق عليهم، لأنهم كانوا متعبين ومذلولين كخرفان لا راع لها. ثم قال لتلاميذه: «الحصاد كثير، ولكن العمال قليلون. فادعوا رب الحصاد أن يرسل عمالًا إلى حصاده».
But he went to the goats of the harmful ones who are of the people of Israel,
And as you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.'
Heal the sick, raise the dead, and make the lepers clean. Drive out demons. Give freely, receive freely.
Your pockets contain no gold, no silver, no copper.
No bag, no Google sheets, no notes, no stick. The servants will not deserve their food. 1 Corinthians 9:14; 1 Timothy 5:18
The city or the roundabouts you entered, just find someone worthy to host you, and stay with them until you leave as you came.
Otherwise, if you enter someone's house, greet its inhabitants.
otherwise they would be worthy of the house's wealth. May peace be upon you, may peace reach them. Otherwise, they would not deserve it. May peace return to you.
They wouldn't have accepted anything from you, neither a house nor a city, nor would they have listened to your words. They left and stirred up the dust beneath your feet. Actions.
"Behold, I tell you: On the day of judgment, the condition of Sodom and Gomorrah will be more bearable than that of this city." Luke 10:4-12 The coming punishment
"Hani, you are like sheep among wolves, be as wise as serpents, and as innocent as doves. Luke"
Many will come against you, when they will take you to court, and the prayers of their houses will strike you down, Mark
And I testify against you before the rulers and kings who come after me, so that you may have a defense before them and the peoples who are not Jews.
And here you have it, don't let the sadness take over, neither now nor later, when the time comes I will tell you what to say.
The words you will speak will not be your own, for it is the spirit of your Father that is in heaven that will give you the words to speak.
And the sons dishonor the father, and the sons dishonor the mother, and the children stand against their parents and kill them, Mark
The people have named me Wekerhokem. But even the devil himself regrets it. When?
But the wrath of God will come upon you, flee to another unit. I tell you the truth: you will not go anywhere until you devour all the inhabitants of Israel, until the Son of Man comes.
The way of the disciple is well-pleasing to the teacher, nor is the service of a servant well-pleasing to his master. Luke
The student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher. If the head of the house is Beelzebul, how much more the members of the household! Matthew 9:34; 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15
Fear them not, for what is concealed shall be revealed, and what is hidden shall be made known. Mark
And what I have spoken to you in the dark, speak in the light. And what you have heard in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.
Fear not those who can kill the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather fear those who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Look, Google, birds for sale at one dirham each! And not a single one of them hits the ground unless it's meant to be with you up in the sky.
But even the hair on your head is all numbered.
Eva, don't be afraid, you have a lot of good in you, but you have to find it.
But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven.
But those things that I am ashamed of before people, even I will be ashamed of them before Him who is in heaven.” 2 Timothy 2:12 Walk here but the sword
"Then I brought you the Bible to establish the kingdom of heaven on earth. I did not bring the kingdom of heaven, but the sword."
Get the difference between the boy and his father, between the girl and her mother, and between the bride and her bridesmaids.
I will spend July resting at home.
The one who values his wife more than me, doesn't deserve me. And the one who values his son or daughter more than me, doesn't deserve me.
And whoever does not bear his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. When
"For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will save it." Matthew 16:25; Mark 8:35; Luke 9:24; 17:33; John 12:25 The reward
He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives the one who sent me. Luke
And whoever receives a guest as a prophet, he will receive the reward of the prophet. And whoever receives a guest as a righteous person, he will receive the reward of the righteous person.
"Whoever gives one of these little ones a cup of cold water to drink because he is a disciple of mine, I tell you the truth, he will certainly not lose his reward."
The chapter about John the Baptist and how he prepared his disciples for Jesus
And after Jesus had given his disciples the instructions, he left to teach and preach in the towns of the Jews.
And when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent word by his disciples
What's up with that: "Is it Wash Net that's coming, or another one of the Nets?"
And Jesus answered and said to them, "Go and tell John again all that you hear and see:
The blind see again, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the good news preached to them.
"Wes3adat hadak lili ma gishkesh fi."
And when he had heard of John, he went out into the wilderness to see for himself what manner of man this was of whom they spake. And he came to John, and saw men come to be baptized of him: and he said unto them, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?
Where have you been? Haven't you seen anyone? And a man wearing fine clothes? Those who wear fine clothes are the ones living in the kings' palaces!
What do you want to eat today? And what do you feel like? I'll tell you what, let's go for something better than just okay.
And this is the path that God has prescribed for him, as He has written: "I have sent my messenger before you, who will guide you to the path."
Behold, I say to you: Among those born of women, there has not risen a greater one than John the Baptist. But the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
For from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and the forceful seize it. Luke
The preaching of the prophets and the law of Moses lasted until the time when John the Baptist came.
But if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come. Matthew
Eva, who has something to say, listen up!
لكن بآش غنشبه هاد الجيل؟ راه بحال شي ولاد ݣالسين فالسواق كيعيطو لبعضياتهم وكيݣولو: But what is wrong with this generation? Look at these boys in the market, they cry for their toys and say:
We inflated the lira for you and you didn't burst, We mourned for you and you didn't cry!
The way of John, and he did not eat nor drink, and they said: This is a way of dwelling in paradise.
Woe to the one who does not repent
The rooster crowed, and Jesus began to teach the crowd that had gathered to see the miracles, more than others, where people were not satisfied.
"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. # 11:21 In sackcloth and ashes: to show their repentance."
But I tell you: The fate of the blogger of Sur and Saida on the Day of Judgment will be lighter than your fate.
Woe to you, Capernaum! Will you be exalted to the sky? You will be brought down to Hades. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
"On this account I say to you: The fate of Sodom on the day of judgment will be lighter than yours." Matthew 10:15; Luke 10:12 Come to me and rest.
"Father, Lord of heaven and earth, I thank you that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children."
Our Father, may it be your will.
The father has given me everything, and to some extent he knows who the son is apart from the father, and who the father is apart from the son and those whom the son wills to reveal him to. John 3:35; John 1:18; 10:15
I'm here for all of you, those who are pregnant and those who are carrying heavy loads. I will give you rest.
Here's my translation: I've brought my light upon you, learn from me, for I am kind and humble. Then, you will find peace for your souls.
"Whereas my strength is easy and my burden is light."
Chapter Ten: Jesus Teaches on the Sabbath
And when the Sabbath had come, Jesus was walking through the grainfields. And His disciples were hungry, and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to Him, "Look, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!"
They replied: "Didn't you read that when David and his companions were hungry, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which was lawful for him and his companions to eat, though it was lawful only for the priests?"
And how would he enter the House of God, and the bread that is offered to God, which was not special, he would not eat it, nor would those with him, except for the religious scholars alone.
And what about those you read in the Torah, that the priests in the house of God desecrate the Sabbath, and yet they are not blamed?
But I tell you: There is none here greater than the House of God.
And since you understand the meaning of the verse that says: "I want mercy, not sacrifice," know that you have not judged those who are not to be blamed.
"Man is lord of the Sabbath." Jesus explained this on the Sabbath.
He walked from there and reached their place of worship.
They found the man with a paralyzed hand. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" They asked him this to accuse him of something.
And they answered, "Only one of you who has a sheep, and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not pull it out and rescue it?" Luke
Eva values sleep more than lamb! And that's why doing good is permissible on Saturday.
And Jesus said to the man with the withered hand, "Stretch out your hand!" And he stretched it out, and it was restored healthy like the other one.
And the Pharisees went out and took counsel together how they might put Him to death. Jesus is the chosen one of God.
And when Jesus knew the news, he went from there and followed him many groups of people, and he saw them all.
And they warned him not to tell anyone about it.
"that the word which Isaiah the prophet has spoken may be fulfilled"
Here is my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul delights. I will put my spirit upon him, and he will declare justice to the peoples.
I won't argue, I won't fight, Until I hear his voice in the echo.
A divided citadel that is not watered, And a wick that emits smoke but is not extinguished, Until the truth returns, it is the one that prevails.
And his name is called the Word of the peoples, they will pray to him. Jesus and Beelzebul
A man named Jesus passed by, and he was blind and deaf, and he healed him, and so he was able to speak and see.
And they were astonished by the crowds, saying, "Is this not the son of David?"
And when the Pharisees saw this, they said, "It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons." Matthew 9:34; 10:25
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand."
And if it is by Beelzebub that I cast out demons, by whom do your people cast them out? So then, they will be your judges. But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Otherwise, I would have brought Beelzebub out of madness. Who are these people that you bring your children out with? These are the people your children will rule over you.
But unless I am sent by the Spirit of God, madness would have come out, for the Kingdom of God has come among you.
How can someone allow a person to enter their home, steal their needs without being satisfied, and then steal their home again?
Whoever is not against us is for us. Mark 9:40
All manner of sin and blasphemous speech that people utter will be forgiven, but blasphemous speech uttered against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
All manner of sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to people, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. Matthew 12:31 The tree and its fruit
You shall know them by their fruits. Even so, every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
What a snake's trick! How can you say something nice when you're not nice? What comes out of the heart is what the mouth speaks. When
I wish for the fortunate to bring forth the fortunate treasures from the fortunate treasure within their hearts, and I wish for the unfortunate to bring forth the unfortunate treasures from the unfortunate treasure within their hearts.
And I tell you: Every empty presence that people fill, they will be held accountable for on the Day of Judgment.
"Your words will control you, either as a master or as a guilty one." The scholars of the law and the Pharisees are blind to see a sign.
And the Pharisees and the teachers of the law demanded of him a sign from heaven. And he answered them, saying, "When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red,'
He said to them: "A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! And I will not give it to them except a sign of the prophet Jonah. For just as Jonah was in the belly of the sea creature for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights."
The earth will remain as it is, just as Jonah thought the whale would not swallow him for days and nights, so will the son of man remain in the heart of the earth for days and nights.
The people of Nineveh will follow on the Day of Judgment with this generation and testify against them. They did not repent even though Jonah warned them, and now here is one of them remaining from Jonah.
And the Queen of the South will rise up in judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon, and now something greater than Solomon is here.
The national way to get the jinn out of a person is to make them walk until they sweat, so that the jinn cannot stay, and to make them turn over and not find rest.
And I said: I wish we could go back to the house I left, and return to it, but we would find it empty, ruined, and destroyed.
And he walks and he has seven other crazy kids with him. And if they enter and settle down, they will take the state from the corrupt state it is in now. This is what will happen to this generation that is capable of evil even more than him. Jesus Christ, have mercy.
And when he used to talk to groups of people, his friends would come and stand outside wanting to talk to him.
He said to one of the attendees: "There are some people outside who want to talk to you."] # 12:47 This verse is not present in many of the ancient manuscripts.
And Jesus answered and said to him: "Who do you say that I am, and who are my brothers?"
He gestured with his hand in the direction of their approach: "Here come my brother and sister,"
"Those who wish for what is in the sky, they are my brothers and sisters and not."
The farmer's chapter of the metal Latash
By daybreak, Jesus went out and made his way to a deserted place.
And great multitudes were gathered unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat down; and the whole multitude stood on the shore. Luke 5:1-3
And he again told them many things in parables, saying: "Behold, a sower went out to sow,"
A farmer was sowing seeds, and some fell on the path, and the birds came and ate them.
A millstone lying on the ground, not much soil, and they grew where the soil was not waterlogged.
When the sun rises from the east, it burns, and when they don't have walls, they get sunburned.
A millstone around their necks in the midst of thorns, and the thorns were so large that they choked them.
There are those who gave a hundred, those who gave sixty, and those who gave thirty.
"Eva, who has something to say, listen!". The purpose of the successor
They approached him and asked, "Why do you speak to people in riddles?"
He replied to them and said: "To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given."
To whom much is given, from him shall be required much more. But he who has nothing, even that shall be taken from him. When
I was talking to them in their own language, whether they saw or didn't see, whether they heard or didn't hear, and whether they liked it or not.
And these are the investigations of the prophecy of Isaiah: And when you hear what you have heard, you will not understand; and when you see what you have seen, you will not perceive.
Where this people's heart is hardened, their hearing is dull, and their eyes are closed, so that they might not see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal them.
But we are glad that you see, and we welcome those who hear. Luke
"Behold, we have told you the truth: many of the prophets and the righteous desired to see what you see and did not see it, and to hear what you hear and did not hear it." The meaning of this parable is that of the sower.
"Listen to what the meaning of this man's words is:"
The one who hears the word of the Kingdom and does not understand it, the devil comes and takes away what was sown in his heart. This is like the seed that fell on the path.
The one who plants in the stony ground, this is the one who hears God's word and accepts it joyfully.
But the word of God did not take root in his heart, and his faith remained for only a short time. When troubles and persecution came, he quickly fell away.
The one planted in the midst of thorns is the one who hears the word of God, but the cares of this world and the love of money choke the word of God in him and it does not bear fruit.
But as for what is sown on good soil, it is this, which hears the word of God and understands it, which indeed bears fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty. The parable of the sower among the wheat.
And Jesus gave them another parable, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field."
The people were sleeping, the enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and left.
And the plant grew, and the stem came out, with the fruit until it.
They called the house servants and said to them: "Hey, sir, is it the beautiful young girl you planted in your field who is coming? Where did this guest come from?"
He answers them: "This enemy is the one who caused this." And his servants say to him: "Do you want us to go and remove him?"
They replied and said: No! So that the wheat does not get mixed with the weeds.
The wheat grows with the rain until it's time for harvest. At that time, we go to harvest and gather the rain, which is the wheat, and we turn it into bundles so it doesn't burn. As for the wheat, we gather it and take it to the storage house. The mustard seed and the yeast are the same.
And he presented them with another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and planted in his field."
"Waakha is the little one full of love, as she grows she becomes a big tree from the moment of planting, until the birds of the sky come to nest in her branches."
And he spoke to them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened." Jesus spoke all these things in parables.
And all this was done by Jesus to the groups of people in the wilderness, and without money, he had nothing to say to them.
The words of the Prophet will come true: "With the staff, we speak and inform of everything that was hidden from the day the world was created." The meaning of this staff is the pen.
When Jesus had dismissed the crowd, he went home. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
And they answered him, saying: "He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,"
The world is the field, the good wheat are the children of the kingdom of God, and the tares are the children of the devil.
The enemy who sowed the evil is Iblis, the harvest is the end of time, and the harvesters are the angels.
As the sun gathers and burns with well-being, so will it happen in the future of time:
The angels will gather the human being's children, and He will collect from His kingdom all the things that caused the sins and all those who sinned.
Wishing you a speedy recovery. I hope the pain and toothache will be gone soon.
But those who obey Allah are like the sun in their kingdom. Those who have something to say, let them speak!" This is the parable of the treasure, the jewel, and the net.
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a treasure hunter and found a treasure in a field. He buried it again, and in his joy, he went and sold all that he had and bought that field."
And the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls,
"And a man loved a jewel very much, he sold everything he owned and bought it."
"And the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered some of every kind,"
And many Hajj pilgrimages, they would go out fishing by the sea and when they caught some, they would sort them out. The good ones they would put in the net, and the ones that weren't suitable they would throw back.
And thus shall be the end of the world: the angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous.
"Wirmio cities between Falzopia and Al-Afa, where Gadi will be the river and the teeth of the gazelle." The new and old treasure.
And Jesus said to his disciples, "Have you understood all this?" They said to him, "Yes."
He said to them: "Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old." Jesus was not received in Nazareth.
And when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from there.
He returned to his hometown of Nazareth and began to teach in their synagogue, astonishing everyone. They asked, "Where did this wisdom and these miracles come from?"
Is this the carpenter's son? And what about his mother, the one you call Mary? And his brothers, James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Where do your sisters live in our city? How did all this happen?”
And they were not amazed at His condition, but Jesus said to them: "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and among his own relatives." John 4:44.
And he has no power over them, except by Allah's leave, that he may test who believes and who does not.
The Beheading of St. John the Baptist
Hearing of Jesus, Herod the ruler was perplexed.
He said to his disciples: "This is John the Baptist, whom they killed, and this is why the miracles are performed through him."
For when Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, Philip's wife, Luke
"Then John said to him: 'It is lawful for you to marry her.'"
He wanted to kill him, but he feared the people, as they believed he was a prophet.
At Herod's birthday feast, Herodias' daughter danced at the party, and Herod was pleased.
Why did he swear to give her what she asked for?
"Herodias' daughter came in and danced before them. She pleased Herod so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. Prompted by her mother, she said, 'Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.'"
The king was saddened, but before the oaths he swore and the people present, he ordered that what they desired be given to them.
The servant who beheaded John was imprisoned,
They gave her one of the tablets and gave it to the girl, and he gave it to her.
And when John's disciples told him, they took his body and buried it, and then they went and told Jesus. Jesus called the five thousand and one.
And when Jesus heard it, he departed from there by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.
And a great multitude came together, and they came to Him, and He healed their sick.
And as the evening approached, his students gathered around him and said, "The situation has driven us to this state. They say that these groups of people are going to the shops to buy food for their heads."
But Jesus said to them, "You give them something to eat."
The text translates to: "Wallo said: 'We only have five loaves of bread and two fish here.'"
Show them to me here!
He commands the crowds of people to sit down. And God, these five loaves of bread and two fish, he looked up to heaven and thanked God. And having taken the loaves, he gave them to his disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.
They all ate until they were full, and then they gathered twelve baskets full of the leftovers from the bread they had eaten.
And they were about five thousand men, besides women and children. Jesus then went up on the mountain.
And Jesus instructed his disciples to go ahead and get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, while he sent the crowds away.
He went to the mountain alone to pray, and stayed there until evening.
After the students' boat was overwhelmed by the sea and most of them were swept away, the wind was against them.
And when morning came, Jesus stood with His disciples on the sea.
And when the students saw the water, they ran away saying: "This is some kind of demon," and they fled out of sheer fear.
They answered him, "Lord," and Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Take heart, it is I; have no fear!"
He said to him, "Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water."
And Jesus said to him, "Come!" And Peter went down from the boat and walked on the water to go to Jesus.
But Mili saw the strong wind uprooting (things) and began to drown, and he cried out: "Save me, my master!"
And taking the hand of the child, Jesus raised him up, and those who brought him were astonished. But Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid; only believe."
They all went out to the boat, the wind calmed down.
And those in the boat worshipped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God." Jesus, seeing many people sick, went to their towns.
And Jesus and his disciples departed to the other side of the sea, and came into the country of the Gergesenes.
They knew him as Malin the rooster of the country, and they called him the news of the valleys, and they brought him their sick chickens.
They asked him to take a different path. The way he took was a discovery.
Chapter Five Continuing the Elders' Discussions
And after that, two Pharisees and experts in the law from Jerusalem came to Jesus, and they asked Him:
"Why don't you follow the elders' custom? They don't wash their hands before eating."
But he answered them, saying: "Why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?"
Hitler said: "You are either with us or against us, and whoever is not specifically with us will be killed."
But we say: He who has no sheep or goats: This is what we help you with, we have given it as a gift to God.
What remains is a duty upon him to fulfill. And thus they abandoned the words of Allah to follow your tradition.
The hypocrites! Verily, Isaiah had the right when he prophesied against you, saying:
People praise me with their mouths, but their hearts are far from me.
It's useless for them to worship me, when they learn the teachings that are not the commandments of people. The things they do are in vain.
Woe to you, people! They said to them: "Hear and understand:"
"Whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then is eliminated. What comes out of the mouth, however, comes from the heart."
And after that, he had disciples who said to him: "Did you know that the Pharisees are worried because they heard your words?"
They replied and said: "What was not planted has gone with what is in the sky."
"Let them! Here they are, blind leading the blind. If not, the blind would lead the blind into a pit. Here they are, about to throw Google into a pit." Luke
Peter said to me: "Explain to me the meaning of this metal!"
He responds: "What, are we still on this? You still don't understand?"
You don't know where the food you eat goes after it enters your mouth and goes to your stomach, and then comes out?
ما يقوله الفم، يأتي من القلب، وهو ما سنندم عليه. عندما
Here are the vain thoughts that emerge from the heart: Like the slain, the corruption of the married and the unmarried, theft, false testimony, and slander.
"Nothing that King David touched would become unclean, but the food he ate, if not washed, would not be clean for him to eat." This is the faith of the Canaanite woman.
And Jesus went out from there and walked by the Sea of Galilee, and up on the mountains.
She came to him a woman of Canaan, from these parts here, and she cried out and said: "Have mercy on me, my Lord, son of David! My daughter is severely tormented by a demon."
But he did not even answer her with a word. His students approached him and asked him, saying: "Leave her as she is, lest she follow us and become like us!"
And Jesus answered them, saying, "I was sent by God only for the lost sheep of the people of Israel."
But the woman came to Jacob and bowed down to him and said, "Help me, my lord!"
"She replied: 'It's reasonable to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.'"
And the woman said to him: "What is my lord's business! But even the dogs eat from the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
"Jesus answered and said to her, 'Woman, your faith is great! Let it be to you as you wish.' And at that hour her daughter was healed. Many people witnessed this."
And after that, Jesus went from there to the Sea of Galilee, and He went up to the mountain and sat down there.
And a great multitude of people came to Him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they laid them down at His feet, and He healed them.
And the crowds were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking, the blind seeing, and God glorifying Israel. Jesus warned them not to make him known.
And Jesus, looking upon his disciples, said to them: "Make them sit down in companies, by fifties in a place." And they did so, and made them all sit down. Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before the multitude. And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.
They ask me, "Where are we going to get this dough that can satisfy a large group of people in this condition?"
And Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."
And Jesus commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground.
And God blessed them, and said, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth." And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
They all ate until they were full, and they laughed at the seven cats playing with the crumbs of the bread they had thrown.
They were people who had a thousand and a quarter, without families or children.
And when Jesus had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.
The chapter's temporal markers
And some of the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus, testing Him, and they asked Him to show them a sign from heaven. Matthew
But he answered them and said: "As the sun sets, the sky becomes clear, and the clouds turn red."
Good morning, Bakri Katgolo: Today will be winter. The sky will be red and cloudy. You know how to interpret the weather, but you can't interpret the signs of time!
A wicked and perverse generation seeks for a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. And when He had sent the multitudes away, He departed from there and came to His home. Matthew 12:39; Luke 11:29 The leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees

They say to themselves: "If we say these words, we won't get any bread with them."
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Why do you think lack of faith in your hearts? 'We have no bread?'"
What haven't you understood yet? And why haven't you replied about the five thousand loaves that are distributed among five thousand people? And how much did you collect from the circumstances of these loaves? When?
What about the seven thousand loaves of bread that were distributed among a thousand people? How much did they collect? When?
How is it that you fail to understand that I did not mean my words to you about the bread? Shake the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees from your heads!

"Peter pulled him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, 'Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you.'"
He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
He said to his disciples: "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me."
He who wants to save his life will lose it, but he who loses his life for my sake will find it. When?
What is the use of wealth for a person if he gains the whole world but loses his life? And what will compensate a person for his life?

And at that moment, behold, a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!” 2 Peter 1:17,18
When the students heard this, they fell on their faces and were very afraid.
And when Jesus came to them, he spoke to them, saying: "Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid!"
And they rubbed their eyes and saw no one but Jesus alone.
And at that time, as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell no one about this vision until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
And they asked him: "Why do the scholars of the law say that only the prophet Elijah will come?"
They replied and said: "Indeed, Ilya Gigi is the best and can do everything,"

The disciples came to Jesus and asked him privately, "Why couldn't we drive out the demon?"
And He said to them, "Because of your little faith. For truly I say to you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. And nothing will be impossible for you.
"And this kind of demon does not go out except by prayer and fasting."] # 17.21 This verse is not found in many ancient manuscripts at Matthew 21:21; Mark 11:23; 1 Corinthians 13:2 Jesus prophesied again about death and resurrection.

When Jesus and his disciples came to Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and said, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
And they replied: "Eh, let him finish it." And before entering the house, Jesus asked him: "Simon, what do you think? From whom do the kings of the earth collect taxes or tribute? From their sons or from others?"
Peter's reply was: "From outside." And he said to Jesus: "On this basis, their children are exempt from the tax."
But so we don't cause them any trouble, go to the sea, cast your line, and the first whale that you catch, open its mouth, and you will find inside a plate of dirhams. Take it and go, it will be over for you and for them.
