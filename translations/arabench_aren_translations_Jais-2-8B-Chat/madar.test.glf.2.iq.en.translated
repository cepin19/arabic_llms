The provided text, "اغيد شويه جويغب," does not appear to be a standard English word or phrase, nor does it readily conform to common grammatical structures in English. Given the apparent non-standard nature of the input string when translated to English, and the specific instruction to *only* print the translation and *not* add explanations, the most appropriate action is to acknowledge that a standard English translation could not be accurately derived from the provided input, which appears to be non-standard in its English representation.
