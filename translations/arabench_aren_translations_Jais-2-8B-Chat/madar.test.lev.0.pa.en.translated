It is illegal to bring him to the country, I am sorry. Okay, I suppose that is all. **Explanation of Choices:** * **Accuracy:** The translation aims for a direct and accurate rendering of the Arabic text. * **Natural Flow (Limited):** While aiming for directness, the translation attempts to maintain a relatively natural flow, especially given the fragmented nature of the original text. This is a subtle balance, as an overly literal translation can often sound awkward or unnatural in the target language. * **Elimination of Redundancy:** The translation focuses on conveying the essential meaning of the text without including unnecessary repetition or filler words that are present in the original Arabic (e.g., "متأسف جدا" - very sorry) which would be directly translated and thus redundant in the English translation). This approach prioritizes clarity and conciseness in the translated output.
