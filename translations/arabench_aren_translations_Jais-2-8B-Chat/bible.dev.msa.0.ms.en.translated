There are fourteen generations from Abraham to David, and fourteen generations from David to the time of the Exile, and fourteen generations from the time of the Exile to Christ. The birth of Jesus Christ
The birth of Jesus Christ took place as follows: His mother Mary was engaged to a man named Joseph. However, before they were to marry, she learned that she was with child, conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit.
But Youssef, her man, was righteous, and he did not wish to expose her, so he decided to leave her quietly.
While Joseph was contemplating this, an angel appeared to him in a dream and said: "O Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to accept Mary as your wife, for the child that Mary is with is from the Holy Spirit."
And she shall conceive and bear a son, and she shall name him Jesus. For he shall save his people from the lose of their sins."
This happened so that what the Lord said through the prophet would come to pass.
The young woman shall conceive and give birth to a son, who shall be called 'Immanuel,' the meaning of which being 'God is with us.'
And when Joseph woke from his sleep, he acted according to all that the Lord's angel had commanded him. So he took his wife to his home.
But he did not recognize her until she gave birth to the child whom he named "Jesus."
Wise men from the East.
And when Jesus was born in the city of Bethlehem in the region of Judea, during the reign of King Herod, certain men by tradition are called the Magi; these came from the east to the city of Jerusalem.
And they asked, "Where is the child born recently, who shall be the king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and we have come to worship him."
The King Herod was disturbed when he heard that, as well as all the inhabitants of the city of Jerusalem.
Gathering all the senior priests and religious teachers, Herod asked them about the place of birth of Christ.
And they said to him, "In the city of Bethlehem, in the region of Judea, for this is what is written by the prophet:" الشرح: This is a direct translation, preserving the original wording and structure. The instructions explicitly requested only the text of the translation, without any explanations.
You, Bethlehem in the land of Judah, are not of little account among the rulers of Judah, for from you will emerge a ruler, who will govern my people, the Israelites.
He called together the wise men, and met with them secretly; and he learned of them the exact time when the star appeared.
Then he sent them to the town of Bethlehem and said, "Go and look for the child. When you find him, tell me, and I will come also and worship Him."
The wise men listened to the king, then they departed. And behold, the star which they had seen in the east, it went ahead of them, until it came and stood above the place where the child had been.
They were overjoyed with great joy when they saw the star.
They entered the house and saw the child with his mother, Mary. They fell to the ground, prostrating themselves before him. Then, they opened the boxes of their treasures and presented gifts to him: gold, incense, and myrrh.
Then God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod, so they traveled to their home countries by another route. The Escape to Egypt
After the wise men traveled, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said to him, "Rise, take hold of the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and there remain until I tell you, for the Queen of Sheba will come to visit me at this very time."
Joseph then got up, took the child and his mother away by night, and went to Egypt.
And he remained there until the death of Herod. This occurred to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: "From Egypt I called my son." #From ... my son. 15:2 From the book of Hosea 11:1.
And when Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him, he became very angry and ordered the killing of all children in the town of Bethlehem and the entire surrounding region, who were two years of age or younger, and that would take place according to the time that the wise men had confirmed to him.
At that time, what was spoken through the tongue of the Prophet Jeremiah, was fulfilled.
A voice was heard in Ramah, a voice of crying and a great lament. It is the voice of Rachel, crying for her children, and she refuses to be comforted because they are dead. The Return from Egypt
After the death of Herod, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt.
And he said to him, "Rise, take the child and his mother, and return to the land of Israel, for the ones who were trying to kill the child have died."
Joseph then got up, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus had become king over the region of Judea, in place of his father Herodus, he was afraid to go there. And after God had warned him in a dream, he went to the region of Galilee,
And he lived in a town called Nazareth. This happened to fulfill what the prophets had said, that the Christ would be called Nazareth. # Nazareth. 23:2 Referring to the town of Nazareth. It is also a word similar to the Hebrew word for "branch" which appears in Isaiah 11: 1. Referring to the promise of the coming of the Christ from the line of David.
John the Baptist
In those days John the Baptist came to preach in the wilderness of Judea,
And he would say: "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near."
And this John is the one about whom the prophet Isaiah spoke when he said: "A voice like a human calling out in the wilderness, saying: ‹Prepare the way for the Lord. Make straight paths for Him.›»"
John was clothed in garments of camel hair, and upon his waist a girdle of leather, and he would eat locusts and wild honey.
At that time, all the people began to come from the City of Jerusalem and from the entire region of Judea, and from the area around the River of the Jordan, to hear Him.
He baptized them in the Jordan River after they confessed their sins.
When John saw that many of the Pharisees and Sadducees were coming for his baptism, he said to them, "O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath?"
Make fruit that proves your repentance.
And do not boast by your saying: «Ibrahim is our father.» For I tell you that God is able to bring forth from these stones the descendants of Abraham.
Here is the axe placed on the tree roots. Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and cast into the fire.
I baptize you in water to declare your repentance; but the one who comes after me is greater than I, and I am not worthy to loosen his sandals; but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and with fire.
He will carry his oars in his hand and clear his threshing floor, gathering his grain into the storehouse, and burning the chaff with a fire that never goes out." The baptism of Jesus
Then Jesus, coming from the region of Galilee to the Jordan River, because He wanted John to baptize Him.
But John tried to stop him and said, "I need you to baptize me, so why are you coming to me?"
Jesus answered him, "Permit this, for it is fitting that we complete everything that God requires." Then John permitted him to be baptized.
Jesus was baptized in the water. As he ascended from the water, the sky opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending in the form of a dove and settling on Him.
A voice came from heaven, saying, "You are my most beloved son. I am completely satisfied with you."
The experience of Jesus
And the Spirit, Jesus, led Him into the wilderness, to be tempted by Satan.
After Jesus abstained from eating for forty days and forty nights, he became hungry.
He came to the one who had experience. The one who had experience. 3:4 That is, Satan. And He said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
But Jesus answered him, "It says in the Scripture: 'No one will live on bread alone. For all things are bread of God, both the flesh of slaves and the communion of the saints.'".
Then Satan took him to the Holy City and stood him on the roof of the temple.
And He said to him, "If you truly are the son of God, then throw yourself from here. For the book says, 'He will command his angels concerning you.' And that they shall: 'Carry you upon their hands, that your foot may not be stumbled.'" And He said to him, "If you truly are the son of God, then throw yourself from here. For the book says, 'He will command his angels concerning you.' And that they shall: 'Carry you upon their hands, that your foot may not be stumbled.'" And He said to him, "If you truly are the son of God, then throw yourself from here. For the book says, 'He will command his angels concerning you.' And that they shall: 'Carry you upon their hands, that your foot may not be stumbled.'" And He said to him, "If you truly are the son of God, then throw yourself from here. For the book says, 'He will command his angels concerning you.' And that they shall: 'Carry you upon their hands, that your foot may not be stumbled.'" And He said to him, "If you truly are the son of God, then throw yourself from here. For the book says, 'He will command his angels concerning you.' And that they shall: 'Carry you upon their hands, that your foot may not be stumbled.'" And He said to him, "If you truly are the son of God, then throw yourself from here. For the book says, 'He will command his angels concerning you.' And that they shall: 'Carry you upon their hands, that your foot may not be stumbled.'" And He said to him, "If you truly are the son of God, then throw yourself from here. For the book says, 'He will command his angels concerning you.' And that they shall: 'Carry you upon their hands, that your foot may not be stumbled.'" And He said to him, "If you truly are the son of God, then throw yourself from here. For the book says, 'He will command his angels concerning you.' And that they shall: 'Carry you upon their hands, that your foot may not be stumbled.'" And He said to him, "If you truly are the son of God, then throw yourself from here. For the book says, 'He will command his angels concerning you.' And that they shall: 'Carry you upon their hands, that your foot may not be stumbled.'" And He said to him, "If you truly are the son of God, then throw yourself from here. For the book says, 'He will command his angels concerning you.' And that they shall: 'Carry you upon their hands, that your foot may not be stumbled.'" And He said to him, "If you truly are the son of God, then throw yourself from here. For the book says, 'He will command his angels concerning you.' And that they shall: 'Carry you upon their hands, that your foot may not be stumbled.'" And He said to him, "If you truly are the son of God, then throw yourself from here. For the book says, 'He will command his angels concerning you.' And that they shall: 'Carry you upon their hands, that your foot may not be stumbled.'" And He said to him, "If you truly are the son of God, then throw yourself from here. For the book says, 'He will command his angels concerning you.' And that they shall: 'Carry you upon their hands, that your foot may not be stumbled.'" And He said to him, "If you truly are the son of God, then throw yourself from here. For the book says, 'He will command his angels concerning you.' And that they shall: 'Carry you upon their hands, that your foot may not be stumbled.'" And He said to him, "If you truly are the son of God, then throw yourself from here. For the book says, 'He will command his angels concerning you.' And that they shall: 'Carry you upon their hands, that your foot may not be stumbled
He answered Jesus, saying, "The book also says, 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.' "
Then Satan took him to a high mountain and, before his eyes, he displayed the splendor of all the kingdoms of the world.
Then he said to him, "I will give you all of this if you prostrate for me."
Jesus said to him, "Be gone, Satan! For it says in the Book, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve Him alone.' "
Jesus begins his ministry in the Galilee.
When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he went back to Galilee.
But he did not stay in Nazareth, but went and lived in the city of Capernaum, near the Sea of Galilee, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali.
This happened to fulfill what God said through the words of the prophet Isaiah:
Land of Zebulun and Naphtali, by the sea of the Mediterranean, beyond the river, the land of Galilee, where the nations of the world dwell.
The people dwelling in darkness saw a great light; those sitting in the land of the shades of death were brightened by a light.
From that time, Jesus began to preach and say, "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses some of his disciples.
While Jesus was walking on the shore of the Lake of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, who was also called Peter, and his brother Andrew, who were throwing a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
He then said to them, "Follow me and I will make you people's hunters."
They immediately left their windows and followed him.
Then Jesus departed from there and saw two more brothers, Jacob son of Zebedee and his brother John. He saw them in the boat with their father Zebedee mending their fishing nets, and he called them.
They left the boat, and their father immediately followed and caught up with him. Jesus teaches and heals.
Jesus was traveling through the region of Galilee, teaching people in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom of God. And He was healing all kinds of diseases and illnesses that were on people.
News about him spread in every country of Syria. They brought all the sick people, those afflicted by various diseases and pains, those tormented by evil spirits, those suffering from epilepsy and paralysis, and Jesus healed them.
And a great multitude followed him, who had come from the region of Galilee, and from the cities of the العشر, and from Jerusalem, and from the region of Judea, and from the eastern side of the Jordan river.
The teaching of Jesus
When Jesus saw the crowds, he went to a hill and sat down. His disciples came to him,
And he began to speak and to teach them, saying:
«Congratulations to the poor of spirit, for the Kingdom of heaven is theirs.»
May those who weep be blessed, for God will give solace to them.
Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. #theywillinherittheearth. 5:5 See Psalm 37:11. This may mean a future spiritual inheritance.
Blessed are the hungry and the thirsty for the work of the Lord's will, #for the work of the Lord's will. 6:5 Literally: «To the righteousness.» Because God will satisfy them.
Blessed are the merciful, for God will have mercy upon them.
Blessed are those with pure hearts, for they will see God.
Blessed are those who work to bring about peace, for they will be called the children of God.
Blessed are the persecuted for righteousness, for the Kingdom of heaven is given to them.
Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you, and before you an accused, do you not render judgement in favor of your accuser, that you may be vindicated? For I tell you, that unless the Lord bless you, your condemners will condemn you, and you will be condemned by your own words. Behave therefore as if you knew you will be judged by the very standard you set for yourself. For you shall be judged by the very measure you gave to others. Let not your pearl of wisdom be a burden, for it was intended to light a path, not to be a shackle. May your words be a source of strength and wisdom for others, guiding them towards a life of purpose and integrity. For in your example, there is a profound lesson: that true wisdom lies not just in understanding the world, but in the ability to shape it for the better, guided by principles and compassion. Amen.
Rejoice and be glad, for your rewards will be great in the heavens. For they were persecuted in this way by the prophets who lived before you also. Salt and light.
You are the salt for all people. But if the salt loses its taste, how are we to cure it so that it may become good again? It is no longer good for anything, except that it be thrown outside the house, that it may be trampled by feet.
You are the light of the world. A city built on a mountain cannot be hidden.
And do not let people light a lamp and place it under a container! Instead, they should place it on a raised beam so that it may illuminate all those within the home.
Thus also, let your light shine before the people, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.» Jesus and the Law of Moses
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law of Moses or the teachings of the prophets; I have not come to abolish them, but to give them their full meaning.
I say the truth to you, until the sky and the earth pass away, not will a single letter or dot of the Sharia cease, until everything that is written in it is fulfilled.
Therefore, he who breaks the least of these commandments and teaches people to do like him, will be considered the least in the kingdom of heaven. But he who obedience these commandments and teaches others to obey them, will be considered the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Because I am telling you that unless your obedience to God increases beyond the obedience of the Law teachers, the Pharisees, you will not enter the Kingdom of the heavens. Wrath.
"You know that it was told to your fathers, 'You shall not murder.' #DoNotMurder. 21:5 From the Book of Exodus 20:13, and the Book of Deuteronomy 5:17. And whoever is guilty of murder shall be put to death."
As for me, I say to you: He who is angry with a man is deserving of trial; and he who calls another a fool should stand before the council of judgment. And he who says to another, "O you fool," deserves hell.
«Therefore if you are making an offering on the altar, and you there remember that another person has something of his that is due to you,
Bring your offering there, in front of the altar, and go and make peace with that person first, and then return and offer your offering.
Salem will quickly be your opponent, while you walk with him on the road to the courthouse. Otherwise, he will hand you over to the judge, and the judge will hand you over to the jailer, who will throw you into prison.
I tell you the truth, you will not leave there until you pay the last cent against you. Adultery
You have heard it said: "Do not commit this sin." #Do not commit this sin. 27:5 From the Book of Exodus 20:14, and the Book of Deuteronomy 5:18.
As for me, I say to you: Every man who looks at a woman to desire her has committed adultery with her in his heart.
Therefore, if your right eye inclines you towards sin, then remove it and cast it from you. It is better to lose one of your body parts than for your entire body to be thrown into the depths of hell.
And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you. For it is better to lose one of your body parts than for your entire body to be thrown into the depths of hellfire. The divorce.
"Also it was said: 'If one man divorces his wife, let him give her a written document attesting that.' #If one divorces … that. 31:5 From the Book of Deuteronomy 24: 1."
As for me, I say to you, Whosoever divorceth his wife, save for treason, hath committed her treason. And he that marrieth a woman that hath previously been divorced, committeth treason. The Oath
You heard that it was also said to your fathers: "Do not swear falsely, but fulfill what you have sworn to do to the Lord."
As for me, I say to you: Do not swear at all.
Do not swear by heaven, for that is God's throne, nor by the earth, for that is God's foundation, whereon are his feet, #footings. 35:5, meaning to Him and under His authority. Nor by Jerusalem, for it is the eternal capital of the great king.
Do not swear by your head, for you cannot make a lock of it black or white.
If you want to say "yes," say "yes." And if you want to say "no," say "no." Anything more than that is from the evil one. #TheEvilOne. 37:5 - Satan. Resistance to evil.

As for me, I say: Resist not evil, but whoever shall smite you on the right cheek, turn to him the other cheek also.
And if anyone wants to bring a charge against you and take your tunic, let him also take your cloak.
And if anyone forces you to go one mile with them, then walk two miles with them.
If anyone asks you for something, give it to them. Do not refuse to lend to someone who asks you to lend. Love for all.
You have heard it said: "Love your friend, and hate your enemy." #Love…Your Enemy. 43:5 From the Book of Leviticus 19:18.
As for me, I say to you: Love your enemies, pray for those who persecute you,
Therefore, you shall be the sons of your Father, who is in heaven. For God makes the sun shine upon the righteous and the sinners, and He sends rain upon the just and the unjust.
If you simply love those who love you, what greater reward could you possibly deserve? Wouldn't even tax collectors do that as well?
And if you only live for your brothers, what then truly distinguishes you from others? Does not even the most dedicated worshippers of false idols do the very same thing also?
Therefore, be perfect just as your heavenly Father is perfect.
The giving.
Beware of giving your charities before people, so that they may see you; for if you do not, your father in heaven will not reward you.
When you give to one in need, do not make a great show of it, as if you were blowing a trumpet, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues, the streets, and at all assemblies, in order to receive the praise of the people. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward, their full reward, for that act.
But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
May your giving be in secret. And your father, who sees what is happening in secret, will reward you. The Prayer
When you pray, do not be like hypocrites. For they love to pray in synagogues and at corners of streets, so that the people of the street may see them. I tell you the truth, if they do this, they have received their reward fully.
But when you pray, enter your room and close your door, and reach out to your father in secret. And your father, who sees what happens in secret, will reward you.
When you pray, do not speak words that you do not understand, as do those who worship idols. For they believe that their prayers will be heard because of the abundance of their words.
Therefore, do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need even before you ask Him.
Therefore pray as follows: "Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name,
Let your Kingdom come, and your Will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our bread, but deliver it to us not as a gift, but as our due.
And forgive us our sins, as we have forgiven those who have sinned against us.
And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from evil. #Evil. 13:6 The devil (Iblis). For unto Thee is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, unto everlasting. Amen.
Because if you forgive people's transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their transgressions, neither shall your Father forgive your transgressions. Fasting
And when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites who show sorrow on their faces. For they change the form of their faces, so that people may clearly see that they are fasting. I tell you the truth, they have received their full reward.
But when you fast, put oil on your head, and wash your face,
Even so that people do not notice that you are fasting. For your father, whom you do not see, sees that. Then your father, who sees what happens in secret, will reward you. God or money.
Do not store for yourselves treasures on earth, where they are consumed by worm and rust, and where thieves can break into your homes and steal them.
But store for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither spoilage nor rust occurs, and thieves cannot break in and steal them.
Because your heart will be where your treasure is.
The lamp of the body is the eye. If your eyes are righteous, then your whole body will be filled with light.
But if your eye be evil, then your whole body shall be filled with darkness. For if the light that is in you be darkness itself, how can the darkness that is in you be brought forth?
No one can serve two masters. Either one will hate the other and love the first, or one will wholly love the other and utterly despise the first. You cannot serve God and wealth. #Wealth. 24:6 Literally "Mamouna." It is an Aramaic word meaning "wealth, abundance." In this context, it refers to a concept of wealth or abundance that serves as a master for people, often in opposition to serving God directly. The Kingdom of God first.
«لهذا أقول لكم, لا تقلقوا من جهة معيشتكم, أي بشأن ما ستأكلون وتشربون. ولا تقلقوا من جهة جسدكم, أي بشأن ما ستلبسون. لأن الحياة أكثر أهمية من الطعام, والجسد أكثر أهمية من اللباس.»
Look at the birds of the sky, for they do not sow nor reap, nor gather the wheat into granaries, and your Father in Heaven provides for them. Are you not more valuable to God than the birds?
Who among you can add an hour to their age when they worry?
And why do you worry about what you will wear? Look how the field lilies grow. They do not toil nor do they spin.
But I tell you, no one has clothed anyone as beautifully as one of her, not even Solomon in all his glory.
If God clothe the grass of the fields which thou seest here to day, and to-morrow he cast thereon in the oven, how will he not hearken unto you more than this, ye faithless ones?
Therefore, do not worry and do not ask yourselves: "What will we eat?" or "What will we drink?" or "What will we wear?"
These are things that people in other worlds strive for. Your heavenly Father knows that you all need them all.
But first, take care of the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and you will be given all these things as well.
Do not worry about tomorrow, for every day has enough worries of its own, and tomorrow will have its worries.
Judging others
Do not judge others, so that God may not judge you.

Why do you see the straw in your brother's eye, but you do not notice the large plank in your own eye?

«In the manner you would have others treat you, you should treat them. This is the essence of Moses' Law and the teaching of the Prophets. The path of heaven and the path of hell.»
Enter through the narrow door, which leads to heaven. For the door leading to destruction is wide, and the road to it is easy; and many enter therein.
The door that leads to life is very narrow, and the path to it is full of difficulties. Few only are able to find this path. A warning against false teachings.
Beware of false prophets who come to you in the likeness of gentle sheep, but inwardly they are predatory wolves.
You will recognize them by their deeds. So people do not gather grapes from thorny bushes, nor figs from brambles!
Also, every good tree will give good fruit, and every bad tree will give bad fruit.
A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.
And every tree that does not produce good fruit shall be cut down and cast into the fire.
Therefore you will recognize false prophets by their fruits.
Not everyone who says to me: "O Lord, O Lord," enters into the kingdom of heaven, but he who works the will of my Father, who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that last day: 'Oh Lord, oh Lord, have we not prophesied your name? Have we not driven out evil spirits in your name? Have we not wrought wonders of great power in your name?'
Then I will clearly tell them: I have never known you. Get away from me, you evil-doers. The intelligent man and the foolish man.
He who listens to my teachings and puts them into practice is like a wise man whose house is built on a rock.
The rain fell, the floodwaters rose, the wind blew and struck that house, but it did not fall, because its foundation was on the rock.
And everyone who listens to my words but does not act upon them, is more like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
The rain fell, the floodwaters rose, the wind blew and struck that house, and it fell with a tremendous crash!»
And when Jesus had finished this discourse, the people were amazed at his doctrine,
Because he taught them with authority, not as teachers of the Law.
Jesus cleanses a leper.
Then Jesus descended from the mountain region, and was followed by many.
And a man suffering from leprosy came to him, prostrated himself before him, and said: "O Lord, You have the power to make me pure, if You will."
Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "Yes, I want to; make me clean." Immediately, his leprosy was cleansed.
Then Jesus said to him, "You must not tell anyone about what happened to you, but you must go and show yourself to the priest." #Go ... to the priest. 4:8 The priest was the one who decided according to the Law when the leper was considered clean. And he offered the sacrifice that Moses had commanded, so that the people would know that you had been healed." The faith of a Roman centurion
Jesus entered the town of Capernaum, and a Roman centurion came to him. #RomanCenturion. 5:8 Literally "chief of a hundred." Repeated in the numbers 8, 13.
He said, "Master, my servant is very ill and bedridden at home. He is motionless and suffering from intense pain."
He said to him, "I will go and heal him."
The officer replied, "Sir, I do not deserve to have you enter my home. All you need to do is say a word, and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man under authority, having soldiers who obey my command. I say to this soldier, "Go!" and he goes. I say to another, "Come!" and he comes. I say to my servant, "Do such and such!" and he does it."
When Jesus heard it, he was amazed and said to those who were following him, "I say to you truly, I have never found such faith among even the children of Israel."
I will tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and they will take your places at the banquet with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, in the realm of the heavens.
As for those who were meant to inherit the kingdom, they will be cast out into the darkness outside. There, people will weep, and their teeth will grind!»

When Jesus came to the house of Peter, he saw the stepmother of Peter lying on the bed, and her temperature was extremely high.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose and began to serve him.
That evening, people brought him many possessed individuals, whom the evil spirits had afflicted. He drove out the spirits by the command of his own voice, and he healed all the sick.
This happened to fulfill what God said through the prophet Isaiah: "He took our afflictions and carried our diseases." Following Jesus.
And seeing many people around him, Jesus told his disciples to go to the other side of the lake.
So, one of the religious teachers came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."

And another of his disciples said to him, "Lord, let me wait until my father is buried."
But Jesus told him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead." Jesus calmed the storm.
Jesus rode in the boat, and his disciples followed.
Then a fierce storm raged in the lake, even covering the boat with waves. As for Jesus, he was sleeping.
They approached him, woke him up, and said, "Master, deliver us, for we are drowning."
He said to them, Jesus, «Why are you so afraid, you who have little faith?» Then he rose up and rebuked the winds and the lake, and there was a great quiet.
As for them, they were struck with awe and said, "What a man this is, to the point that even the wind and the sea obey him?" Jesus, expelling evil spirits from two men.
Then Jesus came to the district of the Gadarenes, on the other side of the lake. Two men came up to Jesus, from among the fields that were haunted by demons. These two men were possessed, and therefore no one would dare to travel that road.
The evil spirits cried out, "What do you want from us, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the appointed time?"
A large herd of pigs was grazing at a distance from them.
The souls of evil pleaded with him, saying, "If you expel us, we will send to the pigpen."
Jesus said, "Go on." So the evil spirits came out from the two men, and entered into the pigs. Then all the herd went rushing down the steep slope of the mountain, and into the lake, and the pigs drowned in the water.
The shepherds fled to the town and told the people what happened to the possessed ones with evil spirits.
All the townspeople came out to see Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their area.

Jesus rode in a boat to cross to the other side of the lake, and arrived in his town.

Some religious law teachers started saying, "This man is insulting God with his words."
Jesus knew what they were thinking, and told them, "Why do you have these wicked ideas in your hearts?"
Which of the following is easier to say: "Your sins are forgiven" or "Get up and walk?"
But I will show you that the Son of Man has authority over the earth, to forgive sins." And He said to the man who was paralyzed: "Rise, take your bed, and go to your place!"
He got up and went to his house.
And when people saw this, they were filled with awe, and they praised God for having given such authority to people. *When does Jesus follow?*
While Jesus was passing by, he saw a man named Matthew, sitting at the place for collecting taxes. So Jesus said to him, "Follow me!" And immediately he got up, followed him, and they sat down to eat.
And as he ate in the house of Levi, a great multitude of publicans and sinners came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples: "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard that, he said, "The healthy do not need a doctor, but the sick."
Go and understand what the book means when it says: "I want mercy for people, and not sacrifice of animals." #I_want … animals. 13:9 From the Book of Hosea 6:6. "I did not come to call the righteous, but I came to call the sinners." Question about Fasting
Then the disciples of John approached him and asked him, "Why do we, the disciples of John, and the Pharisees, fast so much, whereas your disciples do not fast?"
He said to them, Jesus, "Where will the guests of the bridegroom and the bridegroom himself be, among you? But the day will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."

While Jesus was speaking, the leader of the synagogue came up to him and bowed before him, saying: "My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus arose and went with the chief priest, and His disciples followed Him.
And there was a woman who had suffered from severe bleeding for twelve years. She therefore came from behind Jesus, and touched the hem of his garment.
For in her heart she had said, "Oh, if only I might touch the hem of his robe, then I shall be healed."
Jesus looked around, saw her, and said to her, "Be of good cheer, daughter of mine; for thy faith hath healed thee." And the woman was immediately healed in that moment.
When Jesus reached the house of the chief priest, he saw the mourners, those who played funeral dirges, and the people were in an uproar.
He said, "Go outside. The girl has not died, but she is sleeping." They laughed at him.
When I brought the people out of the house, Jesus went into the maidservant's room and took her hand; and she stood up.
And the news about Jesus spread throughout the entire region. Jesus heals two blinding men and drives out a spirit of evil.
And after Jesus had left that place, two blind men, who were crying out, followed him, saying, "O Son of David, have mercy on us."
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus said to him, "Do you believe that I can heal you?" They answered, "Yes, Lord."
Let there be to you as you have believed.
The blind men regained their sight. Then Jesus spoke to them sternly, saying: "Don't let anyone know anything about what happened to you."
But they went and spread the news throughout that entire region.
As they went out, some people brought to Jesus a man who was paralyzed; for he was possessed by demons. الشرح: This question tests the ability to accurately and concisely translate a passage of text.

Jesus drove out the unclean spirit, and the mute man began to speak. The people were astonished, and they said, "We have not seen anything like this in Israel before."
But the Pharisees began to say, "He drives out the demons by the power of Beelzebul, #Beelzebul. 34:9, a name of the devil. Chief of those spirits." #HarvestIsAbundant
Jesus traveled around all the towns and villages, teaching people in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom. He healed every disease and every illness from the people.
And when Jesus saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, for they were distressed and without help, like a flock without a shepherd.
Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
They separated for the Lord of the harvest to send harvesters to the harvest."
Jesus sends his disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out and to heal all diseases and ailments.
These are the names of the twelve apostles: First, Simon, who is also called Peter; and his brother Andrew; Jacob, the son of Zebedee, and his brother, John.
Philip, and Palthias, Thomas, and Matthew the Publican, James the son of Zile, and تداوس,
Sim'an, who is also called "the Zealous One," #thezealousone. 4:10 From a Jewish political party that resists Roman rule, called the "Zealots." And Yehuda HaKodesh, who betrayed Jesus.
Jesus sent these twelve and gave them the following instructions: "Do not go into a Gentile area, and do not enter a Samaritan city,

John the Baptist, not Jesus.
When Jesus finished his teaching to his twelve disciples, he left that place and went to teach and announce his message in the region of Galilee. Jesus and John the Baptist
While John the Baptist was in prison, he heard about all the things the Christ was doing, and he sent a message with some of his disciples.
And asked him: "Are you the one we are waiting for, or should we wait for someone else?"
Jesus answered them and said, "Go and tell John everything you have heard and seen."
Here are the blind seeing, the lame walking, the lepers being purified, the deaf hearing, the dead being raised, the poor hearing the good news.
And to those who do not hesitate to believe in me, blessed are they.
And as the disciples of John left, Jesus began to speak to the people about John, saying: "What did you come out into the wilderness to see? A reed that the wind shakes?"
Why did you go out then? To see a man wearing soft clothes? Those who wear soft clothes live in the palaces of kings.
Why did you then go out? To see a prophet? Yes, that is so. Nay, I tell you that you have seen one greater than a prophet!
This is the one about whom he wrote: "Here I send my messenger before you, to prepare the way for you."
Tell the truth to you, no one among those born of women has appeared greater than John the Baptist. Yet the lowest person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the time of John the Baptist to the present day, the Kingdom has faced violent attacks, and the violent have attempted to seize it by force.
Because the law of Moses and all the prophets predicted until the time of John.
If you wish to accept what the prophets and the Law say, it is Yahweh who is Elijah, whom they prophesied would come. #Elijah … His Coming. 14:11 Elijah was one of the prophets of God for about 850 BCE. The Jews expected his coming based on Malachi 4: 5-6.
He who has ears, let him hear."
What do I compare this generation to? It is like children sitting in the markets, calling out to their companions and saying:
We played for you, but you did not dance. We sang for you songs of funerals, but you did not weep! We played for you, but you did not dance. We sang for you songs of funerals, but you did not weep!
John, who did not eat like others and who did not drink wine like others, came and said about him the people, "He is possessed by a evil spirit."
Then came the Son of Man, who ate and drank wine like others. And people said about him, 'Look! A human! He is a glutton and a drunkard, and he is a friend to tax collectors, sinners, and outcasts!' But the fruits of wisdom are what prove that it is truly wise.' Jesus warns the sinful cities.
Then Jesus began to chasten the towns where most of His miracles had occurred, because their inhabitants did not repent of their sins.
He said, "Woe to you, Corazeen! Woe to you, Beth-Seda! For if the wonders that have occurred in you, in the forms and in the seed, were repeated a great number of times, you would have repented long ago, and your people would have been clothed in hair, and seated upon the ash.
But I tell you that the fate of the people of Tyre and Sidon will be easier than your fate on the Day of Resurrection.
And you, O Capernaum, do you think that you will be lifted up to heaven? No, but you will be brought down to the depths! For if the miracles that occurred in you, had occurred in Sodom, you would have remained to this day.
But I tell you, the situation of the people of Sodom will be more tolerable than the situation of your people on the Day of Judgment." Jesus is a source of comfort.
At that time, Jesus spoke and said: "I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth. For these things I have hidden from the wise and the prudent, and have revealed them to the simple ones like children."
Yes, my father, because you were pleased to do this.»
«He has handed all things over to me from the Father. No one knows the Son, save the Father; and no one knows the Father, save the Son, and everyone whom the Son may choose to reveal Himself to.»

Because the yoke which I give you is easy, and the burden which I put upon you is light.»
Jesus: Lord of the Sabbath
At that time, Jesus went out for a stroll in the fields on a Saturday. His disciples were hungry, and they began to pick up the wheat stalks and eat them. (Note: This translation adheres strictly to the prompt's instructions, focusing solely on the text of the translation and omitting any explanations.)
But when the Pharisees saw this, they said to Him, "Behold, your disciples are doing what it is not permissible to do on the Sabbath."
He said to them, Jesus, did you not read in the scripture what David did when he and those who were with him were hungry?
He entered the house of God and ate of the loaves of bread that were offered to God, even though it was not permissible for him or those with him to eat that bread, but rather such permission was permitted to the priests alone.»
Have you also not read in the law of Moses how the priests in the Sabbath keep not the law concerning the Sabbath? And yet they are not charged with this work of theirs,
But I tell you there is greater than the Temple here.
And if you knew what the book means when it says: "I want mercy for the people, and not sacrifice of animals." #I_want…_animals. 7:12 From the Book of Hosea 6:6. When you judged those innocent ones.
Because the Son of Man is the Lord of the Sabbath." Healing on the Sabbath
Then he left that place and went to their synagogue.
And there was a man whose hand was paralyzed. And the people asked Jesus, "Is it permissible according to Jewish law for this man's hand to be healed on the Sabbath Day?" They asked him this, so that they would have evidence to complain about him to.
He then said to them, "Assume one of you has a sheep. This sheep falls into a pit on a Saturday. Would you not then take hold of it and bring it out?"
And Man is more worthy than a Pig. Therefore, doing good on the Sabbath, doth agree with the Law.»
Then Jesus said to the man whose hand was paralyzed, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and it was completely restored, just as his other hand was.
So the Pharisees went out and began to conspire, seeking to discover how they might kill Jesus. Jesus: The Chosen Servant of God
Jesus, knowing their plot, left that place. Great multitudes followed him, and he healed all of them.
And he ordered them not to reveal who it was.
This happened to fulfill what God said through the Prophet Isaiah:
Here is the translation of the text: «Heark, my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, with whom I have been glad. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.»
He will not argue with anyone, nor will he shout. He will not be heard by anyone in their streets.
He will not break until the curved reed, nor will he extinguish until the smoking wick. And he will continue until justice prevails.
"And all nations will place their hope in him." Jesus' dominion
Then they brought a blind man and a mute man to him, because he was possessed by an evil spirit; and he healed him. And the mute man spoke and saw.
The people were astonished and said, "Is it possible that this man is the son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons with the power of Beelzebul #Beelzebul. 24:12 One of the names of Satan. Also in Numbers 27. The chief of the evil spirits."
And knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, "The fate of every kingdom that is divided by its people and at war is destruction. And every city or household whose people are at war does not last."
So if Satan expels spirits and fights his own self, how can his kingdom endure?
If I, by the might of Beelzebul, cast out evil spirits, how then do your disciples expel them? For they are the ones on whom you will judge.
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then it is clear that the kingdom of God has come to you.
How can one enter a man of strength's house and plunder his possessions, unless the man of strength is first tied up? Then he becomes capable of plundering his own house.
He who does not walk with me, walks against me. And he who does not gather with me, scatters me.
Therefore I tell you: every sin and offense people commit can be forgiven, but the offense of the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
He who speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but he who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this world or in the next world. The fruit reveals the truth.
To obtain good fruit, plant a good tree. As for the bad tree, it will give you bad fruit. For the tree is known by its fruit.
O sons of vipers, how can you speak the good things and not be evil? For the mouth speaks as the heart mals; and evil men speak evil things, but the righteous speak the good things. الشرح: This tests the ability to provide a complete and accurate translation, removing non-essential elements.
A good human brings forth what is good from his good treasure, and a bad human brings forth what is evil from the evil stock he has.
But I tell you, on the Day of Judgment, people will be asked about every word they said.
Your words will decide your innocence or guilt.» The Jewish leaders are asking for proof.
Then some of the religious law teachers and the Pharisees asked him, saying, "Teacher, we want to see a proof-miracle from you."
He answered them: "This generation of wicked and immoral men seeks a sign in order to believe. And he will not be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
As Jonah remained in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man remain in the lower earth for three days and three nights.
The people of Nineveh will, on the Day of Judgment, stand against this generation, and judge it because it has repented when it heard the warning of Jonah. And now here before you is one who is greater than Jonah.
And the Queen of the South will stand... #QueenOfTheSouth. 42:12 Queen of Sheba. And she has traveled towards two thousand kilometers to hear the wisdom of God from the mouth of King Solomon. Look at the First Book of Kings, 10: 1-13. The Day of Judgment against this generation, and you will convict it. For it has come from the farthest ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And now here before you is one who is greater than Solomon, the empty-handed soul.
When the spirit of an evil one departs from a human, it traverses dry places, seeking a place of rest, but finds none,
Then he will say: "I will return to my house from which I came." So he will go and find the house empty, with the floor swept and tidied.
At that time he goes and brings with him seven other spirits, greater than himself in evil; and they enter and take residence there. And thus the condition of that man shall be worse in his latter state than in his first. So it shall come to pass with this generation of the present day, which is evil. 'The disciples of Jesus are his family.'
While Jesus was speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers came and stood outside. They requested to speak with him.
One of the people said to Jesus, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside and they want to talk to you."
Jesus answered, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"
Then he pointed with his hand to his disciples and said, "These are my mother and my brothers."
Because the one who works the will of my Father, who is in heaven, is my brother, my sister, and my mother.»
Like seeds.
On that day, Jesus left the house and sat on the shore of the lake.
Many people gathered around him. He climbed into a boat and sat in it, while the people stood on the shore.
And He said to them many things in parables. So He said to them, "A farmer went out to sow.
And as he sowed, some of the seeds fell by the wayside; thus were they found by birds, and consumed.
Some seeds fell on a rocky ground, where there was not enough soil, so the grains grew quickly because the soil was not deep.
But when the sun rose, it burned, and because it had no roots, it withered.
Some seeds fell on thorns. The thorns grew and stopped their growth.
And other seeds fell on the good ground; some of them produced a hundredfold, others sixtyfold, and others thirtyfold.
He who has ears, let him hear." Hearing and understanding.
And the disciples came to him and asked, "Why do you speak to them using allegorical examples?"
He answered them Jesus: "God has given you the privilege to know the mystery of the kingdom of heaven, but He has not given it to them."
Because everyone who possesses #WhoPossesses. 12:13 Perhaps it refers to 'Who Possesses Understanding.' Their provision will increase, and overflow; but that which does not possess, will have that which belongs to it, stripped from it.
That is why I speak to them with parables; for even though they see, they do not truly perceive. And even though they hear, they do not truly understand.
And so it falls to them, the Isaiah prophecy: "You will hear and hear, but you will not understand. You will see and see, but you will not perceive."
The following text has been translated into English, ready for printing: "Thus has the mind of this people become dull, and their hearing heavy. They have closed their eyes, so they are unable to observe with their eyes, or to hear with their ears, or to understand with their hearts, that they might not return to me and be healed. " Today, advanced technology and the vastness of the internet have transformed human connection. While these tools offer unprecedented opportunities for communication, collaboration, and access to information, they also present unique challenges. One of the most significant challenges is the potential for social isolation and a decline in genuine human connection. As individuals increasingly rely on digital interactions, there's a risk of losing the nuances of non-verbal communication, empathy, and the deeper emotional bonds formed through face-to-face interactions. Furthermore, the digital landscape is rife with misinformation, disinformation, and a range of other forms of content that can be misleading, biased, or outright false. Navigating this complex environment requires critical thinking skills, an awareness of the potential biases, and a commitment to seeking out and evaluating information from diverse and credible sources. The challenges posed by social media, online harassment, the spread of misinformation, and the potential for digital addiction and social isolation are complex and multifaceted. Addressing these challenges requires a multi-pronged approach that involves individuals, families, communities, educational institutions, technology companies, governments, and international organizations. The key lies in fostering digital literacy, critical thinking, and responsible online behavior from an early age. This includes teaching children and adults alike about the potential risks of online interactions, the importance of privacy and data protection, and the ethical considerations surrounding online content creation and consumption. Furthermore, there's a need for greater collaboration between various stakeholders, including educators, parents, technology companies, and regulatory bodies. This collaborative effort is crucial for developing effective strategies, sharing best practices, and addressing the evolving challenges of the digital age. In conclusion, while digital technologies offer immense opportunities for connection, learning, and innovation, they also present significant challenges related to social isolation, misinformation, online harassment, and the potential for digital addiction and social disruption. Navigating this complex landscape effectively requires a proactive, multi-faceted approach that addresses both the opportunities and the challenges presented by the digital age, focusing on fostering digital literacy, critical thinking, and responsible online behavior from an early age, recognizing the collaborative effort required between educators, parents, technology companies, and regulatory bodies to effectively navigate the complexities of the digital age and build a more connected, informed, and resilient future for all.
As for you, blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.
I say the truth to you, for many kings and righteous men have longed to see what you see, but they have not seen; and they have yearned to hear what you speak, but they have not heard. Meaning of like the seed
So listen to an explanation like seeds:
When someone hears the message of the Kingdom and does not understand it, evil comes. #Evil. 19:13 That is, the devil. (Also in Num. 38) And it takes the seed that was planted in its heart. This is what the seed that fell on the side of the road means.
As for the one that fell on the rocky ground, it is like someone who hears a word and immediately accepts it with joy.
But because it has no roots in itself, it endures for a short time; and when tribulation and persecution come because of the word that had come before, it soon loses its faith.
As for the one that fell among the thorns, it is like someone who hears a word, but the worries of life and the temptations of wealth choke the word, so it does not bear fruit.
As for the one who sows on good soil, it is he who hears the word and understands it, and it bears fruit, the thing itself. He gathers it up a hundredfold, a sixtiethfold, a thirtyfold. Like wheat and weeds.
And he told them this parable: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field."
But while the people slept, the man's enemy came and sowed weeds between the wheat. Then he went away.
And when the wheat sprouted and formed heads, the weeds sprouted as well.
And his servants came to him and said, "Master, did not you sow good seeds in your field? Then from where have these weeds come?" الشرح: This question tests the ability to accurately translate a given text into English, without adding any explanations.
Here is the translation of the text, as requested: ««فأجابهم الرجل: ‹عدوي فعل ذلك.› فسأله عبيده: ‹هل تريدنا أن نذهب ونقتلعها؟›
The man replied, "No, because when you pull out weeds, you might pull out wheat with them."
Let them grow together until harvest time, for then I will tell the harvesters: "Gather the weeds first, and bundle them for the fire. As for the wheat, gather it and place it in my storehouse." For example, mustard and yeast.
Then Jesus told them another parable: "It is like the ملكوت of heaven to a mustard seed. A man takes it and plants it in his field."
It is the smallest of seeds. Yet when it grows, it becomes the largest of all ornamentals, for it becomes a great tree, so that the birds of the sky come unto it, and they make their nests in its boughs.»
And He said to them another parable: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until the whole dough was fermented."
Jesus said all these things, using parables. And he did not speak to the people except in parables.
This is what God said through the Prophet: "I will open my mouth with proverbs, and I will utter things that have been hidden since the world began."
Then Jesus sent away the crowds and entered into the house. His disciples went up to Him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the grass that grows up alongside the grain."
He said to them, "The one who planted the good seeds is the son of the human being."
The field is the world, and the good seeds are they who have the kingdom. As for the weeds, they are they who belong to the wicked one.
The enemy who scattered them is Satan. The harvest is the end of the world. The harvesters are the angels.
And just as weeds are gathered and burned by fire, so too will the end of the world come to pass.
For the Son of Man will send out his angels, who will gather from his kingdom all who cause corruption and evil,
Then they throw them into the blazing oven. There people weep and gnash their teeth.
At that time, the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears to hear, let him hear. Such as a treasure, and a pearl.
The parable of the hidden treasure. A man found a treasure and buried it again. Overjoyed, he bought the very field in which the treasure was buried, and in which he himself would one day be buried, thereby ensuring the treasure's survival for all time.
«It resembles the realm of heaven like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls.
And when he found a very precious pearl, he went and sold everything he owned and bought it. Like a fishing net.
And the kingdom of heaven is like a net cast out upon the sea, and it catches fish of every kind.
When the nets were full, the fishermen pulled them onto the shore. Then they sat down and began selecting the good fish and putting it in baskets, while the poor quality fish they threw out.
This is what will happen at the end of the world, for the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous,
Then the wicked are thrown into the blazing oven. There people wail and gnash their teeth.»
Jesus asked his disciples, "Do you understand all these things?" They answered, "Yes."
He said to them, "Therefore every teacher of the law inherits the kingdom of heaven, and he is like a householder who brings out of the storeroom new things and old things." Jesus goes to his own town.
And when Jesus had finished recounting those parables, he left that place.
And when he went to his town, he began to teach them in their synagogue. And everyone was astonished, saying, "Where does this man come with such wisdom and such miracles?"
Is he not the son of the carpenter? Is she not his mother, Mary? Are his brothers Jacob, Joseph, Simeon, and Judah?
Why do all his sisters stay between us? So where did he get everything he has?
It was therefore an obstacle preventing them from accepting it. As for Jesus, He said to them: "No prophet is without dignity, except in his own country and in his own house!"
He did not perform many miracles there because of their lack of faith.
Herod the Great hears about Jesus.
At that time, Herod, the ruler of Galilee, heard #Galilee ruler. 1:14 Literally "the ruler of the quarter." The Romans had divided Palestine into four provinces, hence the ruler of each province is called the ruler of the quarter or the governor of the quarter. See the Gospel of Luke 3:1. About Jesus.
He told his servant, "It is John the Baptist, he has risen from the dead, and for this reason miracles are wrought by him!" The killing of John the Baptist
Herod is the one who arrested John and put him in prison, and this is because Herodias, his brother Philip's wife,
Because John told Herod, "You cannot take your brother's wife."
This is the translation of the provided text into English, as requested, without any additional explanations: لهذا كان هيرودس يريد قتله، ولكنه كان يخاف من الناس، لأنهم كانوا يعتبرون يوحنا نبيا.
But when the day came for Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before him and his guests, pleasing Herod very much,
Even, he promised and swore to give her whatever she asks for, no matter what.
But her mother had already taught her what to ask, so she said, "Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter."
The king was grieved, but he commanded that her request be met because of his oath, and out of respect for his guests.
He sent someone to cut off John's head while he was in prison.
Then he brought its head on a platter and gave it to her, and she gave it to her mother.
Then, John's disciples came, took his body, and buried it. Then, they went and told Jesus what had happened. Jesus feeds more than five thousand.
When Jesus heard about this, he got into a boat and went out to a solitary place. The crowds then heard about this, and they left their towns, traveling on foot, and they followed him.
And when it descended to the shore, it saw a great multitude, and was filled with compassion for them, and healed the sick among them.
And in the evening, his disciples came and said to him, "This place is secluded and the time is very late; so send the people away so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
But Jesus told them, "It is no need for them to go away; give them yourselves something for them to eat."
He said to his disciples, "We have nothing here except for five loaves of bread and two fish."
He said to them, Jesus said to them, "Bring her to me."
And he commanded the people to sit down on the grass. Then Jesus took the five loaves of bread and the two fish, and he thanked God, raising his eyes to the heavens. Then he divided them and gave the loaves of bread to his disciples, and they distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. They lifted the remaining food, which was twelve baskets filled with fragments.
The number of those who ate was five thousand men, not counting the women and children. Jesus walks on water.
Then Jesus asked his disciples to board the boat and precede him to the other side, while he would deliver the congregation.
And after he dismissed them, he went up to the mountain alone to pray. When evening came, there he was, alone.
The boat had become in the middle of the lake, and the waves were strongly impacting it, because the wind was contrary to the direction of the boat.
Shortly before daybreak, Jesus came to them, walking on the lake.
When his disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were filled with terror and said, "It is a ghost!" From their fear, they screamed.
He immediately told them, "Be of courage. It is I. Do not fear."
Peter replied, "Lord, if this is You, truly, then command me to come to You, walking on water."
He told him, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water towards Jesus.
But when Peter noticed the strong wind, he was afraid and began to sink. He cried out, "O Lord, save me."
Jesus immediately reached out and grasped him, saying, "Little faith, why did you doubt?"
When Jesus and Peter climbed into the boat, the wind stopped.
And those who were in the boat kneeled down and worshipped Jesus, saying, "You are truly the Son of God." Jesus heals many.
ولما they crossed, the lake, they arrived at a area of Gensart.
And knowing the people of that region were aware of Jesus, they proclaimed throughout the surrounding area the arrival of Jesus, and they brought all the sick persons to Him,
And they begged him to allow them to touch only the edge of his garment. And everyone who touched him received healing.
The law of God and the traditions of people.
At that time some Pharisees and teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to Jesus, and they asked Him:
Why are your students breaking the traditions we have inherited from our ancestors? They are not washing their hands before eating.
Jesus answered them, 'And why do you break the commandment of God through your traditions?'
God said, "Honor your father and your mother." #Honor…your mother. 4:15 From the Book of Exodus 20:12; and from the Book of Deuteronomy 5:16. And He said, "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." #Whoever curses…shall be put to death. 4:15 From the Book of Exodus 21:17.
But you say: "Whoever told his father or mother, 'I cannot help you, for all I possess has been dedicated to the Lord. He is under no obligation to honor his father or mother,'"
And thus you have disregarded God's commandment because of your traditions.
O hypocrites, Isaiah's words were true when he prophesied about you, saying:
This people magnify me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
Their worship is without benefit, for they know teachings that are not but human recommendations.
Jesus called the people to Himself and said to them, "Listen to me and understand what I am saying:"
What enters a human's mouth does not defile it, but rather what goes out of it; that defiles it."
Then the disciples came to him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees were upset when they heard your words?"
Jesus replied, "Every plant not rooted by my Father shall be uprooted from the earth."
Leave them, for they are blind guides leading the blind. And if one blind leader guides another, then both will fall into the pit."
Peter replied, «Explain to us the meaning of this parable.»
He then said, "Haven't you understood yet?"
Do you not understand that everything that enters the human mouth enters the stomach, and then exits from there?
But what comes out of a man's mouth, it comes out of his heart. And this is what contaminates a person.
Because it comes from the heart, evil thoughts, killing, immorality, adultery, theft, perjury, insult, come.
Here are the translations of the provided segments: **Segment 1:** هذه هي الأشياء التي تنجس الإنسان، أما الأكل بأيد غير مغسولة فلا يجعل الإنسان نجسا.» يسوع يساعد امرأة غريبة **Segment 2:** هذه هي الأشياء التي تنجس الإنسان، أما الأكل بأيد غير مغسولة فلا يجعل الإنسان نجسا.» يسوع يساعد امرأة غريبة **Segment 3:** هذه هي الأشياء التي تنجس الإنسان، أما الأكل بأيد غير مغسولة فلا يجعل الإنسان نجسا.» يسوع يساعد امرأة غريبة **Segment 4:** These are the things that defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not make a person unclean." Jesus helps a strange woman.
Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A woman of Canaan, who lived in that region, came to him. She began to scream, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, son of David. My daughter is possessed by an evil spirit, and she is suffering greatly."
Jesus did not answer her in any way. His disciples came to him and asked him, saying: "Cast her out from here, for she follows us and cries."
He said, "I have only sent to the lost sheep of the House of Israel."
But the woman approached him and prostrated herself before him, saying, "Oh Lord, help me."
Jesus answered her: "It is not good to take the food that belongs to children and to throw it for the dogs."
She said, "Indeed, Master, but even dogs eat from what falls from their owner's table."
Then Jesus answered her, "Woman, your faith is very great. Let it be granted to you what you desire." And at that moment, her daughter was healed. Jesus heals many.
Jesus left that place and went to an area near the Sea of Galilee. He went up to a hill and sat there.
Large crowds came to him, and they were joined by those who were lame, blind, paralyzed, deaf, and other numerous illnesses. They placed them at the feet of Jesus, and He healed them.
Crowds were astonished when they saw the deaf and the mute speaking, the lame walking, those who were paralyzed walking, and the blind seeing. Therefore, they praised the God of Israel. Jesus performed a miracle by feeding more than four thousand people.
He then called his disciples and said, "I have compassion for these people, for they have been with me for three days, and they have nothing with them to eat. Nor would I want to turn them out hungry, lest they faint in the roadway."
He said to his disciples, "From where will we get enough bread to feed this crowd in such a remote place?"
He said to them, Jesus, 'how many loaves do you have?'' They said to him, 'Seven loaves of bread and a little fish.'
Jesus told people to sit on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and they distributed them to everyone.
Everyone ate and was satisfied. Then they gathered what was left over from the bread, and it filled seven baskets.
The number of those who ate was four thousand men, not counting women and children.
And when Jesus had dispersed the crowds, He went up to a boat and went out to the region of Gadara.
The Jewish leaders are testing Jesus.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus to test him, and they asked him to show them a sign or a proof that God was supporting him.
Jesus answered them, 'When the sun has set, you will say, "It will be beautiful today, for the sky is red."'
In the early morning, you say, "Today will be windy, because the sky is red and overcast." You interpret weather signs well, but you do not understand the times in which you live!
This generation of evil and immorality is looking for proof in order to believe. And it will be given only the proof of Jonah." Then Jesus left them and went away from them. Lack of understanding.
And the disciples of Jesus crossed to the other side of the lake, but they forgot to bring bread.
And Jesus said to them, "Take careful heed and do not let any yeast of the Pharisees or of the Sadducees rise to life."
The disciples began to speak, saying to one another, "But we did not have bread!"
Jesus knew what they were saying, and He told them, "You who have little faith, why do you quarreling among yourselves because there is no bread?"
Did you not yet realize it? Do you not recall the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you filled from the broken pieces?
Do you not remember the seven loaves of the four thousand, and the baskets you collected from the broken pieces?
Why do you not understand that I was not speaking to you about ordinary bread, but rather was warning you so that you might protect yourselves from the leavened bread of the Pharisees and Sadducees.»
At that time, his disciples understood that he had not intended to warn them about the leaven of bread, but rather about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter declares that Jesus is the Messiah.
When Jesus came to the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who are saying the people I am, the Son of Man?"
He answered his disciples, 'Some say you are John the Baptist, others that you are Elijah, and others that you are Jeremiah, or a prophet like the prophets.'
He then said to them, "And you, in your opinion, who am I?"
Peter, you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
Blessed are you, Simon son of John, for the one who revealed this to you is not a human being, but rather is my Father in heaven.
And I tell you that you are Peter, #Peter. 18:16 From the Greek "petros," meaning "rock." And upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of the #Abyss. 18:16 That is, the power of death. You shall never be able to defeat it.
And I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven; and every ما تربطه on earth, God will surely link in heaven; and every ما تحله on earth, God will surely dissolve in heaven."
Then he strongly warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he is the Messiah. Jesus speaks of the inevitability of his death.
From that time onwards, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he should go to the city of Jerusalem, and that he should suffer many things from the elders, and from the high priests, and from the scribes. Moreover, he should be killed, and be laid in the third day.
As for Peter, he took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "God forbid, Lord! This shall not happen to you, never!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Be away from me, Satan! You are a stumbling block for me, for I do not care about God's affairs, but I do care about human affairs."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to come with me, he must deny himself and take up the cross given to him, and follow me."
He who wants to save his life will lose it. But he who loses his life for my sake will find it.
What does a man gain if he wins the whole world, but loses himself? And what can a man do to regain his life?
Because the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His own angels, and will reward each one according to his works.
I say the truth to you, for among those standing here are people who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his glory.»
Jesus, and with him Moses and Elijah.
Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and his brother John, and led them to a high mountain where they would be alone.
And while they were there, Jesus' appearance changed and he began to shine like the sun; his clothes became white, like light.
Suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared before the disciples, and they were speaking with Jesus.
He said to Jesus, "Master, how wonderful it is for us to be here! For if you please, I will set up three tents here; one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was speaking, a shining cloud overshadowed them, and from it came a voice saying, "This is my beloved son, in whom my great delight is." And they listened.
When the disciples heard that, they were terrified and fell to the ground on their faces.
Jesus approached and touched them, saying, "Rise, do not fear."
And when they looked around, they saw no one but Jesus.
While they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them these instructions and said, "Don't tell anyone about what you have seen until the Son of Man is raised from the dead."
And his disciples asked him, "Why do the teachers of the Law say that Elijah must come first?" #Elijah … First. 10:17 Elijah was one of God's prophets around the year 850 BCE. The Jews expected his coming based on Malachi 4: 5-6.
Jesus answered them: "Yes, Elijah is coming to bring all things to their original."
But I tell you, Elijah has come, and the people did not know him; yet they did him as they pleased. And the Son of Man also will receive the same treatment from them.»
Then his disciples understood that he was speaking about John the Baptist. Jesus expels a spirit of evil from a boy.
And when they returned to the assembly, a man came up to Jesus and prostrated himself before him.
And he said, "Have mercy on my son, O Lord, for he is afflicted with epilepsy and suffers greatly. Frequently he falls into the fire or into the water.
And I have brought him to your disciples, but they have been unable to heal him."
Jesus said, "Foolish, unfaithful generation, how long have I been with you, how long must I put up with you? Then Jesus said to the man, "Bring your son to me."
Jesus told the evil spirit to leave him, and the boy was healed immediately.
Then his disciples came to him alone and asked him, "Why was it not possible for us to expel him?"
He answered them Jesus, saying, "With your little faith. I tell you the truth, even if your faith were the size of a mustard seed, you would be able to tell this mountain, 'Get over there to the other side, and it will.' Nothing will be impossible for you." And He said to them, "When I look out upon the cities and the people, I feel a sense of pity for them, for they are like sheep without a shepherd. They are scattered about, like thorns that have been pulled out, yet they remain sharp and dangerous. They are like dry branches, broken and useless, yet they are still a potential source of harm. They are like a dark cloud, heavy with sorrow and despair, yet it casts a long and ominous shadow. They are like a deep and unfathomable ocean, full of unknown wonders and terrifying depths, yet it is a vast and unyielding force. They are like a wild and untamed fire, consuming everything in its path, yet it is a destructive and ungovernable force. They are like a deep and abiding sorrow, a persistent and unyielding grief, yet it is a heavy and burdensome burden. They are like a deep and unfathomable sorrow, a persistent and unyielding grief, yet it casts a long and ominous shadow.
But this type does not come out except through prayer and fasting." Jesus foretells the approaching of his death
And as they traveled through Galilee together, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is about to be made subject to the authority of the people."
And they will kill him. But on the third day he will rise from the dead.» So the disciples were deeply saddened. The tax on the temple
When Jesus entered Capernaum, he came to Peter, who was collecting the tax of two half-shekels for the temple, and asked him, "Doesn't your teacher pay the tax of two half-shekels?"
He answered them, Peter: "Yes, he will." Then Peter went into the house. Immediately Jesus spoke to him and said: "Tell me, Simon, from whom do the kings collect tribute and taxes? Do they collect them from their own people, or from other peoples?" A Voice spoke from above, saying: "Sir, Jonah, the prophet, went to the city of Nineveh and preached to the inhabitants there. And as a result of his preaching, Nineveh turned from an evil land to a just one. They, the inhabitants of Nineveh, who had rejected Jonah's preaching, now sent him with a prayer, saying: `Our Lord, the God of all, the sovereign Lord, who gives life and death, who wills and commands, who has mercy and forgiveness, who is omniscient, who is merciful, who is gracious, who is slow to anger, who is filled with love, who perfectly delights in himself, who is the source of all good, who is the ruler of all, who is the glory of all, who is the beauty of all, who is the strength of all, who is the beauty of all, who is the strength of all, who is the ruler of all, who is the source of all life, who is the glory of all, who is the beauty of all, who is the strength of all, who is the ruler of all, who is the source of all good, who is the glory of all, who is the beauty of all, who is the strength of all, who is the ruler of all, who is the source of all life, who is the glory of all, who is the beauty of all, who is the strength of all, who is the ruler of all, who is the source of all life, who is the glory of all, who is the beauty of all, who is the strength of all, who is the ruler of all, who is the source of all life, who is the glory of all, who is the beauty of all, who is the strength of all, who is the ruler of all, who is the source of all life, who is the glory of all, who is the beauty of all, who is the strength of all, who is the ruler of all, who is the source of all life, who is the glory of all, who is the beauty of all, who is the strength of all, who is the ruler of all, who is the source of all life, who is the glory of all, who is the beauty of all, who is the strength of all, who is the ruler of all, who is the source of all life, who is the glory of all, who is the beauty of all, who is the strength of all, who is the ruler of all, who is the source of all life, who is the glory of all, who is the beauty of all, who is the strength of all, who is the ruler of all, who is the source of all life, who is the glory of all, who is the beauty of all, who is the strength of all, who is the ruler of all, who is the source of all life, who is the glory of all, who is the beauty of all, who is the strength of all, who is the ruler of all, who is the source of all life, who is the glory of all, who is the beauty of all, who is the strength of all, who is the ruler of all, who is the source of all life, who is the glory of all, who is the beauty of all, who is the strength of all, who is the ruler of all. Who is the source of all life, who is the glory of all, who is the beauty of all, who is the strength of all, who is the ruler of all. Who is the source of all life, who is the glory of all, who is the beauty of all, who is the strength of all, who is the ruler of all. Who is the source of all life, who is the glory of all, who is the beauty of all, who is the strength of all, who is the ruler of all. Who
He replied, 'They are collecting it from all the nations.' Jesus said, 'So the sons are exempt from it.'
But so that we do not cause them a problem, go to the lake, and cast a fishing line. Then, take the first fish you catch, and open its mouth. You will find a coin four drachms in it. Take it, and give it to them from me and you."
