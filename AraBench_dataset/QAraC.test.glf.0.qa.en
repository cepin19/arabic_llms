If you do not want, I want
Oh!  Sultan, what are you saying
That's a shame! It's an opportunity that we all shall not miss.
Also, I am not interfering. It is my right to take, and you actually have the right to take before me.
Sultan, God bless your parents, don't bring us troubles.
Saleh, donít be a....., May God forgive me!
For God's sake, is there a brother that advises his brother with what you are saying?
If you were hungry
And you found a big feast
The feast doesn't belong to anyone
Say that to yourself
This feast wonít be there in front of us again
Don't be odd Oh!  Saleh
And take the opportunity away from us
No no no no, don't try to convince me, that's impossible, impossible, I don't do that
The problem is that he is afraid
Afraid of what?
This is a governmental project! Everyone takes
That's the rule!
Even the people who are not participating take advantage of it.
and he's the chairman of a huge project
This means that he is in control.
The Third Millennium International Beaches, more specifically, the first stage of the infrastructure
Such an idiot
That's where we can loot!
If he refuses to take
Who gave you the right?
You don't have the right to take advantage of it
When his car was not working
Who used to drop him at the project site? Wasn't it me?
No, If that's the case, you have the right
Who gives you the money to fuel your car four and five times!
Leave it to me
Don't be foolish and be stubborn
Take some benefit
Look at uncle Khamees
And now as you say they call him a millionaire
One third of the project,
The other third is commission,
The one who plays in a folk band,
They say that there was a national celebration,
and bought one hundred lanterns
You know what they did
added the zero.
There is no point, Oh!  aunt
No, God will guide him if He wills
let us eat with him,
I spent yesterday's night trying to convince him.
It's an opportunity.
for the good to prevail.
And if God wills, the good will prevail.
This is common.
keep it between us.
Don't talk to anyone about it.
Do we need to be worried?
But my friends
A pain in the neck.
The man started to change his mind.
I talked to him today
Morning for two hours.
He started to get convinced.
That we have a meeting with him in a while.
And we have to persuade him.
He's cutting off our benefit.
They truly drove him to change his mind in the meeting.
Brother Ali, Brother Othman.
I don't know .
As today is my first day of work.
Count on me
How can you not get!
Sure. But are you sure I will get some?
I want to ask you
If you are hungry and walking in the street
Would you eat or not?
I'm a person who eats a lot
Don't worry
The plate is large.
We are still working on the initial article of the meeting.
If you are not well,
If you have any concerns
What I really want to know
from the project.
May God guide you Oh! Saleh
That's reasonable because you are a chairman for the first time of your life,
It's very simple.
we will include our share
in the project's budget!?
What do you think?
so nobody suspects what we are up to
to put our share as a separate article!
This amount of money has been looted
by the people in charge of the project.
Cannot be
No no no Oh! Saleh!
You know how these things happen.
But it seems that you have some fears.
It's their right
First and foremost,
Everything is in our hands.
I told you he is lying.
What's wrong with you?
He says the new car belongs to his friend and you are believing him.
He said that!
Let's say it is his friend's car.
In a very special location also!
Except for a very wealthy man.
I didn't hear that from the people,
told me he bought him the land and recorded it by his name
He said please
He has the money now.
now he will start to lie
Aren't we his family?
That's it?
We won't get anything?
We will end up getting nothing!
he wants to eat it alone, a bite
don't nod your head!
neither is your brother
Sit down and everything is going to be alright
I talked with him for the whole night.
I told him that no matter what, they are your relatives.
and he finally agreed.
This is how things are supposed to be.
and hopefully you won't only get it once
This is the Third Millennium International Beaches.
, more specifically, the infrastructure.
Later on they will start with stage two,
and you will continue with him.
May God reward you with good.
It's good that you pushed him to agree.
You are no different than them.
But, never mind.
I hope you explained to him.
We want a percentage
They are all taking percentage.
He even said after I convinced him
want their friends to attend meeting for setting the project budget
They have to follow up, it's their money.
we set and we're sure of it,
submit it as soon as possible to be approved.
Take your time.
Who is this? do you know him?
He is my brother in law participating with me.
Do you mean he is
are responsible for doors, windows and everything related to finishing up.
Good, good
how much do you want, so we can finish?
How much you will get?
is that we take the money
Let us give ourselves a week to think
and determine the amount of money that we'll get.
have people who are waiting and want some
Abdulaziz is right.
if someone decided to take half a million,
During this week everybody will think carefully
and specify the amount they want.
by next week, they will be making their minds and determining how much they want.
it is not up to you
then , it is up to you?
Ignore him
Hey friend, what is it? what's wrong with him?
I don't know what he is doing here
Hey! who invited you to this project?
It's a government project
Saleh, is your brother's name is Sultan!
This is our neighbor's driver.
sometimes he drives us when our car is not working.
Write down.
Sanad Abdulla.
No no, there are three more people.
What else can I do, I am tired of him.
I said to him enough Oh! man, let's propose the budget and finish.
No no, this one will take an amount of money.
How much shall I put for him?
Poor him, does he have any children!
yes he has, let it be twenty five thousands and four hundred
and four hundred
They're adding him by force.
How much are you going to give them!
%pw this is too much.
This is my mother, just as we were just talking about her
yes, mom.
Yes, no no no, this is the last one Oh! my son
No Oh! my son, she wants to go to Thailand for treatment.
Wait, wait, what's wrong?
Why are you upset
just from the first stage, the Infrastructure specifically.

Add three thousand

Did you add her
Yes Mommy.
No mom I've added her, just wanted to check the name
My dear, mom
Let's enlarge the feast

Tomorrow is the last meeting and everyone should determine the amount of money they want
I've got this

It's too much darling
Oh! Guys, Oh! guyes , wait , it is noisey , give us a chance
The committee is in a meeting now to approve the  budget of the project, money issues are not to discuss now, that's it
I want more
We told you don't embarass us, we are in the yard of the ministry.

If anyone came and asked what's wrong with you all here
We will say to him that the electricity is down or shocked
Don't make noise is the ministry yard

This is the first stage
more specifically, the infrastructure
It's for the coming generations
Sure and on the behalf of our program staff we would like to greet and congratulate you for the opening of the project which is going to be tomorrow as far as I know

One year and a half
Once again, on behalf of Future Accomplishments program,
This project

May Good keep the bless of oil upon us
a second, third and tenth stage.
the representative
Welcome aboard
Why did they gathered us here, when are the cars coming to take us
What? To where they should take us?
Thank God, you grew old and became senile
let us sit down, the sun is hot
yes, kind girl
But I don't see anything
anything except sea
Why did they depose you
Eman told me that my sister Moneera is here
about my father's land in the desert
I wondered who lied to her and gave her false information
It's not that land
you saw a farm in the desert and thought It's your father's
Besides, why do you ask about these things
You have brothers,
who work hard and invest the land, real estate, companies and make effort
free from headaches.
I'm disappointed in you Oh! Eman
and also, sister
How come you don't know
They have to give it to me
They are your brothers
and there is nothing better than the truth
because money
now we aid her and drive her to the hospital.
I don't know how many years she spent fighting with her brothers at courts
nine ten year, if not more.
No but
Um Salmeen's brothers are thieves
poor her, she was telling me yesterday that
she wants to build a mosque before she dies
you don't know
I'm not saying that your brothers are like hers, hopefully not.
How many years now since my father died
why is she asking now
and she saw the farm
What else does she want
Isn't the check paid to her every three months
Saqr, calm down, let's understand the story first
It's not up to her
If it was somebody else, his sisters won't even get a Riyal
I've got it
From where
as if it's not my money
see what, Moonera
Please look at him
It becomes fifty thousands
Because I had the courage and asked about my father's land, the one in the desert
I'm sure that my share is more than that
Each one is living in such a villa
, their kids are in the best schools,
What can I say, Oh! Moneera
I won't stop fighting for my right
I will take my right
better we invest your money in the company! No thanks
Everyone fights with the other
people have no mercy anymore
Don't think that your brothers will be better than mine
look at me
twenty years
I used to go to court frequently
and at the end
I didn't get anything out of it
Why are they doing that
That's why I'm telling you Oh! darling, be nice with them
act kindly towards them
and you'll get tired of them
and why do courts take so long
We are four hundred thousand all.
If we reached million like the other countries
I really doubt, Oh! my dear, that a command will be issued
Look at my brothers
I swear I don't want all that
What can I say, Oh! dear
I can only say God alone is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs for us
God is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs for us
Didn't you have a court session last week?
As usual, Oh! my dear
The judge asked us to write a Memorandum
We've been through this many times.
my dear, they will be investing millions, you will be just watching them
and as I told you, you will be tired of courts
and won't take your right
That's why I'm telling you, if I were you
I'll be satisfied with what they give me.
because the woman
we don't owe you anything
Men are asking you!
She has some
Just some questions regarding her share and
She just want to know something and go
If you can't find it
I will drag you, and show it to you
He will find his way
you signed on a giving up document
Two hundred and fifty and it's even more than enough for her, her husband is working
take it or forget it
why is she requesting now
But he's covetous
as if it's not my right
it's my father's inheritance , and he want to decide how much should I take, take it or leave it
It's not for me or him to decide
This is God's command
Why are they torturing my father in his grave
I wasn't expecting that from them
It's because of money
opened thirty years ago,
I don't know what to do, Oh! Nasser
Lands, buildings and real-estate are easy to figure out
I don't know how much do they get
Even the company,
It's your right to go and ask about everything
and I won't leave them alone
how are you going to go back to them
It's not up to you
and it's not up to you either, I have the right to know everything
* *
Your sister gave him the power of attorney
that allows him to inspect about everything in the company
Saqr, Saad
He's yelling at us
Saqr, enough
Brother Nasser
Excuse me, I will take
Yes sir
You go away, now
excuse me, go
Don't give him a reason to attack us
Now, if he went and claimed against us,
and he said that you beat him up
So, do we let him do whatever he want!
has an official document
official! we cannot stop him
It's his legal right to inspect everything
If he had a look at the budget and the accounts
We give her forty thousands every three months
If he checked out the budget,
multiply twelve by eight
divide it on three
thirty two
You know how much
That's how much we owe her
excluding the lands and projects
We are free to do whatever we want
we have nothing to be afraid of, we don't get afraid
If he disagree, this is what we got, if he agree, then welcome
let them go and deal with it
They just give their sisters enough money to live with
she is married
she has a husband to rely on
what does she want to do with money
This is what it's supposed to be from the beginning
yes boss
as he likes
Even my office
Brother Rashid, this was supposed to happen earlier
As you like sir
file by file
when she knew her actual inheritance,
, villas, and lands that she didn't know about
they turned out to be seven
they turned out to be sixteen
She didn't know
poor she was shocked
it's not fair
don't leave them alone
Please Oh! my son I don't want to hear about courts
The more you are concerned,
the less the judge is
for half a mintue
and then will say his usual phrase,
to the seventh, fourth, two thousandth, I don't know how much
They'll be very glad my son
you are not supposed to leave your bed at all Oh! mother
May God heal you,
No no, feel free to come
*Nasor* and my sister *Manoor*
After we slammed the door and kicked him out of the company
He's sending one of my colleges from school days.
He's called Abdulla
and now
I will not allow him
I mean can he influence them
Hopefully he will
Yes yes yes
Don't depend on judiciary
Courts do nothing but reports
Postponements and fights, useless lawyers
Years pass
and age passes
and you wont get a one Riyal
May God have mercy on Um Salmeen
She advised me a day before she died
never go to courts
He said our courts
she died without taking any of her inheritance
She died and the judge still has not solved her case
What if we were like the other countries,
Hi Abdulla
Brother Abdulla
Years passed
This is my brother, Saad.
May you grow in grace
The most important thing
is brotherhood
Brother Rashid
you are a brother to me
Don't let the money issues and
Do you something else to talk about other than my sister
Excuse me
Why should I ask him to stop talking
he's right
They don't even want me to get my share of my father's inheritance
My mother told me yesterday that my brother's ,Saad, wife
Her father is a messenger in the ministry
All of it from my father's money
We were waiting for so long,
we'll try for the last time.
You sent them your friend, Abdulla
They didn't respect him and even kicked him out.
Let's see what sheikh Abdulrahman will do
He's such as kind man
He said sure Nasser
*Don't worry*
intimidate them with law
Did you forget what poor Um Salmeen said about courts
Maybe Um Salmeen's brothers do not fear courts
but my brothers
might be afraid of gossips
they might be ashamed of going to the court
that we wait and see what's going to happen after sheikh Abdulrahman visits them
God bless you
Is that a Friday sermon
If you don't have, get out
What are you saying, Oh! my son?
He's saying the truth
Go away, %pw go
I'm going to the court tomorrow morning
and why do I have to pospone till after tomorrow
I'm the one who decide, not you
What is going to happen if I waited till the day after tomorrow
Hello my brother Rashid
this is a promise
I told you before
let's intimidate them with law
Now, he's begging me to postpone going to the court
Because they knew you are serious about it darling
It's important that we visit your sister Muneera
What is this
oh you asked me what is this , this is
God bless you all
is a small model of the courts building
May God bless you
and all of you
bless you
Didn't you say
told you to not go today
and postpone it till after tomorrow
to %pw get that sample this %pw of the court building
ready for you to show you the way
you enter from that door, this one
When you enter from the door,
you put there all your stuff,
mobile and anything metallic so that it doesnít make sounds beep beep beep beep beep
You register the case, they will ask you to go to the eighth floor, one two three four five six seven eight elevator you go
go around the offices
See the judge, if you really need a particular judge for example
Also, these
want to sue us,
we are here to show her the way
We'll see when you are going to take your right
either you take the six thousands
As he said
good bye
we'll have dinner today at my sister's house
Oh, did the ministry approved his project?
My sister told me that he was extremely happy , he did not believe it
He said if they approved the project, I will invite you to a dinner in my home
Thanks God, luck comes in pairs
How happy you are, Oh! Bu Waleed
Lucky him
My sister told me  he was so happy that he could not sleep yesterday

It's a shame they look like wise men where they are not,
They do nothing useful
Do they do anything? at all!
They don't move a chair without BuFahad's permission
that the manager didn't ask about you yesterday
People's issues are pending
It seems that you are going to them today as well
I'm in a trouble

Don't pull us
right in the brain, in the brain
How will you manage to speak
Give it to me, let's see who is calling
Mr. Bu Waleed
I'm calling you because I feel bad for you
Be on standby mode

I used to go from a ministry to another
I run from one ministry to the other,
finishing my children's papers

My children are in good positions at work
and they're busy all the time, what can I do
there are meetings everday, either with the manager, or with the chairman or with the minister
They have good jobs, once they are needed they have to be there, its work %pw

I'm coming now. May God reward you
Coming now, good bye
excuse me now, Oh! Oh! Bu Shaheen
They called me and said that it's ready
If you send your father tomorrow to finish your work,
If so, I will be late to work
Fear your God
It's impossible, especially tomorrow, I cant
it's because he loves you
although he's upset and tired from your misbehavior with him
You're even not respecting his age
He's worn out and sleeping in his room for two days
because of going around streets in the sun heat
Let him give you the papers,
and go right away to finish it
A committee, starts from early morning till the afternoon
Did you hear that, mom
Do you want my building construction to be delayed?
Since you have a deadline and a comitte tomorrow,
your papers have to be done tomorrow
from them at night
He has a committee tomorrow, he ought to be there
Whats wrong sir
holding back his tears
In fact I didn't lie on my father,
the committee changed their minds
and said they will come by the end of the week
Ok why didn't you tell him
Oh! father don't go
I will go because the committee didn't come
Instead of sitting in the cafeteria with those girls
You tricked him
ok enough
I will apologize
i will
thank you
Oh! father, Khalood is
he is mistaken
and selfish also
when he knew that the committee will not come
We are blessed by you
and from now on, Oh! father

stay at home
Let me kiss you on your head
Welcome, welcome Oh! my son
Good morning
Oh! my dearest father

I'm sorry sister
they call it Dawri and Kass
he talked about the game refree
he started talking nonsense
and they gave him a nickname which is stop corruption
People started to instigate him
and bring him some prattles to say it on tv and radio
and also
They put him in jail
Believe it or not sister,
In these days, everyone cares about themselves only
Why is he looking for troubles
Now, I will never ever,
let him speak, and say his famous quote"stop corruption"
Thanks God that he's fine
we are blessed by your coming

After many attempts he finaly calmed down
but next time he wll pull you to the court to divorce his daughter
ok mother
I promised you

I told you I will not
Excuse me, I have to go now
I'll tell you but keep it down,
The manager told me that
he dosn't want you to work here
cause you might talk about the administration
and start getting us into troubles
How is the manager going to hustify that decision
He has millions of excuses to say
where am I going!
Areyou serious, resign
What did I told you before
Hello, yes
Good bye
I told you
You know, because of public interest
we have to reduce the number of messengers in the ministry
you are right, but
Please, just one time, tell us "stop corruption"
It's cool

True, yes
you're still here!
we have work to do
it's a disaster
Until this issue is solved
What did I tell you?
I told you they're going to fire him
and Moneera wes standing here and she heared me saying that
Yes father you did
i heard them myself saying that
please go, let me talk with your father alone
Let me talk with your father
He entered the jail, we considered that a slip and we forgave him
we can't forgive him after being fired
Just because we are relatives,
You hear that
Calm down
Hopfully, everything is going to be fine
May God guide you to the right path
I didn't come to drink coffee
I know you
I feel bored
your uncle gave you two weeks
I swear he will take you by force to the court to divorce his daughter
Even If I go out,
why do you wan't to get in troubles

Even if someone asked you,
ignore him
Isn't he stop corruption guy
Yes man, he is
He seems not ell these days
We want to hear it, at least once, please let us hear that
No, it's ok
are you police men?
No no, mother, you didn't get it
and asked him to talk on a radio program about a problem that my cousin faced
He was hesitant
We felt that he was hesitant becaused we talked to him in public
So I sugested to my cousin that we go to his house and talk to him alone
Did you feel that he's agreeing
He was hesitant
and go away
Enough enough enough
I will be upset and will not talk to you for ever, you hear that
Are you saleh Saad,

my sister, Aisha, has divorced yesterday
i'm responsible for them now
I have a huge responsibility now,
I don't know what to do

but I didn't feel it's the right thing to do
that I'm afraid that this guy will take my place

But I want that to be done in a way that it does not affect me
I am thinking of a way to get red of him

What did you say on the radio yesterday
MomI want candy
No candy until the dinner
So, no candy
why is your shirt teared off
Mom we where playing, me and adol
I know you were playing
but what teared off you shirt
God is the sufficient for you, Oh! Adol
Come and see what your vicious nephew did
that I told you It's expensive, we don't need to buy it and you said never mind, it's going to look good on Waleed
See what he has done
the shirt is unuseable now
that's why he's not affraid, no one is stoping him
Mom where is the candy
see how he intended to tear it off, it's clear this as intentoinal
poor Waleed
He was happy wearing this shirt for the first time
He will see
where is Adol
In the garden
Why, what happened
something between me and him
Don't tear it
have some shame
Don't argue with a child
A child should not left to do whatever he wants
him unreformed
Don't ask me to watch my words
are you a reformer
we will raise them
behave your self
don't argue with him
why are fighting like children
Keep yourself out of this mother
don't interfer
tell him to raise his children well
He's a child
You can't diffrenciate between a child and a adult, because your mad
You know
It's not your fault
Let's go upstairs
They don't deserve
wasting our time in replying to them
one should not
where people used to love each other
ok ok i'm coming, god bye, good bye
But, sir, some pepers have to be signed by you, the minister wants to see them
Ok ok, I will talk to the minister, don't bother
Did you see the disaster, the catastrophe
it's new, no Oh! Aisha
This is not a child act
You are right
He ruined the clothes
look, look
This is unwearable
look at adol's pants, he can wear one leg, the other one will be uncovered
It's obvious that this is ont teared off by hands
It looks like it's teared using an electric saw
I can only say God is our sufficient for us
I'll tell you

If you know, take a round around the villa
I love you, not just because you know how to ride the bicycle,
also because something else
You say the truth right

Who teared our clothes off in the closet
how did your father cut them
He has a big scissors that even cuts the car
inder the bed, take all the candies
Not to that extent,
no one elso could do such thing
Why do we have to be silent
The most important thing
is that we insist on what we say
Who teared the clothes off, Waleed is a child
Which computer?
What is he talking about
Those cracks are impossible for a child to make
Why don't you believe me
Go find your friends
Give me a second

A child is born,
When a child is born,

I will not leave him
He talks in very formal Arabic language, just like one spoken in museums
Ignore him
He will knok knok until he gets tired and go

He's mad because I broke the compuer

Yes, and it's not the first time i see him
and I noticed he never take his eyes off you, *
He's not enrolled in buisness class,
but he's attending the class with us since a week ago
It's obvious that he's dying to get to know you
Don't be since he likes you that much, don't be very self-restrained
No, sister
I don't want him to think that I'm easy
I ran after him
let's let it go ordinary
Now he's running after you, dying to know you
It's true that I too like him
but, I don't feel it's the right time
One hundered precent
she look at you and *
Afe you waiting for her to come and say"Excuse me, can I introduce myself"
take the initiative
You are right
but I'm waiting for the right oppurtunity
the right oppurtunity
What do wait, you're enrolled with her in the same class
what did the teacher said
Ask her please, miss
oh, what is her name?
we are exchanging glances since three months
but never get to know eachother
You are too old
Which means that you should go and say "Pardon,
Can I get to know you
Not to that extent
I have to wait for the right chance
a calm and polite girl
I don't know what you're looking for
We finished shooting all the episodes yesterday

So long as I'm free

Even the car's key
I will leave you in this Titanic atmosphere
See you
Good bye

I just know that you are Waleed
Waleed Rashid Abdulla
Sure when hearing your father's name, many people will think that you are the son of the famous actor
The same name, God's willing
In fact, my father is Rashid Abdulla, the actor
Rashid Abdulla, the well known actor, is your father?
You're eating biscuits! why didn't you had your dinner with them

Lucky you, he brought you a sheep, your new villa gift
He proved he's a good neighbor
Hello Saleh, any thing new?
In fact, we have so many names
They told me, Oh! Bu Saad, may God bles you, that my name is in (the list)
This will be determined according to the need and experience of the employess
We don't know
We might not move you
You have to excuse me, I will not be able to do anyting for you

We wanted to move and settle first, and then when God bless us with money, we'll buy funiture
You did the right thing

Don't consider me a stranger
Anthing you need,

Neighbors are for each other's help(Idiom)
But now I heared and saw it

So, I'll go with you
Don't worry Oh! sister,
Whenever you want to choose the furniture, tell me
darling, your father applied for a loan, If approved, we will change the whole furniture
and I'm repeating it again,
Do not hesitate to ask me anything
We are like a family now
Can't your sister study without your help
But I want her to depend on herself
I'm sure you were talking to her!
Do you want me to lie and say it was my friend
Oh! son, Oh! ali

As long as she loves me, and I love her, I will solve the issue
You are dreaming

and this car is always breaking down
Your daughter is our daughter
Never mind
No need to bother yourself, Oh! brother Oh! rashid
No may God bless you
The car is parked in the house yard, and the driver is sitting without work
It seems that the development bank bought you a house and a car
It's not our car
our neighbor's car, Rashid Abdulla
I see relationships are developing
we will discuss things of a mutual interest that are of the two parties advantage
Oh, this is a very huge development
Let's go
Mom, it's emberrassing
She didn't agree
She said Noora is like my daughter, and the driver will drive her to the university everyday
Did you tell her that my father's car will be under maintenance for a week
I swear, no
She said the driver is going to drive her every morning
God witness, Oh! Um Ali
they are kind people
No no no Oh! man
There is no initiative or capability except from God
what a trouble, what a trouble, what am I doing now
What can I do, I have responsibilities
Who is going drive my daughter to the University
Oh! Bu Ali, as long as you have been referred to me by Mr. Rashid abdulla
we can't reject your request
Bu Saad, Bu Saad
I'm sorry Bu Saad
Bu Ali knows how much we love him
Thank you, may God reward you well, Oh! Bu Saad
They love you, God willing
This one is nice
Oh! people, Mr. Rashid is busy, let him go
Pardon, Pardon, Mr. Rashid, if we wasted your time
No problem
Lucky you, you have good conections
We are your friends and brothers, take care of us when we need something
just tell me where do you want him, I will bring him for you*
What happened, what's wrong, why are you pulling me
you are going to propose Manal to me
they agreed mother, they agreed
Manal talked to hermother about me
Why are you not believing
Um Waleed

I don't understand
May Waleed get marry soon as well, the apple of my eyes
She called me, poor she
She's taking some accessories
Not accessories! Jewleries
Is this my mother
She will also go by a chic vehicle
God willing, God willing
God willing, I cant stare at you
That's very kind of Um Walled
In addition to all that, she gave you the car
with the driver
If I went with you with this look, they won't believe that this worn out man is thos queen's husband
Oh my God
Are you going with this clothes
what! no no no no no, don't worry
I will change my look, you wil not be able to recognize me
They will be suprised thinking that I am a Sheikh
Bring coffee for him, may he live long
Bu Ali, I really didn't recognize you, I thought it's someone VIP, not Bu Ali, You are not Bu Ali
What do you think?
You have even a different walk
May God bless you, the people we are going to propose to Ali for them
are VIPs
I arranged everything from Igal(Headwear) to car,
I am sure I will find it with you
In the lastest serial, that you acted in
There was an act, as I remember, a wedding
You were wearing a shiney black Bisht
and I also want you to teach me how to wear Bisht
Because, God bless you, I never wear Bisht in my life
God willing, you look great
like this, so that when you enter the guest room
This is not right
My brother, Rashid,
Do you have cufflinks
Good Afternoon
The one who's always with me and Kholod
That's why
hat you are my baby
We are family now
and we don't want our daughter, Noora, to be apart from us
Noora suits Waleed
He said to me that he sees her in the university, and wont find a better spouse than her
We are blessed by this
I will inform her father, and may God please us with what's good
Why did they reject him, for what reason
because is father is an actor
ask your father to come
quickly, tell him Rashid want to see you
Where are you Oh!
I'm yelling out of sorrow
because his father is an actor
you have no shame
I am an actor
yet, I act honesty
I act on stage for few ours and my part is comes to an end
when acting is over
You are playing roles
I act
I convey a useful vision
But you
I wear costumes to play roles,
on stage
but you
you wore it in guest rooms
the rich and wealthy woman role
who is the actor?
Who is the real actor
Don't be sad Oh! Waleed
Raise your head
It's a dishonor
You 've missed the scene
I heared her yelling at him, don't turn your head, don't turn your head, poor him, he broke my heart
and walking straight
just like a hourse
it's him khamees, Oh! man, Khamees
It's Khamees
His wife is insane
she is jealous of other women
that's why he's walking like this
so that he dosn't see women, and no woman can see him
You see how his wife is driving him crazy
Straight, don't turn your face
I will show him up in the office tomorrow
Khamees, please, please, show them the city center look
Khamees, show me the city center look
Isn't your wife call it city center look
come on Khamees
I will go to see what deos salem want
poor him
When are you going to change!
If you just hear what they say about you
Even in front of me, they say more than that
Why is she doing that
she is jealous of womenbeing aound me
Why would she be that jealous
that when I sometimes sit in front of the TV
It's her, her
I swear by God
No no, it's ok
Hello, peace be upon you sister
You see that,
I talked to her just now, in front of you, she heared a man's voice
I swear, sometimes she throws my clothes on te street
Have some respect to yourself and divorce her
I find it difficult to divorce her
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't come clposer to me, stay there
What's in your mind!
Nothing bad
who are you talking to
you are spending time with thse useless people
especially this fat guy, he's the most one I hate among your friends
the one who have chubby cheeks and his hair is like baby plants
That rude has no shame
You want to torture me in my grave
let me talk with her
tell me, what's up with you
who are you talkng to!
I can't see anybody here
Salem, what's wrong! what happened!
Our friend Khamees gone crazy
after a while, he faced the wall and started talking to himself
He cracked up
Khamees is a poor man
He always visualize his mother, and imagine that's he's talking to her
God is the sufficient for his wife
They say Khamees is with you
He's busy now, having an international call, very far one, even the cal is dropping
What does the letter say
May God help you Oh! Khamees
Why are you awake!
I'm sleepless, I can't sleep
regarding tomorrow's meeting
with the famale delegation in the ministry
Is it possible if they
May God guide you, Oh! Khamees
these names are selected my the office of his excellency, the minister's office
But, come on
Why are you afraid of her
If you were talking to salem, why would you hine then!
say the truth
Why are you hiding behind the water tank then
Just like that
You saw the last dailed number, read, it's with you
The last numer!
You dailed the last number after deleting the number of the woman you were talking to
tell me, what's her name!
i told you, I told you, I told you
I told her I was talking to Salem
my friend at work, Saloom
she didn't believe me

I swear Oh! brother she didn't let me change my clothes
who do you want me to call!

You help eachother
You men are always like that
you're just like him, a liar, I will show you
If you intervene in again, I will go to the office of the minister
She cursed me
and threatened me that she'll complain about me at the minister's office
She is really brave
she's planing to ruin my career life
It's my fault I listened to you and called her
Listen Oh! Khamees
I she complained abou me at the minister's office
you will come with me and say the complete truth, keep me out of this issue
this has nothing to do with me
you are a coward
Sisters and brothers
Good morning everybody
I'm pleased that you attended in the meeting
Where are the rest
he ran away
Where is Khamees
He's coming,
switch off your mobile
Ok, don't switch it off, leave it in the office
The meeting is for just an hour
This is not my phone
The war began
OMg, since that day, he's staying with you
where can he go
He can't go
and since that day, his situation didn't change
jealous, jealous of women presence around him
this is not jealousy
He sit alone here in the living room at night
He says it's my mother
His mother! his mother is dead
That's why I invited me, to find a solution for me
she asked you to move from the department that has women
Is it a military decision
look at the signature very clear at the bottom
Brother, excuse me, I'm moved to the social walfare department
walfare department! are you sure they moved you to it?
Why is it strange
Thank you, God bless you
Are you Madame, sorry, Mister Khames
The minister's office called and informed us
Did you go to your new department?
Who is in the office with you?
Essay, Saleh, jassim,
Oh! Khamees, the minister decided to transfer you just yesterday
and you just moved to the new department today
I explained my problem with my family to you
The minister decided to transfer you
So I have to go to the minister
He started his annual leave today
He will be back after a month and a half
Such a trouble
If you want my opinion,
the minister will tell you the same
work there until we find you another place, this time he transfered you cause many told him about your problem with your wife
I'm telling you the truth
and what to do!
to not talk when your wife calls
You never know, they might comply with you, beg them
I asked them to put the abayas in the car, I had put them in a box for you
How many?
I had put ten as you are five in the office, which means two for each one
He seems to fear his wife a lot
Imagine that he gave us all male names
and he calls me Abdulqader
what's his name
and he's cute and handsome that's why she's affraid other woman likes him
In the name of God, what's wrong with her
Who called me?
Yea, Abdulqader, the one who sits next to Hassan, there behind Khalil
Here are the abayas, each onecan choose what she likes
look at this one
How much is this one
What's wrong, what happened
Excuse me
where is the walfare office
There supposed to be five employees
What's your name
I'm handsome
I'm crazy, my wife drove me crazy
I'm crazy
You unfolded the project in front of us
and met with them
What did they say
They said
Manoor, prepare some tea
I cant
do you want me to go back to the kitchen and mess up my outfit
Go now, go prepare us a tea
Go go, nonesense
Go, listen to what men says
Don't forget that we're Bani Aqrab (Sons of scorpions)
Go go, and bring a tea with out sugar for me, go go go go go
The bank said that the project is fine
I called him many times, his phone is busy
Poor them, they've been waiting for a while for you
It's my brothers as usual
One of them took a month vacation, she travelled three months ago and didn't show up
God is The Generous, Good bye
and all the changes are in our favor
pour for us
Yea, but if you build a park
it will take the space of at least two or three villas
that the park is a place for the inhabitants of the complex to relax
Men do not need women's opinion
keep it for yourself
Put the tea and go away
No park
Just one moment
Sister, you know I love football

She's going to travel to China
Captain, isn't Chaina a little far
May God grant you success
Your sister will play an important game
She used to study education, but I went today and applied for a transfer for her
She will study architectural engineering
There's no difference between a man and a woman
Really? go and serve coffee
Where are you going
I'm tired of waiting
stupid, are you stupid
Go, say hi to your mother and inform her that you've been expelled
Go, *
what a fool
The coffee in the pot that you have became cold
They don't call the whole year, but once they know that you have a series, they call
Hello, how are you, how's children!
What did you told her
I told her you'll be in the serial with us
Sure, and she'll be the main character
Look, Ali, Shaaola is going to play Nouf's role
There is something called makeup, it can make her look younger
Mariam's role is only for twenty six or seven episodes
Let Shaola benefit
He'll be giving us endless lectures
I'm affraid he'll be a pain in the neck for us
The most important thing is that he should not know that the producing company is yours, you and Hamed
I hope I'm not late
and Rashid is here too
that the director and actors are ready
For the sake of time, Oh! people let's start the meeting
Please tell us what you think
Hamed, do youwant to say something
Honestly, I think ut's the best
You see when the maid commited suicide
You know the most touching part for me
was when the maid commited suicide
When she hanged her self from a fan, rotated around her self and bleed to the death
they found him and she cried her son, it's thriling
and keep kicking it till he arrive the house yard
is the thrill
The police comes, inspects home, and arrests the mother
it's really a great serial
You had almost performed the serial here on this table
is actually an extortion of the artistic conscience
a societal
it's all about unusual events,
that are unbelievable
Seventy two murder cases
And wihat's with the crying
You are known for obstructing people
It's ok, Mister Hamed, Let's be open minded
let's take a majority vote
Mr. Nasser don't claim openness and use majarity as an excuse, these don't work with a critical evaluation of Art production
You are involved in this due to your governmental job
Good bye
I heared the dor bell ringing
It was an indian with a bag in his hand
He asked me, are you madam Hessa, I replied yes
I opened the bag
It was a ring that worth nearly seventy to eaighty thousands
I'm affraid the indian man brought these things by mistake
No it's not bu mistake
It's Sameera
Hamed's wife, the superviser in the company
It's gift from her to you, may God bless you
Yea, it's for you
The ring is very luxurious ring
I never dreamed of having such ring
May God bless you Oh! Hessa Oh! darling
Yea, this is it, I call it the blessings serial
Ali and Hamed own theproduction but they are employees there, they can't pesent it with thei names
What are we going to get more than the ring
Don't share that with anybody, keep it between me and you
Am I crazy to do that?
Your brilliant husband
who is called the magician
only five percent, it's little
No it's good it they approved four millions for them
Your husband will get two hundred thousands Riyals, it's fine
I think we'll give the college girl role to Nada
it's a great role, she fall in love with a man and run away on a bicycle
The serial that we're going to produce is called Conscience Extortion
They talked to me about the role in the serial
I really ant to know,
Khalijee serials are always like that, this year's trend in extortion
Ok, tell my daring, what is my role
You too darling, your role is secured
Don't embarrase me
I'm coming, coming, now
I made all that breakfast, don't go and leave me
This is Omar, the manager's secretary
May God protect us
He never asked to see me this time of the day
and told him that it's going to be a weak and absurd serial
Don't waste your money on it
Ok, so, what happened next
May God protect me, What can I say, I'm affraid Rashid told them something bad about the serial
Don't be affraid
Leave it to me
a sick minded person
is a social serial
I just saw it on TV
No may God give you long life
The serial that's on TV now is called "The Extortion of a young flower"
But, I assume the budget that they ask for is too high
It needs a high budget
But don't forget that the producing institution is a local one
We have to spport it
never mind
Did you read the art page
We heared that they are going to start shooting "Conscience Exortion" serial
and that a huge budget is allocated for it
However, It's been said that the serial is weak
and other said that the serial is consisting of school that teaches immorality
It's possible that they stop shooting
Peace be upon you
Upon you be peace
Welocme. welcome, have a seat
Good morning
Good morning, welcome
I'm Elie Muneer. a journalist, and I have an appointment with Mr Hamed, if you don't mind
Yea, fine, please sit down for a while, cause he's in a meeting
Murcury, this will let us use a design of a universe
and by the way we'll correspond with all world's reporters to communicate wit h us
That's your task
of Mercury Media Production Company
and discusses its issues in a way that rank it as the best production in world history
Can you believe that who wrote this
He has got no shame
Do we have such journalist?
Do we have such journalist?
a journalist should have a sense of ethics
are working
Do you think they are here to*
I met his excellency, the minister, do you know what he told me
It's very tragic and its events are unusual
The first episode is going to be tomorrow, I'm gonna watch it with the peole
What do you think, mother?
It's ok mother, it's just the first episode
have you seen people talking to themselves, unless in the Khaleeji serials
also, have you seen a mother who wants to kill her children, unless in your serials
Oh! my son, Art is a tact, it's not unusual cases that you generalize it on people and society
Mother, that could be done in Plastic Arts, but Drama is totally different
Don't give me a headache
It seems that they are imitating Turkish people
Don't judge now, it least watch the first five episodes
This serial is a failure
We can't let our children watch it
Not to that extent, brother
There are worse serials and being viewed on Tv
In fact, not anyone
It's your fault
foe everybody, in every house
go and collect the people who understand these dimesions and hidden lines
and view it for them
not for us
tell me, what happened
The minister with some guests passed by
I stood up to greet him
We agreed on producing the serial
How come the minister will like it
Ok, let's hear Nasser's opinion
my collegue wrote that
I only publish the messages that says something good about the serial
No no, don't worry
Read the News paper tomorrow and I will publish praising messeges from me and will state that the viewers sent it
God willing
You'll be glad
for this year
Ok, if they have an agreement with him
It's the best serial in the history of the Khaleeji Drama
They are all on agreemnet with them
Ok, let's say they all have agreement with them,
I will real the subtitles only
I hope that they repeate Conscience Exortion serial
Thank you, the minister of Arts for that serial
I wish they repeate it again
when the miniser office first called me
that we can come to collect the last money batch of the serial
They were right when they called you the magician
That was not everything
Profits were rewarding and we took our money
and also the serial is a failiur
the writer himself told me that he regrets writing
I'm here to suggest a second part of the serial
The minister believed the trick of the press that you made up
He believed the imaginary success that we made
that he's not pleased of the serial
Which means that it's impossible that he approves a second part
I assure you that the minister himself will ask for a second part
I can only
say thank you
to all people
who worked on this serial
and congratulate them for it's success
that they all deserve
In fact, winning those awards of outstanding festivals
proves that there
That's what you think
You're a brilliant
definitely win the golden award
What was he saying
He said if the readers, and press are lying to me
Yea, why not having a second part
as long as the Arab and gulf television festivals are art laundering
art laundering!
I heared of money laundering
not art
Illegal money
serials are the same
What can we do with "One Two"
What do you mean
Didn't we signed a contract with them, they have to be committed
Write them
our products are exported to the world, bread of all kinds and types, flat , big, small, triangle and diverse
how much did we agree on, in the contract?
Two million dollars
What did you do with the Australina baker
he's the invintor of the bread
Anybody told you about his product?
Not really, they just told me it's bread, but I don't what it contains
It's bread with a zipper
you call it (Sousta)
Instead of cutting the bread, (Samoun)as you call it =(semolina bread)
The invintor tried to make it easy
Jeans bread
that's the secret
You eat the bread with the sousta(zipper)
Those people make very strange things
This Sousta(zipper) is amazing, it's produced in a way that, once you put in in your mouth, it melts
It can be of different flavours, Strawberry, katchup, coffee
Do you know how much money I invested in this project
Three million dollars, with invention rights
Come in Oh! Sameh
Yes Abu Nasser
Yes, sir I'm at your servise
We delivered it today, sir
tell him Oh! Sameh
were with your son, Nasser, yesterday, playing football in his team
I agreed with him
to form his team of drivers and security men,
and it's also an incomplete team, we have only one goalkeeper, if he injured we'll be in a trouble
I am supposed to have fans as well
When you took seventeen players,
I didn't say anything
the people who are important in the company
, who are indispensable
he took the hospital pastry bakery
Why do you upset the guy
you said he can't, he's a son of a well known family, he can't run after a ball and make fun of himself
He can do whatever he wants
But don't take the indispensable ones
What can I do mum, my team has a match and I needed four players
No more excuses
oK, whatever happened, happened
Hamdi didn't come to work today sir
I went with him
He said get dressed
and they had me standing up in the goal area
The match started
Then I didn't feel anything
They told me that the ball hit me while I wasn't focused
Did you work as a goalkeeper before?
I played just because Nasser asked me to play
There is no power or strength except through God
We are tired of your love for football
From now on Oh! Nasser
no football
you got to cancel your team
and all the bakers should go bacj to their bakeries
What do you think
Fathe, it's
I don't wanna hear anything
Please Oh! Bu Nasser
Listen to what he want to say
ok, I will, only because you asked me
speak, what do you wanted to say
Tomorow we'll be having the last match of the tournament
Don't upset him, Oh! Bu Nasser, Please, I beg you
Alright, Oh! guys
Congrats, congrats
Good, good, good, congats
Oh! mister Nasser I wanna talk to you for a minute please
Thank you, my team today was on time
Mister Nasser, we have to
You promised us of a party
Do you want me to call and book a hall in the hotel
and call press and journalist to come there
No Oh! Rashid we'll have it in our home
So that when my father sees the players and their success, he might not cancel it
They winned the cup, they winned the cup, they winned the cup, they winned the cup, they winned the cup,
I hope so
No no, I saw him taking photographs with the players and he was with them talking to press
It seems that Sami, the sport page editor is interviewing him
a photograph
leave it close to me
take a good shot
He's happy
your comment on the winning of your sons, the bakers, made them
high spirited
and the effort
and loyality to the bakery
Pardon, Bu Nasser, we watched the team playing four-four-two
and loyality to bakery and coach's plan
Thank you Uncle Bu Nasser
Bless you
Hello goalkeeper
Aldawri and Alkass's =jounalists will come to interview you
Ni, they're not Almajlis ones
They sent their representative to conduct the interview
They brought the cup, They brought the cup, They brought the cup, They brought the cup
You know, we encourage youths
I expect a bright future for them
Yea, Good bye
God willing, your phone is always ringing, and your photos are in the newspapers, you are blessed by this football
Do you know who was talking to me on the phone
reduce the price of the engines, he said ok
Yea, you became wellknown now, under every photo of you in the newspapaers, they write the first athele of the International Bakeries
I was not interested in football?
What are you saying
Since I was in school
the one who used to sit next to me loves football
You say I wasn't close to football
since the one next to me plays football, I'm close to football
being close to to sport means that I'm a sport man
So we're not the internatoinal bakries anymore, we became the international football
I heared him yesterday saying that he'll make it sport club
and today we meet the first sport man of the international bakeries, Bu Nasser
to enhance football
Before the match, tell us about your expectations before you go to the stage
The game is tough today
the team that will be controlling the mid line will be of a *..* today
Yea, if God wills, we're communicating with professional players' agents to develop the international bakeries team
He's called Saud, listen, we want commitment
((yea, he want the previous deal of the players))
it was useless
When I gave you the prices
I gave you the international rate
So, isn't the gulf a part of the world
of course not
This is not your buisness
You just have to inform me once a buyer from the gulf come
open your fax line
two of them are defense players, one is mid and the other is center player
look, these four players
three of them cost
two hundered thousand dollars per player
take them all in one package
that will be six hundered thousand, I will give them to you for five hundered and fifty thousand dollars
Nice, this regarding the African =players, now, for the Brazilian=player
He's the player of the season, he alone costs one million and two housand dollars
They put that price but then I recieved a fax, I'll show it to you, it's here. wait, look look, I recieved it from a club in UAE
The decision is yours
Tank you
God wills, check his leg calf
How is it
The knee, the knee
The knee is fine
We don't want to be cheated, I hope there is no Cruciate ligament
Oh! Bu Nasser
What is this connective muscle
butcher! make a Mufatah (Rice and meat, a traditional food)
honestly you are lucky to have the Brazilian and African players, congratulations, congratulations
Thank you
To the store, store
oh, God willing, you have an other trade
No no no, only players
I see they are unloading boxes
young players! yea we want them, from the african Jungles
Yea, why is that
Karem, open one box for him
He's a human being just like s
He said young, didn't you hear him
He said tthey are young
as long as we
Why don't you give us thhis young boy as a free gift
Listen, Bu Nasser, if you took care of him and raised him well, he will be of your benefit later
and them go and release him in the stadium
Come Come come come
be easy on hm, he's still young
put him in the annex, let him raise him
Don't hesitate if you need anything, all the players are with me
your coach should understand
We winned 2-0, we controlled the game
Father, he's a coach of Spain
I don't like him
A successful coach
should control the game
and this one, the opposit, Alwakra road
we should not leave your coach to do whatever he want
he spent less than two months with the team
we have to put an end to this
If he's expert in football, he would have activated the corner players, and not attack from the center
yea, he relied on offside trap
Oh, mother, don't give me a headache
He should dismiss Kakunu Malalawi
and replace him with Shinamu Hababu Hetawala Hatawa Hawawa
No no no no no I don't want him to play
Forget about Shululu Habubu Taba Lawa
which line?
implement the plan
and forget about Hulolo
This is not supposed to happen between the coach and the manager of the team
The star of the game, the star of the team
Do you mean that we aren't experts in football
Listen, Oh! Sultan
let him go home
Don't take him in the Bakeries car, let him go by Taxi
not your buisness
Keep updated
Do you see what my father has done fair?
he dismissed the coach and sent him back
what he do
is ruining the team
Say Goodbye to our team
Mom Mom
No, he is insane. That means that he told that you are divorced, tell me the truth, what happened between you?
From the first day I saw him, I told your mother, I don't like this guy.
I feel that he is incapable of responsibility.
Forget about the nonsense and speaking about the past.
You should go to his father and know why your daughter is divorced.
I don't know what to say Oh!  Borther Rashid.
For what reason he divorced her, then?
It's not fair Oh!  Abo Abdullah. We should know, we have the right to know, why she is divorced?
Please, Don't intervene. It's not your business.
How come, I should n't intervene? And the man is waiting in the living room to know why his daughter is divorced?
She doesn't know how to appreciate her husband and to respect his feelings.
Who's she Barcelona?
It is not your fault. You don't know the Spanish League.
Barcelona is not a lady,
This is Guardiola's team.
It means that I go now to the man who's waiting for me in the living room
If you don't go, I'll go. Alright, stay here and leave it to me.
She should get out and don't nod your head.
It was not enough for her to revile Barcelona,
Messi, the football magician, who score hatrick in every match.
Maradona himself said that Messi will be better than him,
and your shameless daughter make fun of him. Listen,
you daughter is not a fan of Barcelona and she is not suitable for us (idiom).
what do you mean !
Listen, may God guide you.
Don't tell me that you want my son
to apologize and to please her.
Damn it.
and thanks God we have a lot of money.
What's the purpose of our money, if we don't make our son happy.
oh, stop it.
Most importantly, I'll look for a Barcelona fan.
Mom, I'm not upset
She is crazy Oh! son, forget about her.
Drink the tea Oh! son
Do you know Oh! son , they are the losers.
A thousand girl wish to marry you,
drink my son.
I feel sorry for her.
Poor her, she was divorced before two days
after a one month marriage.
What's wrong with you, you want me to get involve with him.
I don't wanna be in trouble with him
Who told you this illogical stories !
Don't listen to her.
She doesn't know who is he?
What does she want more !
her fortune only.
Do you remember the building that I wanna buy and make it apart-hotel.
The one in Almansoora.
is owned by his father and when his son marry our daughter, I'll ask him this building.
If you couldn't.
Talk to her brother
Listen carefully,
A son of millionaire proposed to you.
Do you know what's a millionaire !
The chance only comes once.
They are super rich to the level that they bought a palace in Spain, so that they can spend summer there every year.
%pw alright, and Barcelona story?

Someone like that
Do you think he will succeed? I don't think so, he will waste his time and he will lose.

Did you like the joke?
So, did you brought the design with you?
I didn't have time to do them, show me your designs and I'll choose from them.
To be honest, you have a better taste.
They will leave us, envy starts working.
When he know that my project is good and it starts to bring income,
They say that he will do a project like mine.
A design and tailoring boutique
For women clothing.
This Abo Nasser who have nothing to do with trade
There are banks
He will harm his cousin.
in this manner this days.
Yes, yes my cousin.
Do you know I was sleeping and they wake me up by saying that your cousin wants you.
Everything is ok ! Ask me whatever you want !
Everything is alright, everything is alright.
I hope so.
You don't have any intention for any project for example like, like
Are you coming to find a partner or something?
I heard that you are determined so I said I have to pass by may be
You welcome.
If you need the raise, we have it.
Thanks God, work is going very well.
What shall I do Oh! Abo Saleh.
But we are late, they rented it last week .
Yes, they did.
Alright, that's fine if God wills, bye-bye.
So, that's him.
Are you sure?
And with haute couture and do you know the great calamity !
What is it?
That he rented a shop next to your shop.
(Procalmation)You envious (Procalmation)You hatered !
Before you know that the market is opened for everyone,
You should know
That your heart should be opened for your cousin.
I'm not coming to ask you,
You deny, lie and make fun of me and you told to me, Me,
I wanted to do my work in concealment.
To take that is the shop next door , you want disrupt my business.
But they didn't say come and be like a pain in the neck next to the teeth of wisdom, you are driving me crazy.
This is envy and hatred, I swear I swear I'll slap you, this is hatred, leave me on him.
Come on, you are relatives Oh! People ?
Shame on you Oh! Abo Saleh !
Leave me on him, I swear I'll punch you Oh! You with your squeaky voice, you.
I'll beat you just like you beat me by stealing my bit.
Come on Oh! People.
Just say peace be upon him Oh! People.
I swear, I swear, you didn't do anything.
He advise me to bring a designer from the Philippines.
Don't let anyone to lie to you.
Why, why lebanese in particular.
They chitchat with him, joke and laught and they feel very comfortable.
That's why Abo Saleh bring a lebanese .
He started to tell me some nice words and persuade me
He fascinated me, fascinated me by his words
He persuaded me and led me to pay twelve thousands riyals.
And after two days, I went to Souk Al-Haraj and I found the same cupboard, its twin for nine hundred riyals.
and make money,
Bring a lebanese designer.
Can I meet the sir, yesterday you've told me that's it's difficult, also today is difficult?
Yeah, Today it's also very difficult.
I feel that Abo Saleh has changed these days.
What's wrong with him?
No I don't know? What's wrong?
Abo Saleh is very tired psychologically after his cousin opening of a shop and he brought a lebanese designer just like him.
Ever since for two weeks, the shop's sells are declining.
That's the problem here in Qatar there is no a qatari who opens a shop, unless another qatari would come and do the same project and open the same shop next to him, can I enter to him?
No, no, no, no, he is with Fadi the designer now they are thinking of a solution.
What to do now?
We are sitting as if we ate a poision.
If we stay like that I think that won't even earn the rent of the shop.
A place that is far from them.
That means that we will evacuate the arena for them.
Alright thank you and how much is the discount?
No way, why you don't give evening gown with every wedding dress for free?
No way, let's go.
What's wrong? What's happend? We will go to the shop that is next to you, today they put an ad with every wedding dress two free evening gowns and also twenty five percent discount.
Alright let's go, let's go.
And now wait for two weeks, they will advertise the same ad, buy a wedding dress and get two free evening gowns with a twenty five percent discount.
They are fighting us.
I'm thinking the same too, If we leave them, they will destroy us.
Don't bother yourself,
What did he do also?
So it's absolutley a challenge.
Of course its a challenge.
Bravo, he deserve it this naughty, he don't want anybody to earn his living.
If it happens you will hear the news within two or three days, I'll close his shop
Well done.
Wait, wait, hang up, hang up, I'm coming to you now, bye.
What's the matter?
Saad is saying that the shop is unbearable and no one can sit there, he saying he don't know where this bad smell is coming from
The smell has nothing to do with this air condition, No way.
Its smell won't go from the shop at least for six days.
Hundred percent sure.
He came at night.
He cuts the electricity wires from the shop.
Is this fair?
Now you will sign a pledge or we'll start a case and we'll open up a file?
Don't do anything for him.
I'll terminate him from this life
Oh! Abo Nasser something weird has happened, no one comes to our shop.
Abo Nasser, hang up, hang up, there is a client who's coming, I'll talk to you later. That's werid.
He is in his bed groaning.
He saying a psychological case and I was afraid to tell him that the bank had called and they need the installments.
The debts were accumulated on him because of his mean cousin.
What happened to him this time?
Poor them, if they entered by mistake and saw Saad the designer, they scream at his face and run away from him.
Asleep ! poor him, he never feel asleep, his eyes are open and he is looking at the ceiling.
I don't know what he has done to me.
Saad is in the shop.
He put him under a spell, I don't know what he has done to him.
When women see him, they get scared of him.
I don't know, what he has turned him to !
He made me lose, he made me lose.
I have so many debts,
I'm afraid that they will imprison me.
And I don't have any proof against him, so that I can sue him.
I don't know what he has done, I don't know what he has done.
Forget about him, he deserve it.
Please, tell me what kind of magic you've done to him, you've made his designer to turn into a monster and women get scared when they saw him.
I spread a rumor
It's not ok Oh! People, tell him that the shooting group needs you urgently.
Oh! People God bless you, may God protect you, tell him they need you urgently, urgently.
I swear they will raise my blood pressure, kill me, paralyze me. This is not fair Mr. Abdullah

Why Cans?

His appearance is appropriate, what I remember he is fleshy and chubby, not tall and not fat.

Unlike female citizens.
No forget about female citizens.
Alright, then look for a wife at the hospital.
I like her.
But Oh! brother she ignores me.
Alright then try to be close to her, laugh for her, gaze her, give her your number and your intention is good.
Nothing nothing wrong.
Behave yourself.
Or get out, get out, if you don't get out, I'll call the security, so that they teach you a lesson.
No, no I don't need anything.
Why sir, you have to drink.
For me please.
No, no thank you.
You can take her and leave the hospital.
The one who's speaking to you is Faleh Al-Marzouzz.

And I have to take it tomorrow.
No worries, they are still open, go and change your clothes, so that we can bring something that satisfy people.
What's wrong with you ! let's go.

Above the average, its not the finest !
Of course there are the upper class chocolate, but sorry I thought that you were looking for the suitable price.
This is very expensive, why you are looking for the more expensive.
That's unbelievable, check this artistic touch.
This called the royal chocolate.
The same chocolate that it is always ordered at the spanish court.
Give me this one.
Congrats and by the way it has a warrenty certificate.
You welcome, you welcome, rejoice !
Come here Oh! brother, give us from this chocolate Oh! Brother.
What's the occasion for this Oh! man?

With God blessings, he deserve that, give me one more.
And quickly bring the coffee.
Aunt, did you go to their wedding?
Yes dear, I've been to their wedding, it was embarrassing, disgusting. Do you believe it sister !
Have you heard your aunts words?
That's why I wanna do for you an unparalleled wedding.
There is no time, you only have a month and half.
I'll arrange everything,
But he doesn't let me do anything.
You are not living in the society, you don't see how people put all what they have on their weddings.
And you have seen by yourself,
When you bought a nice thing, you've seen how they praise you and praise your taste.
They haven't told you it's amazing and awesome?
That's right, but how much we paid?
The money that we paid for the chocolate, it brings four sheeps for the wedding.
Please don't intervene, your mother knows how to do everything, just give her the money and that's it.
That means that they will accept anything we will choose.
Ew, your really have a bad taste.
What do you think about this stage?
But excellence costs a lot of money.
Why, why, the previous one was nice !
What do you think about this one?
Its the first time Qatar that somebody think about making a stage like a computer mouse.
Excuse me, for a minute.
Look talk about everything except the stage and the arrangements, this is the place where women will stay who doesn't have anything, but gossip, just shut up.
The man is waiting for us.
We will go for the mouse stage.
Its a very bizarre stage.
The latest model in two thousand and eleven.
We already have chosen the mouse.
You can sit aside, this is all for your own sake.
So you have to choose, if it is Noah ship, you have to pay twenty thousands more and if it is the mouse you will pay a hundred and twenty five thousand.
Make up your mind and we are ready.
You are not the first one to get married.
What do you think yourself, you will get married in Comoros? This is how things work in our country.
And we are also only in the beginning.
If you don't need a stage, where you will put the bride? In a box?
Iron, paint and some wood
And people are happy.
They are taking advantage and lying to us, actually they are crooks.
So what's wrong with you now?
You are angry and upset?
If you don't want to get married, fine.
I'll call the bride's mother and I'll tell her that Saleh has a very difficult conditions.
He don't want to get married? he can't afford the wedding expenses? It's fine for me. Do you want me to call her? I'm serious, I'll call her.
We recieved a flower collection from Netherlands.
In my opinion, if you put it on the tables in the wedding,
Are you sure that it's the first time in Doha?
Also the Middle East !
Put it on the bill.
How much it will increase?
A hundred and seventy two, Alright then,
But Samir I don't want to see this collection in any wedding.
You know people's gossip.
Alright, they are reserved.
Your salary is more than mine.
You will starting an issue that we can't handle.
May God help you Oh! Saleh.
But you may God guides you, you should've try to settle things.
For me, thanks God, I've decided to look for a wife in any Arab country.
They say that there a wedding costs you only Two thousand dollars and have fun.
God bless you dear.
If God wills, his wedding is going to be in next month.
You should only specify how many cards do you want and tell me.
If the invitations are adequate, then fine. The most important thing is that people know that they are invited, where and at what time and that's it.
You only care about his, you don't care about what will people say.
People knows the wedding standard from the invitations.
Tomorrow when they see these invitations, I know what will ladies say.
Look at there wedding, if those are there invitations, They didn't see te invitations of so and so.
We didn't say such a thing, we will order it online.
It has a fabric cover, from the panda's skin and it has a silver glitter.
No one can blame you, you can't stop me.
I won't be a hot topic for ladies, we will order the invitations means that we will order the invitations !
I feel sorry for him Oh! Man.
Poor him, of course his family has put so much pressure on him.
Oh! Man he scrounge money from everybody.
What are you saying, he even sold his car.
And He looks Twenty years older, this morning I've seen him speaking to himself.
Don't blame him Oh! Brother, Poor him, I don't know when we will develop
Close the door, please.
Sorry, Oh! Brother.
You didn't try to convince them to do a wedding based on your budget?
What do you mean by based on my budget?
Why, Am I living alone?
The problem that our society is suffering from the appearances, boasting and showing off disease.
It force you to be sick with the same disease,
If you wanna live in it.
One time, I've hint to the bride's mother.
I was attacked by her words(Idioms).
Put your trust in God.
By the way, tell me,
How did you get married?
And I don't want to get married, I'm not insane.
And even if I've decided Oh! Brother to get married,
I'll think about marrying a foreigner or even an Arab.
And he is saying your country !
We've decided to bring a DJ for songs,
But because Um Nasser brought a well known singer for her son's wedding.
He is a very well known singer, but I forgot his name.
Why you are so upset?
It seems that you don't like what I'm doing !
It's enough that he have sold his car and everyday one of his friends give him a ride.
Earlier, I've entered the room and I found him speaking to himself.
I see, now you've changed your mind.
Because my brother Saleh is tired, Mum just stop it.
I don't care about you and him.
I'm not less than people.
Don't make us a joke.
Please Oh! Mum that's enough, my brother has spend all what he have and he took money from everyone.
Please, shut up.
My mum has a new demands for the wedding and my brother said I don't have money, so she shout at him and he said I'll cancel the wedding, I don't want to get married.
Where is she now?
She is inside and they are doing first aid for her.
He said that she is much better now and they will find a room for her in the hosptial.
What a scandal !
Relax Oh! Sister.
The doctor told you to stay quite and he give you an injection to sleep.
How can I relax and he want to make us a joke for the good and for the bad.
I was telling him to bring Abdullah Rowaished and he said I don't have money.
I feel sorry for your Mum.
Be worried about her.
Go to her, go to her and kiss her head
And tell her I'll do what you want,
I'll bring Abdullah Rowaished for you.
Abu Yosif is kind, I don't think that he won't help me.
It's not fair, you didn't find anyone other than Abu Yousif.
What's wrong with it !
Are you insane Oh! Saleh?
But the minister kept him because he is an old man and more than that he is disciplined and honest.
Do you want my opinion, if you say the same thing you've told me to him, there is a big chance that his heart will stop.
Yes, I did.
That's because of the bloody crisis that you are going through and you want to ask Abu yousif some money of course from the ministry money.
And only God knows, when you will bring it back to him.
And if the auditing people come and ask him about the money,
Of course he might be in trouble.
No one will know and he will know how to deal with it.
It is up to you, the man is in his office and you should be responsible if anything happens to him.
I steal in my last days !
Uncle they don't call it stealing,
In the first drower.
There is, there is a white can wrapped up with a blue ribbon and it has a circle with a picture of a pigeon wing, bring it, bring it.

But this is not fair if this happened !
The company has offered a contract of three millions, two millions were only for the materials.
He wrote a memorandum to the minister.
We know that there is a corruption, but corruption doesn't reach this extent.
It seems that you are not living in this world.
Tell me, what does the minister said to Othman?
And why our boss didn't object? they are saying that he was with him !
I don't know about him, I swear I don't know.
Where are the morals?
The right have become wrong and the wrong have become right !
Oh! Saad, Are you sure that the minister has fired him, Oh! People what happened to the world ?
Only fired him !
What else?
It's owned by the minister sister.
This girl is in an affair with the minister.
What a strange world (Idiom).
What's wrong with you guys, you didn't know who's she?
This is the new employee that the minister hired instead of the unfortuante Othman.
Go, go, go.
What do you want me to do Oh! Saleh? To object the minister !
Are you insane !
Listen to me man,
We have kids, we want to live .
We want to live.

It's such a shame to say that your father is honest.

All you body is covered.
What the people will see ?
And hopefully, you are looking for a job, no one will employ you when you are like that.
Is there is a decent lady who cover her body and her attractions.
And she is covering her chest, she is wearing till here, she strangling herself.
I got sick of her, son.
And I bought for her a top and a trouser that reveal half of her tummy above the navel.
But she is a hopeless case, she doesn't want to be on the right path.
Here I'm telling you !
You will only blame yourself.
To ask for the hand of your daughter Sara for our son Rashid.
One of us is only looking for the right man for his daughter these days.
Let me tell you, Rashid my son
is a very good guy.
He never stops drinking(Idiom).
He is twenty four hours drunk.
Drunk, inebriated and heavy all day.
And don't ask about roistering.
He is well brought up.
And let me tell also he is a hypocrite.
And how is stealing?
That 's what I expect from you and how is drugs?
It's obvious, he's done. I'll give you five riyals, if you can find the pupil of his eyes, I'll do a contest on him.
By the way Oh! Abo Sara, we only come to ask for her hand,
You know roistering and hanging out.
We know she came from a good family.
With bless son, with bless, this is how life works, with blessing
I'm drunk.
I can't walk.
Alright, come,
Alright bye, bye.

Why do I have to call him?
So, that he can come to pick you up.
Where is he?
See, he is there, looming with his Gotrah with a blond chick.
Really, your father is walking straight, he is having fun.
Hello my dear daughter Mona !
Majed ! His name was Abdulaziz.
Yeah, that's right.
You confused me daughter.
And you know since the establishment of the State of Palestine and its capital is Jeneen in two thousand and ninety, after signing the Comprehensive Peace with the state of Israel,
And Israel is still exercising terrorism, pressure and blockade on it.
The latest were what was raised by the Israelis and their Arab friends of allegations against the Palestinians.
That they smuggle plastic knives through the tunnels
Especially the second article, paragraph one thousand which states that the Palestinian people should cut their nails everyday.
Let's move now to the fateful meeting.
Mr. Cheap,
When Israel approves the establishment of the state of Palestine,
Oh! Man what are you saying Oh! Man? You are destroying our reputation and leave me alone !
Please !
Excuse me Mr. tiger, Excuse me Mr. President.
Can you give the chance to speak?
Have fully adhered the International Comprehensive Agreement.
What does Israel representative saying?
To find anything solid a stone or a plastic as commitment
Oh! Man even our houses
What do you Gulf people call it?
In Palestine are all made of wood.
American companies according to the agreement makes wood cars for us.
And all our houses' doors are made out of thermally treated wood.
We don't need speeches.
Don't change the subject.
Mr. President,
This a very crucial point and I would like to vote on this regard because grow the nails is a breaking of the agreement.
If you agree, raise your hand.
But I've dreamed a very strange dream.
So that you can control the students.
I got sick of telling him.
That's the fourth school that you will start working on it tomorrow.
Because I've imposed my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The boys are following him and they tear his clothes and he doesn't do anything.
How many times he came to me without Gotra.
There headmaster told me.
Rashied is kind and we don't want to fire him,
Kids are throwing him with chalks
And they pull his Gotra in the break in front of everyone.
And they said this teacher is very reluctant and he will spoil everything.
Shall I tell them the ketchup story ?
Come on Mariam.
What's the Katchup story, this is new, no one have told me !
They poured a whole Ketchup bottle on the chair.
He came and sit down.
He didn't know anything
Only when he saw kids laughting at him at the school yard.
Stop it.
By the way, your headmaster that you will start working with him tomorrow, called me.
However, Its ok, we will give him a chance.
Because I'm waiting to tell you
That the kindness and weakness age is over.
Oh!  Cousin Oh! Abdullah
You will see a different Rashid.
And no need to remind you with the important educational quote,
You are education graduate and I'm an education graduate.
And we all know the quote,
The teacher is the son of the first class.
You will see the strong Mr. Rashid.
And if anyone will do a misake,
He will be in trouble.
When you start speaking, he said just shut up.
You will see what I'll tell him.
Who of you made fun of me and said just shut up? Who?
You are the one who told me just shut up !
No, not me.
So the one next to you, you !
Stand up, go to the headmaster,
And tell him that Mr. Rashid kicked me out.
I don't want to see your face here, do you hear me !
What do you think about my nervousness?
You shouldn't be only like on your first day, but you should be like that the entire year.
Be aware of the consequences.
If I hear someone's voice
While I'm explainig or speaking.
You know what does
Nervous means, Do you know what does nervous means?
It means nervous.
Have you heard what I say or not?
I heard him too.
Get out from the class.
Go to the headmaster.
Take your stuff and get out now !
Take your stuff.
I don't care.
Obviously he is still looking for him.
No professor, we didn't saw him.
By the way, The ice-cream with milk if it have strawberry inside is very nice.
My dear Abdulrahman.
Every person make mistakes and The human being
Just kidding son.
But the most important thing is that your father doesn't know the story !
I don't want it, I want the chocolate in my bag.
Alright, and =Where is your bag? =Where is your bag? where is your bag?
In the classroom.
I'm at your disposal.
You are saying that he is happy from you.
You don't know how to differentiate between the rich boy and the commoner boy.
Misfortune, how does the misfortune look like green or red?
Come here, where are you going to?
In the toilet.
You are still in the toilet?
Knock the door quickly and tell him that the first class had started before a half an hour, quickly.
I was before them all, one juice and one chips.
I took it before all of them, I've bothered them. My friend Abdulrahman and by the way this is very healthy.
Alright, now go to Saoud and bring the playstation CD from him.
So what do we learn from this story?
That man
should have morals.
This is the playstation thing, he told me also to bring the playstation all at one time.
Alright, do you want anything else my friend Abdulrahman, my friend?
Nothing for now.
We learn for the story
You are all know that I'm leaving this week because I was accepted for graduate studies.
So, I thought that I have to hand over the ceremony file before I travel.
How can I take you in the afternoon? Abdulrahmin have told me and I don't know where he want to go, but he didn't tell me at what time !
As long as his father came back and he didn't tell him anything, thanks God you've guaranteed and relieved.
Let's say I didn't take him today's afternoon and he became upset and he tell his father, no,no,no it's a catastrophe, no,no.
Hello my friend Abdulrahman.

And peace be upon you.
Thank you.
I need water.
I didn't ask, you didn't ask anything, I'm at your service.
Professor, professor. How can you ask for water from the professor?

And you are also making fun, making fun of me

This is enough for how many?
Good, this is for how many cars?
Four to five cars.
Excellent, this is excellent, lovely, excellent.

Did you give me the chance to speak?
Alright Oh! People, Silence and let us listen to what uncle Abo Nayef is saying?
Now, this loser who doesn't worth a cent, play with your nerves !
Leave it to me.
If I didn't slap him in the face, so that he will stick to the umberella that he has done,
The game is played by its players (Idiom).
Is that ok?
%Pw Bye-bye.
You still didn't see anything.
Do you know that he have a jewelry shop now !
That's why I see here wearing all these rings and necklaces.
May God compensate us.
Just walk, Are you going to stay in the heat?

He became the vice president of the Global Educational Center
Let him tell you, let him teach you. You are a teacher and he is a teacher, but see where he is now and where are you now.
Don't mention it,

The professor came, the professor came.

Professor you don't know who is he?
Yes dear, I know who is he.

This thing is ok, right?
Ok ! This is automatically, without any doubt.
So, darling, please make my dream come true.
Before your dream, my dream
is to build a tower between the cornich towers.
Let's go, what you are waiting!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You are capable of it Oh! Abo Saleh.
It seems that your friend is upset.
He doesn't look so Oh! Brother.
You are capable of it Oh! Abo Saleh.
Do you believe it that he stand, toolk the mobile and give it to Abo Saleh.
look, there is something behind this and a million percent that Abo Sultan holds a grudge towards him.
His relationship with Abo Saleh was not good.
No, Abo Sultan won't do this only if he is intended to do something else.
Really, to that extent?
He opens the car door for him !
And finally he works on opening the doors of the minister's car.
Oh! Son don't break my heart, don't break my heart.
For your information, all the stories that we hear in the cafes happen in the country.
But I can't believe what I'm hearing !
My heart have stopped, my heart have stopped.
I'm afraid Oh! Daughter that women will start talking about it and don't mention Latoof the dishes collector, she is spreads romars about me among women Oh! Daughter.
Say something Abu Sultan, speak. I'm shocked, I will collapse.
Please, I know what I'm doing.
It's none of your business.
Muneera, I'm working on a slow fire.
By opening the door for him, this is the beginning of the plan in my head.
I deserve to become a minister not him.
Let me work, I have a plane
to let them fire him,
Yes, a plan.
He should trust me in the beginning.
They told me that we appoint him as a minister because he was appointed two months before me.
Because I'm very certain that he will be kicked out from his job.
Magic might invalidate,
What is it?
What is this also?
And every activity he attends, the photographer will take some many pictures of him until his picture become very common in the newspaper
And he stincks untill he floats on the surface.
Are you sure?
You just wait. Let me work against him and you will see.
On the contrary your honor,
Of course your excelleny.
So, tell me,

Three hundred fifty.
For this famous person,
You are at home today, Anything wrong?

Let me rest today.
Hello, Um Sultan.
Can I say something?
Oh! Woman I only want him to take me
You've started to like it
You've seen by yourself whats does fame do !
I know. Thanks God that you were convinced.
To be honest,
Your minister is worried, it seems that he likes this stroy.
I'll send you my brother Saad.
No, I didn't follow up with any activity and I didn't read the newspaper, I don't know.
We are at your service, bye.
If God wants the demise of an ant, He gives her wings.
Peace be upon you, man do you have a conference here at the hotel tonight?
A wedding?
Don't mention it, you don't have any activity like a party, birthday or a wedding?
I don't know, but you can see with the hotel behind us.
Aha, there is a hotel behind you, right?
Is it ok to leave you in the car and to enter the hotel to ask?
Go, go, go and take your time. Go and ask, go.
May God help everyone.
Does this minister let us sleep or rest?
That means that he didn't find him a party, a wedding or any trouble to throw him it.
He took him to sixteen thousand hotel and he didn't find anything for him. He has a bad luck just like his face.
Just shut up, hello.
You didn't find a birthday for him, or a .
Go, you migh catch the second half !
In every issue, he has a hundred picture.
He doesn't sleep ! he doesn't get tired Oh! Brother.
Oh! Man, the newspaper director says the first thing is to prepare his picture and later I prepare the newspaper.
She said that my kids have done a competition on the picture of your husband minister.
One is asking the other, how many pictures of the minister in the newspaper?
And the winner gets a prize.
The story is not like that, you have to come to the cafe and listen to the comments everyday about his pictures in the newspaper. They is it's a non-stop gossip.
Wow, his demise is very close.
As they say, the butterfly if God wants it demise, it get closer to the light.
People will leave you and they will salute him.
He became one of the most famous people in the country.
Don't mention it and who is he?
You've ruined my prestige.
May god bless you and bless her.
She said we all get married except poor Amal, she is the only one of us who didn't get married.
This is my destiny.
It's not my destiny to get married.
And I forget about marriage.
God is only sufficient of who was behind that.
Do you see those pampered who are sitting there?
Yes, what's wrong with them?
Do you see the one who's playing with his hair?
Is that a boy or a girl?
After my father died, I mean he killed him.
You've saw him, he grow up, right?
It is not right to let him attached to the maid.
Go and make some tea.
I got sick of speaking to mum. But she doesn't has only one maid , she has two maid for him.
I've told you a hundred time don't intervene, Khaloud is my son not your son.
You have no other issue other than Khaloud and th maids and the maids and Khaloud.
Mom this is not good, Khaloud is twenty four hours with the maid and doesn't want anyone else.
Get out. I want to rest, I want to sleep. How?
Oh my God Saoud, Your brother Khaloud have become a girl.
Wait for a while, if I didn' tell my father about you.
Let me tell you something, what's wrong with Khaloud ?
Saoud is saying that Khaloud is wearing make up and he acts like girls. what's the matter? What's the matter?
Gosh, gosh, gosh Oh! Saoud.
Khaloud puts makeup in his face ! It's only little bit of makeup. A child who he saw a make up palette and he played with it.
I've seen a very small spot and even it's not clear.
He is kind, nice and gentle.
I'll scold Saoud
I haven't seen you for a long time.
Last time I asked you Saad, What do you want be when grow up and you didn't tell me, now tell me when you grow up what do you want be?
And you my dear Khaloudi, my dear Saad is going to be an office and what do you want to become?
This year we will go to London like last year.
Yes, call the the shaky in Bahrain.
Tell him to bring Sawsan, Khalouda and Fahoudah.
And say hi to Samoora.
I seek forgiveness from God.
Today my father told me to choose.
Do you want me to build the land that overlooks the sea or the land nearby?
I said I don't want to choose,
I can live with you darling at any place.
Thank you darling.
And you taught me fishing ?
Wow Oh! Amal, I want to open my eyes and they tell me that you've graduated from university.
It seems that it's not a men's perfume.
I don't know, but it has a very strange smell.
Oh my God, What's wrong with me?
The way you talk have become feminine.
You forgot that you are a man.
And hopefully you speak with people in this way outside?
I can't believe it Oh! Khalid.
Please, get out from my room !
What a pity Oh! Khaloud !
You've let me down.
Come on, don't hurt my feelings, I swear I'll tell mom.
This is my son and I know him very well.
Poor you Oh!  Khaloud the light of my eye, I hope that all kids have his tenderness and feelings.
And you when you just see someone who's tender and quiet, you say that he is a gay.
Shame on you, shame on you to say such a thing about your brother.
Stop it, you made a big fuss of nothing.
Poor him, he only applies a very nice perfume. Now what's the difference between men's and women's perfume.
Here I'm telling you, don't say that in front of your father.
I have it.
I'll show it to you, but be quiet, so that Mohammad won't feel anything.
How does these girls gather?
It's bad that such a beautiful girl do that !
Don't look at him, don't look at him !
I'm afraid that he felt that there is something that is related to him.
Give relief to yourself.
I know that you are watching the widespread bluetooth nowadays.
I'm waiting for Saad, let him comes.
How are you Saad?
May God protect you.
We were waiting for you, we didn't play cards.
Yeah, Why?
Do you want to drink anything?
I see him sleeping here in your apartment for two days !
Because of the bluetooth story.
Yes, his elder brother threatened him.
He is afraid of him.
Don't try, I've told you not to try.
Seek refuge from Satan Oh! Son, for me !
I've booked already
I will go away. How can I face people? I can't !
And what do I say to your father?
Say anything to him.
Oh these kids only brings trouble oh.
That is the end mom.
I remember when Khaloud was young,
Of course this is going to be the outcome.
Stop it, please get out.
The right thing always hurts.
The jar was broken.
It is impossible for me to live in Doha.
I can't face people.
My mobile is switched off for a while.
And you are blaming me Oh! Amal?
You are girl and you spending all your day at home.
What can I say when I'm a man who's all day meeting people outside.
It is difficult Oh! Amal.
I can't live spending my day and my life and my head is always down.
Dad feels for a while that there is something wrong at home and that there is a change.
For how long my dad will be absent for the events that happen here in the house?
Sometimes I blame dad and sometimes I don't.
I don't blame him Oh! Amal when I remember his dedication and devotion in his work, so that we can live with our dignity among people.
And I do blame him
When he leave the house and kids responsibility for the mother.
We don't want to exhume the past now.
Does dad know about or not?
But I'm willing to
Put the bluetooth for him
But I won't give it to him
I don't want to see my father's shock with my own eyes.
I'll be devastated.
Whatever Oh! Amal,
He knows throw us
is much better than knowing from someone else.
What a pity that our house reached that extent.
Because a dirty bomb that is called Khaloud has exploded in it.
And the customes and traditions.
You will find them insolently
closing their ears from it
And they don't want to listen to it,
They listen only to one voice
Which is the dirtiness and the queerness.
And they step on all the goodness.
What comes to your mind
That you've suddenly decided to study abroad.
We can only say, but may God helps you Oh! son.
May God helps you.
The people who come back bring the gift not the people who are going to travel.
You are right.
That's a rule.
But every rule has
Amal come with me quickly.
Did he watch it daughter?
I can't hear anything.
Abo Saad !
Abo Saad.
Abo Saad, what's wrong with you?
Dad, what wrong with you Dad?
Dad !
Don't be upset,
You are a great person.
And any man wish to marry you.
I didn't divorce you for anything wrong with you.
I've divorce you,
Because it's impossible
That I accept my kids uncle to be
a gay like your brother.
So Salooh,
You are here everyday.
Before you never come,
You were hidden in the underground.
That was before when we were in the underground.
This is a very strong words, can you handle such a words?
You get one thousand two hundred, you earn too much money !
Say whatever God wills.
Go, go.
You only came seven months ago, stop nagging and drive me home.
What an embarrasment and what a scandal ! Every time he take me to someone's house he asks their driver, how much they give you? Nothing satisfy him and today he asked to raise his salary.
He is making fun of you this driver.
He came less than seven months ago.
He bothered me son, he bothered me.
Send him back him, so that we get rid of him.
Send him back and bring someone else !
Tell your son, he doesn't know what's behind this word ! He doesn't know about what it costs from time, money,
And driving training. Send him back and let's ger rid of him !
The first time you came here to my house before six months ago,
Alright, then I'll say something new for you,
Petrol now is a hundred and fourteen dollar, before the kilo worth a half riyal may be five riyals, everything becomes expensive boss.
Open your mind and listen to what I'm saying !
When you first came here, what was the salary that I give to you?
You gave me seven hundred.
You are still new, new. You came before six months and this eight hundred salary is too much.
I need money.
Those driver you are talking about are old, old, you are new.
This seven hundred is now eight hundred.
Go !
He said I will only give you a hundred riyals raise.
And there is no benefit with three hundred.
What I told you is the right thing?
No, no Shashe. I'll be in trouble when I run away.
No, I'm afraid Shashe.
Who run away from their sponsors.
Why you are afraid?
Becuase before the sponsors of those people
Give them a six hundred to seven hundred salary. Do you know how much they get?
How much you earn?
So, why you are afraid?
I'm not afraid,
God is sufficient of him.
I wake Nassor up and I told him to go and see him.
There was nobody.
He even steal the phone that I bought it for him.
What have you done?
What I've done !
They did all they can do, the took his passport and they put with them.
You can go Oh! Sir, you are excused.
We will look for him everywhere.
That's the problem, that's the problem.
And after all this they run away.
The put us in trouble and they harm us.
I've told you to send him back,
But do you think that I will leave him.
I will find him whatever he is.
He will be back which means that he will be back.
For me I prefer to pay for his ticket and I send him back home rather than letting him to stay here and make money.
I had it up to here, I wish that I can find him.
Man get inside now, no one will buy now.
In the beginning of the match, it seems that you were worried as I've noticed.
But worried about what? We were worried that our team won't score goals.
We need more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you are scared, you were afraid from the opposing team.
I'm not scared about the opposing team, I'm scared about our team. I'm afraid that it won't score more than three.
This our team's level, I know it. I'm speaking about our team's level.
That's a big trust from you.
The opposing team have nothing.
Fantastic ! the Foxes have scored a goal now, you are forward with the first goal.
Where are you going?
I'm going home.
Do you have car?
Come with me, I'll give you a ride.
Thank you man.
Why you are trying, you can't beat our team !
Your honor the match just started and the league just started.
Did you hear what he said?
He said, it's very problematic.
Mahmud, bring the tea !
Now my friend is coming to take me to the stadium, quickly.
Take it Oh! My friend Sajed.
Take it Oh! Pasha.
What he had made of himself?
Yes, he is the indian guy.
Yes, Oh! Man, he is crazy about football.
Don't say such thing about my team Foxes.
They will win, they will win.
Let's go Oh! Sajed, Let's go Oh! Sajed hurry up, hurry up the match will starts hurry up. Bring one water with you, the Foxes will play today.
Our dear viewer, we have with us one of the most famous fans of the Foxes Club who's called Thaaloub.
They are saying that you defeat them because they were incomplete.
What they are saying, what they are saying is not right.
What's incomplete? Every team has a dozen of players.
If one was not there or two, that's won't change anything.
This Fox is very smart.
This is the best fan we have.
Alright, in the occasion of the winning Oh! Thaaloub, A last word that you want to say it to the Foxes.
All the words stop,
When they say the name of the Foxes.
It's name is high in the sky.
This is the good fan.
Listen to me brother,
You can find him excited like that.
Here we go Oh! Handsome.
So, where is the indian guy who's a football fan?
I haven't seen him for awhile?
Oh! Man he is a big star now, he doesn't come here.
I saw the man a few days ago and I didn't recognize him. He was sitting in a coffee shop in Villagio that is called Starbucks or starbocks something like that.
I remember this boy, he came and sit with us in the cafe and he didn't have money for a cup of tea.
He give the boy twenty riyals tip in front of me.
What made him like that?
Oh! [Man}, He sits with important executives at the club, they help him and they do everything he wants.
Can I say something Thaaloub?
Yes uncle.
My uncle it says: whether you go or come,
I don't know why you are supporting a bad and weak club like this club.
This this Foxes is team is my heart.
When you open my heart
You can catch so many foxes in it.
You haven't heard the poem your honor which he wrote it about the referee
When we had a match with them.
Please, please Oh! Thaaloub recite, recite this poem, recite, recite.
Uncle. Oh my God who knows my secret.
My soul is in so much pain.
I don't sleep at all at night,
You know that we the Foxes fan club
You can't tell me the name of the winner, so that I have a scoop.

Mom where is Amoolah, I don't see her with you today?
And she go with her.
My sister doesn't satisfy with Abayas.
Oh Oh! Daughter I didn't tell you Moneera's story with her son Nayeef.
Her son is in the age of Waleed God bless him
And the same height.
Yesterday she was telling me that she don't know what to do with her son.
she wants to take him to the hospital, but her husband Youseef
knew yesterday about the story.
He argued with her and he was yelling at her.
He says why you didn't tell me?
This is a psychological case.
This against the boy's will.
He should take his son and chain him in the middle of the backyard
And later he tell him do it one more time and pees in your bed.
It is much ado like about nothing(Idiom).
What did you say Oh! Um Moneera?
I was telling her eat, eat.
Eat and Bon appetit.
Poor me.
Mom, Mom.
Good that your father didn't know about you,
Otherwise he will kill you from beating.
Alright, go to the bathroom and take a shower before your father wake up and he will do a catastrop for you.
I won't listen to what you are saying,
Poor them,
They are crying and shaking.
I'm afraid that something wrong will happen to my kids.
I have to take them to their uncle to punish them.
I'm nervous.
They didn't fail, they were pass.
Why you will take them to their uncle?
Nassor got fourty eight out of fifty
Why they don't get fifty out of fifty?
There uncle have warned them.
And to be honest, I agree with his point of view.
Forget about emotions,
And my brother should punish them.
Alright, I'll get, I'll get.
This is the last time, this is the last time.
Fifty out of fifty.
He wastes our time and I affirm to them that he is our son.
Why you don't get fifty out of fifty?
Shut up , shut up, shut up, I've warned you, but you don't listen to what I'm saying.
You don't listen to what I'm saying.
Shameless boy !
hit him on more time, let me punish him.
Ouch ! Stop it uncle.
So that next time you revise very well, you revise !
Alright, that's enough.
Do you know what I will do?
I will let you jump one after the other and you will be a falafel.
Be aware of going with your family to public places.
He create misunderstandings for us.
Professor, Waleed is crying.
Why you are crying?
This is an excellent mark.
It is strange that you are crying.
You are suposed to be happy.
Oh! Son, everybody left and even the buses left. You are waiting for somebody to pick you up.
At the school enterance which means that he is waiting for the bus. The bus have arrived and the kids got down.
Have you heard about the boy who commit suicide today?
They gave him his certificate.
And his father threaten him, if he doesn't get the full mark.
Waleed, Waleed. Come back Oh! Waleed come back.
hello and welcome,live, in our new episode of our program"without boundaries"
oil consist of more than thirty five percent of total and different energy sources
while the rest goes to natural Gas, charcoal and hydropower
therefore, oil is considered the number one source energy in the world
Gulf countries and Iran alone owns six hundreds and eighty six billion barrels
followed by Iran with twelve percent then Iraq with ten percent then Kuwait and UAE with nine percent
each of them then comes venezuela with seven percent
then Russia with five percent
Gulf countries and Iran make two thirds of world reserves
Unprecedented prices and exceeded one hundred and nine dollars for the first time in history
and in this episode we are trying to understand a lot of complications concerning oil
and problems facing oil exporting countries
despite its skyrocketing prices
also the problems that citzens and residents face in these countries
because of the inflation and the Unprecedented rise
which will appear next on the screen or they can write for us through our website "www.Aljazeera.net"
because today the market is the key factor
and not the producing countries
today what determines the price is the power of the market
no not the OPEC
of course supply and demand has a part of course
but the other factors are
other factors are political tensions
in the world
and real estate markets
and stock exchange markets and else
and moved to prices in the speculation
of "comodities" like oil for example
and tomorrow will reach one thousand dollar and God knows
oil in two thousand and four jumped from forty four dollar
and today we see that even the prices of petrol
fluctate from day to day
the prices of oil declined below ninety dollar
and increased in the second quarter
Especially with the spring arrival and secondly because most world filters are under maintenance
which always,,, for the second quarter
the seasonal demand for oil declines
in winter it gets below ninety
and all of these indicate that speculation have power and control over the market now
changed a lot means when we go back to the traditional market in the past
the market used to be influenced by the supply and demand
seasonal supply nd demand
today we see that the economical growth is
today or yesterday, the general Falon, the leader of the middle area in afghanistan and iraq, resigned
and his resignation aroused a huge reaction for its relation to what so-called the anticipated US war
political or geopolitical effects
may affect the oil market whether negatively or positively in an expeditious manner
the effect will come for sure and it will have its impact
even,,,Speculators also react to political influences
that may confirm, he will say, some of them will tell you that the US war on Iran is coming
here what will happen to the market? the market will be optimistic in a way
this question, honorable deputy, now in light what the white house
and this have brought back the region to an atmosphere of tension
this is the ambiguity
but Falon may saw this scenario
has a quick reflection on the oil market
today we,,and proven by numbers that there is no shortage
let me give you an example: in the last seven weeks
in the United States of America, their oil reserves increased to more than half of the last five years
means today,,no i mean to say..
not even for the next war because today i tell you even the world have a profitable storage
even the world consumption today, you can pick any country and you will find a long line queues infront of petrol stations
that's another thing
What are the risks posed by this issue
what is the number that you expect will be? i don't know
two hundred or maybe three hundred dollar it could be less but
may reach if these tensions became real tensions
because like you said the Gulf represent sixty percent
in a country that is even away from the oil producing countries
you will see how the influence comes inversely on the oil amrket
and it may reach three hundred dollar
and moved from stocks and else to oil market. today you will see more than two trillion or two trillions of dollars
today we see the print
speculation in it is more than a one hundred a day-means-
that these tensions in the region and awaiting
April ,as it was said before, that it will be the month of setting this war
God knows,,i didn't,,,i mean,,,chiney
in the region because now
this year is the election year
and the current American administration still have few months left only
George Bush the father waged a war on Somal and sent thirty thousands canadians in his last days in the white house
we see but we don't anticipate the events
but i don't think this scenario will happen
because this scenario very expensive
America won't pay a thing, you are the ones who will pay as well as Iran and the consuming countries
America today
now it depends on Africa's oil and it has many other alternatives
look there is no,, let us speak clearly
you said in your introduction that sixty percent
of oil reserves
but now they export twenty two...
of their oil from west Africa
from west Africa and whatever they export from any other region in the world
the oil production
because this is a hard number and Fixed reserves and reserves
what so-called deep water or sea production from great sea depths
therefore, the Gulf will continue to be a difficult number
and the oil of Caspian Sea
and i consider them dreams because its neither fact nor reality
they sabotage it and destroy it
the important means there is
today Qatar is the biggest source of energy in the world
liquefied (LNG) that's why these countries are considered a difficult number
and the countries needs for energy
means for sure that there is something so-called secure supply
and despite the occurrence of an internal objection inside the United States and even on the level of general Falon
but there are still some concerns
about president Bush that hemay
try to observe how political risks doesn't come from Gulf countries
means it came no no no its not about generosity because no one from us deals with generosity
no there is dealing with a lot of generosity
but not "in the current field"
we are not part of a charity work
or being generous
but generous with westerns and not with anyone else
with America precisely
where the market is
where we find economical returns we will go
we won't
such as oil and Gas
you will put it for the sake of generosity
i have the evidence
i have the evidence
is no more than sixty to seventy dollar
not the rise of prices
but the decline of the US dollar in which you insist
you in first place as GCC people and OPEC
that exportation should be in Dollar and you refuse
change currency despite that the currency collapsed and therefore
even though the return is not in your favor
no i didn't say it should be 70
and its the talk of experts not mine
ok the dollar dropped by thirty percent and the oil rose more than this reduction
means if we take the measurement year in two thousand and four
we see that oil prices range between thirty five to thirty six dollar
it is of course means
that oil increased its price
but it is a slight increase honrable deputy
means if we take it
we consider it now
even these prices
i mean if we compare it with two thousand and four
it even exceeded the fall rate of the US dollar
the exciting is
interact with the reduction of dollar
whenever the dollar drops the oil prices rise
this is also a thing that the market started to give it its feeling
our interest now is to lower
no the situation has changed maybe in the beginning of the reduction two years ago they used to say this tlk but the situation changed now and there became
and the dollar started loosing its value against other main currencies such as Euro and sterling
so the question is why linking your currency with with dollar
a weaken currency and doesn't have a cover
this is a historical era
petrol and its derivatives in dollar even the european production in the north sea, Russia and Norway
states that America in the mid-seventies
canceled the gold cover that US dollar had
that's not true
ok than tell me whats true
the OPEC organization includes
four Gulf countries
Qatar, Kuwait, UAE and Saudi Arabia
today the OPEC share of the global market
is forty percent
today if we say that the world consume eighty five million barrels
which deals with dollar in pricing oil
if you put a price with another currency everybody will
you can't
all oil producing countries must agree
you, saudi arabia and Gulf countries, hotshot s
who own 66% of the world reserves are the big people
reserves but i think of it as exporting
including venezuela, Libya and Iran
Cameron, angola and all these organizing countries under the OPEC organization
its share in the market doesn't exceed forty percent
produced and exported from outside the OPEC
and this can't be associated to the forty percent
it can't by itself unless
there are some countries that tried but
not a real attempt
its you who refuse because of the american bondings
from dollar to another currency
all oil producing countries
before it used to export one barrel only
it is loss if they import it
and his currency got really high
and he sell his oil in dollar
in his input or receiver he received it, get his money in dollar then he converted to his local currency
his currency is not attached to dollar
true but he
but its also your problem; you sell in dollar but if your currency is not attached to dollar than you have no problem
my main question now is
what are the concerns and impacts behind attaching your currency to dollar in light of dollar reduction
it has been associated many years ago
especially in the seventies when the dollar used to be a very strong currency and had a huge power
this Disengagement is not that easy
the divorce is easy
no here its not
divorce has its expenses
that works for the benefit of these countries and not against it
in profit and loss
dow jones anounced yesterday that there are 4 countries , there is Qatar
but there is also a report for the Gulf finance saying that there are four Gulf countries of course because Oman left the united Gulf currency
i read a statement in Dow jones and i dont think its a real statement
that the director of the Central Bank of Qatar was exiled
he said yes and said there will be a study but also all Gulf countries must
profit and loss must be examined very carefully away from emotions
leave the subject for examination and till they come
look i can bring you other economists who can come up with another study
that contradicts this study
global house said something really simple and organized and issued in a report in 8 march means
just four days ago
global house id the simple solution and it needs apolitical decision
the political decision can be summed up in two things
not three, first thing
its intention or the five along with Kuwait, about its intention in two thousand and ten to issue the currency or study issuing the united Gulf currency
second point is to issue a resolution to diassemble from the dollar
first regarding the united currency
from my personal view
to see the united Gulf currency
this currency will be powerful
it will be
maybe one of the powerful currencies in the world like you said
and what will come from reserves and huge revenues
therefore we that's what the prime minister focused on when he said
the Gulf countries because no country can do it on its own
unless with a strong economical content
and economical growth today even euro we see it
of course you shouldn't forget that the central bank has a big role
in evaluating
and calculating profit and loss
from all these news
tense situation
two thousand and eight like obeservers said, global house said that this inflation will continue
for a long time in Gulf countries but the solution is in the hands of governments
some countries raised the saleries to seventy percent like UAE
to stop the inflation process that
and here is my question now when will you raise the saleries of those poor people
i will hear your answer after a short commercial
about today's episode: oil reserves and the daily production of GCC countries saudi arabia
has two hundred and sixty four billion reserves
and two out of ten barrels
and produce nine out of ten daily
million and Kuwait one hundred and one and a half and produce one billion and produce two and seven out of ten millions
Qatar fifteen and twelve billion and produce eight hundred and fifty thousand Oman five and six out of ten billion and produce seven hundred and seven thousand
Bahrain one hundred and twenty five million and produce thirty five thousand
and it was thirty eight billion total revenue per year
from two thousand and three to two thousand and seven
Europe one hundred billion
sixty billion in middle east and forty billion
in Asia and other countries
while the total local production of the GCC countries in two thousand and six was seven hundred and seventeen
the gross in two thousand and seven is seven hundred and ninety nine and seven out of ten billion expected
to be in two thousand and eight nine hundred and twelve and one out of ten billion
while the inflation that keeps on swallowing the employees saleries and people working in this area
but it will increase in two thousand and eight to three and eight out of ten
Kuwait is forteen percent but in two thousand and eight it is expected to be eight and nine out of ten UAE
will be ten while saudi Arabia was six and a half and it will reach six
and eight out of ten
saleries are being eaten
so what are the amounts and percentages that you will give to the poor people here
if we want to solve the problem
a real solution
always saleries always increasing saleries
is not the solution
i'm not against raising saleries
that's not true, i, that's not true
we always
there is of course a believe
the case of increasing, the increase without controling the inflation will make the inflation eat up all these raises
to solve the inflation which is a hiah committee that includes all expert and specialists
and now this committee puts
because increaing saleris in the world
and of course the economical golden rule says
it won't have an end
and no matter how
much saleries increases and no matter how much increases
the inflation will increase
the solution is a must and it must
with a scientific study here bait.com institute which is specialized in recruitment made a study with the help of the British Yougov siraj
they made a scan on fifteen thousands employees working in Gulf countries in twenty sectors of the key sectors
especially experts and those with careers there is no job satisfaction
because the inflation here started swallowing
especially those whith experience
are thinking to move from these countries where inflation keeps eating
now you will loose
this is the easy concept and you put the easy concept and try to implement it
the solution for inflation is increasing saleries
the balance is there
it is there
we are anxious and the state is anxious and we are trying the best we can
to solve this issue with a real solution
always temporarly solutions do not solve the problem but increase it
increase it means
we hope we will have more time till this committee puts
all applications
this is boredom and you excellency
boredom will always be
right but the state tried and patched the raises with forty percent
no here is an important point in the topic of increases
in terms of raises you only wqant Qataris as if non-qataris work for burkina faso and zimbabwe
you take into account qataris and you dont take into account not expatriates
while the highest percentage is in it
you ahmed are living in Qatar and not Germany
and everybody talk about this and suffer
a way higher saleries than government sector
and on the contrary we saw
in the government sector
and on the contrary government sector become
because best units and competencies started
i also read a report and as you know we are in the oil field
of labor
like our experts
engineers and workers who come from outside Qatar
because we as well interact with the global market
for all these things what is the rate of increase in saleries
hope is with God almighty but we say
that the government has a plan
and i say to control the inflation is more important
than temporarly solution
and we will see and i'm sure
that there will be
positive results
will be in the edge of fifteen percent
ok the second nice report is saying that twenty two billion from oil will come to you and forty three billion from Gas
no comment, its not the process of sprinkling
procedure and of course we are
but the talk about the economical growth must also reflect on people
and it did reflect any economical growth today, Qatar owns the highest economical growth in the world
and vice versa
the huge "conveyors" in the country is also part
and if it wasn't for these huge "conveyors" and big projects
in this country it wouldnt also be part of inflation
resulted in some of the inflation
and this too led to a lot of cash in the market
first concerning the association of dollar with oil
pawned oil for the sake of protection
from united states of america and therefore stability in power
thank you
Saad Al-Ghamdi from Sudi Arabia your question saad
Peace, mercy and blessings of Allah
truely its a good episode and a good title
what i really want to talk about is that the region now goes under the American policies
american policy in its war now in addition to the cultural one that its trying to make against Islam there is a world economical war
now in china
and the American inability reached also with Japan sixty one billion dollar
and Japan already has invested in two thousand
with america to what equivalent to nine
billion while it is investing now with the European union with more than twenty seven billion dollar
to keep up with the american policy and to make the dollar inevitable currency for the whole world
brother i say the buy now
and the Gulf region will become
as a place
thank you brother Saad
Mohammad Alwaseef from Egypt
hello to excellency deputy who is with you
Arab rulers in the middle east ,your excellency, remind me of
when there is
when there are demands to adjust the prices
adjust the saleries in returns for the prices just as you said your excellency
in Qatar we used to consider you as a prototype
and persist on not promising with the raise this is so Arabic style
we want, we consider Qatar as abo treka
he has the right to say what he wants do you have a question, its certainly his right, he is responsible for this policy
the question first
his excellency must put under consideration
this is one second he should respond to public opinion
with the poor like you said because they are the people of the countries that needs special care
Arab leaders who doesn't care about the poor
peace upon you
upon you peace
good evening to you and good evening to his excellency
i want a raise as well
saleries are excellent and good that's good
ok thank you for the subject in which we need and we suffer from it
i am with the poor and will always be by God's will and we know that there are no poors in Qatar and we are sure
and make the judgment that Qatar like what he said that money goes to the ruling family and to the governor
and that's the important question now
lets first answer the brothers
can not judge
what happens to the wealth
now there are new cities almost to be such as the pearl and lusail and other places means even qatar is expending
this is not the case the caseis
a propriate urban plan
in short because we still have two minutes tell us what will Qatar go for
Qatar now, there is Qatar post-oil and gas
there is a clear policy for the state
because it is
non-renewable asset
because it is non-renewable asset
therefore today the trend in the state of Qatar
the capital of middle east in education
today we see the educational city
today this educational city includes the best faculties in the world
building medical cities, media cities and financial cities
because today oil and gas
no of course we do not imitate anyone
the other satellite channels
not only Aljazeera, you will make one hundred jazeera and we don't stand aljazeera of course
because my brother these countries our countries in the Gulf now
in the seventies mutation now everybody remember the seventies mutation
now when we see what Qatara has from growth
and this calls for a special episode about Qatar in post oil
with our vision about oil, it's future and it's resources in the region especially in Qatar. in conclusion my greetings to the program team
i'm Ahmed Mansour and i greet you from without boudaries and peace be upon you
peace, mercy and blessings of Allah upon you
greetings live this week from the capital of Qatar, Doha
and i welcome you in a new episode of our show "without boundaries"
in the same time that Qatar holds the largest American military base outside the United States which is Al-udaid Air base
with the enemies of the United States in the the region
such as Iran and Syria
its doors are open for the leaders
in fact leaders of Hamas enjoy special connections with the Qatari leadership
as also the Emir of Qatar was the only Arab leader
who visited the southern suburbs in Beirut that was destroyed by Israel during the lebanon war summer of two thousands and six
and still an unlimited support to restore what Israel destroyed in Lebanon
and at the time that Qatar reconciled
with its elder sister the Saudi Arabia about two years ago
at the same time Skirmishes with the regime in Egypt
such as the lebanese file where it succeeded when others failed
to gather Lebanese leaders in Doha where they signed an agreement that led them safely
to the final elections
also difficult files
that cared to be the engine of these files and not Qatar
the smallest Arab country
and in today's episode
we try to understand the basis and the rules from which the foreign Qatari policy started off
and to whose benefit
Qatar, the smallest country geographically and demographically, perform these big roles
and what are the qualifications that ables it to do
and that will be in a direct dialogue with the Qatari prime minister and minister of foreign affairs
and for our viewers who wish to partcipate they can call us through our show numbers that will appear next on the screen
the visit that the Emir of Qatar made
the roar Aljazeera channel cannons in order to improve the connections with Saudi Arabia
from the past such as the attempt of Saudi Arabia to take over the Qatari government with the help of Al-mirra tribe
in its edition that was published on the twentieth of last June
what is the nature of the secret transaction
in the name of God the merciful and kind
a lot of things that aren't
what i think is accurate
i many interviews here in this show i always said that the accurate is that
and that we consider it the spine
of the GCC countries
there was a misunderstanding
moreover, the
and different point of views
its true that the case of boundaries was done and it was a major obsticle
the saudi-Qatari historical ties were special
these ties if we observed
between the two countries and both families
ruined by misunderstanding
neither by us nor them
because there is no conditions between brothers
and its done and now the relations are in a status that i can assure that its very excellent
in the benefit of the cooperation council
but how the situation between Aljazeera and Saudi Arabia was improving while Aljazeera was the obsticle and the reason that led in two thousand and two
there is an important point
and i repeat if you turn back to all programs i was always saying
not only the big sister but i used to say that our dependence in the cooperation council on
that Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region
and we give value to our relation with it
there was media some heated media exchange and that was obvious for both parties
these countries find themselves
unsuccessful when brothers agreed
especially the Saudi- Qatari house
rather they found themselves in a conflict
where there is no camel
and i don't think its a strategy from anyone who was in this conflict
but excuse me sheikh allow me to put things in its frame or dots above letters
a lot of observers find that Aljazeera in the past couple of years
in the time where still the situations that were criticized on Aljazeera screen
by what's going inside Saudi Arabia
whether the arrested people or opponents or else are still standing
Aljazeera stoped handling these issues
evem aljazeera coverage of pilgrimage turned to
praise for the system and what the custodian of the two holy mosques do in a time that differs
first you can ask Aljazeera management about this subject dont ask me becasue i
that combines both countries
for the stabilty of the region
this strategy continued and strengthened the stability of the region
the region you mean the gulf region
the Gulf region
there are many cases surrounding the Gulf region
also the call of the custodian of the two holly mosques in Kuwait
he had an impact on all listeners and on the whole Arab world
he spoke from his heart about settling arab differences and over come it and buried it
not only in point of views
no it is in the policies and the policies are point of views
in the Arab world is considered
a kind of war
while in the developed world
talking about the same interest
now you stayed for many years
the situation now
listen first
there is a difference between this subject and the other one
the idea of a small country going against the bigger ones and make them feel vulnerable
every difference or misunderstanding
had its reasons
and its reasons are over
over because of the wisdoms of our two leaders
are there any insurances for the future relation
there are gurantees between two parties
based on love brotherhood and interest that joins both countries
and the leaders, their talk is considered more than a document
between Qatar and Saudi to develop this relation
and we hope so much from this Saudi-Qatari relation to develope
for the best and there will be more fields
for this relation like what we have with other Arab countries, other Gulf countries
for Qatar is an important country
ok so Saudi Arabia is an important country
what is Egypt to Qatar? because whats bad is that at the same time that you have conciled with Saudi Arabia
and three orginization which are Hizbollah
which is Aljazeera channel
or against the regime in Egypt the largest Arab country
first let me start with this
the Egyptian people
and we respect the Egyptian nation
and its interest
with a lot of Arab causes and the sacrifices of the Egyptian nation
and this case
someone would beleive that we are trying through this case to reach an understanding with the brothers in Egypt
in light of what you are saying that you respect Egypt and the Egyptien people
and we think he is a good person
our differences with Egypt is in two points
or one point
we were accused that we were planning to overthrow Ghaza and i don't think
and we don't get involve
in cases that belong to other countries
doesn't beleive in interfering with any country's affair unless if there is a room for reform
does it mean that you interferd with the overthrown that was made by hamas against the authority in Ghaza
of course i dont deny actually we didn't know about this as much as others new about it from media
we have relations with Hamas and we have relations to others
what made Egypt be different or to have a dispute between both of you in this point
i will come to this
Hizbollah conspiracy
hizbollah and
but i speak for my country
we were very astonished by this subject
shook for the benefit of Qatar
what pyramids said
the pyramids said
to attack Egypt and its status
can i reply
we go back to the conspiracy which they mentioned
the days will reveal this
the start was not from the Ghaza conference
and i exonerate the Egyptian people and president Hosney Mubarak from it
if we go way back to Almina conference
after the Madrid conference, do you remember Al-mina that was held in Doha
and that was an agreement and when the conference was going to be held with us
they said we don't want to hold the conference
people, we know that you coordinate with Israel
toward Qatar and this is
what we try to understand why
we sat and we talked and talking is always good
have two parts
what are they
there is a disagreement
in the political orientation
if we look to Algaza conference that took place
his highness prince spoke with all presidents and among them his brother president Hosney Mubarak
and we were informed by a foreign country
the brothers in Egypt have a point of view in the matter that it should't be held
and people are being killed while we are watching
if you don't want it to be held in Doha we can hold it in any place in the arab league
and it will be chameful to discuss the case in the Kuwait conference byplay
by Israel and the western world stand and sees what's happening
when we all said ok now this is common and there is no power and no strength save in Allah we as Arabs can't stop it, neither a large country stopped this fight
Egypt's declaration request to stop the hostilities in Ghaza, an hour later the fight stopped
so even us
we shouldn't take the Arab street with such naivety, our disagreement with the brothers is in one point
and this is in the international norms
and not enough hospitals and doctors being arrested at the borders
you were the ones standing at the borders
there and no one could enter
the brothers didn't take it very well
because Ghaza is next to Egypt and its considerd a part of the national properties
when we talk about any humanitarian issue anywhere in the world, we only talk about a humanitarian issue
and we respect the supremacy in Egypt
and we know its stance but this doesn't harm the Egyptian stance
and we hope for so much from Egypt
is the largest Arabic country
and we think that it can deliver our voices and voices of others from the Arab world
to all the other parties
even the rescue mission following Ghaza
that Europeans tried to save it
what happened in Ghaza
whether its a conference providing and so and i consider it a rescue to the government
we were not invited to a conference we were called to coordinate between GCC countries
and we were gathered in the cooperation council
these amounts wont be issued to any party
rather it will be issued to
the affected parties in Ghaza
directly and this was
because it's not allowed to enter and from each side
i rejoyce for Egypt and all the whole people in Qatar rejoice for Egypt because Egypt
Egypt's victory in the political issues is very important for us
but you are anticipating
just give me two minutes
one minister was braging to what has been denied and said
and whoever harm Egypt we will cut his leg and break his arm
honestly i think this official has offended his country
as matter of fact they didnt fail and they didn't talk about anything but themselves
what helped them in this and i've said this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia, saudis intervened because the king has a wisdom in this matter
to wrap things up in the Arab world
we agreed
that the king will decide that this is in the best interest
we accepted the king Abdullah's decision because we respect him and trust him
but for one to say that we stopped them it is even an insult for those who they have stopped
as if they were students at a school
i think that this is
the limit was reached
thinks that he should Impose his strength
we are sorry we are sorry about this
if you think that a small state doesn't have the right, its rights are taken from it the right
and you are barging in and puting you noise in Darfour
it's an Arab decision in the Arab league
African decision and a decision from the united nations
i think the main issue is
Hizbollah conspiracy in addition to Qatar
a conspiracy of i don't know what in Qatar
if it happened probably after the swine flue that it appeared somewhere Qatar will be the reason behind the spread of this epidemic
Qatar is a peaceful country it knows its size and potentials
but Qatar has a point of view
Qatar has a descrete policy
if Qatar can solve any Arabic matter we consider it an honor
because any Arab dispute
we think that any Arab dispute can weaken our position infront our major cases which are Palestine and all the other cases that we are facing
the Arab world became a receiver
even our analysis became like their analysis
western analysis
but there is a matter that we know about it we know what happened in Pakistan
in a way that i want someone to receive me and roll out the red carpet for me in Washington
is anyone blaming Qatar
did Qatar offended any Arabic country
tried to contribute with money
These contributions are provocative
i can pass by to say peace upon you and you would say: you are saying hi to provoke me
this is another case it means that you have a problem or you have a deficiency
this case doesn't concern me it concerns you
but if you have internal issues
we always say it
especially after the speech of the custodian of the Two Holy Mosques king Abdullah
in kuwait and i know that this man is honest
a man who speaks what is in
his heart i always say this
i always say this
i always say that even in the middle of our dispute with Saudi Arabia i used to say that
and you can go back to all the documents that you have in Aljazeera but
that the case differs no no
from one part so we said no that's it we stop at this situation
and we tried as much as we can
i don't want to get into this subject
to see their own matters and where are their mistakes
and we see our mistakes it doesn't mean that everything we have is right
are you refering this your excellency sheikh
to the presence of internal problems in Egypt
and they want to get out of it
do you deny that Qatar is contributing in any form of conspiracy against Egypt externally and trying to break its relation with Turkey and any other country
it looks like we have super powers
and they are seventy million if we can do,,no eighty million
they also have a problem need to be resolved
that you have played a role in the case of the soldier Shalit despite your knowledge that this file is important for the Egyptian government
and you sought with the French
we received a call from a friendly country
that there is a case that we need to handle we said brothers this case belong to the Egyptians they said
we want to see this case as a request
from Israel and another country that we want to see another part to see this
when we saw this we told them if the same conditions from the brothers to speak to the brothers in Egypt
and we declared this i mean is there an official who can say we are in the sense that he deceived the Arab league
this means that he is a poor fellow
how did he let it pass us by
to let the president Mahmoud Abaas stay
and we supported this
is he addressing his people is he addressing us is addressing the Arab world
the problem is from you
i think this is a healthy phenomenon
i don't own Aljazeera as accused
and Aljazeera must enter the media competition such as there is so many medias in the west
there are so many media entities and at their teen time all of them curse each other
but after a while they will reach the stage of maturity
it could be or it could be not
first our situation with Saudi Arabia is different
and even if we compromise for Saudi Arabia we accept that in Qatar
important relations
and Egypt is an important country but there is particularity in the relationship with Saudi Arabia
also there is a particularity between Egypt and any other Arab country Egypt is the largest country
that's true but we have history with Saudi and the relationship differs
its a personal dispute between some officials here and there
we respect the Egyptian president
i hope that it would be limited to a disagreement in policies in point of views
i told you the problem when there was an attack over Ghaza
the second problem is that they have problems with us and till now we didn't know what did Qatar do to cause it
why don't you try now to set a meeting between the Egyptian president and the Emir
Saudi Arabia Intervened in this matter
and as it was leaked to the newspapers they said at first it was a secret meeting then we found it the next morning
that there was a meeting between me and Omar solayman
in Saudi Arabia
a repture with no return
and i can't tell you that we agree on everything
let us say so no one would explain it as no you are comparing yourselves
but dignity is dignity whether with youngs or olds
the minister said if Egypt got the appropriate satisfaction
satisfation between kids
i don't think so Egypt is bigger than this i think he didn't find the right expression
do you have a vision on how to solve problems with Egypt or are you like the Egyptian people wait for a divine intervention
please i don't want to talk about a divine intervention or else becasue olnly God knows who will live and who will die
and i pray
someone deluded him that there will be a method
and our pride in Egypt
that there must be a certain way
it will either stand with me or stand against me
and whatever pain the Arab citizen feels
in the Arab world we suffer with him and this is the policy of His Highness Prince
Countries derives its power from sources of power
the united states has the sources of power of china the sources of power of France and the source of power of small state like Qatar
our faith in God
which is clear that
you are trying
but we are a small country and i put that under consideration
and i will repeat it one hundred times
so that no one would say that we have any sensibilities
that no one will take from us
for Israel, you have been tickled now
ok before i go to israel
how can you solve the problem with Egypt
whats the problem now
and everyday they provide a complain to America if i can tell you the big countries you were talking about
they deal with us based on interest and so as we
all the complaints and all
in order to sabotage the relation
i think any great country that does that will affect its image
it will also affect our Arabic pride if we run complaining about each other
everything come and we know everything
our solution is based on the Arab interest
and we are here for them if they needed anything
Are there any steps next to repair the relations
but i know that there are good relations between the president and his higness Emir
if there is anyone who is pulling strings
against the bonding of the two countries and the two leaderships he will find himself losing
no it could be tomorrow it could be after ten years i honestly don't know but from our side if anyone invited us to a conference we will be there
anyone will invite us to a conference we will attend and if we have a point of view we will say it in the conference
we can't
because Egypt is our older sister but we have point of views and we discuss together
This is all that is required whenever the time comes we will be very pleased
that got canceled because of this policy
and as i said we respect the Egyptien people
of course you are asking about how many contracts were canceled, ask how many Egyptien came to Qatar at the same time
but as a state policy as i told you the Egyptien people in Qatar is so close to our heart
now in the fourth of last june you have tinkled the emotions of the Arab nations when you have closed the israeli office it was published in Arts on the fourth of june
why you are saying that we tinkled them if we wanted to tinkle them we would have close it twelve years ago
when everybody had a compaign before reconciling with Israel and before there were secret meetings between Arab countries and Israel
and after the reconciliation of most Arabs
with Israel whether under the table or on the table or they talked to it in any way
if we wanted to tinckle emotions we would have tinckled it in previous Islamic conference
in the united nations the ally of Abdul Naser held a banquet at the Israeli ambassador Gabriela Shalev
he was one among many guests who attended this banquet and i don'tt know for what reason the embassador held it
becasue in the united nations we sit next to Israel and no one can deny this
or we find a glimmer of hope to push the anguish from our Palestinian brothers
now the management have changed and i had a small space for the issue of Egypt but unfortunately
it wasn't me it was you
my question is about the United states and the new management and its impact on your relationship (you Qataris) with the United States with the The presence of the largest military base in Qatar
there are differences in point of views
serious in solving many cases in the region
and if they are serious we will help them as much as we can
we expect a special relationship or a solution to the problems that existed between you and the management of Bush
a lot of these cases were solved
the Emir of Qatar spoke yesterday in Paris about what is happening in Iran
and you have special relations with Iran even though its relation to the united states is bad
first we have to put it in the frame of the internal affairs becasue we have to respect every country and its internal affairs
Lebanon after elections
before the elections Saad Al-Hariri said in this program that Doha agreement ends with the establishment of the elections
is this your vision as well or do you see the agreement still standing or you will have to come up with a new agreement
the Doha agreement was for a stage that will make them do peaceful elections
a year and half passed since the Doha agreement
we were following it day by day minute by minute until they reached the elections according to the Doha agreement
that we interfered lately In one of the electoral districts to correct some misunderstandings that happened
but you still have something to do with the arrangements in Lebanon
we are always close to lebanon you know how Qataris love Lebanon and like going there
the first country i visted after a western country is Lebanon
a question and a quick answer about what is going on in Yemen
you have interfered in the case of hotheen and there are some accusations saying that you have supported them
or your interference put them face to face with the state and now there is a bigger danger which is the danger of the south
and we suffered a lot and this refers to why we stand here and not standing there in Qatar
and indeed we faced so much pressure but this was our vision and this was the stance of his highness Emir
the houtheen topic
and its stability affect us positvely and the instabilty affect us negatively
we interfered with an honest mediation between two parties
and we signed an agreement
but i understand if this was meant to be used for other reasons
and to be there with them and we always stood with them in all cases
and its not based on fact
i see that there is no need for us
we sell it
i say this with an appology because i know there is a large arab audience who disagree with me
Dear viewers, thank you as well for your listening, hoping that we explained to you some of the foreign policy of Qatar
In conclusion, greetings from the program team , and this is Ahmed Mansour greeting you from Without Borders
may the peace and blessings of allah be upon you
dear viewers God's peace upon you and welcome to this special interview
Ben Jasim Ben Jabr Al-Thani the prime minister and the minister of foreign affairs of the state of qatar
of course why do I say special and extraordinary interview? it is because
Qatar and this man precisely was the main sponser
sir, one simple and direct question
i think it happened because there was an Arab consensus from the beginning
and we tried that when we went to the united nations
the arab consensus was important and the lebanese management from both sides was important
to reach some results
its very important that the external interference
too many opinions and suggestions from outside
Arab Lebanese and international if you want to say
it went through stages bit it meant
that there is nothing unless it means these stages were there
does it mean that the complications in lebanon
since the time of truth
I mean when you were gathered and entered now directly on the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file.
have you discovered that the Lebanese complex is huge
Lebanese Arabic international regional that needs a significant decoding
or is it a simple complex but was magnified due to external intervention
because we know that lebanon is a beacon for the press a beacon for Culture a beacon for tourism and a beacon for many things
lebanese shouldn't allow
to affect peace and security in lebanon
the number one problem
is the external repercussions in lebanon
you suddenly decided after twenty four hours to take everybody in one plane
from the plane directly to meet the Emir of Qatar
they didn't even expect it they couldn't rest for one minute unless you were kind enough to let them
the secret is to not let them rest and think much
and make a lot of calls
we pose the idea of bringing them to doha because we need an atmosphere
or you will gather them with a lot of difficulties
and in many circumstances
we let them out of these circumstances to circumstances where they can find a solution
that if we wanted to succeed than we have to let them out of this atmosphere
and quickly
God made us succeed with the venetian statement or the beiruti statement
and we succeeded because they agreed to go to Doha
parties decided to go to Doha
some thought that Qatar is more bias to one party over the other
and from Beirut but
the policy of his highness that if we were intermediates
in this process
ok Frankly
have you seriously consulted
With the main parties concerned at least with what is happening here in lebanon kingdom of Saudi Arabia and syria
especially the brothers in the kingdom of saudi arabia i spoke with Emir Saoud
and he showed his support to the idea
We benefited from Emir Saoud that we
everybody needed a solution
its justifications are weak
if we depend on logic
its justifications are weak
should have been removed because there is tension in palestine
there is the case of the Iranian nuclear
the arab league must have a mechanism to solve cases
is the African union better than us in solving cases
and try to gather parties
and set conferences to find solutions then why Arabs who have ancient bonds can't
gather arabs or gather parties if there is or Intervene to support the the oppressed
that should be under study
if we want to have a wake up call for the arab league not the league the arab world
the arab league is just a tool for implementation
one of the officals was here which is the president Nabeeh barri
requires an s-s
now it looks like the lebanese agreed
well listen we
and on top of them qatar
didn't lead one day to a result
for the arab interest
it will be considered a strength for the arabs
we tried it
in the united nations when we went for the Doha agreement
and the agendas made for the solution and not for other reasons
there is no doubt that
and more important role in the entire arab world
to put
stop it with our agreement
to others to come and help us
because this is a dangerous matter but
why have we reached a stage where everybody is playing in our yard
in our yard
it very important to put ahead the interest of our people
now we need an arab league after this agreement to see what are we going to do with our palestinian brothers
what are we going to do for Somal
what are we going to do for Somal isn't it a member in the arab league
Sudan is not in the arab league! Iraq is not in the arab league! why don't we try
we are part of the arab world and a small one
i wish this won't be a suggestion this idea
Qatar is in good relation with syria and Saudi Arabia
i think that first if we were not asked to do something we will do what we can
but i'm sure that his highness King Abdullah
king of Saudi Arabia Kingdom
and his fellow brother president Bashar
because historically Saudi and syria had an agreement
can only be a passing phase
and we will find with God's will
still though i insist on the question if that's ok with you is it possible that you take a role in this part
even if not in public now you kind of owning trust
any rapprochement between arab countries we seek in it
and this have been the policy of his highness since the beginning but this matter
what happened in Lebanon does it indicate that the region is on the verge of serious adjustments
or what happened in Lebanon is local and lebanese matters of region still
not attached to this situation
i wish the contrary i wish that this is
the beginning of a new phase in the arab world
we can create
will happen in another place
in another meaning your excellency are you affraid that the escalation that existed a period ago
at least from now till the end George Bush presidency
there is no doubt that i still have concerns about palestine now the matter of Ghaza
i want to ask
we don't need anything else
request that i take care of the humanitarian side in palestine
we can't deliver them medicine
nor food
electricity for the patient who is in the hospital
the one who will die when electricity shut down
i wish
that the arab league agree on amount for this matter food and medicine we call it food and medicine
we don't want the Red Crescent to deliver it
let the red cross deliver it
but pardon me the arab side is commited to this israeli siege
i don't want to go through details i'm just saying that we as arabs should deliver medicine and food even if we disagree with Hamas
the saudi arabia kingdom made a huge efford and they pledged in the holy kaaba
because this disagreement will only benefit the other party
saying not to deal with this party because we will find you the solution is not true
and i
till now i have no signs of solution
are you afraid of an american iranian encounter in the coming period or do you expect it
this is possible of course
at least I speak about Qatar
iran is an important neighbour for us
we may not agree with all their policies or they may not agree with our policies in Qatar
for example they tell us we don't want you to have relations or connections with israel
maybe there are who consider you necessarily to be part of it because of the American bases found there
we know how to deal with this
There are those who said that after the visit of the Emir of Qatar to Saudi Arabia
he may met or consulted or spoke with the Saudi host
in Istanbul of negotiations between syria and israel
and i can say it was a coincidence
the second topic the Saudi kingdom was eager to find a solution and i was Communicating with Prince Saoud
what happened in the last hours
Change tactic change the tactics of the negotiations
from your part or other parts
we as responsible for
and from all parties and we closed the room on ourselves
and finally we found ourselves... then his highness intervention was very important
and from it the intervention work out
without mentioning it now it is over
and his message was clear when he said we know our size and location and our role and so on as if he
wanted to take a role without provoking any other party
whether arab or national or regional
but eventhough
have become a responsibility
did you want that or not
we are trying to prevent some jealousy because we as a state
that these countries
can do or
i think this will be the profitable combination
the last question your relationship with Washington is it for long term is it normal or special
i can say that our relationship with washington is good
it doesn't mean that we don't have different point of views in cases
but this is our right if they talk about democracy this is democracy
how is it good how can you interpret it on the ground
if we talk about economy its excellent if we talk about education its excellent
also health but if we talk about politics i can say its good
in your opinion and make it clear in the next stage
in my opinion we leave israel confrontation on the side
and if we wanted to stop the play in the arab court
and fix enmity between palestinians
We agree on one opinion so that we can be a respectable strength
i don't think we have
to be something effective
thank you dear viewers for your follow-up and we will meet again with God's will my regards
Welcome to our viewers to this dialogue with the prime minister and the Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
in this dialogue
We are trying to explore the political reality of the Arab and the Arab efforts
Excellency Sheikh Welcome
to investigate what is happening in Ghaza
and i wish through this dialogue that we can
shed the light on some of your questions
the Israeli entrance to Ghaza in a savage way
and our goal was to have a united arab stand
Dealing with friendly countries
and fellow countries
And how to find a clear and strong Arab position that the Arab countries
And then, we find areas of reconciliation
From our site we know that more than one Arab country has been violated
in an abusive manner
and no one was punished while
we get punished for everything whether intentionally or not
we are the specialized people
in the world and the only ones who are always targeted
always disciplined in a way
i think
To the extent that we won't be able
to gather on the level of leadership
to stop the discipline compaign
We didn't want to create a crack in the Arab world
And there were five other verbal approvals
with two-thirds majority
But the aim of the meeting is not
in which they wish it to be the right one and our point of view to be wrong because the goal
is to solve the problem and not to do a summit
but will it be solved At the expense of the Palestinians blood
what we asked for now is that the ministerial doesn't cancel the request of Qatar
and which was also confirmed by his highness
in the speech that he made that we don't insist that it would be in Qatar if it will cause any embarssement we don't insist that the summit take place in Qatar it can be wherever
an Arab stance where others respect us
yes and for the ministerial
we want to tell them that the Security Council resolution was issued
and israel
was not involved in the decision and it continued killing and bombing in Gaza and still does
and i need to ask the Arab what are we going to do about it
what are we going to do
is it when israel is done
To apply the remainder of the Security Council resolution
or there will be a stand since israel didn't stop
shooting, we don't force our brothers
to a decision that is considered over
few days ago
we will talk about the ministerial meeting
you will support this eventually
of course we support to hold an Arab summit and this was our idea and some of the other countries as well requested the summit syria yemen
already an arab crack there
or they sorted us to the camp of moderation
and the camp of non-moderation
and what do they mean with non-moderation
that was sorted by the west
as moderated and non-moderated Arabs
you won't find a moderated nation or non-moderated nation
and we want to know what is moderation and what is non-moderation does moderation mean following israel plans
and end the case in a humiliating manner
or we just need to let the case open
i mean this is an important question
are the countries
are following israel schemes and want to solve problems in ways
i don't want to say that it follows israel schemes and i don't want to accuse anyone
but i say
if we called a camp moderation
what is moderation in the eyes of the west
do we agree to slaughter a certain category of Palestinians
of course elcetions took place
i'm not a supporter nor an opponent to hamas but i speak out of an existing
the existing fact is that there is
an idea
what some people call radical movement
but we have to ask ourselves what does this radical movement is aking for
for something other than its rights or is it asking for its rights
or are we going to sort them
and create other masses as well
against because we
internal arab and intellectual
and its starting to happen
Therefore we do not want to fight in a war on behalf of others
yes excellency sheikh in short
who prevented the Arab Summit
i can't say prevented there were some efforts and the topic is semi-known
the topic of prevention
but as i said we could have
take a vote and get the two-thirds
but this wasn't the aim because its not the issue of challenge as much as it is the issue of an urgent need that's what we think
while others thought its not an urgent need
we went to the security council
or there is a resolution in the security council
But the decision is for the Security Council, israel said that it will finish then it will consider the topic
all that i want to focus on again
we won't be making efforts to implement the resolution on the weaker party
what will make it different than the first meeting
for the alteractions sometimes disagreements take place
as much as
will we be ready to have a clear arab stand
hunmanitarian aids
supporting our brothers significantly
also to adress the israelian party and tell them
i don't think everybody are ready for that, we suppose to investigate this
why not we freeze it
eighty four and we are committed to the truce eighty four and the israeli were not committed
its normal to have altercations in meetings but as matter of fact these altercations
represent situations and whats in their heart
one of the altercations that was being notified is
that there was someone who described Hamas movement as dispersion
nor even the few
this situation occured and we responded to it and there was me one brother from the ministers
and i think this is what the west is saying
that these are radical movements, fragmentation, and other nouns
and we don't want to be the others' men
and therefore it always mean and i don't mean anyone by it
any foreigner they found
or a western country or western countries find
among arabs
ok now your excellency sheikh
the call for a second ministerial meeting
its agenda should be one thing
where are you Arabs from all this and what is the stand of the nation of three hundred and something
one million israeli marketed
which was issued following the decision one thousand and sixty eight
the issued decision
israel didn't implement it, it will implement it after finishing the mission
and there is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort
that should be thankful for in this decision
for us to request the seventh chapter because israel is above the law, israel
and if it has been questioned they will say we understand
its not the fault of arabs if they
if its like that israel will not been questioned
and it's above the interantional law
that's a fact
why did you go to the security counsil and why did you link the arab summit with what will be issued from the security council
in the summit, the security council will try for us
it needs a hard decision
a decision that
can make an official loose his position
we were being terrified by the west
and we work hard after they make their decision
i don't want to go out of the subject
those who made the attack to reconstruct Iraq entirely on their expense because they are the ones who destroyed it
lets us not demand the Iraqi government nor demand for the people who died
there are no compensations
exactely same thing in Sudan when they started talking about Al-bashir trial
your excellency
your excellency sheikh
a big arab diplomatic victory in the security council
listen, they had some difficulties in the security council because the first speech was about a presidential statement
the consequences
of israel did not comply with it
it will Will comply with it after two days, after a week, after it finishes the mission
because they didn't compile with it
sorry but people should compile
because israel agreed after it finished the mission
do you have an alternative for the decision now
all what we did
some brothers unfortunately with some efforts
they participated in the siege of Ghaza
i am a friend with the west and i don't mind that we have any relation with the west and i'm not
against the west not against America
but these people know the language of interests
your friends if you are strong
or if you have a point of view
and in the end they will take one percent of our point of view and we say we won
what is victory
with what contained
i can't say now anything about the precautions because the decision was not
and the council is its own master
you took part in the formation
yes we participated in the formation to some extent
but you were not invited to the meeting with the arab ministers and the american minister of foreign affairs
but i beleive that the brothers who went are enough
you referred to arab parties for certain interest
in this regard your excellency sheikh
For two years until the moment
listen i don't want to talk about accusations
i can't pretend that we were informed with everything
if they are people who
there was an israeli refusal an international refusal and we contributed as well to this refusal
and from here the dispute started and the siege began
and last month israel killed twenty eight palestinian during the truce
and we let them starve till they burnout because we don't want them to be in authority
those parties your excellency sheikh
state clearly that the palestinian dispute
i mean if there was
who created the palestinian dispute maybe there was a palestinian dispute
to say to one party no you are right one hundred percent
i'm not saying that hamas is one hundred percent right
i don't claim that and i'm not saying that
but, the intermediate is usually in the middle at the same distance from everyone
and not only the intermediate but also us as Arabs are at the same distance from everyone
but not wanting it to exist therefore we should terminate it in any possible way
Once by training troops right and left
and once by surrounding them and not give them money nor saleries
and once we create a positive model in the west bank
to let the people in Ghaza see how the people are living
the luxury living
while the other way around in Ghaza
invited to a second ministerial meeting an arab ministerial meeting but at this time
which talk is still going around it between hamas mediated by turkey
this meeting that you were invited to attend looks like it wants to circumvent
it will be a circumvent if we made another initiative
we don't have initiatives
in this issue
because egypt is an important arab country
it is requested to take a role and we support any egyptien effort made to reach an understanding
but it's important
don't come
tomorrow with a party that looks as it prevailed another party
nor the road to harmony
a balanced egyptien initiative
between the internartional demands and arab demands and humanitarian demands
and the requirements of the role of Egypt and which is an important role
it is an arab leading country that we all respect and appreciate
according to you is This what is required from Egypt
the suggestions now, the existing initiative now they don't fill these requirements your excellency
I have a vision for the initiative
we hear from here and there some informations
i can't comment about something that i don't know
with all respect to the government or the palestinian presidency that should be there and we all acknowledge the palestinian presidency
but also there are people
who are injured in another party that we should also take their point of view
so that we make this intermediate works
by the way to take the point of view
Hamas's position was clear that this decision didn't take our point of view so how it can be issued
a resolution that arabs participate in its formation without contacting or taking the opinion of the primary concened party in the subject matter
we only want, of course we deal with the palestinian country as a country
and we deal with the authority as a one sided
but now there is divisive in a party somewhere and another party somewhere else
this doesn't mean if we deal with people from Ghaza we will have to stop dealing with the people who are either in the bank or in the palestinian presidency
we deal with palestinians as one people and one government
they ask someone from Ghaza to be with them
and now we begin to coordiate with each othe
what was announced about it
first for the resolution he didn't say mechanism he welcomed the egyptien initiative and any other initiative
some and he considered it as a mechanism
this is an explanation but what i understood from my readings to this resolution that he welcomes the egyptien initiative
we hope that the egyptien initiative will succeed in performing
that stops the fight
i don't have doubts about our brothers in Egypt
because israel didn't accept the Security Council Resolution
and you consider that this resolution no longer exist since israel didn't accept it
even if it accept it later things will be changed on the ground
yes your excellency sheikh in the talk about the egyptien efforts
in cooperation with the turkish efforts at the same time and it
or an arab excuse
or arab disputes that can't reach a solution therefore it came to fill a space
it supposed to be filled by arab parties
i welcome the position of turkia
a stand that should be appreciated by Arabs and muslims
turkey is an islamic country
therefore this is a natural role
and that people should follow him
there is no arabic conscience to solve the situation
one will say let them finish the mission
there must be a clear Arab position a clear cut of all this aggression and it continuous and procrastination
that there will be an opposite arab position
israel can procrastinate the decision, i'm not talking about an israeli arab war and we are the people who always call for peace
and we are a country that likes to live in peace
but i don't call for an arab war i call for
a clear arab stand
Within the context of the initiatives and proposals of course you are following up what is going on
and proposals and conditions set by Hamas
do you think
now as an observer that on the reality ground
and the political that was resulted from the military operation will allow now hamas to set its conditions
does he have to be right
we agree on this point and we disagree on this point
the second thing
i don't know about this negotiation as i told you they are not there oh now they negotiate
the second thing
ok In the required positions of the Arabs
this arab reality
that we have witness after the start of those operations
it looks like there is a very advanced position that is taken by the arab street
about us as governments
of course i feel sorry that some people describe the peoples' gift
another time they are telling me this issue
represent the people's opinions
presidents now
i mean if they want
at least they see what
demand of course there is a high ceiling and a modest one
to stop the normalization and the diplomatic relations with israel
Qatar to
close the bureau of the israeli representer in Doha
Qatar, which takes this position
consider that the Arab side must be radical and takes radical positions
Anything agreed upon by Arabs will be a collective agreement
not at all if we had an arab agreement
a treaty is something and relations are something else
we are ready
to go along with our arab brothers
if only there is a decision and a clear arab credibility
and they deal with others not only the countries that has relations
but also countries that has none
it's very important
don't become agents for others
he says why not Qatar set an example in this field
if this is the only model then we are ready to be in it
but we also want
an arab model Qatar is commited to a part of its arab commitment
such as
and no one sell one for the other
our problem is that trust among arab countries is missing
and unfortunately i don't want to tell our secret i don't want to say brokers
therefore it's very important
for formal invitations anywhere because we have to rise above this
some called the ambassador some made protests some expelled the Ambassador such as Chaviz
and that's part of the disagreement
but some of them called for the ambassdor and who summoned countries with permanent membership and these are all movies about our people
we talked about the modest ceiling for the people's demands
for the high expectations there is someone who demand to open fronts there are those who demand syria to open its fronts with israel
listen i told you that we call for peace and we don't call for fight with israel
and we don't want to fight israel
to make a fight with israel
and how they will agree
this is also a problem
that make us speak to each other that overcome our disagreements
what you said excellency sheikh drew my attention
that in condition that countries don't sell each other
what do you mean
i mean now
The street will not have mercy on us
your excellency sheikh
Is what happening today is the completion of a project that started on two thousand and six in Lebanon War
Or that there is disagreement
no i think that there are disagreements in goals
lebanon had a freed land
still some parts of course supoosed to be a deposit for the united nations
or something like it
lebanon i mean we dealt with the lebanese case significantly
israel of course needs weak states around her
so that it dominates and it iis the owner of the long hand
of course there are countries that it supoort and are foreign
therfore it wants to remain the only power in the region
and now they want
to change this example with ghaza
in lebanon you speak with how many sects
and how many sides
while in palestine there is only one side
but i can assure you again that the problem in palestine is that they listened too much to a lot of arabs and foreigners
and from here the gap started and everyone thinks that it will control the other part
in your opinion as an observer and watcher
as it was planned it will end with breaking the bones
we as arabs do we accept this because it may repeat for those who desobey
or say his opinion
whether israelis or others in the future
and we set a high example
in obedience and assisting in the breaking of the bones
we have a moral example that says Me and my brother against my cousin; me, my brother, and my cousin against the other
now we are supposed in any disagreement with hamas and i'm not saying hamas or other is impeccable of doing any wrong
All of them have mistakes
now we should to let go of this issue
brought a part to its knees
because here the failure will not be the failure of the group
your excellency sheikh Qatar usually i mean a period ago it was trying to come up with proposals
and initiatives to come up with solutions it happened in lebanon
it happened in Darfur we will talk about this in a minute even in hurry
that we
don't want to rely on our brothers because sometimes there are some sensitivities
that one country will do all these initiatives, we son't mind as long as there is a solution
our goal now is not to make Qatar a top headline
it wasn't one of his highness emir goals
one of his goals was how to stob the bloodshed
and stop the domination
what happened is above imagination
and we are in Qatar
do we know something they don't know i don't think so
but what is most important is to have the good intention
to reach a solution to honor
the talk about the initiatives, it is usefull to know what came to the initiative concerning Darfur Resolve the Justice and Equality Movement
and the sudanese government in khartoum
and it will be mainly about solving the issue of Darfur because the issue of Darfur in its begining
the Arab helped
but we don't heat up a cause that we made it international
on the basis of revenge from the system and now we want to solve the issue and we don't know how
and we always strive as i mentioned earlier in implementing decisions we are the best people who implement decisions
Remove the case from the competition is there also a competition in the issue of Darfur
i don't want to go through this
before we sum up the conversation your excellency sheikh there is an economical summit
Is this summit will be held are you going to attend it
no we will attend the summit
We wish that were held in an atmosphere different from the the arab atmosphere but it was programmed
it would be a disgrace
ok if arab leaders attended this summit
when palestinian blood were shed in Ghaza and there they are gathering for financial and economical reasons
help in heating up
but it looks like no one is affraid from this street
you don't know the circumstances i mean of course i wish that nothing happen to us but safety
and to be safe
but no one takes someone in his little pocket

Welcome lady Hissa with us in this episode

At the very beginning we launched the name of disabled maybe in the eighties and earlier
more educational concept when
among those who provide them with such education
an important document in the united nation appeared in ninety three
about the term and before we go through details
From other regions, although there are regions that are not or classified as a developing country and classified as a poor
and latin America especially latin america as a matter of fact this trend over there is the strongest than in any other region
But statistics have proven otherwise
The trend toward legal rights exist in the Arab world and found in many countries
it is possible that resources exist and the political will as well
ok here let me tell you that some statistics you may know about
eighty percent are from poor countries
UNESCO says that about ninety perccent of children with disabilities from poor countries don't go to schools
Ms Hissa how cant you comment about these statistics
it is real to a large extent
I saw in Darfur and in Gaza and in areas that are exposed to such events which are wars and conflicts
there you can't defrentiate between a disabled person and abled because they are in large numbers
in fact children with illiteracy among females for example are almost fifty three or fifty two
and in other countries
There are many barriers preventing the access of these children to school even without disabilities
in fact the City doesn't have an infrastructure even if this child found that school
he can't reach it
for the sake of children and others from the population
these agendas and projects are great but we barely hear of it
Except when we talk about the International Day for the Disabled, which was celebrated by the world few days ago What is the point of this celebration
the situation in the world
better than people without disabilities
There are organizations arrived and set up many projects
implements a very important health strategy
through this strategy
There is overlap between the humanitarian affairs and the work with marginalized groups such as people with disabilities
now there is a degree of consciousness in the arab world and it is better
at the point of awareness we pause to receive calls and complete our conversation
thank you
I have two questions I would like to ask her since she was in United Nations before
second point
Laws of the United Nations which calls to fight the systems that cause obstruction to the community for the child now for example the Syrian intelligence system
Is there a law that allows to demand for the trial of the system as there are many in Syria
yes sliman your question is clear Sliman kraw from syria thank you very much, with us naif saeed from kuwait welcome naif
Peace, mercy and blessings of Allah upon you
peace upon you too
good evening
good evening and welcome
if you may i am one of those who are mently and intellectually disabled
hear arabs say the free man understands with signs
and there is a verse in Quran saying in the name of God the most merciful and kind Allah hath given us speech praise Who giveth speech to all things
i sat down for thirty years without speaking one or two words per day
so praise the lord for he made me speak
i was reffering to Quran and i found
people attacking me because i use Quran as a refference and they consider me as a hypocrite
they are attacking me not knowing that they are at the bottom of hell
i only got slander
and not saying the truth
if your house is made of glass don't throw stones on others
and of course psycological disabilities
about brother solaiman's inquiry it also fall among the same definition
programs of the United Nations or what their reactions about the causes of disability such as political or other goals
Go to various agencies and organizations
to discuss with them and persuade them and to know to what degree
there are subjects and disability cases on their work agendas
UNESCO the InternationalOrganization for Labour UNICEF and the fact that these organizations already put disability
it is one of the programs that tries not to lose sight of children who have disabilities
with good oppotunities and schools
from different environmental aspects
UNICEF as well
but there are insufficiencies we have to admit that there are insufficiency in the United Nations as well
Most prominent weaknesses and inefficiencies that you have talked about what are they
For the United Nations
the issue of routine and bureaucracy
i was in my country in the state of Qatar
but it had routine and bureaucracy in it that obstructed
my work especially sometimes during Restrictions or deficiencies as well
struggling or trying to fight people with disabilities for the recognition
till it reached Somewhat satisfactory unless it did not put it in a separate article as the global movement for disability wanted
But it occupied a part somewhat appropriate
Unfortunately there is no coordination between them
this is one of its main deficiencies
Survey, which was applied by the Special Rapporteur and applied to the states
among staff or people working in those programs
unfortunately we received only three responses from forty-eight organizations and agencies and they have came to us only with three responses
don't put
The issue of disability is permanent, stable and sustained for many years, although this issue is a human rights issue in the first place
in the last period Praise be to Allah two or three years ago
The issue of disability has become at least raised through events such as seminars and else
peace be upon you
gracious Madame why there are no laws and binding decisions for the Arab countries and to who is responsible for its activation of these international regulations
For the Arab countries and the allocation of salaries, for example, the allocation of salary for the disabled
Are there funds allocated by the United Nations
Will this money turn to governments or to the offices belonging to the United Nations and will these aid really reach the disabled
The final observation if there were not binding decisions for the Arab countries
thank you very much Ahmed alhalabi from Greece
with us Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia welcome Ibrahim
peace be upon you
peace be uopn you too
her to adopt this proposal
which is to write directly to the Secretary General of the United Nations
to be transfered to this fund
or productive factury
allocating one percent only of the annual net profit
i go back to our guest to response for callers questions
and he said that doctors adviced him to make a surgical procedure but
it cost a lot and he can't afford it so from where he can get help
he is from algeria
i think it is important to meet the needs of brother Naji
like any other rights the rights of persons with disabilities
All of these rights and duty must be obtained by the citizen
To join the International Convention for people with Disabilities this agreement is legal and binding
and satisfy the rights and needs of people within the national scope
Or even at the non-governmental level
Binding on all States and shall be restricted to ensure the implementation of these laws
At least at the level of officials chiefly there must be awareness
it Must be at least if we work on these treaties on this way
Even if there is no commitment to it significantly
there any response to the monitoring reports of that you're doing and whether there was interest
But do not forget the norms it is a document morally binded in fact and not legally
to have a commitment and to be legalized
and understanding that these cases will be resolved or discussed or it will be within the context of a community suffering from many problems
Naji Zacharna, Director, Qatari Center for Deaf sign language expert in Al-Jazeera
first of all Mr Ali would like to make a sincere thanks to Al Jazeera
which now have broadcasted this episode on air
now ali is speaking and saying that he is very proud
and was a servant's for all people with special needs in the place where she was and still
and we support her and stand on her side always and ever
And i also say that there are a lot of people with special needs
there are some of them who don't know about this agreement because there was no training courses
About them, especially in the schools or hospitals or in public and private institutions
and it is essential to publish this agreement
As a law dealing with people with special needs in all countries of the world
and i was emphasizing and insisting for these states to
adopt this agreement and sign it
such as the State of Qatar, and some countries have signed this document its goal to serve people with special needs and serve us
Thank you very much fellow Naji, speaking on behalf of Ali
thank you very much
Your opinion may make a decision
Former Special Rapporteur of the United Nations on disability we may start a proposal made by the caller Ibrahim Abdullah of Saudi Arabia
Establishment of a fund to support
A fund for donations and accept any contributions from the states
This means the fund is supposed to spend it on activities that made by the Special Rapporteur when he is engaged in
And even the Arab states did not provide donations only one country: Syria
To meet those obligations is a problem found in the United Nations, therefore
the fund
The lack of commitment by Member States, unfortunately, and lack of interest
And unfortunately many people say with all boldness that mean we do not care about the situation now
Is in fact the issue of obligations
about human rights
with its broad and general form
the marginalized specially
but for this reason there are those covenants
for these countries to be committed to its obligations however it is a good idea made by the brother
on top of that it is essential that there won't be one independant fund means independent in its form, but the organizations that already exist in the region
Of what they have in their budgets
Provided special projects for people with disabilities in Gaza
aids for people with disabilities
the issue always involve political factors
his State or government ensured its support dramatically
is reducing number unfortunately
with symbolic Amounts
the father is disabled
of course, pulled out of citizenship
they took away his girl she
sometimes from
Teaching problems
traveling or going out we get confused
Peace, mercy and blessings of Allah upon you
and peace on you too
and we can
rebuild themselves knowing
i hope that Arab countries allocate from its budget
thank you very much bahjat karawan from kuwait
aisha mhamad from Qatar welcome
peace be upon you
peace upon you too
good evening to you and to sheikha the daughter of khalifa
i just want to send her a letter of thanks and appreciation
in last years
with our best wishes from us; parents of children with special needs
for sheikha hissa's constant support for them
hamil liwaa shareef from tunisia welcome
There is another level, which is genetic
I think that there is care on the genetic level that reduces the proportion of disabled
in our arab customs the cousin always mary his female cousin and so on
By this means at this level, a level of disability and thank you
can you comment on what the viewers said
actually like i said on the national level
I know that there are programs for guidance and support
falls among health care services
which also fall under the umberella of hamad medical
I think within the Psychiatric Clinic and Also programs in the Supreme Council for Education
Department of Special Education frankly I do not know if it still exists
but it is certainly within the Health Care Services Yes, there is support and there are Medical Services
And rehabilitative provided for these cases
Prevention is better than cure and referred to the genetic factor and marriage between relatives are there any campaigns
For example, to raise awareness
in this area
sure this is a very important point and serious
And one of the things that me and others have dealt in many words and many of the participations
Yes, there are awareness campaigns and not only directed
Carried out by the World Health Organization
as well as for UNICEF
now in many arab countries including qatar
and definately tunisia
now there is a binding decision for early examination
and which was implemented in many countries
This is all on the preventive aspect
and such campaigns do they receive any positive response
especially when it comes against habits and customs
Of course, its difficulty is when it collides with the communal culture
to have a decision to have strategies to have the will to deal with that and commits
The issue of early examination for example because this is a very important issue before marriage
ask you if there are statistics about disabled people
and especially disabled people from arab region
for the arab region
and especially
with the last events that happened in the region
In the areas and in spots of conflict and in wars especially wars and conflicts and so on
that with every person killed there are three disabled
and what happened in lebanon and darfour and many other places
Not at all it is not enough and first the issue
With the principles of human rights
there must be something for people with disabilities and their programs and plans
Agendas within the existing institutions in the ministries in the government and non-governmental
In conditions such as conditions of war or disturbances
Only to your words High Commissioner for Human Rights at the United Nations nafi bilay
in the world and the strangest thing is what was said by the International Monitoring Committee for the Rights of People with Disabilities that census
to this extent the disabled are not included in the Statistics, which are being held for residents
they do not always announce
For example, in the State of Qatar when the census was conducted i think more than five years ago
but honestly
In collaboration with the Planning Board and with the
Prepared by the Council as a matter of fact and with the participation of us such as the Office of the Special Rapporteur
to put more classifications for disabilities
Needs that are supposed to be found
tyoes of those needs all these important details that must lead you to a result
is whether or not there is a disabled person
but at least
statistics are some how in progress in this regard
peace be upon you
Madam thank you for this program and thanks to Sheikha Hissa
but i thank God that i am a Qatari and i receive all this care from my country
and my daughter is a student now in independent schools and receive a good education praise to God
and i want to thank Mrs Hissa
her Motivational role and her role that let us not fear or worry about our children
praise and thanks to allah and thanks to her and to those who this category rely on
thank you very much Fatma Al-Dosari from Qatar, still with Qatar with Lateefa
peace be upon you
peace upon you too
my virtuous sister relaity and expectations and what we are waiting for is to solve the problem of our children
where is the sheikha's role for our Qatari children
i hope she can answer this question
hello, peace be upon you
And I bear witness to what was provided by the State of Qatar as service in particular for audio disability
we had a program for early detection of hearing impairment
There is a Supreme Council for people with disabilities
for people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability
Even the assembly of Civil Society the MGOs or other communities
because the reality and what we hope for if i compare it in five years
what was offered for the disabled people before five years and now
thank you very much Kareem Naseem from Jordon now we go back to our guest
of course
the society as a whole with its individuals abd especially with its families who have
children with disabilities have ambitions and great expectations from
Whether it is on the planning level or at the operational level
but with respect to one of the points you mentioned which is a very important point
Children who can not have documents or other, whether in Qatar or elsewhere
International Convention is like many of the international documents
And commited to translate it into plans and strategies
To provide those services automatically
Based on the Universal Declaration of human rights regardless of religion, race, color, sex, sexual
ok Sheikha Hissa you worked as Special Rapporteur earlier you were in the United Nations concerned with disabilities after six years of work
did you wish
maybe time was not enough or financial aids were not enough
there are a lot of achievements made and I am proud of it
through my participation or through existing organizations and through governmental institutions in many countries
specially in the arab region
That there will be more research and larger studies
we started off with a global survey and we had more than one report
Raising awareness is an ongoing process that must be worked on constantly and dramatically
the coordination between the Arab states
And between people themselves people with disabilities and their organizations because they are
But they have a duty they must
they must fight for
thank you very much
thank you
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode I thank everyone who participated with us with opinion and commentary
tomorrow with God's will we will meet a new guest
be with us with your letters and messages in a new episode of "Mubasher" (live) good bye
Good Morning
I'm very happy to have you here with us
Firstly, and before we start asking you different questions and chat in this morning
Thank you Shaima, I might have congratulated
The whole Middle East deserves that international achievement
Qatar really droped a pin on the global football map
Thank you Qatar
Also Ali, go ahead Oh! Ali
Firstly, I would like to say good morning to viewers
and express my congratulations for him and all the Qatari citizens for the hosting
and, If God wills, just like what Sheikh Mohammed said,
It was a dream, and if God wills, it's going to be a reality, and working will start from today or the period of the announcment
Did you expect that Qatar wil host the world cup in two thousand twenty two
despite having powerful files such as the US, Japan and australia, weren't you affraid in this field in this subject in particular
No, see, to be frank with you, I said it's seventy percent that Qatar will get it
is very powerful
has a global and competative plans
We were competative
why would we fear
But thanks God, Qatar's file was really powerful and deserved that
It's true that the two thousands and twenty two profile, World Cup and hosting in Qatar
So, what do you think the athleted themselves feel
they are in the field, of course they feel very happy, God wills
I'de like to %pw, we were talking off air, but we want to hear that on air,
The moment of the announcment
Where were you, how did you recieve the news, were you surprised, tell me, and tell the audience
on the radio
Then all the people joined us
They heared about the announcement
How did you find the internatonal media
On the sport channels level, everybody was supportive, specially the arab channels, Thanks God, every one offered support for us
As son as they announced Qatar's winning and that it gained the hosting,
all the arab countries declared their full support to Qatar, through media, human resourses, volunteers, in future
arab countries are known for their generosity
Even on international media level, Shaima
I went that time to celebrate at Souq wagif
even the Agence France-Presse were shooting there
we had also interviews
Everybody collaborated, Qatar now, on a daily basis, is being mentioned
hundered times a day, in the ragard that it's the smllest spot on earth
I assume everybody will recognize Qatar Even on the internet
for hosting two thousands and twenty two world cup
I mean, any football player dreams of serving his country,by being in the team
Of course, any player, whether in the Qatari league, wishes to represent the team
so, it's a positive thing that one works very hard to
be in the league, even when being in the league devote all his efforts
whether in trainings, or games, because he's carrying the motto of the league on his shirt that's why he should commit his energy
Look, people in charge paid a lot of effort in taking care of the young players, they are teaching them professionality from an early age.
food, sleeping
Tell me about your experience, you played in a several age stages, how was your experience, and what the most important stage for you?
it was, of course
I progressed step by step in the league , from the juniors's to the first team
You know camping with the club and wit hthe league
So each stage has a special mark
Yes, Lana God willing, you used to move between
We now get used to you as the sporty Lana
We always see you as a sport lady, we loved watching you, knowing sport news through you, so, how's sport with you
I, honestly, don't find it different that the talk shows, in talk shows we used to interview famous satrs in their fields, also in sports we are interviewing stars as well
Like Ali and the others in their sport field
on the contrary, sport field is active
specially that we are the sports capital
and Qatarr now has become the global sports and football capital
instead of presenting varied talk show, socail, economic and cultural programs
there are different feilds, volleyball, basketball, different champions
But it's still sport
awsome, great
I honestly wished
I wished that I'm ten yearsold now, not twenty five
so I think the young players got a very huge opportunity
I hope they take the advantage of this opportunity
That's great Ali, what do you like to say to the players
,God will, the young players that will have a bright future in the coming days, if God wills
of course, I told you it's an opportunity, they must take advantage of
and it's a golden opportunity
so they have a big advantage of it
tell us, what are you up to, what are the new coming programs that you are going to present, I know we asked you to come in your vacation
so tell us about your new, God willing
always in following up with the events, we are preparing for the Asian Cup that will start in January
few days back we finished from the Gulf Cup, by the way we'de love to say congratulations to the Kuwaiti league
Newscast is also available to cover the events
My first appearance in media was throught the Qatari Tv, of course, my roots are from Qatar TV
I'm greatful to their kindness
to carry the message of the media on different channels
wether private, sport or other channels
So, thank you Qatar TV
We wish you the the best of luck, we are still in the same topic
firstly, i'de like to thank the administration of Alwakra club
and its fans, I was in alwakra club since
my childhood,
Sheikh was here with us yesterday, Sheikh Nesser was with us
still in the club
I'm still the son of Alwakra
but, as I told you before the program starts, professionalism
that belongs to each individual in Qatar
we know youths already loves sports and are addicted to it
How to make of sport a social matter
Media awarness in the first place, media plays an important role to promote sport in all different life fields
You said youths are addicted to it, also schools have become aware of the importance of sports in the school
for example they celebrate any sport occasion
Also in Qatar, you see the signs on the streets, this reflects the awarness of sport
allocating seats for women in the stadiums and anywhere
this also indicates women's awarness and participation in sport field
and we now have a Qatari women league, for women players
So I believe sport is developing
I believe also that this time period
for producing huge projects and awarness of sport, I assume this tme period is enough
If it's considered and carried out carfully
It's sufficient and at the same time has to be used thoughtfully, as you said
and also, there is one point, thats is how the young generation take an advantage of the league
Everything is avaiable, the capabilities, experiences and equipment
Also there is an important thing, thanks God, we are in Qatar, as all Arab and Gulf societies know, are known for our passion for sports
how to attract this audience to keep up with sport news, football games in Qatar
and to attend the games at the same time
most of the Qatari people loves sports and football, but the problem is that they don't attend
when you browse web forums you will find that there is a huge interest specially in most of the club's forums
there is a huge interest in football leage
You, as a Qatari citizen, what do you think is the best solution to attract you to attend, away from being an athlete and player
what is the possible way of bringing the audience to attend, for example your friends
It depends on the person himself, there is no general concept
some people like to watch it on TV in a gathering at home
for example, Japan, japan made a briliant plan to attract the audience in a large way
when you attend games, you collect points, or whatever, so, they are seeking solutions, so, hopefully
and Alarabi
The most important point is that each player will be here in Qatar specially in two thousands twenty two, Lana, what do you think we need
apart from the financial support, what do you think we really need?
providing the means that make them ready as a Qatari league and participate in huge mondial, the World Cup
Time passed quickly with the nice people, when the producer told me that time is up, I said realy, God willing.
always achieve the impossible, it achieves the dream that we thought it's impossible, Thanks God we are living it on reality
As Sheikh Mohammed sais, it was moments of celebration, but the hard work began
and if God wills, two thousands twenty two will be an event that stand up to the name of Qatar
I congratulate everyone living in Qatar and honestly, Qatar has become a global landmark
for hosting two thousands twenty two
Thank you Lana, the brilliant presenter, I hope you success, and will always watch your programs to know sport news
Thank you, surely the happiness
Young Qatari talents
And they are singing a new genre which is popular nowadays.
But in the form of repetition with music and fast rhythm.
And also a band of amateurs of rap,if God wills.
Stay with us, we will start from now and good morning
We try to have glimpse about it.
We can define Rap briefly as fast music.
It's perform do a repetition, but not a fast rhythmic singing for the song's words
That consist of so many rhymes, addressing a number of different topics and issues.
It might sometimes be personal,
social, sentimental or political.
It often be controversial,
And liberal to a large extent.
The Rap perform, our viewers doesn't sing the song's word,
But he repeats it.
He flatter with his voice that considers as secondary element.
Generally, the voice is not important in the Rap songs.
For this reason, he is not called a singer, but a Rap performer or rapper.
The rappers take care of the following elements in songs:
For example the flow, the flow of the voices, synchronism and delivery.
They have followers, audience and fans.
They have a special style for Rap,
And I think they will give you an idea better than me personally.
Good morning, hello.
The first thing, it was a period in which we wanted to do something new.
To be special with something.
So, we said why don't we sing Rap?
And Rap is an art which is present in all the countries of the world.
So, why it is not present in Qatar?
So, we said we invent something new.
We gave him an idea that includes a message,
We speak in it about the advantages and disadvantages that happens in the society.
So, we deliver a message first and second it's an art.
It's an art from the various arts, this is for the viewer's information, it has addressed so many social and psychological issues among youth drastically.
Time changes and this has to do I think with time change.
Before, there was a little acceptance.
We are singing, since approximately two thousand and five, the acceptance was little in the beginning.
We can say about ourselves that our new beginning was in two thousand and ten.
There is a more acceptance and popularity.
People like to sing and perform similar to the Rap style at this time, have you noticed this?
Yes of course, a high percentage of people.
Also there is something we want to talk about, you were the founders in many bands.
A beautiful band and I think you have concerts, can we talk about this band?
How it was founded, How is the idea that someone could make a band, and how many of you in this band?
In the beginning, we before the band was established,
Rap came to Doha starting from two thousand and five.
It means that everyone who loves the Rap concept and who can sing Rap, He could sing and download it in the website.
I can download, Salman can download, someone can download, so there was a competition.
We got to know people.
So, we started to compete each other.
Later after a while, after all these years, we got to two thousand and ten.
Before two thousand and ten it was a groups system which means that this group is by itself and every three or four where together.
So we said why don't we united as a one group under the name Rappers Qatar,
or in English Q Rappers.
So we agreed on this, so we said under a one name and we are all one hand together.
And we come up presenting this thing and saying the same idea.
Approximately twenty five person.
Twenty five, wow ! If God wills, it's a big group.
So, is anyone of you plays or, or, or all of you sing Rap?
Coordinate and compose.
You can say it's a personal thing.
Excellent, how is this twenty five are organized? How is this number is organized in the band?
Everyone individually has his own potentials.
It means that every person in the band can make a full song
Without any help from another person.
But it is possible that capacities might be different, for example if Salman is better than me,
He listen to it and he tell me change the words her, change something.
It is possible that each one change to the other.
We help each other little bit.
Or a company that adopt you, so that an official entity adopt these works,
And there will be the right distributors.
So that the work come out in in in a classy style and it became something official for you.
To be honest, we are hoping to be supported and we get the support by a compay who came and adopt us by producing an album for us.
We don't have any problem.
Some matters are little bit difficult.
So, why don't you think that the first initiative comes from you?
So that the individual can be introduced to the first CD.
By doing this you can later attracts companies, what do you think?
Approximately in two thousand and seven, I made a CD.
I distributed among my friends.
How was the demand?
I think.
So-so because in two thousand and seven may be Rap was was not dominant in the Gulf.
But not as popular as now.
We were speaking before being on air, for example, there are a great groups like Palencia and Kastro.
Let's talk about it?
They said we will organize the party for you.
They have covered all the cost and procedures, the coordination, and the work; we didn't expect that level to be honest.
Honestly, we were surprised and it was an amazing work,
But there was a little pressure because there was no ads and there was nothing before the concert.
There were no ads, or anything two days before the party
We assumed that nobody wil come due to the short notice
When we were inside, before the party starts
That was a good point
wich means that our voice reaches the families as well, not just the youths
We thought that the idea appeals only to the youths
but at this stage, we discovered that there are many ages class that listen to us
Is there a specific song that the audience like
the audience interact with most of the songs
yea, most of the songs, but there were a lot of songs and we are to many
The whole group
what's the words, how it adress different issues
We're talking about the current situation
al least, even it was *
Even if they talked, before *
It has to be this way
i mean, there is rhyme
we think about ech word and try to find better synonyms
ok, you have few songs, let's listen to one of them
one of the songs that you produced
let's listen to it and see audience's opinion
I hope they like the words
Thank you Ali, I loved the intro as it has my program's name
This is KD and DJ MREldoha program
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen
This KJ Mrs Bobo with SKT one hot to body
Don't forget, the show is broadcasted at nine thirty, everyone must watch
Produced by Hassan Naama, Presented by Shaima Alhamadi
, the director is Nasser Almalki, and the guests are Qatar Rappers, of course
Because it really, contains the name of =the program, thank you Oh! guys
I have to clap my hands for you and the people in the control room
we broadcasted it last night
and who wrote the words, or is it
each one writes his own words
Because If I wrote for Yusef
not only write these for the love of singing, and passion
I assume you have to write about 2022 world Cup, and the Asian Cup, I assume if you can
Yea sure, personally, we will produce a song about this subject
But, I don't think it can be official at this stage
so I assume there should be some patriotic songs
through Rap art
Yea, actually, today , everyone
We are watching live now
The cup has arrived and Doha streets are decorated
So, viewers, as we saw, Doha is decorated to celebrate the Asian cup
agencies involved has done all the preperations for the hosting
and there will be more crowds
I assume they will throng along the cornish side
I'm sure they are ready to host that important sport event
Is there any parties in the coming days?
There is an offer from an authority, they promised they'll arrange a party for us
But, still, there are some complications
precedures and some issues, so, we're not sure
So, we try, If I meet Yusef and saw
some of them, I have a song theme,
if we find that it suites the song
and the possibility of performing it
when I'm at home
and then send it to Yusef ny email
this part of the song id for Yusef
There is also an other thing, do you travel abroad
in this field who have millions of fans
don't try to immitate, but we listen to people who are ahead in this field
but we try to be a competitive
so why not taking some ideas and immitaing certain things
but reverse it, I take the idea and apply it in a different way on my song
who formed a band and have more thn one CD
a person called Abdulla Aldayel
He has the experience and ability to discover groundwater
This talent is the ability to discover groundwater reservoirs
one of the residents of Marat town
There are a lot of experts
who locate the groundwater before drilling
that needs  or some wells might be drilled where there is no water
with the aid of copper rods and pomegranate branches
or fig, through which he can locate water reservoirs
What arethe used tools
to discover the groundwater
That was in ancient times
but now, it's been replaced with copper rods
So, we put the two rods in parallel
and walk slowly
we notice, when we walk on water stream
the rods wil open up
now, we are passing on a weter stream
it opens up this way
when we crossed it starts
now we are at the middle of a water stream
and here, will be the middle
so, in this way, we can determine the course of the water, or the groundwater in the ground
and the process is repeated more than oce in more than one location to find the most intense location
Abu Ibrahim confirmed
on that reaching an advanced stage of this career
for his discoveries to be very accurate
In Marat, outside Marat, in Shaqra, Huraimla and athethia
more than one hundred fifty well has been discovered
the persentage of errors does not exceed five persent
needs training, experience and a gift from God
beats the modern equipments and laboratories
in short time

Sabah Eldoha Program
Marat twon, northwest of the Saudi Capital, Alriyadh
we watched this report and promise you of more reports from Arab and international countries
and Gulf countries, if Gof wills
and we reached the (()) and different titles but it has it's
meaningful sense
I assume there is a large group of Khaleeji youth in the Gulf
any specific people you follow as an example
that you follow up with rather than imitate
There is a connection in general betwen all Khaleeji rapers
it's not contest, I mean if I produced a song
that tackles a particular topic
we can call it a meaningful competition
we've got connections, but there is no one who I
In Saudi Arabia there is Qusai, God wills. He
has fans and a CD
Many companies want to adopt him
Do you which to reach this stage, perhaps you exceed this stage with more and more, God wills
We wish you the best of luck through this band
there, in receiving the cup, let's see some footage of the cornish
in addition to a group of young Qataris
that, even if it's borrowed from tthe West, it's in khaleeji style
there is also love rap songs and a distinguished band of twenty five people
it's important that we follow up with you to know your news
Si I assume you have an email, website or a forum
how can people get in touch with you
we used to have our own website
but there was some peoblems with the hosting company
it used to close sometimes for no clear reasons
so, we faced many problems and closed it at the end
there is no use, the website will surely close
SO, what to do, what are the alternatives, to solve this problem
UAE, KSA, Bahrain, oman, and even Morocco and Egypt
You have to communicate with them to know the latest news, songs produced once in a while
So, what's the alternative now
we currently rely on special pages like
under what name
ok, when you google our name
Rap qatar or rappers Qatar
You can produce your own video clip
for the program, you worked on it yesterday
we uploaded many videos on Utube
songs with pictures
a song and the same, with pictures
I guess we have to see you improving more
you need a place for all of you to gether rather than having equipments in each one's house
Mixer, piano, computer, and guitar
honestly, I wish tht we find support
for example a company
produce a CD
and allocate a special place for us
working on our own
nut at the end of the day, we are still working on our own
we don't want that
it's not different than what Yusef said
we need a video clip
and an album
video clips make the sng spread rapidly
itconvies the ideas faster
if there is support, everything elso will come eventully
and your beautiful voice be everywhere
it's a type of arts that deals with different issues and problems
Thank you Yusef Alneimi and Salman Alabdulla for coming
Let's see it and wish them on the behalf of our program all the success guys

it's expiry date
when you go to the cashier, you already have the total and all the details
recognizes the goods, instead of reading the components of each commodity
while walking with the trolley
it is attached to the trolley, so one can choose the material that he want
most of the projects are a reflection of children'e feeling of a problem
has many activities and goals
The center offers a range of programs and activities that focus on a one major idea
We have ten goals that Her Highnes, Sheikha Moza had put in the founding of the center
could be also, yea
that directly transfer him to the underground train from his house
but it's idea is that it's for clothes
all the shops in Qatar that sells T-shirts will appear
it can also be with the car key, I press the button
it locate the items that I lost and take me to the key
yes, let's go back to the projects that the center will work on
which is children's early education
,skills development and adoption of talents
so, it varies between children's diffeent skills, media, research skills
personal skills, such as public speaking, persuasion of audience
the skills vary and we had put a speciall program that serves it
we started with Future Media, we did really good in this project, we reached the end, the graduation of the project
we also got numbers of children and young speakers
and their creativity ...
Do you have young presenters
For the TV, it's important that they present children's shows

We welcome them wherever they are
Also this is the national Tv
We need to attract and discover these talents and improve it

The scientific club played an important role in improving the projects and also with the technical support
The major role was the Supreme Education Council, by supporting schools and partners
Mister Abdulla, moving to such a edifice like Katara,
that embody also a variety of activities and clubs
do you consider that as a push forward to more success
besides moving to a separate building
regardless of the very huge place
and makes it easier to deal with public

The most important thing is that, the more we deal with children, the more we discover that
today's childhood differes from our childhood
They need more care, focus and time

in attempt to stabilizing the children
to live with a dream
with the project
This project or dream
children's imagination is very broad
so we limited it to twenty thirty
and other key areas of Qatar's vision, twenty thirty
We started training children in four stages
Then, thinking of the mechanism of brainstorming and the tools that broaden thinking scope
What do you mean exactly by this phrase?
are the facts or tomorrow's nation
Which means, whatever a child dreams of today
He will grow while the project is growing
in fact, that was the real explanation of the vision, that children will live from today
with a big dream

There is an evaluation committee they have a method of assessing the projects
The first, second and third projects that won the prizes
The forest, got the first prize
was very precise with details of the projects and the project was ready for application
of course it needs many administrtive elements,
there were very precise details on the brochure distriputed on the visitors,

We came across Kumait's brook not the brook of Al-Anajeel.
Mr. Ayman there is, whatever God wills , a cooperation between the family, the guardians, the center and also the child.
And I think there are different method in which he can be with you at once.
Generally to run the training process.
Since whatever comes to us whether the trainee, the student or the child,
This record contains his complete personal information.
Even his monthly grades, for example every months he has an evaluation.

Did you feel Mr. Ibrahim that really there is there is a difference from the student in his first two days,
And after he complete maybe three or four months?
If it was taught at the public, private or even independent schools,
Basically, the program scientifically is working on specific methods.
After passing level one of the program,
Which show the lost potentials or need to continue developing it
And he reached a specific level or what are the updates that happened to the child?
So, we are working on a scientific method, a scientific program

His weight is increasing without eating.
Alright, your left shoulder.
This is becuase of the nerves, when I told him that he has a tense nerves.
Beofre ten years ago, he walked barefoot on the beach.
We know that when someone walk on the beach, I think that he empties.
Any uneven ground not only sea.
Negative energy that might %PW.
And may be he was surprised from you that you've discovered these things through massage.
Of course, kids are the most important.

She should focus on a rock or on stones, by pressing here, you are giving orders God be glorified to lower part of the back and the period's problems. If you have pain,
By seconds if God wills, it will disappear.
The pregnant woman
Delivery became easier for her.
Either here or here and God knows best.
If they tell her that there is a possibiltiy of giving birth in the seventh or you can give birth in the ninth.
Unless on sand.
If she walk on sand, no problem, but if she walks on rocks, no.
She should eat seven soft dates for breakfast, soft date is better.
If she don't have soft dates, the date is enough.
As Allah the most high says, I seek refuge in Allah from the accused Satan, my discovery is from Quran.
That mean that God was unable to let this soft dates come to her, no he wasn't unable.
Thanks God and I seek refuge from the word I am.
She should bring a rock or small balls.
The delivery's bed. For example, if she forgot and she came to the delivery's bad, she holds the handles.
You will notice at the private hospitals, an east asian lady will come
So, this is a practice in East Asia.

Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al-thani, the director of General Health Department at the Supreme Health Council, will talk more about it
Good morning Sheikh.
Let us start with a look at these activities.
The program Healthy Steps towards Qatar
Is a program part of the national strategy to treat, to combat obesity.
About four of the world highest countries in terms of obesity are from the Gulf countries.
We started a strategy at the Supreme Health Council of course jointly with the Ministry of Education and other authority to combat obesity.
Fearing from it's spread more and more soon.
One of the programs to protect from obesity is Healthy Steps towards Qatar.
Can do this competition together, so it will be an international competition.
The program consists of a sex weeks.
Every week is different than the upcoming week
To make the students in the seventh and the eighth grade aware of the health importance in this age,
Because this the first age which they become aware of themselves.
In the first week as you remember it was about what is your favorite fruit?
The second week is walking.
You have to walk ! Everytime you walk, he gets points.
It's a Qatar map and everytime someone get's points, he walks and his schools moves forward and his class moves.
So a beautiful competition among the students is created.
In the second week, he drinks water, we don't want him to drink soda.
We tell him to drink water, there is no need to drink so many soda everytime you feel thristy, no drink water !
Later, in the fourth week your favorite sport.
There are some games in the school that some of them doesn't like,
We look for a sport that he likes,
So that we can force him to practise sports.
The child eats a healthy meal
And his family knows that it should let their child eat a healthy meal.
And Al-Jazeera Academy, an academy for girls and boys, so we can take.
Of course this is a sample and with it's success if God's will, we will increase the experience in the next upcoming years.
The students are happy and they feel more active,
We need more games, we had so much fun with our colleagues.
The girls are saying their skin is now better, acnes decreased.
That's right, that's right and it becomes an awarness.
Parents knows about their children.
And their colleagues in different classes, they ask them how are you? And they learn from their colleagues.
And thanks God it start to spread that many schools are excitied to participate in the next year from now.
If God wills.
Qtel was the official sponsor in supporting this.
We had Aspire Zone who provided the sports competitions and awareness.
On on on on the dinning table.
So, thanks God so many authorities, some of them I have mentioned and I missed some.
But thanks God everyone participated with a part
And the other, the brothers were doing it in the form of separate lessons, curriculum, or
There was a diversity.
We tried to do different kinds and engage as many people as possible.
It is the future generation.
In order to circulate this experience or spread it as much as possible in Qatar.
When you evaluate there are something that you need to fix it,
After it's spread now and it satisfactory results,
If God's will, we will spread because there are people who ask by telling us why we were not in.
You eat, eat a healthy food and you will reach this, you have no problem.
When we at this age, when he starts from a young age, he will reach what he wants by the age of twenty or twenty five.
Your excellency have mentioned a group of titles, each group had a title.
If we come back, we will try in our segment today to be about the closing of events,
And if we remind people again, in our program, we had more than one hosting.
Let us repeat and What were the information for every week that we want to deliver to the student
Alright, the first thing of course, the first week is you favorite fruit.
Every class was about about fruits and it's benefits.
What are the benefits of the fruits with vitamin C
So, he starts to love some fruits, not all the fruits are his enemies.
He might be allergic from one or two, but why he don't eat the rest.
The second week is walking, people think walking is only for elderly and why should the young walk?
Which means when I get old I walk;
On contrary, you walk because it relaxes you mind and brain
And it's relieving the individual which means walking the clarity of the mind gets improved.
You took the students for walks.
Yes, they were all required to walk whether at home or at the school
And they register their points through the class instructor
Of what they walked daily.
That was an event, there are people who have done a procession, the girls school have done a procession.
We want them to like this, creative with unique ideas.
The spirit of competition and the teachers should think outside the box, we don't want them to give them ideas which they should stick to it.
Everyone has his skill on this point.
Of course the third week is drink water, all the time we try to let them drink water, so that he don't feel thirsty and crave drinking soda.
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite sport.
If we could figure out his favorite sport and support him on it,
He will be interested in sport.
There love for the sport by playing it, he is unconsciously playing sport
We said earlier that we will talk about the Qatari Multiple Sclerosis Society.
