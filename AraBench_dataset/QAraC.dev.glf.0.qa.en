I am saying what you refuse to understand, Oh!  Saleh
What troubles? Saleh open your eyes, open your mind, look at the world around you, see what people are doing.
If my brother is blind
and refuses to improve himself and improve those around him
Oh!  Saleh... Don't be stubborn
No no no no, I don't care what you say
Walking in the street
And some dates, two dates thrown
And you are starving
Will you eat or not?
No, I will eat
Tell me, has he accepted that?
Your husband is too old to accept that
I had enough with him
It's our chance, our cars are embarrassingly old
Try to talk with him, please
These things are common and usual
The idiot! He lacks self-confidence.
Huh, scared?
What really gets on my nerves
Is that he's in charge of the budget
What is this project that heís in charge of?
It is a huge government project
It's hidden at the bottom.
I have the right to take the money
You work in another ministry?
Mom, how did you forget!
and the day at the garage
Which means that I shall
Consider myself as a participant!
It is not fair that I don't get anything out of it.
Won't I get anything?
That means that I am a participant too.
We are all supposed to take.
This a government project
But your idiot son won't understand
I will talk to him
The good that you are refusing
This is a government project
It's your chance
just like what others are doing
The fortune feast is in front of you
Take your share.
He barely had a Riyal in his pocket
I myself heard him
It is known that the government projects are
and the latter third is looting.
His son Salom
He went to Souq Waqif
One lantern cost him eighteen Riyals.
They priced it in the budget
for one hundred eighty Riyals each.
They said we didn't do anything wrong,
You will get fed up with him
and seek refuge from Satan.
Yea, but I think that he's changing his mind.
God willing Oh!  my God
he is the chairman and everything is in his hands..
Most importantly, don't forget about us,
we are your friends.
We have to be together.
Such a governmental project is an opportunity
Sure Oh!  Ali
We cannot do it without you.
Don't worry Oh!  Ali
And if God wills, everyone included in the project
Of course
yesterday I was chatting with our friends
from your side
we are not worried as you are members in the project committee
Are worried about Saleh, the chairman of the project.
They say he's
Don't worry Oh!  Ali
And tell your friends not to worry.
Really Oh!  Abu Fahd?
That's good news.
But Oh!  Saud, don't forget
No No
Hopefully, everything is going to be alright.
Let this Saleh agree first
I'll take care of it.
I was wondering if I'll get some advantage
Is it possible ?
Then, you are a participant in the project as you are working with us in the same department .
But the most important thing is that it remains a secret between us
And you found a plate of rice and meat in front of you.
Sure I will.
Bon appetite
What's wrong with you!
If you will remain absentminded like that,
It's not going to work
This is not going to work.
Or questions
, we'll be glad to help.
how are we going to get our share
Or is it logical
What shall we name it!
Also we are not the only ones who will take
Every participant will ask for his share.
Why not!
Don't be scared Oh! Saleh
we are the ones who will put the budget.
What about the land that he bought today?
Did he just found it as well
Nobody can afford to buy it,
Where did you get this information from?
He called me today,
because my brother's phone was off.
I said what's wrong
inform your brother
that the other land
which is next to the land that he bought yesterday
has been approved to sell
He said please call him to check if he want it I will reserve it for him.
he doesnít want to share the money with us.
What about our money?
We are considered participants with him.
Even if we were not participants!
You are eating a huge bite by yourself.
At least give your brother and mom some
I'm not here to beg you
We are participants in the project as well, we have the right to ask for our share.
Tell her, tell her.
It's true that when Sultan came and asked him for his share, he refused
but I didn't agree with him.
You have to give him a share of the project,
The first stage.
You are not less than anyone else
members of the project committee
I heard him talking to them,
they are letting their brothers and friends in.
I know that government projects are free for anyone.
that we don't want a limited amount of money and that's it.
from the share capital.
that his brother Sultan can attend the committee meetings if he wish
because it seems that committee members
Project budget,
but we want to
Thank you
Yea, Bu Saleh
your wife's brother!
You will like him
he will benefit the project.
Let us  remind ourselves.
We divided the task, right?
You, Oh! Saleh
I will be responsible for cement, bricks, and concrete.
and leave the rest, from water to electricity, on me.
Oh!  people!
Specify/Take your share.
Me, I swear,
Sometimes I decide to take an amount of money,
and sometimes I say
let me take a percentage.
No problem, Saleh, No problem.
Take whatever you want using the method you prefer.
The most important thing,
We as well,
so that during this week,
everyone determine the amount of money they would like to have.
For example,
and after a few days, they change their mind,
and ask for more one hundred thousand.
alright, but why it is so, huh?
What do think?
I agree.
Even the participants,
Focus on your looting  work, ignore him.
There is also the money of the orphans
or or or or or or increase the budget.
Too many people would like to eat.
Who does he think he is
What is this! Is it your father's project!
Yes, It's Sultan
Oh! my brother Oh! Sultan
which means he's a participant
Is it the last name?
Your friend Saud is including lots of names.
He keeps adding names, saying let's benefit them.
So, in which group shall I add him, percentage or amount of money?
No, put him with the beggars.
%pw how much you should assign for him! put twenty thousand for him
Yes, enough
They are even adding a note here saying
that he's our neighbor.
But, Saud's list is longer that Abdulaziz's
All of it is going to be considered as part of the first stage budget
As a package, nobody will notice.
Yea, there is  there is also the list  that my mother sent
that every two hours she calls and adds people without asking
hehe, may she live longer
The apple of my eye, my son.
God bless you, %pw she is ill and poor.
But the woman has no money.
%pw God bless you, I told you this is the last one.
Tell him it's liver transplant surgery.
what! Yea wait, wait.. How much is enough for you?
How much is enough for a liver, residence and hospital!
About  one hundred and eighty thousands Riyals.
How many livers are you going to transplant!
One, but sister it is expensive
Yes, God bless you, put her name on the list.
Hasina, yes yes Hasina bint Hilal.
Are you giving her from your own money!
Reassure him and tell him that I am not taking anything from the second stage,
Yes yes, one hundred and eighty thousands Riyals.
Oh! man, they will replace her liver with a new one,
Tell him, tell him to add two thousands, I want to buy gifts for my girls
two thousand
One thousand for me
yes, Hasina bint Hilal
Can I embarrass you in front of your friends!
No mom.
I have a lot of work
Later, I'll call you later
the people who eat from the feast increased
infrastructure is capable of the load
Don't forget me
Write down the number you want.
I don't know
It's up to you
I'm the chairman of the board
and I'm saying you deserve a million
They are deciding that the project will start tomorrow.
and they will give us the payments constantly
How much! we want to know!
They will give it to us all at once or in batches
Why is she taking more than us
There is an electric shock or there is a looting, it does not matter, the most important thing to stay silent, we are waiting for them and they are coming
%pw he told you to stop talking,[-n] %pw so stop talking
you don't get embarassed
If I hear one of you talking
I will sew his mouth
They kept us for too long
You know this is money, not an easy/simple matter
How much was it before?
Fifty million
it seems you are taking a big bite
You're the chairman at the end
we don't want headache
Let's approve the budget
Mr. Saleh, from what your speech about the project, we noticed that it is a very spiritied and importent project as well
and It's not only for this generation
Yes yes
Tomorrow will be the opening of the first stage of the project
we would like to thank you for your attendance and congratulations again
and Iím welcoming
in this occasion
of the United Nations
To where? to the project
Where are we then!
I don't know where we are
I'm fed up
don't you see the officals have spoken and the people have clapped their hands to them
We are in the official opening, what's with you
okay now they spoke, that means that we are in the project
yes we are in the project
and people are sweating
and these partitions, I don't know what did they put inside
leave the box alone
These partitions are the infrastructure
The official %pw opening of the international beaches
, the third millennium, what's wrong with you.
I really don't know
Yea, thank God, aging is a disease.
I wish I knew why they deposed me
He's just parking his car.
I found this visit strange
But when she told me
Nobody told me anything
I myself saw it, there's a large farm there
Thank God, you are comfortable
You receive checks while you are relaxed at home
Why bothering, Oh! my dear, don't let anybody walk through your mind, Moneera
You should thank your God Oh! Moneera that you have brothers like Rashid Saad and Saqer.
that worry about your share and invest it.
there look at my friend Hessa,
her brothers aren't giving her a Riyal of her father's inheritance
We don't act in this way
This is your legitimate right
this is a matter of trust.. don't you trust us!
I don't know
I don't feel satisfied with what my brother, Rashid said.
He keeps reminding me of the check that they give me every three months
But, it's my right
He always says to me
you don't trust us
Money and inheritance issues must be clear
If you, my dear, are not content
you know what it does to people
and Um Salmeen is an example to you, the poor lady
who can believe that she inherited millions
Because of her brothers,
Money destroys people
But business is business and it's your legitimate right.
and then what
and we are running the company
investing lands, real-estate and money
with no problems and no headache
She said she was passing by the land, in the desert
That's more than enough to her
I'm afraid her Husband, Nasor is behind that.
What problem?
your sister started to *search*
That is the problem
She is planning to get us in troubles
it's kind of us giving her money
Calm down Saqr.
We should come up with a solution to this Oh! Rashid
in my head
What is this
my share of my father's inheritance
the charity that they give to me every three months.
Everything is clear
Forty thousands no more
As if they are not investing the money
I see, I see, I see, I see
it's clear
It's obvious.
They said let's give her more so she feels happy and stops asking
that's right, everything you said is right
they're giving me a little at a time
If you just see their wives
, has many different diamond jewels
and I don't have half of what they have.
they don't feel I deserve my father's inheritance
If you asked for it,
it's your right
legal and legitimate right
I feel they are stealing and lying to me
I don't feel comfortable about the way they act
Life is unpredictable Oh! my dear
They exhausted me, make me sick Oh! my darling
don't they know that there is judgement and punishment
and that God will punish them for taking other people's money
and be carefull, don't mention anything about the court to them, Oh! darling
They will be happy
Is it from our over-population?
That's why I'm telling you Oh! darling
calm down
Everyone has a flat that looks like a skyscraper
I just want my right
I want to build a mosque before I die.
and give charity for the poor
Mother Um Salmeen
Keep it down, Oh! dear
and don't mention anything about the court to them
or anything else
you know why!
at this time
her rights are taken away
you were questioning the accountant.
Who are you!! to ask him
Answer them !
yea I .. No no I'm here for your sister.
the door that you entered from
Don't frown
Do you know the door that you entered from
No no
No Saqr
it's a pity, Saad
Manoor don't get yourself in trouble
If you want your share in the company and the real-estate, we don't mind
six hundred thousands
She was content for her entire life
I'm sure it's her wicked husband
as she is kind
It's like I'm begging them
It's a known and definite legitimate law
He's telling me either to take six hundred thousand or nothing
it's not fair
Expect anything Oh! Moneera
My father's company,
eight buildings
without mentioning lands and houses
and he's saying six hundred thousand only
with signing a giving up document
No Oh! Moneera
Don't be cheated and sign that paper, be careful, I'm warning you
It's your right to know everything about the lands, the money and everything else, it's not up to them
But the company,
you are a partner
They just kiced you out from the company,
Nobody can stop me
Know what?
Is it your father's company
Don't you see him yelling
let me in I'm telling you
Leave him, no need
He has a paper I don't know what it is
he's yelling at us, let him shut up
We are sorry.
my brother Saad to the office and explain to them, they don't know
Come inside
See if Mr. Nasser would like to drink something
come in please
surely %pw
you'll get us into troubles
he will discover how much she has
he will discover that we owe her four hundred thousand not forty thousand
let's do the math
in ninety six months,
here is the issue, multiply it by three hundred sixty
eleven million, five hundred and twenty thousands
It's ok, so what?
Let him do whatever he can
%pw I will frankly tell him
It's our money
All of the people who inherited did the same
Welcome, welcome in your company, disregard what happened
You are welcome
Here is the accountant, Sameer
answer anything that Mr. Nasser would like to know
The whole company is under your control
If you want to come in, feel free, don't ask permission for anything
Thank you
count on me
go get him , take him
let him look at all the files
She is supposed to take more than ten millions
They didn't even mention it
poor she was saying
that her father left
four buildings,
I thought that they have three lands,
Each land is bigger than the other.
Allah suffices us for everything and He is the guardian, Oh! Son
it's not fair what they are doing
Don't leave them alone
What can I do, Um Salmeen
I have to sue them, there is no other option
He'll skim through a couple of papers
the case is postponed
Be careful my Oh! son, Oh! Nasser
Don't mention anything regarding the court
Oh! madam, you are here and the doctor is looking for you,
get up Um Salmeen
go to your room
and all Muslim patients
he didn't tell me
Sorry, who's speaking
Oh, I now remember you, yes yes I remember you
Yes yes yes yes
Regarding what, my brother!
Never mind, thank you
Now that he knew that we have money, he's going crazy
Do you think that this Abdulla that you sent to them can
Is he a close friend of Rashid?
He knows him very well, for years ago
can you believe Moneera
Even Abdulla, he gave me an advice
Chase them up
Don't leave them alone
Try to take as much as you can from them
Do you know what Abdulla is telling me
are not for people who live for seventy or eighty years,
it's for people who will live for at least two hundred years
Um Salmeen, may Allah mercy her
May God have mercy upon her soul, she used to say
the number of our residents didn't reach four hundred thousands,
and the case takes ten years and even more
do they have to *mummify* us to consult the court
That is him
Yes dear, are you sitting with them
Good luck
btw he is an old school friend
Life is short
and I seek your benefit
and you are from a big and well-known family,
and deeply rooted.
Please Oh! Rashid, we are friends
Please go while I'm still calm
or you will get beaten
go away, forget about the friendship thing
Are you going to go out or what
paid a hundred nighty thousands for a diamond jewelry set from the jewelry fair
from where she got all that money
They waste the money on their wives,
and deprive their sisters from her money
Do you still have hope Oh! Nasser
they fought with you
When I talked with him yesterday in the mosque
just let me do what I told you,
Well known and deep rooted people
Maybe, why not
but , I also suggest
May God bless this talk by these bright faces
O God, enlighten our hearts with whatís good for our earthly life and afterlife
you , listen
if you have something to say except my sister's share issue
It's right
%pw better go or you will be beaten up
I don't care what you say
I begged you for months, and you refused
I don't care
I'm going tomorrow morning
Give it to me
Hello, hello
Don't listen to her
She wonít go to the court
After tomorrow
we'll give you a chance to see what you are going to do
Good bye
Being kind is not useful with them
and they realized that their reputation is at risk
%pw we'll see what they will decide
Saad, are busy tomorrow?
She decided to take legal action against them
I asked her to postpone it till tomorrow, so we go to her tomorrow
what is this
You are right
You asked why
that you want to go to the court and sue us
in order to take your share of the inheritance
Yes, she did
May your life be nice
May your life be perfect
Why , I told you that we want to go after tomorrow
When you arrive there, first park your car in the parking lot
you'll see the security guards
you go to the eighth floor
The judges are in this floor
are business cards of all lawyers in the country
I'm sure you will need them
come here to make fun of us
We want her to start a legal action against us
Go to the court
Listen *Manoor*
and sign us a giving up document
which is good
you know the way
we showed you the way
Let's go brother
I forgot to give Moneera something important
This is today's Alrayya news paper
there is such a good article
a woman wrote it, I assume she's a doctor
I want you to have a look, as a gift *from me*
His living status must be changed
It's a pity
He has four children but his house is miserable
Surely he will be, he risked all his wealth
He took a risk in this project

a female delegation
What's wrong with you! wont you sleep today?
Hello Salem
I'm your brother Khamees
No, I'm really talking consciously to you
Oh! my brother

How can we delete your name,
The only one who can delete your name is his excellency, the minister
It's a meeting in the ministry
an official meeting
Who are you talking to
Salem Salem Salem
Tell me the truth
Who is the lady that you were talking to?
Salema Salema, salem, I swear it was Salem
if you were talking to Salem
Are you goiing to speake up?
This lie dosn't work
Don'tt lie Oh! Khamas
Wont you say the truth!
you're wearing casual clothes
she thought that I'm talking to a woman
what a pitiful life
May God bless you, please salem call
Please, so that she believe
He asked you to call
It's not your buisness
don't nose into other people's buisness, or you will something that's not pleasant
and complain about you
Hello!? hey, you!
how can you stand living with such a sharp-tongued woman
Let's start the meeting now
Hassan went to call Khamees
Ok, let us discuss the budget of the real estate first
let's start
let's hope he finds him
he got terrified when he saw the ladies
I searched the entire ministry and you're hiding here
let's go, let's go, the people are waiting in the meeting room
I can't sit with the ladies
Oh! Khamees, how would your wife know
I'm affraid she calls
*OMG* do you want her to suspect me, don't you undrstand
if i didn't answer her call, how am I going to go back home
will your wife call in this hour!
Of course, as your company is a large one
This project, which will be implemented by your company for our ministry
is one of the largest projects in our ministry history
Oh! people why is the table shaking
No, long aged, it's not the table, it's me
you can answer your call
Who is this
Sorry, who do you want to talk to
it's my phone, %pw
I'll explain to you, wait, wait
He fainted because he was affraid to go home
Her brother came
He informed him that his wife said don't come home, unless you change your job and don't work with ladies
That's why he sent a letter to the ministry to transfer him from our department
Exactly, the minister himself told me that he approved it, what does he want!
What's with his wife
this is madness
I ask him who are you talking to
I told you he's insane
What are going to do! your wife and children are coming back tomorrow
I don't know what to do
as long as you did what she wantef, why are you afraid to go home and see your children
She want an official proof
ok, give her the papers
Ok, that's what i did, I sent the paper with her brother
so that she sees the minister's signature and make sure
and hopefully agree, if she agrees, I will hopefully go back home tonight
Sister, here is the minister's signiture
what else do you want
He shall start working in the new department tomorrow
which means an office and a job, other than the one he used to work in
Where is this department, God bless you
Yes, God bless you, here's the minister's permission
Nothing, nothing, it's thatt one, on your right
Yes, pw%, God bless you
Please come in, your office is ready
Saad, and Abdulqadder, God willing, it's a big office, yes
Good bye
How come you're asking for a transfer
The department is all women
%pw My wife
nobody can implement another decision except the minister himself
You have to work until the minister comes back
Oh! brother make a deal with your colleages
and adress them with male names, so that your wife don't know
and I had put two extra for the new female employee
The new female employee, it's a male employee
few days ago, the minister's office has transformed a man to work with us
Are you serious!
he looks funny, poor man, a man working between five women, he looks funny
They say his wife is extremely jealous of other women around him
A blind jealousy
Poor man, he's needy
But he asked us to keep silent when his wife calls, we complied and didn't speak
Yea, Abdulqader who is with you in the office
***** see if it's your size
My son called, he said my wife is coming to the office
what are you doing
Go straight, it's the first foor on your left
This in the walfare office
with Khamaso ***
Those are six employees
and hese here, I am sure he came to work
These lies dosn't work for me
My wife is jealous of other women around me
Because I'm handsome
May God guides you Oh! Sultan
but we want to know which stage we reached
Uncle, Saqer and I were at the bank yesterday
That the project
Peace be upon you
Brother, I have an important meeting at work today
Go to the kitchen quickly
I'm dressed up and ready to go
In fact, your place is the kitchen
Women have to obey men
and scorpions bite is painful
This is important for the rain, look look
look uncle
Aisha, please call the secretary and ask him to inform the employees
than the meeting is rescheduled to tomorrow
I hope it's not something serious
they keep issuing orders
and we have to implement
They should realize that you are an important sperviser
and have many responsibilities and commitments
They consider women as a sevant
I've never seen people who despise women like them
what age do they think they're living
They asked me to not go to work today, and go to the kitchen to make tea instead
Where are the maids
and the other one ran away a wek ago
even the maids couldn't stand their offense
I understand them
May God be of your help
Bank notes are few,
The tea
Uncle, they mean that
In fact, a villas complex is nothing without a oark
Ok now, the park..

Darling, Fatoom, I have to go I'm late
Ok tell me, what do you have
Speak or I will go

a committee, from the women league came today
and the school nominated me to ne in the league
are you crazy
and you want to go to the league
Do you know if you told your uncle and brother about this, you'll see no good
You're the one to blame
we warned you
Why don't you come and see me, It's been a long time since the last time I saw you
It has been a year now, a year since I saw you
Is he married or not yet
Oh, may God guides you
who will agree to marry an illiterate who doesn't have a degree
No no no, it doesn't matter if he's illiterate , he's a man
and Khamees is a son of scoprions
his bite (scorpion bite) is painful
and also he should marry someone from the same social status
a scorpion like him
May God help you
What can I do Oh! Aisha
Since the minister travelled, al the papers are forwarded to me
and inform Mustafa, the head of the HR department, that I want to meet him twomorrow
but the ministry guests arrived today

Ok, coming, ok, I'm coming now
what can I say Oh! Aisha
My brothers are the sourse of all these troubles
I don't know what happened
It's ok darling, ice packs are necessary for your face to not become swollen
Didn't we warn her not to go and talk to them about it
she went to them , they had beaten her
Do you know if I told them that it's football
they would have beaten you long time ago
How embarrasing, you play football !
next time, we're going to break your neck
Know wo is talking to you
The big scorpion
that small
Yea but uncle, I didn't beat herm only Sultan did

I had choosen economy and political sciences
I chose Graphics cause it's desired these days

It's not your turn
you had your chance
Don't be greedy
Ok, scorpion
Beat her, break her teeth in her mouth
Let me beat her
She's here with me
Go to the scholarships department
and cross out architectural engineering
Takeyour time
so that we make sure
I talked to Sultan and Saqer
They don't mind that you marry Moneera
What else do you want
Yea, our son Khamees deserves all the best
I will arrange a meeting with them and let you know
Your nomination to be with the delegation
I appreciate your personal circumstances
But give yourself a chance to think about it till tomorrow
To tel you the truth,
They care about you a lot
and your nomination is from the minister
he's right
I know my brothers very well
They will never agree
I'm surprised
Their car loand are paid from my salary
and I provide for the house
and she wants me to travel with her as well
aren't we going to get her married this week
What are you saying
Khamees is fool, he doesn't even have a school degree
get married and travel with him
Done, let's go
That's shameful
they'll kill her if she refused
Oh! son I told you many times
Why don't you go
tomorrow, I will go tomorrow
Never mind, as long as he's a son of scorions
appearance dosen't matter
I don't wamt to marry Khamees
and go to the kichen
and put it in the living room
madrid and barcelona's game is tonight
i hope Valansia don't beat us
My sourses are reliable
she's devoted and hard working
What do you think of that
what do you want me to do
We have to go
Go to your offices please
Thank you, may God give you long life
long life
serve coffee there
Her excellency
May God give her long life
Welcome, may God give you long life
Good Afternoon your excellency
yes, may God give you long life
did you wash the coffee cups
Go and pour coffee for captain Emad
and also
We're going to play in China after tomorrow
Yea Captain, I forgot to introduce my sister, Mariam to you
I'm going to the official engagement
are you stupid
You know nothing in life, and you want to marry a minister
Say hi to %pw
yes madame
pour it out and make a new one
Actors calls
You know, also Mashael called me minutes ago
what can I say to her
That's pity, Nouf role is not suitable for Mashael
Nouf is a sixteen years old girl
and Mashael is apparently in her twenties
Ok, why don't she take Mariam role
It fits her better
Nouf's is for thirty
We have to get rid of picky person in the committee
He's a problematic, I'm sure he'll not let it run smoothly
He's detailed
He will talk about art, family values, moral art, content, etc
Who selected him for that committee
The minister is the one who formed the committee
Me, you and Hamed can impact on him
No no no that's impossibe
Nothing indicates that it's ours
Even if he went and asked in the ministry of economics,
he won't find our names
The company is issued under Hamed's wife name, may God bless you
Don't be worry about that
Don't worry, actuallt, who's the chairman of the committee
The final word is mine
No no man, everything is fine, come in
I've just talked to them and agreed on everything
Peace be upon you
Upon you be peace, welcome rashid, come in
As you know, this meeting is particularly to determine whether we'll approve "Conscience extortion" serial or not.
and it's being produced by Modern Touch Arts Institute
It's a nice, unusual and bold action serial
I agree with Hamed
The story of the serial is very nice
I agree with you
I liked when she took the gun and killed her neighbor
and wanted to hide the gun, so she put it in the car
and didn't know that it's her son's, it's thriling, and when police came
and her son comes from school
and kick a box
so he kicked it and it flew into his mom's wondow
Here comes the surprise
This part of the box entering the mother's room
and it's good that a local company produces that advanced level of productions
we have to encourage and support them
Mister Rashid,you didn't tell us your opinion
You left me nothing to say
with all due respect to your opinions and reflection on the serial, this "Conscience Extortion"
and human values extortion
repulsive surprises
One and a half person each episode
the other half is left for the next episode
this serial is written with no social awarness
It doesn't carry a moral message that helps the society progress
Tears falling, Why do you have to make the viewers cry
Excuse me Rashid
You gave us your opinion, Ali gave us his opinion, let Mr Rashid express his opinion
It's clear from the meeting
that there is an agreement between you
You've organized it
Some people understand and it's their domain, others have nothing to do with the field
I desapprove that serial
I'm affraid he gets us in troubles
Ignore him
What can he do, he can't do anything
I will do what I want
He gave me the bag and said it's from madam Sameera
I don't know what to do
I can't believe it Oh! Nasser
it's for the new serial that we'll produce soon
The one that has the driver rape the daughter
for the blessing things we've got because of it
The first blessing is the beautiful ring in your hand
I'll tell you how
So they present it with Hamed's wife name, who sent you the ring
and your husband's role was to cover their back
has a share of five percent from the production
It's a nice role
I've hust played a similar role, didn't you see "Lost Dreams"
By the way
It's called The Extortion os something, I can't recall
Yea, Dreams Extortion
why are all the names are alike
Last year's serials were all about girls
You notice that each serial has more than eight girls or even ten
Your role is secured
You are dearly loved
Lucky you,
Yes Omar
Yea ok, ok
sorry my darling I have to go to work, donno what happened there
Just eat and go
He said he wants to see me for a very important and urgent issue
I have to go
I heared that Rashid met wit hthe minister
He spent half an hour with him
and told him you are going to troube him
I told you he complained about us to the minister
What happened is that the minister office called and want to meet with me
I also fear that the minister believe him
I will meet with the minister
The man came to clarify his point of view regarding the serial
That's all
This is true, may you live longer
But firstly, your excellency, I would like to say that it's not acceptable that you talk about a collegue behind his back
Everyone knows that Rashid is
He's jealous of everyone around him
He just cares for finacial benefit
But it's his specialization
But, may God bless you, not anyone who is educated can handel these art matters
Specially TV productions
Conscience Exortion, the serial we are working on
it's a huge production
We'll have a media initiative on the Gulf level
and strong distribution
Of course, it's your specialization, you know better than me in this matter
i promise you of a great serial
That will stand up for our name
See what the journalist, Abdulhameed has written, listen listen
Also, one of the actors said
that the serial promotes immoral ideas
that is limited to the fall of decency
This is really a bold and powerful criticism
They will be in a big trouble if the journalist, Abdulhameed keep writting about them
and if the people I charge know about it
But they are sharp, they know how to handle it
they are a grang
We need to creat our own website
and put on it all our company's activities
What is the name of the company again?
from now on, you are the media consultant
Conscience Exortion serial that Mercury Media Production Company is supervising is considered as
qualitative leap in the Arab Drama
because it carries a moral thoughts and values
It's a serial that aims to develp the society
is the same journalist who critisized them few days back
Is it possible that he change his opinion to the opposit
How can he accept that
Thejournalist Abdulhameed and the others like him
Don't worry Mr Hamed
He said what do you think of the serial, I told him it's gonna be the best on the Arab World
I hope so
I feel that our serial os gonna be the bomb
I don't know where he is
, the other one is packing and ready to go
Not an interesting start
Your stories are always unrelistic, and the events never happened in reality
It's obvious from the first sight
your writers are silly
*It could happen*
Your serial is absurd, absurd
What do think
It's very tragic
Other bad serials are not an excuse
can understand this production from the first time
These are lines and hidden dimesions, it needs a person to focus in order to discover it
By the way, it's a political drama
It's a shame that it's been viewed
What's wrong
You weren't stressed in that way yesterday
I was at Souq Wagif Yesterday with Ali,
We were in a coffee shop
I ignored me
Nasser, what do you think of what happened, it the minister is upset, this is a big problem
within one week, we'll all be fired
what a failing serial, all the people who watched it said it's a failure
I heared that Rashid plans to visit him
and tell him that the serial is a failure and has no action
This is disaster
Leave it to me
Let's see what Nasser is going to do
Listen Oh! Elie
From now on, I don't want any criticism of the serial in your page
Elie please
few days back I saw an article that not just criticises the production, but also curses it
Don't make me upset
I'm sorry
In that day I was off
I would never let them write that
But frankly, I haven't received any praisful message
again, a great success
Good bye
Brother Rashid,
Am I supposed to believe you or the news papers
Conscience Exortion is the best Tv production
May you live longer, they have an agreement
Listen to what the other news paper has written
do they have agreement also with the viewers page
I almost had a heartattack
in a while, they told me
Lucky you, the minister is pleased
Honestly Nasser,
Be ready to watch Conscience Exortion II
No no no no, enough Oh! brother,
the serial, he said he wont write again
He preferes staying in his miserable job
a second part, after all these troubles
a third and a fourth also
What's wrong with you, you don't want to benefit
One of his friends told me
Here I'm
what the magician can do
I wish you more success
Please tell us what do you tink of that success
I thank God for that success
are haters and enemies of our success
I find it strange
that this serial wins awrds while it's a failing serial
But they're the experts
They granted the awards for it, sure they see what we can't see
Prepare a second part of the serial
Ok, may your life be long
a true magician
You'll see, "Conscience Exortion" will
I saw you talking with the minister at the begining of the event
are Television festivals lying too!
I heared him saying be ready for the second part
It's the same thing
are taken to the bank to wash and become clean
All the weak, absurd and immoral serials that you see
they nominate it in the Arab and Gulf festivals
to clean it, and give it awards, so that people consider it high class
Yea, that's true
As long as the judges are the producers themselves
Peace be upon you
Upon you be peace, Thanks God you arrived
It's tru that we signed a contract with them, but they want to lower the prices
Come to my office
We are not a small bakery or bread shop
We are one of the biggest bakery companies in the world
We will not lower it
otherwise, we'll terminate the contract
We've already signed a contract yesterday
with the British company
K Cup W Up
As you like
He has done a marvelous job
He'll be the first in the world to produce that product
He's not only the best bread baker in the world
I'll tell you
How can a bread be with a (Sousta)
opening it by your hand or going to the kitchen and searching for a knife to cut it, and it might cut your hand
So, he made a bread with Sousta (zipper)
to put the cheese and close it again
This isn't a bread, it's a pants
so what do you think, in fact, it's bread bag
How can we remove that sousta(zipper)
if so, one can say to his friend, I ate two zippers
Why the pastry of the Light Mountains Hospitals was not dilivered yesterday
I know, but why didn't you deliver it yesterday
The bakers that make it
again, he used the bakers
That what happened, sir
Why are you yelling at him
You're wasting your time with football and delaying my work
You know your son loves football
So what, what's the problem if he took few employees from the company to have fun with
You have four hundered employees in the company
Eleven main players
four replacement players, and two administrative assistants, that's all, only seventeen
and the team spokeman
Why are you upset with him
But it's ok in the meanwhile. although fans are the most important players in the stadium and it's the player number twelve
I let you have fun with them
and we already signed a contract with the people
When he first told you that he wants to play football
He listened to you
He didn't do anything
No you are upset with him just because he took some employees to play football in front of him and have fun
I didn't say he can't take some employees
Even if some of your friends need some employees, you can lend him some
the important bakers
Yea son, why do you take the important bakers, this cannot be
Next time, inform me before you take any employee
No no, let Hamdi do these paper work
He's in the hospital
Why, didn't they inform you
I finished work, and while getting into my car
Nasser called me
I went to him
He said that they couldn't find the goalkeeper and they have an important match today
*He said find us a goalkeeper, then we arrived to the playground
wear a goalkeeper suit
I never player football touched a ball
That situation
is absurd
and we shall find you a job instead of wasting your time with football
Let me explain
Father, you want me to cancel and discharge the team, right
yes, that's right
Ok father, please, I beg you
I can't discharge the team, tomorrow is the final game
No no no, he's right
do you agree
Congratulations for the winning
Congratulations mister Nasser for winning the cup
We wanted to know how did you plan for the winning
See, I prepared the team psychologically, physically, and mentally and the coach worked hard
In a hotel
Congrats to you all, and there will be a party, as promised
Your father seem to be happy
I'm affraid he's just being nice and courteous
Uncle Abu Nasser, in the beginning, we'de like to congratulate you on the winning of your big team, Team of the International Bakers
for such a huge success
May God bless you, No no no
No photo without Bisht (traditional Arabic men's cloak), wait, wait, hold it
No no
He is wearing The Bisht
Your care, concern and your creative views played a big role of this success, certainly
and the plan of the coach
but, they played five-five-three-two in the finals
and you as an athelete know that changing the board plan confuses the players, nevertheless, bakers team was not confused and did a great job
and the plan of the coach
Bu Nasser, as the first atheletes in the international bakers team, what do you suggest players to do
to the infinity
Welcome Welcome
Long life
They are welcomed, is Humoud Sultan with them?
They are welcome to come but they must have dinner with us first
Dinner, ok!
Thank you, Oh! Bu Abdelaziz
and it's considered as contribution to the private sector
The team is still young
Do not envy me
No, who?
Bu Abdelaziz
The deputy of the engines that we use in the factory
You see
I wanted to get to know him long time ago
Football introduced me to him, I mentioned that to him
I told him Oh! Bu Abdilaziz
You were not interested in football for your entire life
what does it has to do with you
the ball was always close to me, just fifty cm was between us
Bu Nasser hasn't arrived yet?
No, he didn't show up today as well
There is a symposium regarding football injuries, he's the platinum sponsor, he has to be there
You'll see more
Did you see the building behind the bakeries that he wanted to make it an accomodation for the labour
he's obsessed with football
As usual, we tend to meet and interview one of the figures in the sport field
This man inspire the bakeries team by his great thoughts
What about the international bakeries team, we heard you're doing a comprehensive development
in comparison with offices, and all the efforts
it's a small amount of money, only one million dollar for all these efforts
No man, be generous
It's not my fault brother Shaheen
My fault
so what was my fault
that you told me that you need the players for the gulf states
The prices for the gulf are top dollar
which means if a player costs two thousands
for the gult it costs three or four million dollars
I don't get it, explain it to me
Recieve my fax from here
and read it in front of me when he's with you
My dad bought four new players for the team, besides a new shipment of four players
You know, he's wondeful, he can easily beat billy and Ronaldinho
but eight hundred thousands is written on him
Yea, that's true, may God bless you, but a Turkish club has put this price
In UAE they sell him for one million and two hundred thousands
Don't look at me
Ok can we examine the commodity
It's here
leg calf
It's good, ok
No no no I guarantee you
He's fat, God willing, Good he's fat
This one is svelte, good for the center
the connective muscle
It's the most important muscle, no use pof a player without it
Thank you
Let your driver take them to the Automatic club, automatic, what did I say! Automatic
How come
Hamdi, let's go
Congrats, congrats
These are, God bless you, a young players
Yea, we bring them from the African Jungles,
We feed and raise them, and then release them in the stadiums
My pleasure, you can take him, do you have a space for him or I carry him with the pick up truck
when he saw them putting presure on us
he asked the offense player to play
Kakakano Makalali Dendah, No
ask the defense player to play
Kajomakakani Lululu was supposed to play
He's a beginner coach
Even if he was in Mars
Spain! even if he was a coach in Mars
I don't like how he runs the game
this one shoud be on AlShamal road
there are rules for the game
Even if it was two days
What's going on, why are you yelling
Your stupid son
he's not convinced that the coach isn'y expert in football
Listen to her, she talks like Metsu
and he knows that the offense player Selolu Tikawawa is a good centeral player as Ahmad Altaieb said
Nobody will give you a hedache
Just stay away
I know how to deal with him
Whydid the team lose ground
the team is supposed to think of changing the plan
as the players aren't playing in their positions
and the player takulamakaKulalalalu is misplaced, he should be moved to his usual position
Ask the coach to change the ...
to dismiss Hobuwai Malalu
Ok ok ok
No no no no, what's happening the stadium
This is not supposed to happen
The coach should not do that
please postpone these issues till the game finish
people are watching this, it's happening in front of the camera
a forth goal to Najah team, the ball entered the goal area
He scored the fourth goal, he's the star of the game today
This coach is wrongheaded
tell him, Uncle Bu Nasser no longer want you as a coach for his team
and you, shut up*
I'm watching the game on TV and you stay as a spare player, do whatever I ask you to do
Don't do that, it's not good
We have a game tomorrow, how are we going to play without a coach
What is your father doing
enough Oh! Rashid
What's wrong with you?  You freaked me out, tell me what's wrong with you?
He divorced me Mom, divorced me.
Divorced you ! How come?
I don't know mom, I don't know.
Why he divorced you? You were only married for less than a month.
I swear to God mom, I don't know, I don't know %pw.
He divorced you for no reason !
Yes, Mom, yes.
I swear to God mum, I don't know, suddenly he came and told me, go to your family's house.
I told him why is that? He said, you are divorced.
I swear, I don't know what's going on?
They were only married for a month. What will people say about us?
I agree with you.
I don't know what to say.
I only know that he divorced her, from you now.
Sit down. One minute and I'll come back.
Because of her high morals.
She insulted Barcelona.
The light of my eye, Abdullah.
He came to me crying.
He said that she insulted Barcelona and he is very attached to that team and he respect it
, and she insulted him and hurt his feelings.
He told me mum she insulted Barcelona and I told him divorce her and I'll find you another wife.
to tell him that your daughter is divorced because she insulted Barcelona team.
Only, for this reason he divorced her, are you serious.
I don't care.
Is it easy to hurt someone's feelings?
A wife stabs her husband in his loyalty.
I can't believe what I'm hearing !
We don't need a girl who doesn't respect international teams.
This time she started making fun of Messi.
Problems between the couple happends and we should.
Instead of one there is a thousand girl.
The girls are a lot and they wish to marry him.
%pw Listen to me.
I don't want to listen to anything
and please don't intervene. This is my son and I know him very well
I told you it is not your business
I'll be angry at you.
Don't bother youself Oh!  son and don't think about it.
Intsead of one there are thousand girl.
Why you are upset !
, but when I remember her word
That Real Madrid is better than Barcelona
Alright, darling.
What's wrong with her !
Her name is Mona.
She was married for a one month?

We have to face them !
And to get back our clients whether they like it or not.
Do you have money to pay?
I'll pay.
I'm ready to do anything,
but most importantly that he won't defeat me.
This dress that you have chosen worth sixty thousands riyals.
Of course without the bow ties in the middle.
This is a gift from the designer, from me.
And I put on it for you a crystal, there is only fifty pieces of this crystal in all the world countries and this piece is a very unique.
Of course there is no discount, our prices are renowned internationally.

Do you believe me Um Nasser.
For six days, not even one client has entered their shop.
No and today's afternon they didn't open, they've closed.
And you will hear that he put his shop for sale.
I'll kill him, I'll kill him.
Even they can't sit there, he sat outside.

Is there is anyone holds hostility towards you?
There is someone God bless you has deliberately sprayed the shop with this smell
And those are chemicals
Are you sure that someone has sprayed a smell in the shop?
You are cousins, you are adults not young to fight like kids.

I didn't spray anything that's your smell.
Don't cross the line.
You have signed a pledge at the police.
Don't worry.
This time,

Without letting anyone catching me at fault.
No, everything is alright.
That's what puzzles me.

Yeah Oh! Brother please, give me the key. My mother is sick, give me the key, give me.
Its in the car.
I need a Wheelchair.
One moment, one moment, I'll bring the a wheelchair right now, right now Oh! Sheikh.
Can I tell you something, can I tell you something?
Mum is very sick in the car and I need a wheelchair please.
Where is the patient? Inside the car?
Oh! Son son, what happened?
Be quite and don't speak, just see while your silent.
Peace be upon you.
Nothing wrong, but my mother, your lady, she has an asthma, quickly.
I'll tell them to prepare the bed.
Alright, alright.
And don't bother yourself.
God is sufficient of you, What you've done?
Fine Oh! Rashood.
Take care of our son Rashoud.
As you like, come with me Mr. Rashoud.
Come with me Mr. Rashoud.
And I'll take Mr. Rashoud and I'll do what's necessary for him.
That's the expected from you,
I'll tell the nurse to come to see what you want to drink your excellency.
Come with me Oh! Mr.Rashoud.
Excuse me.
What shall I do there are so many people, just wait !
The problem is that no one is taking care of us.
Sir, what do you want to drink tea, coffee or cappuccino.
You are not the first one, Nassor the security at the hospital married a filipina.
Who told you that I'm refused.
Not even one woman gives me attension.
They are philosophizing and they are demanding.
He doesn't have a degree, I don't want your mother, What's that I don't want your mum ! Go and look for your friends.
Oh! Brother, there is a girl at the hospital, I like her.
If she ignores you, look for someone else.
I can't Oh! Brother, the heart is attached.
Your brother fall in love, do you believe, when I see her
Take this one to Dr. Mohammad.
What's wrong with you !
Go now.
God curse on you.
Your honor, our anut is now enjoying her full health.
You are a professional actor Oh! Saud, Oh! Guys next !
Bravo, do you see how they clapped for you and how they praise you.
Now, go and change your outfit and remove the makeup.
Oh! Man forget about it, come and sigh for me here first,
Yes, from now on, my name is Faleh Al-Marzouz.
Forget about this and write Saud.
Saud had passed away.
From now on, my name is Faleh Al-Marzouz, Abo Abdulaziz.
God bless you dear.
One buffet !
I did two.
Even I've heard one of the brides relatives saying, wow they are very classy, I don't think that anyone can do something similar to what they've done in the wedding.
Alright darling, bye-bye.
Check this out Mum.
That I have to bring them something in the occasion of signing my marriage contract.
What's the matter mum?
Look at your brother who's going to disgrace us !
Ew, that's embarrassing, by the way its cheap.
But that's based on our budget, It works.
Leave this thing for maids to eat it
He wants to make us a joke.
Its good that I saw it.
This type is the free class, Its for the high society
Approximately above the average.
No, we want something unusual, something that not anyone can afford it.
Pardon me Sheikha, You can't blame someone who doesn't know your capabilities(Idiom).
Shut up, just shut up you don't know anything.
I'm afraid that the money that I have is not enough.
Don't embarrass us, pay by the credit card.
What's this luxury, it's very sophisticated.
Yesterday Saleh had sined his marriage contract.
Saleh Nasser !
I'm at you disposal, I'm at your disposal.
It's coming for you.
They booked the small ballroom and the food was disgusting.
Very cheap.
What she said about the Saeeds wedding,
Definitely, everyone say the same thing.
That's what scares me !
My beloved sister,
He is only worried about the money.
And he don't care about what people say.
He wants to make us a joke.
But we are supposed to bring something based on our budget and our circumstances.
Do you know that some people take loans, sell their houses and cars just only to do a lavish wedding and to stop people from talking about them.
Leave it for us, and the cheap chocolate is enough that you were about to embarrass us with it.
You've said that the director liked the tray and he took it home.
Alright, if the bride's family said that we choose the ballroom, the stage and we prepare everything alone
And you think we will choose anything !
No, not anything, but the shop that we go to it earlier have a very suitable price.
By the way, this shop had designed the Abo Thahab's wedding.
Does anybody use it before?
To be honest, one time.
In the wedding of the daughter of his honor, Mubarak.
No, no, no, we don't need anything that have been used.
I need a stage that we are the first in the world to use it.
That means that you want to excel.
Show me what you have.
This stage is used for the first time in Qatar.
Inspired by the informational revolution like Facebook and Twitter.
Very modern and up to date.
How much is this stage with the other arrangements ?
I'll calculate for you now, but not less than hundred and twenty five thousand.
Mum mum, by doing that our money is not enough, everything is the most luxurious, the best and excellence all of that costs money.
Everyone do like that.
Please, shut up.
What's the decision?
So, did you like this one?
This Noah ship.
Both of them are new, but Noah ship is more expensive with twenty thousands.
No, for what God bless your parents, I think that the mouse stage is much better.
Shut up, No I need Noah ship.
These are wedding and its costs. By the way, we are considered as a middle class.
Do I have to pay a stage for a hundred and fifty thousand and a ballroom for a hundred and fifty thousand, the one that you booked the Royal Ballroom as you call it?
I didn't say a box, but why is this show off and everyone wants to look at each other and everyone wants to do better than what other have done.
It's a boast battle and no one is benefiting except the owners of wedding shops
Who knows that everyone want to be special, they take advantage of us and lie to us.
I swear I know one of my friends who say that his brother has a wedding shop.
He say that the stage doesn't cost more than two thousand riyal.
I'm just waiting for this moment in which his father say yes.
All right then, do something.
Just like other guys who get married and manage themselves.
Hello Shaikha, your honor.
How are you?
I know that you love excellence.
That's why I'm calling you.
First time to be in Qatar, designed by the international artist Petter Salamon.
A collection that's inspired by the nine planets
From the Solar System.
With Noah Ship stage, it will looks spectacular.
There is no such a harmony, you will be the first one in Qatar to use the nine planets.
Alright then,
It was a hundred and fifty thousand and now?
Alright then,
May God comfort you.
As you wish (Idiom).
So many expenses brother.
By the way I was unable to have all the Eighty thousand.
Everything that I could gather is Sixty thousand and I took Twenty thousand from my brother.
Thank you, thank you very much Oh! Brother Oh! Fahad.
How can I settle things Oh! Fahad, as long as we showing off in weddings, we are in trouble.
Without any show off.
Of course you will receive the invitations that you want.
Yeah, this week if God wills, we will start with the invitations.
That our wedding will be better than their wedding.
Mum look at the invitations that your son have chosen for the wedding.
Your brother is living where?
People are now traveling to countries just only to design their invitations.
Unlike Amina's family, they went to Italy to design their invitation, they print it and they come back. Also Moneera's family,
They went to France, even people who are not rich, they go to Lebanon to bring their invitations.
The system is working like this in the country, do you want us to be different?
So why, which country do you want to travel to?
We have seen some amazing invitations.
Really, it's expensive, but.
But it is special and no one have done it before.
Glitter, I don't like it.
Gold would be much better, sparkling.
Oh! Brother if he can't handle the wedding expenses,
Then why he involved himself.
And leave all this showing off and boasting in weddings and all these costs which has no benefits
In which the only beneficiary from our insanity is hotels and wedding planners.
That's him, he is leaving, poor him.
Let me pick him up, he might not find anybody to take him.
Come on, I'll give you a rid.
Thank you Oh! Abo Nasser.
Oh! brother, the bride's family should support you.
I've tried one time, only one time,
I've told there that there is no need for a ballroom in a very well known hotel.
Why, you've found our daughter in the street and others are not superior than her.
That's the problem, everyone is looking at one another.
Who've told you that I got married?
At least they don't have this boasting.
It's all about a simple party and some little expenses.
And come on Oh! Man, nowadays they are doing Face Book weddings.
Cheaper and with a less cost.
That means that you won't get married from your country.
Forget about it, do you want me to be crazy.
You will see,
If I didn't bring Abdullah Rowaished or Nawal to my son's wedding.
Damn her, she won't be better than me.
I wanna ask you something dear,
If your son has Rowaished's number, give to us, so that we can contact him.
Alright dear, thank you very much, bye.
Mum we agreed on the DJ why you've changed your mind.
And Um Nassor will be better than me?
You forgot who is she and who we are?
People who were less than us, have become better than us.
It's not like that mum, but look at my brother Saleh, he broke my heart and we don't put so much pressure on him.
Really, he broke me heart.
Oh really !
At the hospital ! when and which hospital.
I don't know, she just suddenly fell.
She heard that and she just fell.
He has no point and no one can blame her, after she had prepared everything and the people knew, he simply said that he doesn't want a wedding.
He want to embarrass us.
What did the doctor say?
He will embarrass us, he want to cancel the wedding.
And hopefully, everything will be alright.
Don't burn her heart.
Oh! Son you are a man and you are a breadwinner.
Go, go and comfort her.
I swear if you say that to Abu Yousif, his heart will stop beating.
You know why the minister has kept Abo yousif until now.
By the way , he should be retired before three or four year,
There is nothing wrong with it, he will help me.
I swear, you are crazy.
Did you understand, what I want from him now.
And you will let him hide the papers and the statements, until you bring back the money.
They call it postponement of cooling the amounts.
I won't speak and I don't know why why you are panicked.
There is nothing to worry about and by the end I'll, I'll bring you back the amount.
Do you know what they call me, do you know what they call me?
The difciplined, the disciplined.
Uncle, Uncle, I tried, but there is no other way than this.
If I give you and later auditing people,
And they are tough in auditing, they will take me, quickly, quickly.
Quickly, the tablet, the tablet, the tablet.
You ate, you ate the tablet.
No, No, If God wills, from seven thirty we will be in the ballroom to receive guests.
No, no definitely we will be there.
I'll make a wedding for my son that's going to be the talk in entire Doha.
Surprise !
Alright dear fatima, I'll take to you later.
I'm worried about you that they will envy you Oh! Son, if you entered on them tomorrow like that with the Bishet.
So Mum, the Biesht length is good?
The police are here !
Hopefully that there is nothing wrong.
%Pw police, just stay here and I'll come back.
God is only sufficient of you Oh! Salooh.
Forget about your wedding.
Marriage cage, now will get into the prison cage.
They discovered the document that I hide for your loan and now all of a sudden, they discovered me.
Why you are upset !
You will hear so many disasters more than this one.
What to say then !
A respectful and sincere employee
Who loves his work, the Ministry has contracted with a company to do maintenance.
The employee from his concern about his work, he go and asked about the materials.
He find out that it costs four hundred thousand.
He will save for the ministry a one million and six hundred thousand.
And the minister punished him ! No, no, no, I can't believe it.
Why you can't believe it !
Here is saad,
Of course he has all the news.
He fired him from work.
What happened to the world? Where are the values?
They are saying that he called his office director
And he told him, let her work instead of Othman.
And who's she?
She is the daughter of the director of the same company that have offered the maintenance offer
Which Othman have detect.
No, no, no, no, this is unbelievable.
You are always surprised Oh! Saleh !
This company is for whom?
For whom?
We have became like this !
What are you saying !
It's not about what I'm saying, this poor employee Othman, what's his fault !
His fault that he is honest and sincere !
Do you think that the boss is in his office ?
Yes, he left before a while.
What's wrong with the world !
We started to see some strange people.
I agree with you, Othman doesn't deserve it, but We can't do anything about it (idiom).
It is not fair your honor, he has seven children and he doesn't have a passport.
He makes a living by this job ! What he will do now and where he will go?
Do you know what happened?
The new employee who's the minister hired,
She entered Othman's office and she starts working. Poor Othman came to take his stuff, she prevents him and she said to him go and I'll send you your stuff with the tea boy.
Where is he now?
Things got reversed Oh! Othman?
This is the reward !
This is God's will (idiom).
Bless to God almighty.
God almighty all generous Oh! Othman, God won't leave you, bye-bye.
What's the matter ? You doesn't sound ok !
I know, I know that you are very sensitive.
What work ! I just can't work, I'm leaving now
And it's a chance to pass by my mother and to bring you the stuff.
I don't want you to stay upset like that.
Why you are shouting at me ? I'm your mother.
I'm not shouting at you, I'm asking you.
How it's ok, in what right you go with him? Is he your husband, your father or your brother?
The world have changed, where are you living?
I don't know mum !
You are insane.
People have liberated, the globe became a small village, where are you living !
, but what to say !
Be modern, live this time and don't be backwards.
Get the stuff from the car quickly ! Go, don't look at me and close it.
Anything wrong Oh! Saleh, what's wrong with you?
No, you are not fine today.
You've shout at the poor maid, it wasn't her fault.
You know I didn't mean it.
No, no, no, I don't have the appetite.
So that I can forget the disasters that I saw.
Dear, don't cry.
Boss is a bit angry.
It's our pleasure your honor.
Thank you, thank you very much.
and working hard and perseverance.
Correct, wow.
The most important thing,
The most important thing for me in this ministry
That's right Oh! Your honor.
Tell me, what's the benefit of the employee who doesn't take bribe?
He is useless.
That's why I want you all
There is no place for sincere people and for people with principles and the threadbare values.
If I discover one day
He will only blame himself.
Being just is a principle whatever the reaction is !
That's why I want you to cooperate with me
If you have a doubt
Just tell me.
We are thieves and son of thieves and No one can compete(Idiom) our sisters.
If Noura doesn't take a bribe in a day, she steals the government tea before going home.
Excellent, excellent, bravo. This is the expected from all of you, I don't want her only to be like that, but I want you all to be like her.
God bless you.
That's why I want you to leave the procurement department and to become my office director.
To be honest you know how to choose, you've chosen the right thief for the right place.
Enough Oh! Um Saud enough, don't torment me more.
I don't want to live in prision.
But God is sufficient of satin, he seduced me and prettify honesty to me.
And he told e to be honest.
You are a father.
Why you've bother yourself with honesty and sincerity ?
All your life, you were thief and relaxed.
Its good that I didn't become virtuous.
Let me talk with your father.
Don't you ever do it again.
One should be on the straightpath, he bribes, steals and be a hypocrite to live at ease.
Dad is imprisoned because all his money are unlawful.
Stop it, stop it.
Is that something to wear !
We are a decent family.
Shame on you.
Where is your tummy?
Why it's not uncovered?
You don't feel ashamed, you are shameless.
I'm shy to wear brother.
Is there is any girls that is shy nowadays.
Why you are shouting ?
Look at what your daughter wearing !
Is there is a decent lady who wear such a thing ?
And you will walk on the street without showing any part from your body?
I got sick of her, she doesn't hear what I'm saying .
I never held in backing here.
I bough for her some transparent clothes in which no need.
I'm warning you if I see you one day where something under the knee,
Since you are aware of the situation, never blame me for the consequences.
We are here, God bless you
hopefully that he is a playboy and evilish.
He is like his father.
As you see in front of you,
He is a very good man, how we can find someone like him.
Don't worry uncle, I'm bad.
What a good man. To be honest I love my daughter sara very much and I do care about her future.
Only after we heard about her.
Thanks God, she has a very bad reputation.
I came home at three thirty at night
And she came home at 5 am.
Hello, hello, what ! Hello.
Come and take me from the bar.
Start your car engine and come to take me from the bar.
This is the first time to see a father who doesn't obey his son.
Stop it dad. Start your car I'm waiting for you.
Mery I love you.
I love you too, I've disappeared, disappeared, disappeared.
Basically, basically, my father, Dad is here.
Where is he?
He is daring, unlike my father who doesn't have fun.
Let me introduce you to my boyfriend, Majed.
No dad, Abdulaziz was my ex-boyfriend.
You welcome, come in, its a weed opportunity.
And the Arabic and the Israeli satellites
Discovered that so many Palestinians did not cut their nails.
According to what the State of Palestine adheres to in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement,
At any rate, the United Nations are assembling today to discuss Israel's request of sending especial inspection commissions to inspect the Palestinian's fingures
To see if their nails are long or not.
There was a condition which is the non-existence of anything that cut, wound, or anything that brings blood out.
The State of Palestine
I'm inviting the entire international community to visit Palestine.
Of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
Are made from Cork.
And olives Oh! Man.
We squeeze olives like this, like this we squeeze olives.
We and our Arab brothers are calling the international community
To make an inspection commissions on the Palestinians' nails.
And now, let us start voting.
No, no, no, no, it doesn't reach that extent, no.
In the name of God, the most gracious, most merciful.
Saleh, Saleh, what's wrong with you?
What have you dreamed?
I dreamed of the overturned world.
Oh! Rashid, you have to have a strong personality,
Now Oh! Brother, this school that you will work on it tomorrow is number ?
I'm a teacher like you,
Why I didn't change my school, since I started teaching?
What personality Oh! Brother?
But the problem is his weak personality.
By the way, the teachers with him, they were the ones who complained about him.
To that extant Oh! Brother.
That's why you see him quiet.
Later, he started to teach.
It wasn't Ketchup, it was mayonnaise with %Pw.
Oh!  Brother, we are not talking to you to become upset,
We are telling you because this is your last chance.
And he told me I accepted Rashid, although he have a weak personality
reluctant and he is too good.
Whatever still he is a citizen.
Why you are so quiet brother?
Because all what you are saying is right.
All what you are saying is right.
From tomorrow,
A new Mr. Rashid.
Mr. Rashid,
Your are absolutely right.
Alright forget about it.
And from tomorrow,
Yeah, that's good and what's next.
Here I'm telling you,
I'm a teacher who doesn't like mistakes,
Let's say that a boy jump and tell you like what the other boy in your previous school said and the inspector is there,
And take your bag !
Slowly, slowly, you break the door.
Alright, one learn from his mistakes.
From the first minute,
Here I'm telling you,
I'm nervous.
It is up to me !
Just shut up !
It seams that he said just shut up !
Have you heard him ?
Tell him Mr. Rashid have kicked me out.
It seems that he said I don't care, but he will see, I don't want to see your face here in the class.
Professor, you don't know who's he?
He is the son of whom?
Here is Mr. Rashid coming.
Have you seen him?
Professor the problem is that if he told his father.
Alright, where do you usually see him =sitting, sitting during the break?
You might find him on the chairs area, sitting.
Above the chairs.
The chairs, the chairs.
By the end of the day is human.
But you have yelled at me !
Friends and they are kidding, you are kidding me.
Dad is abroad and next week he will come back and if he come back I'll tell him.
No, no, no, no, Abdulrahman, May God protects you.
We, we are friends. By the way, the raspberry ice-cream is very nice, you might not try it. It has a little bit saurness, but its awesome.
Alright, go and get it quickly.
The only thing I'm afraid of is that he tells his father.
You've said that his father is abroad.
Yeah, he is abroad, his father won't come back? That means that they took his father stuff and they kicked him out !
I hope that there won't be a serious consequences.
You've carried his bag and brought it to him, you gave him your phone number, and you've told him if you need anything call me I'm your friend.
Yeah, but.
Yeah, but what ?
You are the ones who told me
Shout and pretend that you are strong.
Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.
Oh! Rashid !
Sleep, you can sleep, you can sleep, don't bother yourself, sleep.
Mr. Abo Nasser, Mr. Rashid is in the toilet.
One juice and.
Come here, come here, come here, come here, give me.
Go, quickly.

That's why I've gathered you, so that I can hear you perceptions for the ceremony.
How can anyone guarantee a boy?
That will make us in trouble, that's him, he is calling.
At three o'clock.
Which is, hello. He hang up, I swear he is kidding.
Faster, faster.
Peace be upon you.
Stand up for the inspector, sit down.
Yes, I'm at your service.
Oh! Professor come, come her Oh! Professor.
Are you done from shouting?
I'm not making fun Oh! Man, But I'm asking you, did you finish? ?
I'm finished or not, where is the teacher's prestige? By doing that you are insulting yourself and insulting the teaching profession.
Alright, alright, fine, fine.
And you also raise your voice?
Yes, I raise my voice, first you have to know who is this boy?
Faster, Faster.
Only two cars.
Two cars, no, no, I want for four or five cars. Extend, extend, we have plenty of space. Go, go, go.
He thinks he owns the neighbourhood !
Abo Nasser use to do this and doesn't do that.
May God helps him.
I'm the headmaster here.
It's known that Abo Nasser
use to give all the teachers extra classes
Except me.
Who's the headmaster here,
You are the headmaster, may God guide you, what's wrong with you?
Put down your leg.
I didn't put it in your head, it's on the chair Oh! Brother.
%Pw What do you mean?
There is no need, I swear to be honest I want to relieve you.
What is what do they call it?
So, what to do with you now?
Behave yourself better for you and you will take extra classes whether you like it or not.
What's wrong with you, go, go, go, get out !
Alright, I'll get out.
As you like, we've told you Oh! Man.
We have to stop him at his limits.
Wait Oh! People, wait.
Don't blame us Oh! Abo Salmeen.
Oh! Abo Nayeef, you are the neighborhood leader and you should stop him from crossing the line.
I'm not my father's son.
You will see what I'll do with him.
Faster, faster.
Bye-bye your honor.
Wow, when did he bought this new car?
I've told you, but you didn't believe me.
He shaved the mustache and his face became red.
Can you believe it when he came I didn't recognize him, when he spoke I recognize him from his voice.
Do you know that he was promoted a week ago?
Which means that he is incharge of eight boys and girls schools.
What is this magical secret? Ask him to tell you, what's the secret that pulled him out from the bottom !
Here I'm telling you from day one,
When I'm teaching I don't want to hear a voice
and no breath.
Behave yourself.
And you are also reply to me, you are also arguing me. Get out from my face, get out, out, out.
When you are appointed as a minister, look for a good job with you.
So, don't tell me come and take this job
Or the other job, no brother give me choices, different jobs and I pick the most suitable job.
My brother is a minister !
I swear I'm not feeling ok from the phone call that I received.
Everybody is congratulate me.
What they will say mom, may God guides you.
This a very common thing. Every minister hires his friends and people automatically.
From this side, don't worry nice to meet you %Pw.
They know that I'll become a minister.
So, so they are bribing me, this is a sop.
A fortune that will come to us, a treasure, a treasure that will be open for us.
The big land.
Let's go, everybody go to congratulate the new minister.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Congratulation, you excellency the minister.
With blessing your honor, congratulations.
Congratulations your excellency, you deserve it.
You deserve it, Oh! Your excellency the minister.
Oh! Brothers, the responsibility is big, may God helps us on taking it.
As they say, You are very qualified for this job(Idiom).
You've left, after that Abo Saleh phone ring.
It was far from him.
Forget about him.
I'm surprised to see how he loves him now?
And Abo Sultan is not naive.
Yes, I've opened that car door for him.
Bravo, you've done so much !
We are waiting for our brother to become a minister
I've told you Oh! Mum, but you don't believe me.
You were saying it's a cafes stories, cafes stories.
After here husband die, she said that I've envied her husband.
God forbid, God forbid.
Yeah, you have nothing to saying, you don't have anything.
Mum, let's go, I've had it up to here(Idiom).
What do you mean by it's none of your business?
You just have to relax.
I've interrupted them because they made me nervous.
Yes, they are right.
But I didn't like to say that in front of my mum, you know mum she will tell everyone.
She say anything she hears it, they call her the strainer, we don't want a scandal.
So, what guarantees for you, if he is out of power, they will put you in his position?
Because I've asked.
If he was out of the office , you will be the first nominee.
What guarantees for you that they will kick him?
No, I'm very sure about this.
Don't mention it, I saw him out of th office as I'm seeing you now in front of me.
You will do magic for him.
But the plan in my head is guaranteed and effective.
It's the burn it and kick it plan.
I'll made him attend every activity that happened in the country.
At this time he will burn and when he burn, he will be out of office. When he will be out of office, he will kicked out.
I swear Oh! Brother, I don't know how and I don't know what to tell you !
Your visit is called, is called a participation that reflect how much you love your country.
Do you think so?
Today you are a statesman, you should always be present.
You must participate in everything, sorry your honor, sorry, sorry.
Before I forgot, thank you for the sheep that you've send to me yesterday.
Come on your honor, this is a simple sheep, this is not your status. What do you think your honor, are you coming with me today?
The man is waiting for you outside !
To be honest,
I don't want to go.
I'm sick, I'm sick of prestige, I sick of it.
You are a minister today, he is right. As he said you are a socialite, do a prestige for yourself !
God sends you this kind man.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

So that in the near future, if we buy a yacht, we go on if from our house immediately to the sea.
We and our kids.
Please, you have to decide about the wedding date.
It's ok, it only a year and a few months.
What's wrong with your brother, he applies too much perfume.
Amal to be honest, I've notice that your brother Khalid, I don't know.
But he is completely different than your brother Saad.
Different or not different, darling everyody is free about his actions.
And your fiance is backward, he doesn't know that there are a unisex perfume.
Let your fiance keep his opinion for himself !
I don't care.
I can't believe it Khalid !
It is not your perfume that you use like women's,
You even use their colors.
Why you are doing that Oh! Khalid?
Really, you have nothing to say.
Mom, why you don't want to believe anything about him, you don't see his actions and his behavior?
Nowadays perfumes are unisex.
Here I'm warning you.
Have you seen the bluetooth?
I heard about from my friends in the Majlis, they say it's very widespread in Doha.
I heard about it, show it to us.
You have to watch it and I'll tell you later.
See how this girl dance !
Look at the movements !
Those are girls ! Look at this one that you say that she dances very well and do some movements, Do you know who's she? She is Khaloud Mohammad's Cousin.

Fine, you will see what I'll do to him.
Wait for his brother Saad now.
Why? Let him come and you will see, let Saad comes ! I'll send him the bluetooth, so that his family watch it.
Peace be upon you.
And peace be upon you, hello, hello.
Of course, you were defeated.
Why is my cousin sitting very far?

No, But I'll send you something.
No, thank you Princess.
He run away from his family.
Are you crazy Oh! Saad?
And I will travel tomorrow.
You won't see my face in this country.
Where are you going alone? (Idiom), Where are you going alone?(Idiom).
What will people say?
They will say their son have left them and he travelled, you won't to make a scandal for us !
Oh really,
And what your son Khaloud have done is an honor and glory !
A man who turned himself into a woman, is not a scandal?
I can't face people if they say this is the gay's brother.
Tell him he travel for medication, study, work or even he commit suicide.
The most important thing that I don't live in a place where the scandal chases me everyday.
So, where are going?
I don't care about where I go (Idiom).
That's the end.
The other one we don't know where he is and this one here is he packing his suitcase to travel.
Even we don't know where he is going to?
What did you expect him to be?
What's wrong with you? I bring you to comfort me and you are throwing me with harsh words that breaks my heart.
I was telling you to take care of him.
Don't leave him for servents.
You don't know anything about him and you were busy.
And dad is busy with his work and he left the responsibilty on you.
You are right mom.
There is no hope for your sister?
In this, you are right.
What Khaloud done have dishonored us among people.
I can't see anyone.
Did you say anything to him?
That is my father's biggest fault.
We are at the queer bad Khaloud's issue.
I didn't tell him.
In a CD and give it to him.
Only when I'm going to the airport.
I'm very worried about him.
Our house should reached that extent Oh! {Amal.
Don't be surprised,
Khaloud and his peers, they don't care about their families reputations
And their brothers and sisters reputation
Whatever the religious values have called them
And they go dancing and roistering
In the evil sump.
Really Oh! Son, I'm in doubt,
Good bye Dad.
Take care of yourself Oh! Son.
Yes Dad, I have a simple gift for you Dad.
A gift for me !
Now he put the CD in the laptop, I'm affraid of what's going to happen, come with me !
Alright mom.
I can't believe that Dad is still watching the CD, it's only three minutes long.
He might go out.
Where he is going to go? There is not enough time for him to go anywhere.
Answer me, What's wrong with you Oh! Abo Saad?
Dad !
It's ok Oh! Amal,
And if I search, I will fail
To find someone with your morals,
But forgive me
May God helps you,
I see you coming into the surface !
Yes, darling.
We are living in the age of freedom.
The age of human rights and no one owes us anything.
If any one have a riyal, he can take a thousand Oh! The light of my eye.
Of course I can handle it. God save America darling.
Do you know that salaries are high now?
It's one thousand two hundred.
God is sufficient of you, whenever you speak to a driver you ask him, how much is your salary?
My salary is very low.
When he see me, he starts complaining, my salary is low and there is no benefit. We came to an agreement with him that his salary is seven hundred and you raised him a hundred when he took the license, what he wants more?
I've told him, when you finished one year working, we will raise your salary.
It seems that he is greedy and we will have hardtimes with him.
Stop it, stop it, just shut your mouth, just shut up, just shut up, send him back and get rid of him.
It's easy for you this word, it's easy.
So you will let him nagging, I hate going out in the car with him.
Alright, leave it on me.
You have now told me the story, I'm the man of the house.%Pw. Shut up, stop it, you also shut up I will deal with it.
Get up I want you outside, get up !
Come and stand up.
What did I told you?
I said your friends shouldn't come to your room. Did I say that or not?
Boss this is not my friend, that's my uncle.
He came for five minutes and he will go if God wills.
Five minutes !
and keep it in your mind !
Don't tell Madam I need a raise in my salary, I need a raise in my salary !
Everything in the world is expensive now.
And when did I give you eight hundred?
Boss I have so many issues back hime.
Those drivers in Doha earn one thousand one hundred, one thousand two hundred
And may be one thousand three hundred.
Wait, I will think.
Listen, I will raise a one hundred and %pw shut up, I won't raise you.
You don't say that I've raised you a hundred more, go to work !
What did he say?
I will tell you,
There is no benefit with a hundred,
There is no benefit with two hundred,
I'm afraid Shashe.
Why you are afraid?
All the drivers run away,
Because they work outside for three thousand or four thousand.
What's the problem? When you work in a house there is no benefit, but when you work outside you earn more money.
I'm so scared.
Look at those, they are all drivers
How much?
Two thousand and five hundred.
But I'm afraid of the police who will take me and put me in prison.
No, don't be afraid.
I guarantee you.
I was wearing my abayah and about to go out.
I was calling and now one respond to me.
He opened his room and the cabinet was empty.
Muneera's maid escaped for a year.
I will only say, God is sufficient of him.
Alright, I will come to you.
I went to the police.
If you have reported, you don't have any responsibility.
We will do everything we can do.
And you also look here and there in the neighborhood, you might see him and tell us.
Yes, he will make money and when he is full he will turn himself in.
We bring them, we spend money on them, we give them clothes, food and car training.
It is not up to him.
The match will starts now, go inside, go inside is better.
Yes, we were worried,
These are the Foxes and Foxes are not hunted easily.
Do you know that if it doesn't score more than three that means that we didn't win, we need ten or fifteen.
That's a clear mockery, a clear mockery. Let's be clear that's a clear mockery.
That's its level. If it won't score more than three, that's not the Foxes team.
Take it from me.
In ourselves, in the players and in the performance.
They have nothing, they have to thank God if they score less than three, they have to thank God.
Which goal, these is an appretisers. Our team is still hungry, this is the Foxes team, leave us alone man.
You've scored a goal now, you are relaxed and happy now.
Do you think that there are also some goals or it stops with this?
This Fox is very good, He is very clever. It goes here and there and no one can catch it, you will be dizzy. This Fox eats the chicken.
No, no I don't have car.
You are my friend.
Did you heard what he say?
He said this Fox is very problematic,
You can't catch him.
Yes, Oh! Sir.
You don't know him or not?
He is the fan of the Foxes team.
He sometimes appears on the program Refresh Yourself.
They will win today and you will lose.
I swear I will beat you. The foxes team never lose, it is always the winner.
Thaaloub, What do you think about the result today?
Why you are asking me about the result?
It's over, the Foxes is the winner.
The brids came to take their livelihood and they fly.
Let's be realistic somehow, don't say the Foxes won and fly.
Those are the Foxes my friend.
This Fox take the chicken and eat it.
You didn't see your honor what he do in the stadium.
The crowd can't stop laughing of him.
It's evident in the stadium and thank you for listening.
The real fan who has a real loyality to the club
He hang out with the elite qataris who go to the malls and such a places.
He invited me for a cappuccino.

Tell us the poem that you made about our match with the Frogs.
Thank you for all the listeners here.
You are a frog.
You don't feel ashamed that my team defeat you with four.
Talk dirty, talk dirty about the club and the team and see what happens !
Don't say that !
When he expelled one of the foxes
And the reason behind that is a referee.
He expelled a player from the Foxes team,
I've changes his name from a referee to an idiot.
Thank you, thank you, thank you for all the listeners here.
Every month we met to choose the best fan.
Fantastic, and who did you choose this month for honoring?

Now, I know how to reach him.
The crowd have left.

Yes, he is sweet, kind and lovable Oh! Daughter.
No, no daughter, seek refuge from Satan and don't worry, hopefully everything will be alright.
Alright, bye-bye daughter.
Where is Waleedo?
Dad will beat me.
Grandmother, Dad will kill me from beating.
Don't panic Oh! The light of my eye.
Don't panic Oh! Darling.
I won't allow him to beat you.
I didn't meant to break it.
Come Oh! Son, come and drink little bit of water and rest in my bedroom.
Your face has become yellow.
May God guide him, may God guide him. Come with me Oh! Son, some.
Oh God the Generous.
I'm afraid that my father will come here.
Come on Oh! son don't worry,
No one intervenes in my son's upbringing.
This is my son and I raise him in the way I want.
But the poor buy is anxious, shaking and panicked from something that he didn't meant to do it.
Why he don't have eyes?
Let him see !
The bag hit the vase by mistake, believe me he did not intended to do that.
You ! You have to support him !
That you don't say anything for him for me please. Forgive him this time, his state of fear breaks my heart.

Of course he will ask me, why you are taking him to the hospital?
So, what's the problem, if you tell him?
If he knows that Waleed pees in his bed, he will kill him.

In the name of God, the Gracious, the Merciful
and nuclear power
which constitute sixty percent of world oil reserves
and Saudi Arabia takes the lead with twenty four percent of world reserves
then Libya, USA and Nigeria
with a three percent each then the rest of the world combined together with fifteen percent
and therefore
as well as production
and maybe that's one of the secrets and reasons behind why big industrial countries ruch to occupy this area and its countries
and on top of them is the United States of America which is the world's biggest consumer of oil
however, the oil prices are continuously rising
simultaneously with the falling of US dollar
which is taken as a unit for pricing oil
where yesterday, the price of one barrel reached
this led to the increase of income in the producing countries and at the same time
to the increase of its inflation
where the inflation in some of those countries reached fifteen percent
the most important source of energy in the world
of commodities prices and the cost of living
in a live conversation with the deputy prime minister
Qatari minister of energy and industry
Abdullah Ben Hamad Al-Attiyah
and for the viewers who are willing to participate they can call us on the contact numbers of the show
honorable deputy, hello andwelcome
i would like to start with you with the Unprecedented prices that oil have reached
where will the prices may go
of course where will the prices may reach is a puzzling question
or what we call the market force
not the OPEC?
and not the producing countries?
and not the producing countries, and the OPEC has nothing to do with the oil pricing
Is it the only relationship of price is between supply and demand
even now the supply and demand does not have much to do with it
so what are the factors?
there are other factors beside supply and demand
which made investors
feel so much presure and turned to oil and gold or so-called (commodity marketing)
investors lost their confidence in the stock markets
and gold as well
we saw the gold rising from three hundred and fifty dollar in the last years till now it reached nine hundred and seventy dollar
and till today as i previously mentioned about one hundred and nine dollar
but all of them are in rise and if they drop it will be a slight decline
let me remind you that in the first quarter of this year
which is the second quarter that should witness a drop of prices because of the lack of demand for oil
but we saw the market in an exciting and changing state in a strange way
in the second quarter and in the begining of spring time it rises above one hundred dollar
but this means that the previous factors that used to determine the rise of prices for the winter and consumption have changed now and there became other factors
and the economical growth
and in the same time we see the prices of oil rise to this level
you mentioned the political factors and you said that the political tensions play a role in this
on Iran. do you think that Falon resignation in light of the political complications
which was accompanied and today it led most of the American newspapers activities and world journalism. it may affect the prices of oil
yes one hundred percent and today any
today we are in the era of globilization and the affect comes rapidly
unreal factors may affect
and create some kind of turbulance in the market
also creating some kinds of political rumors
said that there is no plan but didn't deny the presence of other options that may apply to Iran
and markets always react to ambiguity
of course now there is nothing certain that America is in war with Iran
and i'm one of the people who doesn't see this scenario
and it maybe there we didn't see it what would happen in the future
but we, who work in the field of energy
we see that these political tensions
in the oil supplies in the world
and in the contrary there are very profitable supplies
this shows that there is oil goes for storage
and there is no shortage in the oil supplies at all
perhaps preparing for the next war
in the light of this insuring image that your speaking of about supllying and that there are no obsticles in supplying
in case the American president bush and the United Satates decided to change their plan
thats another thing
prices will rise to reach special records
oil price may reach
of world oil reserves
you are here,,today the Gulf represent the most important
in addition to Iraq, Iran and the other Gulf countries
today they represent more than 60% of oil reserves that's for what is certain is
you today
if a very small accident occur
therefore indicates
which means that in case of any war with Iran will mean that there is no guarantee to which extent oil prices will reach
God knows today it may reach, we have reached without
wars to one hundred and seven and one hundred and ten dollar and it may jump to one hundred and ten God knows
today oil like i told you it lives under political and psycological tensions
and speculators boarded these tensions
only invested in oil
or so-called not invested a real investment of course neither the future purchase nor the future marketing
and its called oil-paper
and all of them are speculations in oil-paper
its whole production is about three hundred thousands barrels or less
may lead these people to more purchases then to more upgrades
i wish that April will be the April fools
i hope there won't be
it is said that chiney is coming to the region and this is on his main agenda
chiney is the owner of this project as many politicians and media figures said
i didn't know what is in the bag of chiney
and i can't expect what would be in it, means
will he Ignites the war
America in a transitional stage
and why the son doesn't do something else
lets see what will happen, if the talk is about April, April is coming soon only few weeks and we will be in April
and the world may pay
and America is a huge consumer
in Gulf countries
Gulf will be the difficult number
you can't throw this number
their production cost is very cheap
in comparison with west Africa countries which most of them depend on
the Gulf, no other country in the world can
look we have heard this talk from the west and from the United States for many years
the use of
till the last of it and do you remember the Caspian's war story
whatever these dreams are
when you sit with westerns in a close circle
you hear them talk in a different way
what do they say
about supplies and the imporatnce of the region and the value of the reserves
when i asked one of the European officials i said: its weired that you talk between us in the closed rooms
not in the same way that you talk infront
or the media he said: its fir political reasons
and of course there is what so-called double standards or two languages
the language that knows that the Gulf countries
has a significance today such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar
the biggest producer and exporter of oil in the world
and to enter into it
despite all this
the leader of the middle region
start a war on iran
even with an air war or air strike as they say
in supplies
you are not late you are actually very generous
i disagree with what you are saying
we don't even deal with westerns
with America we deal
where the good prices are
regardless of this market nationality
put,, i mean non-renewable energy
for the sake of (between brakets) generosity
Arab generosity
go ahead and give it to me
observers say that the real price for oil
and the reason behind the rise of oil prices
you Gulf citizens and OPEC and countries
you are very generous with Americans you insist to hold on to their currency
you said that the price of oil should be seventy dollar
i said the actual price versus the dropping of the US dollar is sixty to seventy
ok now the price is one hundred
one hundred and nine because the dollar dropped by thirty percent
and now its above one hundred dollar
if we take the percentage and ratio
no one denies it
and one of the main reasons
in comparison with the drop of US dollar
if we take
this comparison
that oil prices
because the united states of America
of course it is in our benefit for the current time for the dollar to drop
weakness or recession in the american economy, the united states can't "do anything"
therefore what happened to this weakness and economical recession
you too aswell become
United states is reducing the benefits on dollar
why insisting on linking oil to dollar
lets talk about why linking the price of oil to dollar
the first who,,more than 100 years
the first one who started exporting the first barrel of oil was exported from the united states of america
and was exported in dollar
and it became since the twenty century till today
pricing oil in dollar
historically it became
and since one hundred years ago that the world is recating and pricing
and in which Norway is considered today the third oil producing country
and oil exporting
Russia is the second oil exporter
and production of north sea field in Europe
pricing in dollar and not in
everything is changing in the world, there are other sources and informations that indicates something other than this
that you Gulf countries
have secret agreements between you and Americans
and oil became the real cover
this is true and there is no
and these agreements
stands if oil stay the cover for the dollar in exchange for the united states to keep covering these regimes
this is not true and there are no secret agreements
today let's take OPEC
you have sixty six percent honarble deputy
out of thirteen countries
out of the eighty five barrels forty percent is for the OPEC
there are many huge countries in the oil production
outside the OPEC organization
what are the obsticles that prevent pricing with another currency
look for pricing with another currency
isn't it when the big people decide
you, saudi arabia and Gulf countries, hotshot s
today the OPEC share is like everyone
there is sixty percent
even if we assume that the OPEC wanted that
there is an agreement between all oil producing countries
there is a direction and an intention toward change
whart kind of attempt
but now these countries can't change the pricing currency
unless there is an agreement between
what is the impact of
let me talk now why European
do not export their oil
from the north sea or Russia or Norway in Euro or rupees
becauser its in their interst their currency is high and expensive
no in the contrary
here where they have loss
with one euro they export one barrel and a half
no its you who are loosing because your currency dropped since it is attached to the dollar
and he is also a big looser, a huge loss
currency association here in the Gulf has a historical bond
you remember when dollar was the most powerful currency in the world
and got linked now when you talk about Disengagement
its like marriage when we get married
and you want to divorce its not easy
no here
or you made a catholic marriage with the dollar
and costs must be examined in a way
exaimned in a professional way and examined
and so as Kuwait, it disassembled twenty five percent of its dollar currency
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, UAE and Qatar
may adjust the price of its currency
today about the subject but but this means that you dont have any intention to study the subject or think of it
the examination differs of course the excellency Prime Minister stated
stated that the Qatari currency is thirty percent less than its actual value
be in this study
there is no direction where you are the only ones going with this subject
Kuwait also went on her own why don't you follow its steps
economists say that its more profitable to the countries and their people than loss
but we
and not anything else
that these four Gulf countries anounce
everybod\y beleive
and i mean those who personally support it
it will support it
it must be included in the study
by itself
made what made out of one country or two
till the time of currency came
so you won't save the situation now
of course there are experts who will do this study
and they will be the ones who
not experts this needs a political decision
lets wait and not haste now look what is happening today
people started,,, i mean
of course in collusion position
excellency deputy, now inflation rate in Qatar in two thousand and seven has reached forteen percent and it will reach 15% in year
eating people's salaries, swallowing their saleries, saleries of working people here
salaries of Qatar residents eroded by thirty five to forty percent
we will return to you after the break to konw the size of raises that will be in the saleries
of employees in Qatar at least for upcoming period so stay whith us
welcome back "without borders" to this episode in which we are hosting the deputy prime minister, Qatari minister of energy
and industry Abdullah ben hamad Al-Attiyah about the huge increase of prices
in oil which returned with tens of millions of dollars to Gulf countries and producing countries
of oil and my question was about the upcoming raise in employees saleries but before this raise i would like to give you some important information
UAE ninty seven and eight out ten billion reserves and produce two and six out of ten
tons only and the report on Kuwait times is an economical report, the Gulf returns are one of the greatest
saudi arabia anticipated returns in two thousand and eight is one hundred and nine billion
and it was
one hundred and seventy last year UAE sixty six this year and it was anticipated to be seventy five
kuwait is sixty four and it was fifty four
Qatar twenty one from oil in addition to fifty five billion
from Gas as other reports said and by god no envy, i mean we dont envy excellency deputy
iraq is forty seven billion
one and a half trillion
in terms of spending it was one and a half trillion dollar
Gulf countries exported with one thousand billion means one trillion
dollar it was a variety of imports
the investment of the united states was three hundred billion
and nine out of ten billion
in Bahrain was three percent
in two thousand and seven in Oman was six and a half but it will increase to seven, in Qatar it was thirteen point seventy five but it will increase to fifteen percent in Qatar
it means that those who are living in Qatar will expect high cost of living, of goods and prices
life is being eaten up and prices are increasing and reaching high percentages and more in Qatar
we sympathize with everybody
then the solution must be
and the solution means that it aims to control the inflation
means that you will increase their saleries by 50%
no they will say that you are against raising saleries
that's not true
and in the council of ministers, against raising saleries
that there is a problem and the solution must be the perfect solution
and not a patching solution
ok there is a balance between the two
and there will,,,that's it
the important is to solve the inflation
and here in Qatar there is a committee
that his highness issued to form
and puts
and puts strong baisis
to solve the problemand control the inflation
what's important for now is to control the inflation
the inflation
if you don't control it
but excellency deputy, now
which specialized in market researches and was published in last february, days before
among them because of saleries for
now you are going to solve the inflation and let the inflation eat up those people's income
a lot of them now
incomes to other countries
raise our saleries then solve the inflation and decrease them again
i repeat what they are saying which is making balance in the topic
but now
and not with a temporarly solution
increase it in a bigger way
therefore here
in order to put an end to inflation
boredom will always
because the increase was enormous during last year, right
second point is
and those who work in private sector are not same as the ones who work in government sector
private sector is very neglected
so now this issue of increase must be viwed with fairness too
i don't know from where did you bring these observations
we are living in Qatar your excellency and not Germany
i'm telling you on the contrary today the private sector started to pay
that most
of Qataris who used to work in gevernment office moved to private sector
because of the high saleries
facing a problem
to move to private sector because private sector is more vital and dinamic
and gives good saleries
attached to what so-called the market force
or market power
they do not come with very high qualifications
they don't come to Qatar because Qatar has low saleries or low expenses
or with expenses they come
ok with our clear understanding
i do not anticipate events and i'm not saying that there will be a raise in saleries
there is no hope as well
to control the inflation
let's give it some time
on the inflation control
and by God's will this what said that the report, that Qatar in two thousand and eight
by God's will so we say that
we see that these numbers will change
sprinkle some of it on people
its a professional process
of course with professionalism and everything but
of inflation
because spending
so much on different projects
allow me to have some questions from viewers and i hope everybody will ask a direct question. Abdul Azizi Mohammed from morroco what's your question brother Abdul Aziz
its based on the ruling families in the Gulf
therefore i don't think that the justification for that is the disagreement of the OPEC
second the total oil income goes directly to the governor
then to the royal familly and the rest will be spend on development
in the absence of accountability the situation will remain the same
Peace, mercy and blessings of Allah
welcome brother Ahmad
i won't prolong the talk, the brother mentioned in terms of rulers regimes and the issue of Qatari riyal and dollar association or other Gulf currencies with the dollar but
America wants to globalize the world and make it pledge the legion to it
the american inability became, the trade between China and America reached eighty two billion dollar
along with it the European union with sixty eight billion dollar
this means that all trends in global poilcy is against the dollar
and we pay for its consequences now as Arab countries and Gulf oil states
will end in confrontation between america
and between the world developed countries such as China and Russia and else and the issue may become
pure millitary
for explosion china bombs russia bombs and japan and american bombs as well
thank you very much for this clarification and these informations
your Question Mohammad is
welcome, your question
can you lower the television's volume and ask your question
ok your question is
but from what i saw his excellency persist on not responding
subject of non-correlation with dollar because the dollar is falling
and by God's will it will reach the bottom
and he is a good man
he shouldn't follow Arab borthers style
thank you brother Mohammad thank you now we request the last intervention from Ahmad Hassan from Qatar your question Ahmed is
good evening to you too
thank you and thank you for the wonderful interview
what is the required, a raise in salary by God's will things will get better
it is true that we are all facing problems, not in saleries no
saleries by God's will things
ok tell me your question quickly
your line will be interrupted do you have a question
all because of high prices, the increase touched all the goods, all of it exported
from European countries
we have in the Arab world factories and laboratories
thank you Ahmed thank you you took your time
now the case of rising prices is an important case
the case of supporting the poor, the man told you stick with the poor your excellency
who doesn't have one billion here is considered poor
here for some brothers we are
who doesn't know Qatar
For the state of Qatar thats not true
today whoever come to Qatar can see the indicators
what are the growth indicators in Qatar and they are
the highest growth indicators in the world
this wealth where does it goand what do you do with it
What within the framework of a response
when the Marrocan talked he talked in a way that is not real nor reality
the person who doesnt see with his own eye
if he comes and sees Qatar and how many huge developments are taking place in it
as a significantly growth you are right, you are asking
and everybody has the right
and you are a small population so from where will you bring people
really does it mean you will bring the eccess from China for example
no we are not going to export we by God's will
the country is based on a plan and on
the perfect independency for the amount of mony coming from oil and gas and everybody know that oil and gas one day will end
that the state of Qatar will become
it is considered one of the best acheivements in the Arab world
today as well
the focus is on
and which will have a huge impact
on post oil and Gas
so you are not imitating Dubai
each countries has its own particularities
in the state of Qatar we focused on the education
on constituents
there will be a medical city in which people come to get cure
there will be a media city that will adapt
of course the world today, today we should build
build a vision
about post-oil and gas
there were fatal mistakes
and there was unfortunately, we didnt welcome this mutation because it tooks us by surprise
and we weren't ready for it not humanly nor technically nor even educationally
now its changed after thirty years
and better yet
today there is a vision
and vison
and vision
thank you excellency deputy and i also thank our audience
for following up with us hoping that we have provided you
Qatar foreign policy seems blurry for lots of observers
Qatar enjoys special connections
and at the same time that Qatar used to have connections with Israel and still do
of the islamic resistance movement "Hamas"
and Qatar provided
it started
the largest Arab country
which angered the regime in Egypt
to the extent of accusing Qatar of conspiracy against Egypt
also Qatar wasn't far from important files
such as Darfur, houtheins in Yemen and even the Isareli captive
Gilad shalit, the hand of the Qatari foreign policy was extented to it in away that irritated the largest Arab countries
and what kinf of power that puts it in such position
these acheivements
sheikh Hamad ben Jassim ben Jabr Al-thani
or write to us through our website www.Aljazeera.net
welcome your excellency
in september twenty two, two thousand and seven to the Saudi Arabia
it was a visit that differs in relation between the two countries at least in the past two years
re-drawing boundaries
wash what was stock
this what was mentioned
in Alhigaz newspaper or magazine
which was held with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and in which you gained back the connection and the Saudi anbassador returned
to Doha
first your introduction was very long and it needs a lot of answers without your last question
which i think you gave it
especially in the Saudi subject
what is accurate
the Saudi Arabian kingdom for Qatar is very important
between the two countries
you talked about the scilence of Aljazeera
you talked about a revolutionary movement
i think these things were clairfied from both sides
and we accepted the clarification
in the state of Qatar
conflict with Saudi Arabia
was always limited in the scope
of point of views
and thanks to God this was because of the two leaders' wisdom
king Abdullah and his highness prince
in the Gulf significantly
more than one hundred years ago
were bright, honorable and trust relations
i want to limited to misunderstanding between two parties
this issue was handled and there were no conditions
in solving any case
but there was understanding and there was an honest intention between parties
to solve this hanging subject
and its not seasonal but stratigical relation
we wish for it not to continue but to evolve
nice diplomatic talk
Saudi Arabia to withdraw it's ambassador from Qatar
i'm not used to talk diplomatically or i would have prevented a lot of problems
i always say what i beleive
saudi arabia therefore its not deplomacy but beleive
the subject of Aljazeera goes under media
between parties and lot of countries got involved in the middle
thinking that it may take points earn points at the expense of other countries
or at the expense of Qatar
or the expense of Saudi Arabia
to reconcile within the Gulf house
i mean in contrast to what was before
its among a political agreement
no no there wasn't an agreement only the agreement of love and interest
but other than that you can ask Aljazeera management
have you build strategic relations between you and saudi to prevent what happened before
it was originally based on a close strategy
can we say it in one two three and four
and there must be union
and some differences were settled based on this
between some Arab countries and try to reconcile other differences
because now if we observe the differences in the Arab world its all differences based on different point of views
when we have a point of view about a certain policy in a certain procedure in a certain case, and another country has a different opinion
its considered two point of views
some observers see that you enjoy criticizing Saudi Arabia
to crticize it
were you exhausted and decided to move to another directionand from there you moved to a bigger country which is Egypt
well its the same idea
no no we are neither enjoying this nor that we have nothing to do
to deal with any party in such method
i mean reasons of conflict with Saudi Arabia are over
between them and i know that there is a very big understanding
and you know that we established
and there will be a type of form
but the Saudi Arabia
let me put this under two lines
you started skirmishing with Egypt Alahram newspaper eighteen edition last april
the official Egyptien newspaper
in a thorough investigation it said that the extended investigations
in hizbollah network revealed a sabotage scheme
that targets Egypt three countries are involved which are Iran, Syria and Qatar
Hamas and muslim brotherhood
and a media horn known with his conspiratorial role
Qatar the smallest Arab country
plotting against Egypt
we respect
and its struggle over the years
i'm not saying it to emotionally affect anyone
let me finish i didnt finish yet
we appreciate
the Egyptian president
and who is careful
about the Arab relations
the first point
the case of Ghaza
like they say and like we admit
that Qatar is
a state of smaller size
that can be part of such schemes
because we suffered from other countries' interventions once upon a time and i dont want to go back to that
after the intervention of some countries in the Qatari Affairs
therefore the policy of the government of his highness
now when they discovered what they call a conspiracy
what im trying to say is that for the house the lord can protect it Syria and Iran can defend themselves im not going to defend them
if the stability in Egypt
and why would Qatar wants to change or interfere in such subject
and the pyramids doesn't come up with things out of thin air
it said that the mini-state of Qatar has sought to fail the role of Egypt and its connections with Turkey and European eunion
and you sought to set up a conference equivalent to the Arab summit in order steal the lights
and you are using a media horn which is Aljazeera channel
yes go ahead
with hizbollah
and we are not comfortable with it
but i can say that we are sure
that our
principle is not interfereing in such circumstances
forced our brothers in Egypt and for that we blame the Egyptian officials
the conflict that exist with some members of the Egyptian government
but some officials have issues with
with what
i'm coming to that
the days of the sweet smell of peace and the peace cause and that we
and previously held in Egypt
and later on with us
becasue Israel
we have a disagreement with it
you don't have disagreement with Idrael
and now and because of the conference and from that day
any islamic conference, Arabic conference they have allergy
this allergy
why not sitting with them
let me finish
and we always hope for the best
we discovered that this allergy
or three
Ghaza conference the one that took place
that Egypt doesn't want it to be held in Qatar
not Arabic
in Qatar and that there is a summit in Kuwait we told them
the palestinian people have been under attack
for more than two weeks
but we hold it before any arranged conference, the Kuwait conference where we were the first to attend
people are being killed and
and with procrastination
the dispute started
nor a mini-state could
i know that there are some of the brothers in the government and this is also considered an offense for Egypt and not anyone else
when they said that after
ok you in Aljazeera
and Israelis have reported a day earlier that there will be an assembly to stop the hostilities before any speech, anyone or anythings
what is it
my brother let the medicine and food gets in during the beating that our brothers had to put up with
once they say the gate was tight
can't let in the trucks
once they tell us that there is an agreement in the other side and they have to come
now its not the time that we want to bring Fath or Hamas
i don't care about neither Fath nor Hamas we cared about the million and a half million and six hundreds who are being beaten
and who don't have medicine
when we started talking about this subject and talking about Ghaza conference
and Qatar's intevention in the subject affects the Egyptian regime
it's not an intervention
we didn't say how Egypt will solve the situation because that's her jurisdiction
one of the officials said we discovered a major plot out of this
he didn't tell us yet what was the plot
that we are i mean this official
is telling us that Egypt is a big deal
ok we understand that Egypt is a large Arabic country and we always say Egypt is a big country
that's why we always ask from a big country many things
because Egypt to us
and you were invited to a conference where there was also a provocation to them
we weren't invited to a conference
reconstruction of Ghaza
and we have coordinated and we had a unified position
people are suffering in Ghaza
is prohibited, i know that Turkey entered things through Israel
i will be happy if i've seen it going in through our brothers in Egypt
they are part of us
and if Egypt won or made a good political work
we think that's it is in our benefit in Qatar and the benefit of the whole Arab world
Egypt's stability is very important to us
if it did a good work its important to us
let me complete your question and your introduction took quarter of an hour
the case is now you lost me but
no i will tell you i will tell you now the wrath
of officials in the Egyptian regime upon you
we are the ones behind the failure of Qatar summit
the second thing is they are the ones who failed Qatar conference
king Abdullah had a wisdom he wanted
and he wanted to make reconciliations
therefore he intervened and didn't let some countries to attend
and i have said this talk to our brothers in Saudi Arabia because we
don't have any disagreements with Saudi even in this point
because as shown there is an interanl problems
or someone from the officals
among big officials
a big state where an official finds that a small state is doing things like this
means there it was for you
to take any role
Darfour is a part of Egypt's national security and Sudan
the five large countries decided
that any country but Qatar will be ok
but these sensetivities will increase the situation why do you have to put your noise in everything close to you
we want to solve this allergy take an anti-allergic drug, they should tell us what is this allergy
why the sensetivities
that some brothers from the government
they want, they have an internal failure
they want to direct attention to a conspiracy in Ghaza a revolution
it's like what the English say blame the Itlaiens
whenever something happened
not only for Instructions but also analyses
wee know what happened because
the case should be solved locally
and not solved
no my priority is my country
my priority is to look first in the causes that concerns my country
then to look if i have enough time
and to look into causes that concerns my Arab nation
or Qatar tried to reconcile
and thinking about any Arabic cause where it can contribute as much as it can
why is it provocative why not take it in a good intention
i can't fix you
i can clarify my point of view
don't throw it on me
and from our point of view
which springed from his heart
let me finish
when he declared an initiative for reconciliation and all presidents were gathered in Kuwait we hoped for something good and i welcome with this
there aredictations
of course the Egyptian official who clarified his championships
in a report i think or a t.v interview or something i won't respond to it
because i have a response for every point
but in order to preserve the minimun of the relationships that binds us and links Arab interests
also it is a response to the call that was mentioned by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques
but what i can advice for him and for someone else is
and they try to fix their mistakes whether internally or externally
in politics or economics or else like we have our own mistakes in politics and economics thus there is no one is infallible
because they are accusing Qatar with all these charges
are you denying that there is a relationship between Qatar and Hizbollah
this is a funny subject
to distort Egypt's relations and undermine its role and its communications with Turkey and the European union
while first of all we are few numbers
if we can do this role
this is not true
there are some accusations to you personally
to pay money to detainees of Shalit so that Qatar will take Shalit and overbid the Egyptian role in this matter
they always accuse us of paying money, first we didn't pay money and we didn't talk to anyone about giving money
but this case
we support Egypt to solve same as we support Egypt and we still do to solve the issue between palestinians
that he is the one who let the palestinian president stay untill the case is resolved
we were there and the first to support the state of Qatar
in the authority and for the Palestinian institutions to remain until the dispute is resolved
and we said that
in the Arab league but he said no we made it happen because we beleive that some people dont want this
but we made it happen cleverly
is he addressing his president
his prime minister
i really don't know there is a problem
from us from them i don't know
they decided now in the twelve issue last April exclusively with Alshourouq newspaper
that the political leadership in Egypt decided to launch a satellite channel for news to face the media horn so called Aljazeera channel and end
its a matter of days and everything will end
are you afraid that Aljazeera will become something from the past
you mean now we live in a political teenagerhood
also you wavered to Saudi Arabia and the Emir of Qatar sat down with the Saudi king
we didn't compromise to them nor did they
we dealt with them as brothers
a small state compromise for the large state Egypt
no Saudi Arabia there is an important point we need to clarify
the relationship between Qatar and Saudi Arabia is different
and then we talk
ok how about the relationship between Qatar and Egypt
and we depend so much on it
let me be honest with you
or is it a dispute in the main policy
i hope that its not a personal dispute because we don't have any personal dispute i told you we respect the Egyptian people
if i asked from you, you said there are two problems Ghaza and what else
and this case have affected us all so much
we want to solve this from the psycological perspective means to resolve this dilemma
published in some newspapers
Minister of Foreign Affairs
in the presence of Emir Saoud Al-faisal
we talked about everything
but obviously things got worse and not resolved
no no there was listen
i can't tell you that our relation to Egypt
they reproach us and its their right as our brothers
and we reproach them its their right as our young brothers
with the big country we don't want to compare ourselves with any big country
i mean Egypt is big for satisfation
it's not the question of life or death but for the solution to come from the sky
for us if there is anyone waiting for satisfaction
or waiting for a method
in Qatar
you will deal with other than peerage or brotherhood
as a big country yes we are proud of Egypt as a large country
but if there is someone deluding someone
i know that Israeil is doing this with us
also the previous American policy in the previous management is with me or against me
so i don't think they want to imitate neither Israel nor America in this matter
also if we took their policies they are being pressed as well by third parties
in many cases let me finish
we understand and we know that there are some dictations even for a big country
what controls your policies
we don't have any movement what moves us is one thing
the internal interest of Qatar this is our internal affair
and whenever we can help the Arab world we will
what are the sources of power: Aljazeera and Al-odaid base
can you say that this is not power
our faith in Alllah and our confidence
or the vision of his higness Emir
we don't want to bother anyone
let me finish we don't want to make any problems to anyone
and we don't want to compete with anyone
they can say whatever they want the Great Qatar or else
but we have a point of view
first of all we fired the Israeli office we closed it
first they used to say close the office so we closed it they got upset and they went complaining to the Americans can you beleive these people
they joined the team so called the devil team
what they tell
the Americans and the Europeans and these are my friends and we know how to deal with them
the schemings
that were made
this is blemish we reached a certain point and then what
tell me now
in points how are you going to solve the problem with Egypt
and on the basis that Egypt has a big role in the Arab world
we think its important to look at it
and i'm sure that President Hosney Mubarak is circumspect about it
but some crew
need to leave
the occupation of the Egyptian public opinion or the governmental or else or nonsense leadership
and focus on the Arab and Egyptian intersts
are there any steps
we are behind them not infront of them becasue they are a great country
In the near future
honestly i can't imagine how it's going to happen
and i know that there is time for sense
and there will be a time either from us
if it was from me
or from them
great Arabic interests that pulled them together
one day we will find this matter
you mean life is still going far
meaning that we won't reply in the same Egyptian style that you have
if someone gave us a hand we will give him an arm
now your excellency sheikh
we were never used to run
unless on a good basis and we are ready to run for Egypt
to stand with Egypt
there are a lot of rumors about the Egyptien workers in Qatar and how they are affected because of this matter
and there are contracts for Egyptiens who work either in universities or major posts
you know that in this matter its not our habit to cancel jobs and cancel
because these people have nothing to do with this
this is a market that has change in demands they cancel one and they bring one
its a supply and demand and there are other nationalities that increased and some decreased
ok a quick answer
the office was there
we have disturbed the office so it is better to leave it now
we would have tinckled it in the days where they had a compaign, all our losses in the negotiations with Israel was because of this office
so we closed it let them fix it with Natanyahu
he was a guest
and he was among them and it's our habbit to invite all the accredited ambassadors in any foreign country
so it wasn't an official invitation to honor Gabriela Shalev
no we didn't honor her before when the relations ,as they say, were good we would honor her now its a little bit difficult
there is no reason now that push you to reopen the office in this period
the office will open again when there are no more reasons
you made it big
who made it as big as Egypt
Egypt emposed this
let me be clear with you, our relations with America is strategic relations
in some things and this is
what is the most important thing
there are things in our region in solving some cases we had disagreement with the previous management
now we have big hopes for the management especially with the steps that were made by president Obama
we think that there is a big hope that this management
is serious in moving the course of peace and serious in solving the Palestinian cause
they are our friends and we don't deny this
what is happening in Iran what could be its impact on the Gulf and on you
Iranians should decide how to solve their cases
among themselves
with their usual methods and i'm sure that they will get pass this crisis
Iran stability is like what Emir of Qatar have mentioned
is important to our region the Gulf region and we share the same borders with Iran
of course we have special relations with all our neighbours including Iran
becasue our country seeks peace and stability for this region
and we interfered whenever a party wants to change the Doha agreement
and i think Saad Al-Hariri said
now its over and what remains is the strategic talk between the president
and the lebanese groups
on how to see
for yemen there is no role for you or they just took a stand
listen it is known that we support unity when almost most of the Arab worl was against the unity of yemen
we are the only Arab country and the gulf country that stood with the unity of Yemen
and the south we have talked with yemen and his highness prince sent me twice to meet the Yemeni president
and i explained to him that our goal is yemen stability because yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula
and did not respect this agreement and i don't want to say what each party have done
but what really affected me
is that Qatar who took this stand and then accused to pay money for Houtheen and big yemeni officials
because we don't interfer in such affairs
and who stands with unity don't stand against it
and another goal for yemen's interest whether politically or economically or else
we don't mind it but i was honestly shocked
becasue i went more than ten times during the fight his highness sent me to yemen between yemenis
unfortunately this is a strange accusation
the time is over but tell me in short these problems that happened to you becasue of your quest to solve problems will they change your policies of intervening in other arab problems
if only his highness listen to me, i see that there is no need
and there was a big offer once
more than five billion dollar at that time if we invested it it would have been fifty billion dollar better than the headache
but i say it with a beleive because maybe the time in the Arab world now
is not allowed under these circumstances
thank you very much your excellency
maybe even extraordinary with the state of sheikh Hamad
for what happened to the agreement in doha
how did the miracle of doha happened
To mandate the Committee and give it all the support
to discuss lebanon after the Israeli invasion
when there was an arab consensus
and we went to new york we were capable of making the decision a little bit balanced
and we sought this in doha that both parties were anxious
we tried as best as we can not to hear it or there won't be
becasue we knew the committee we knew
the reality ground and we know what is the problem after we sat down with the lebanese for long hours
and i think its a common success
but there was determination
I think that lebanon's problem is that the region's atmosphere is reflected directly on it
whether peaceful or non-peaceful
lebanon was meant to have this location
with these conditions
and unfortunately
external repercussions
i can say that the problem between lebanese even if there is a problem it won't be the number one problem
ok State of Sheikh I know that maybe time is not now perhaps too early to talk about the scenes, but
what happened you came here
stopped sort of speak the engagement on the ground now
you were not late even for a second
i know exactly what was going on even the lebanese leaders were telling me what happened
no since the beginning
when i spoke to his highness
i told him if we go to lebanon
i will pose the idea his highness agreed and supported that
where all lebanese leaders be present
because here in Beirut you will have to go to each one's territory
while they are in the same hotel and same place
and they met in the same plane and talked
so we created this atmosphere but since the beginning our idea was
and this was the most important decision that both
of course
and i felt this from the arab league
then we should be honest intermediaries
and thank God i think this was proven to everyone that Qatar made an effort
on both parties
to reach an honorable solution for both parties
and that there will be a solution and no one loose
before you make any move
the consultation took place in the arab league and we founf aa support
of what we did
and i told him while we were there
that if we succeed in lebanon we will take them to Doha
and he recommended me
to lock them down and take away their cellphones
were able to bring them there and brothers in Syria also supported the situation
and i told you since the beginning that without the arab support the committee can do anything
why did they want the solution
i think the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that happened
and this tense
there is tension in Somal there is tension in Sudan
there are many things going on in the world
and everytime we extinguish a fire
it will be for the best interest of the arab world better than the outside interference
and we try our best
it sends forces
even if it was Militarily
for example i think this is a subject
there is a point to be discussed
he was always saying that the solution for the the lebanese file
a Saudi-Syrian agreement
to stop the arabs i mean Qatar and the arab league
Is what happened in Lebanon could lead to a serious reform between Saudi Arabia and Syria
need a self-review in the arab world
because the arab differences
and any agreement between two arab countries
and we tried this
in seventy three war
when arab agree to solve an issue
i think its an interest
Saudi and Syria have an important role in Lebanon
the two parties should
Conquer wisdom
the arab relations on the right track
because here in the arab world we are facing a lot of big challenges
everybody is playing in our court yard
and we don't have neither power nor might
and how can we stop the play in the yard of the arab countries
as arabs at least the minimum of the agreement
unfortunately we complain
while we watch
our disagreement as arabs and the lack of trust between us trust is missing between arab countries
and arab countries
not treasoning as much as it is a kind of
jealousy what's the word
this is a case that needs support from all i mean i think
ok are you going to make this wish come true and really ask for an arab summit
we suffer when it suffers and we rejoice when it rejoices
came in the middle of the talk
so is it possible to take a role to fix the situation between Damascus and riad even if
are eager to find solutions and i'm sure with their wisdom
they may reach an understanding
between them in many cases
and there was a harmony in politics and i'm sure that and with God's will this
that relations got better
needs both parties to make a step
but i can't be certain that this is what is happening now
i'm sure if arabs focused on solving the differences between arab countries and problems of some of the arab countries that i previously mentioned
optimism and a state of pride for the citizen that there is a general arab wake call
but i can't say that what happened in lebanon
can be interpreted on the ground there is an israeli palestinian escalation
there is perhaps an american iranian escalation maybe other cases
will you still be affraid of it during next months
we as arabs
we can't deliver food and medicince only
and electricity to people
we in Qatar are ready and his highness always
there are more than one million and a half palestinian who are under siege
and we don't want them to have neither weapons nor support
they are doing all this
and no electricity
and we give it to Red Cross organization to deliver it to palestinians
and with palestinians we just deliver them food and medicine
and our dispute with them can continue
and i wish that palestinians from both sides to put the national interest ahead
and leave behind the illusions
the Palestinian dissension now is a huge wound
to find a solution
but they didnt commit
this is a serious matter they must abide by Mecca agreement
and they must ask even to go again to Mecca and the kingdom of saudi arabia
and solve this disagreement
they will not benefit
and any promises from any party
wish that there will be a solution but
our position is known and mentioned to all concerned parties that we
won't be a part of it and we won't accept to be a part in any military dispute with iran
we have good relations with it
but we are a sovereign state and they are a sovereign state
everybody look for their best interest but these interests won't harm them or us
we believe that the fate of the Gulf has to be in a clear agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council
and iranon Cooperation and peaceful neighboring
but when your excellency say that Qatar is not a party
any details or clarifications
just a sign
no never
ok i want to return to the lebanese file if that's ok
honestly your excellency we are infront of a big blockage but we reached a solution in the last hours
there is who connected what happened to what was anounced
they might be scattered information that has nothing to do with each other but what happened
that made you reach this result
what happened in Istanbul i know if it had specific dates before
so you knew there were negotiations
Continuously to find a solution
and without doubt the kingdom support is very important
and change the tactics of the negotiations
these negotiations it led
to a positive result; we gathered some parties from some sides
and we started talking
there is an arab and Qatari approach in this paper
tell me what's wrong about this paper
and we started talking about substance one by one
At the last moment to overcome an obsticle that lasted till the end
but the prince met with the parties
and got rid of this obsticle
and there was a solution
we heard a word from the prince of Qatar in the opening session in Doha
you don't consider your role now
listen the most important thing is that we stay away from the lights
don't have any regional ambition
or even to have a control over another stateor something because our state
our size... we have pride in ourselves we think that we can contribute in solving issues with our other fellows
but in the arab world is very important
to have countries that are
we want them to do something and that's important
authorize some small countries to take this role and support them
in some things its excellent other things are good and some things are less than good
last question your excellency
What is the central priority
Is it a political priority
security or fix enmity
or confronting israel
we stop the play in the arab court
we fix what in the arab countries our problems
to pick an effective member in Iraq
to calm things
nationally and regionally
but if we became stubborn
or will have any hope
thank you your excellency Sheikh Hamad ben jasim ben Jaber Al thani for this meeting
And the international efforts to end what is going on from the war on Gaza
we Begin with your request for a meeting with the Arab League Council at a ministerial level
as if you changed your mind about
Requesting to hold an emergency Arab summit
In the name of God the Merciful and kind first I am happy brother Hassan to be in this program
Though the humanitarian conditions
Faced by our brothers in Gaza
contions that require us to do a lot
Qatar didnt diregard the Arab summit
as a matter of fact when we went with the idea of the Arab summit before
Not the decision of the Security Council but also through
are not stepped on nor underestimated
let me put it in another sentence
and we are being disciplined
that the street can no longer bare it, if we tolerated as officials of the Arab street
it won't tolerate it
when we were in Egypt
there was ten to eleven Written consent
some of them spoke in the meeting and it was possoble that we hold a meeting
that we hold it as far as there is Arab consensus
and i don't blame them if in a meeting they may have a point of view
and how can the problem be solved
because it will be solved
This is the important issue
Because our goal is not publicity and advertising our goal is to find
so you didn't diregard the summit
we even ask ourselves
we will go to put pressure on the other poor side
the former and the subsequent and the Security Council resolution, but let's only stay on the subject of the Arab Summit, the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
Spoke clearly that the situation may call for an Arab summit with whoever attends
we found the majority of our brothers support the holding of the summit
with whoever attends
and i don't know what do they mean by moderation
we are the only nation
only the arab nation if we go to any nation in Asia in latin America
with no solution
that were classified as moderated countries
and what is moderation in our eyes
will it give up the palestinian cause
just because we don't like them
do we interfere in the palestinians affairs in away
no nation allows the interference of either the good or the bad
such as hizbollah and who knows maybe another movement will show up tomorrow
is it asking
and can we accept them as a part of the Arab body
as if it was meant for us to get into an internal arab fight
ok if we go to the security council
there is no resolution in the security council
i hope that after israel finish its mission
ok the second arab ministerial meeting which you were invited to attend it
which was dominated by discussins and disagreements and severe altercations
there is an important point
this is not what matters
when we call for a meeting
about terminals
there is no more peace
are the ministers ready for that
because there is a party that tells you that we have to wait
but we are in an Arab initiative
and freeze the peace negotiations with israel
we say that we are in a party that says that we are going to loose in this
there is a bigger loss than the one we lost it now, but we were always respectful, polite and committed to the deciosions since the days of truce
you are saying that altercations are not important
there was someone who wished if Hamas could be destroyed and something like that
this expresses a political stand more than it expressed an altercation between one minister and another
unfortunately this happened
but not everybody
don't want to speak for others
it's important to be men of owr own and men of our state
we are doing the policies of our countries
who do these kind of things on its behalf
i think
i don't think they will respect us in the end
yes are there anyone who do things on behalf of the west
no and i hope i don't accuse anyone, i don't want to accuse anyone in this matter
after the decision of the security council
what will it be its agenda
the situation began with the decision of the arab efforts
and the disagreement is here if israel implement it the decision immediately
we can say there is a decision
but israel didn't implement the decision
are we ready now to go and ask for the seventh chapter i know for sure that there is difficulties
does not being question by the international community and if it did
it will be timidly
the situation
see that they did something for the jew and israeli
to take their rights
this is the current Arab situation
if arab didn't go to the security council
and agree to make a summit and take hard decisions
and western countries will try for us
because we are in the arab depth and there are so many people and you can see how the arab street is reacting to this
but this decision is important
with the issue of calling our presidents one by one
in the end they said that there was nothing and it's false
ok if we are now like germany or else are we going to demand
they don't have to pay for any compensations because they made the attack, just say that you have wrong informations
and killing hundred of thousands
that is because you are a weak arab party
we went as arabs some of us
worked hard in how
to present it
in a way as if it was fate and act of Gd
if the arab nation said if you will send forces to Darfur we will send forces to Darfur
arab considered or there are who considered the decision one thousand eight hundred and sixty
and our fellows worked hrad to put out the decision
that was issued by the security council
i don't want to say it was a victory or it wasn't
and what will lead to
let's presume that the victory
what we will do
it suppose that we don't compile with the rest of the decision
but i assure you we will compile with the decision
unfortunately you will compile with the decision even though you should not
even after the israeli rejection, israel came and agreed
it means we are
will you have an alternative or better yet you are the ones who call for a ministerial meeting
i don't think that the arab nation
in the meantime is ready for any alternatives
and i don't think the arab nation is ready
in the implementation of siege of Ghaza
for different political reasons
to make one group prevail another in Palestine instead of reconciling between them
we begin trying to make plans
once they made a gathering, i don't know arab european intelligence or something like it withought mentioning names
and once they did, , i mean we are participating
in the implementation of
What is required of us from the West
but if we go
i want that there will be sorting in this
of course i'm not talking about the decision i'm talking about
the follow ups because this issue of Ghaza started two years ago, not now
i will talk about the topic before two years but in the matter of the decision precisely
do you have precautions to its terms
issued nor implemented
we were not invited
maybe they think we have a different point of view
it was required that everybody have the same point of view
it is not necessary that everybody share the same point of view but i think those who went made an effort
and we thank them for that
concerning what is happening in ghaza two years ago and you said parties
prevaling one group over another who participated in the siege of Ghaza
you really agree with the sayings or hints or accusations that were released from here and there
about a real arab conspiracy with all what is going now in Ghaza
we are informed partially
from the issue let me tell you that we are not totally informed
but i know
that the palestinian dispute
was fueled on the arab and international level
and if it wasn't fueled they wouldn't differ that much
and it was after the elections
and hamas came and took the authority
by the majority
we should have gave them a chance and see
want reform or they are till now revolutionaries who only know the gun and the fighting
but the day they came
on the arab level some of our brothers thought that these radical movements should not come to authority
some of them are saying that now there was an assault
made by hamas that broke the truce or those palestinians from Ghaza who broke the truce
the truce
remains while the palestinian people in Ghaza starve for two years
that's ok
for reasons of israeli security
it's clear that we don't want them in authority but that doesn't concern me in Qatar
but what is the fault of the rest of the people
and then who should decide
that these or those, not every country have its supremacy to choose
our government
is the key problem
but i'm sure it could have been resolved
if only we worked hard, we worked hard to fuel up the dispute
but it is clear that we were requested to let one group prevail the other because this group
we consider it to be terrorists or we consider it
all what happened lead to
even the promises they made to the party that they will give them a suitable life
they didn't do anything for them
we go back to the international and Arab efforts made to put an end to what is going on, according to what you said you were
there is the decision of the security council that was regected by israel so far
and there is the egyptian initiative the one
and Egypt in Cairo
those egyptien efforts
not at all it's not a circumvent
that is requested for an important role
also egypt's borders are next to israel and palestine
that we
and that we won't to stop the chaos now
in Ghaza and we bring people to stop the chaos in Ghaza because
this is not the road to peace
there must be
And Therefore we always ask them a big role
what was anounced
does it mean that you Can not evaluate the initiative now
or to give the possibility of success or the study
i think the chances of its success
if the brothers in Egypt can
make the palestinian point of views more similar
and the one who should discuss the initiative is the injured party in Ghaza
because he is the one who can say yes or no
and this is an important poin
when the resolution one thousand eight hundred and sixty was issued
this is an arab palestinian problem that we have
that we don't want to hear any party
but i really wanted that, when the palestinian delgeation went
and when they went to the league they requested that someone from Ghaza to be with them
to show israelis that these are our brothers and we are with them
this is an important point
we don't let the authority
to be our goal and nor to build our policy
to stay in authority
sheikh now
i don't know if it's possible to discuss the egyptian initiative since you didn't go through its articles but
do you think according to principle this could be suitable as a mechanism to execute the international decision one thousand eight hundred and sixty as some people declared
a balanced role
now not tomorrow or after tomorrow because
every day passes
there will be bloodshed to our brothers there
therefore we don't want to postpone or the israelis postpone in this matter when they finish their mission we will pose this initiative
and i'm sure that the brothers in Egypt know this and circumspected about it
i want to clarify everything i said
that now we have to solve the issue
and not the way israel want it to be
attracted the turkish role since the beginning of the crisis
does it express
an arab void
and without doubt it is a remarkable position
and has an arab depth
it entrance to an arab disablement
we know that there is an arab disablement
part of it was because of the disputes
part of it because of point of view everyone thinks that his point of view is the perfect one
and someone else think his point of vew is better
and there is no conscience how can you let people respect and know that there is an arab resolution
or they will go after us one by one
another will say no it's ok we just give them two or three days more so that we call them and bring the fellows to be as equal and solve the issue
we have to rise above this and not accept that
hamas may have mistakes but we will deal with them
on the arab level
but for now
at least we tell them no
Within the framework of the required position of Qatar, positions such as, we will get back to this point later but
Also in the field at the same time you heard
yesterday khaled Misha'al chairman of the Political Bureau for hamas movement
first it is unnecessary all what brother khaled Misha'al said with all my respect and appreciation for him
why not sitting with khaled Misha'al and talk to him as arabs
we go to him in the arab league and tell him
that's an important talk
from Hamas
Imposing conditions israel also impose conditions
let them impose conditions are they not allowed to impose conditions while israel can
first what do you think about this arab gift
are cattle and we shouldn't listen to this populace one time they are telling me Degol didn't listen
differs completely, first of all Degol liberated his country
with or without allies he leberated his country from the firy occupation
now what we are talking about
is this arab gift we are supposed to
presidents should represent their people's opinions
the arab people in all those demonstrations that we have witnessed
that can be met from these rows that demands
also many of those who criticize Qatar in this situtation demand
about what is going on the representer and the office is still open
they don't speak the same logic
to cut off the relations we will go with all the arab countries
to cut off the relationship, all ties, even if someone is saying he has a treaty
they just want Qatar to sacrifice by itself
that we
and this is more important than the relationship
not only in this decision in this one and in more difficult decisions
than this decision
means we must have a united arab position
to others
that no one sell one for the other in order to have moral or material gains or called
yes before we close this file in this subject there are also countries that made individual steps
good chaviz is a different topic he has disagreements with the United States
our people don't need us to recall
five ambassdors with permanent membership and provide arguments these are movies
that we are done with and the street now knows better
with the high ceiling your excellency sheikh
or demand lebanon forces to confront the israeli agression and so on
do you think if it was framed within one arab frame it may work out
but we call for an arab position that will make people respect us
i don't think the arab countries are ready to fight
nor that we stimulate
how are going to bring syria, lebanon and the other countries and there are arab countries that don't speak to each other
there should be
a shift in the arab relations
This is the existing policy now among the Arab countries
still existing but i think it already expired
in goals
the important issue
and we know how it is the lebanese structure
there is no doubt that lebanon
gave an example if it returened its lands
the situation in ghaza will differ they are still
surrounded by all sides
this siege
give a different nature
yes i mean here the goals for israel means the process goals for israel
one day it hit someone one day it punishes someone and one day it satisfes someone
an example is what happened in lebanon for them it is not a good example
the solution sample that has become in lebanon
it consider it good
for ghaza
listen the problem in ghaza or palestine their solution is easier than the solution in lebanon
who differ with each other should we get back our land today or tomorrow
their disagreements are about power
on the distribution of power
and that differs because they are closer to each other intellectually
than the lenanese intellectual
therefore the solution is much easier
and here is the problem
your excellency sheikh
means we only have a couple of minutes if we wrapped up the issue to where it may
and deplomatic
How can this process end
of palestinians in Ghaza
let me tell you
or reject
and help
that didn't go along with us
it will be an arab failure
in terms of strategy
But on the Palestinian side
there were some efforts but we didn't see a complete initiative
not before not now why
the issue is not the issue of initiative as much as we feel
the one who will solve the issue we will help without saying the name of Qatar because some has issues with mentioning the name of Qatar
nor to bring a summit because there is a summit in march to be held
if we made an initiative we will be better than our brothers i don't think so
and not put pressures on them
because history won't have mercy for us if we pressed them
we are going through this initiative we saw all parties where there was a meeting on day four and was postponed because of the security council
we hope with God's will to make a progress and we wish that our arab brothers to help as much as they can in this issue
and we hope to push it away from competition
the arab competition
in heating it up because of their dispute with the sudanese government at one point
and these are our problems ok we fight among each others and we disagree
i don't want to go through this
in Kuwait in the nineteenth next month i believe of course the arab situation
as you know and as your excellency mentioned and explained
is the whole arab atmosphere help is it the first economical summit
His Highness
and of course any summit that is held in a fellow country we attend
and we don't mind to attend any summit
But not afraid to become a political summit
Of course, considering that the time impose itself
it is too late even if it meant after ten days
are you talking about palestinians after they get beaten for twenty five days
it will be
won't they say that arabs couldn't meet
we said that
we said that
with all my respect this summit was programmed and we are commited to it
i mean i think that we
the arab street against us
with our way that we are taken
and therefore
and get in peace
and say that's it it is guaranteed
for this meeting
thank you audience for watching
the coverage of the constant war on Ghaza continues goodbye
A few days ago there was a celebration of the International Day for People with Disabilities
Hissa Bent Khalifa Al-thani
in Doha and contributed in preparing a law draft specially
She was also a member of several local and Arab boards in the field of childhood
It also provided more than seventy-five lecture and worksheet, presentations and article published in the Arab and international magazines
At first, let's agree on the currently used term
To refer to people with disabilities should we say with special needs or like what I said with disabilities
first good evening
Taken from a human rights-oriented or human rights culture because people with disabilities
Because it dealt with people with disabilities considering them as people first
a human
And then resulted in his disability by trying to adapt to society
the medical concept was the dominant then
Moved toward the concept
the pedagogy and the special education appeared
This category became
therefore we started calling them people with special needs
which are the standard rules of which it was derived
The role of the Special Rapporteur on monitoring the application of this document
and accelerated the pace until the appearance of the International Convention, which was legally bound and characterized from the rules in this aspect
and Placed an essential condition or basic rule this term
that deals with these people that they are human beings that they are people
with the changing of terms as you have mentioned Is there a change in the perception of this group of community
yes and it is measured in a way
that is variable from region to region
but the special thing about this
that the arab world distinguished or differed
however the legal trends includes the human rights and it exist for example in Africa
in latin America but reasons probably lack of financial resources isn't it
of course, this is what i wanted to say that culture exist but there is a lack of resources sometimes lack of political will
sometimes legislations but
but unfortunately,awarness is a bit low also the human rights culture doesn't exist
ten percent of the world population are people with disabilities
eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities are from developed countries at the age of work
and suffer unemployment
i mean during my visit to Darfur
Or with the presence of mines and weapons
males are one dgree better
add disabilities they will be in remote areas and far away areas
therefore there are many directions of organizations that work in this field and trying to raise
Awareness and to achieve the right for education
rather than establish a lot of religious centers sort of speak
They went to establish rehabilitation centers and hospitals and schools
and this is one of the things that thank god through our work in the office
i tried with the current organization in Qatar
to develop an agenda
Or include the agendas of these humanitarian organizations so it include those centers
in the light of Decline in the situation of disabled people in the world
i can't call it and agree with you that there is a decline
if there was decline in the arab region because the case of disability
is Placed within social context within political and economic context, we can not expect the conditions of people with disabilities to be
while they are from marginalized groups
in acountry like i told you such as Ghaza and Darfur
On the contrary I can not make it in absolute that there is no improvement in the situation
and it was really implemented on the ground and if i can set an example i would say
the Qatari red Crescent
we agreed that projects include
people with disabilities with health issues among this strategy and there are other programs
that we tried to include as well
Within the work of existing organizations on the ground
kamal kirrow is with us now from syria welcome
good evening i'm Sliman kirrow
sliman kirrow pardon me go ahead sliman
My kind regards to you and Ms Hafsa
First Is there an intellectual obstruction within the laws of the United Nations
Intellectual obstruction means a healthy person was the result of what has become a pressure factor that lead to an intellectual obstruction
caused a disability for my son as a result of torture and imprisonment he got a mental disablement and till now he is under treatment and it has been six years now
i know there are about four hundred people between a child and disabled are in prison
is there a law in the united nations
as a matter of fact i
because they know as they know their children
and the whole meaning without making themselves
and there are values in the west
agreed upon but people
some of them are apostate or not following islam wisdom is not taken from them
thank you very much Nayef Saeed from Kuwait
we go back to our guest to comment on
on the calls solaiman was wondering if there was any intellectual disability
yes it is among the world rankings
for disabilities of course the mental and intellectual disability as it is called
is among these disabilities there are sensory disabilities in the sense of visual or auditorial mobility disabilities
of course as i mentioned disability is
action and reaction that occurs among a social context
in the arab world or any other provinces
for sure addressing disability took a long period
and even on the level of the united nation
me for example during my experience and work as a special rapporteur, of the things that I was trying to address them and work on them
In other words the right for all
till they provide them
and different Rehabilitative aspects to ensure that they can enter schools also the labor organization
Working on vocational rehabilitation, which includes people with disabilities
it had some improvements
Especially after the reform
In general are found in this international comission
me too I mean as Special Rapporteur
the truth of my work and this was positive for me if it was not directly linked
which supported this position
I've seen it in many of the meetings, for example the International Convention
for The Rights of people with Disabilities
obstructed by these restrictions or these deficiencies
For example regarding legal capacity
This is one of the main points in the world of disability
the United Nations unfortunately delayed it somewhat during the preparation and drafting
regarding organizations and agencies
For example, and I will end with this
of the world governments and non-governmental organizations state members of the united states
we addressed another questionnaire
in United Nations organizations and agencies of the various regions
to know to what extent there are programs for people with disabilities in their agendas
if it puts budgets if there is a participation for people with disabilities
Human rights
And not only issues of development
we receive more calls, with us now Mishri Naji from algeria welcome Naji
upon you too
i wanted to ask my sister who should be blamed for exactly
i wanted to ask i am originally Physically disabled
ok we will adress this question to her Naji mishri from Algeria thank you very much ahmed
alhalabi from Greece welcome
good evening my lady good evening to your guest
health care housing seasonal clothing even to take them in seasonal tourism and this is what is happening in Europe
and will the psychological patient count as a disabled
especially those who can harm themselves or others
all what we talk about is in the realm of the non-productive debate and thank you
sister Hissa mentioned the financial Insufficiency
in the poor countries especially in Africa and latin america and i demand
Establishment of an international fund to support disability and allocate one percent of the net profit of every organization in the world
And this should be mandatory and without exception to any institution or company
will counteract the inability of many disabled people and war victims and so on
thank you very much ibrahim abdullah from saudi arabia
naji mishri was wondering and have stated his problem that he is disabled
at the local level or national level which means through Algeria
needs within the community must be met within this community
Are the same rights that should come to any other person
In other words the right of living first and then the right to housing right to health and in education
therefore I really call from here from this podium the governments and the Arab governments in particular
For the benefit of the citizen and the individual
to guarantee
Those needs and rights within the existing agendas
No there is no need to create any new devices
To meet the needs of the the disabled person or no need for this if the state
can and they already have to be committed to perform
I advise him first to return and refer to the relevant authorities at the government level, if possible
Because within a national scale and must be within this range
theyou mentioned the International Convention for people with disabilities but there are a lot of States that signed but are not committed to it
and here we pose a question from one of the callers, why there are no laws?
it is a fact for sure that we are in a human society which means there are a lot of errors and many of the right
Sure many of the conventions and certainly many of the treaties have no literal commitment in it
Or an ideal commitment of many nations that joined to many such as cedaw and other
But there are breaches and violations, and we know that
But the question of adopting an agreement and to organize for it
First, we will ensure that at least there is awareness
This awareness starts from the top of this pyramid with decision-makers
Officials and then gradually grow until it reaches the community as a whole
Also the question of our commitment to prepare reports and these reports to be delieverd to the United Nations
The issue of knowledge and understanding and high degree of awareness
to the reports you worked as Rapporteur in the United Nations were
Yes, from what I saw and noted that there is interest
So there is a comparative advantage for the agreement for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
So I would advise, encourage and call
it is also important for the disabled people to be
And we will hear what will Ali Obaid Alsnari , head of the Qatar Society for the Deaf and the mute, tell us
Mr. Nagy Sgrna will be talking about it Welcome Mr. Nagy and Mr. Ali as well
peace be upon you
peace be upon you too
with Me, Mr. Ali Obaid Alsnara Chairman of the Board at the Qatari Cultural & Social Center for Deaf
and which is headed by HE Sheikha Hissa
the Special Rapporteur for People with Disabilities of the United Nations previously
as a deaf person from Qatar
And chairman as a matter of fact Sheikha Hissa had a long history
And the International Convention which you are talking about now is in the matter of fact
a great benefit to all people with special needs in all parts of the world
and especially the arab world
and i wish as a deaf person
that these countries apply this International Convention
That would serve people with special needs it is essential that
Really to have someone who can activate this Convention in all states
Obaid Alsnari, head of the Qatar Society for the Deaf and Mute
we stop
here and we continue our discussion after a short break stay with us
Send and share your views on important issues on economic, political and Sport and a variety of other things
sms service is through aljazeera live
Dear viewers, Welcome again to you and our guest for today's episode Sheikha Hissa Khalifa Al-Thani
Disability an international fund to support
Disability and be binding on all states to provide money what do you think of this proposal
United Nations has a fund called the Fund on Disability
And, unfortunately, those contributions are very weak
The task of monitoring the application of normative rules
When i worked for six years there was not any meaningful support
Only from China and Austria
and It is always i means I thank this state for its support
The main supporter of the country is my country, Qatar
which established the Office, through which we were able to implement many of the activities and projects Praise be to Allah
Yes, this lack of support indicates what
I mean like what we raised in the beginning and always this point raised
Conditions of ordinary people
So how is called the care of people with disabilities or care for the disabled
Means that if there was a realistic commitment , real and serious
in all conditions in all categories
The people with disabilities the refugee and the displaced child and woman
All of these we will actually may reach a degree so-called
Equal opportunities and participation and equality
and there are these voices that always demanding and never get bored or tired
In the Islamic and the Arab region why not allocate part, Sorry
For the benefit of these programs and projects
Such as what was offered by and i truly thank him from this podium
the Islamic Development Bank
from within the budget that was allocated
Failure to comply with what you told me about in paying Financial dues
Funds to help those with disabilities does it include only developing countries and Arab states or
Even developed countries do not provide
I mean, the the person who was before me who is the swedish Yes
also some countries of the european union
And sure there are many countries, especially in the Arab region wmaybe didn't
Even know about the existence of this Special Rapporteur
In my case I mean what happened
in Sweden and China
And the Arab region, unfortunately, there have been many promises, but unfortunately it was only one country
We will talk about the Arab region but
we have more calls with us Hamad Al Marri of Qatar Hamad welcome
peace be upon you
and upon you too
welcome doctor sheikha hissa
is almost ten
we noticed that this girl had a psycological disability
What is your role for girl who is suffering like her
With her colleagues
i mean sometimes even when we keep
What is your role for children of Qatari girls
Thank you very much Hamad Al Marri from Qatar karawan Bahjat from Kuwait Welcome
like what they say, Sheikha Hissa
why don't we leave our oil in its murky
those with special needs we can count them
and we can help them
that we have huge financial components
We can break the psychological barrier between us and them
by reviving the morale of the individual
and spend it on this noble goal
that is if we are trully believers
Thanks and appreciation to Sheikha Hissa for all her efforts and all what she have done during her mandate for the Special Rapporteur
With our thanks and appreciation to her and thanks for the State of Qatar for everything it did to those with special needs
thank you very much aisha mohamed from Qatar
peace be upon you professor wasila
peace upon you too
and to your kind guest
her highness sheikha hissa
My question is about prevention
As they say prevention is better than cure
There is another level of disability, regardless wars and traffic accidents
the genetic level maybe resulted from families which is the marriage of relatives
i think its a large percentage
that leads to disability
thank you very much hamil al-liwa shereef from tunis now i get back to our guest
first caller was hamad al marri he was wondering
where would a girl with disability a psycological disability go
and to who he should go
in every country
sure there are services that provide all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar
For these disabilities, whether mental disabilities such as what we said or any psychiatric disabilities
for schools
previously there was
or not i mean the Special education in the Ministry of Education, which is now the Supreme Council
hamil al-liwaa shareef from tunis pointed to something really important
and scientific papers and so on
from programs of organizations working on disability only, but even within the campaigns
Programs for women
All these drew many of the campaigns and programs to reproductive health
i Spoked about this aspect
is adopting healthy strategies
based on awareness
to show the risk of marriage with relatives
and genetic factors
i think it was implemented in the State of Qatar
habits and customs but it takes time for sure
Particularly at tribal communities
But with time there will be response to it but it is necessary to have a legal obligation in a sense
Yes karawan Bahjat questioned and suggested to allocate one percent of the Arab states budget
to help those with disabilities let me first
Yes, there is statistical estimation implemented by the World Health Organization on the world as a whole
there is fourty or near fourty million disabled people
half of them are women
but these numbers are multiplying
such as a study in South Africa where they have seen and proved
definitely the statistics that appeared from the war in Iraq and from the war in Gaza
that with every person killed comes three disabled people
and since the Arab region has become the region of undisputed conflicts
even the suggestion made by karawan bahjat
one percent won't be enough
to help people with disabilities in the arab region
The issue of percentages for people with disabilities or other marginalized groups
Honestly and sincerely i dont think it fits with
That require addressing their problems and needs
Confirmed that people with disabilities are the most neglected
conducted by the governments do not generally count the disabled
Correct and these are associated with the culture of the society and community restrictions sometimes
when census is being conducted by
relevant agencies
that there is a disabled person in the house
There was only one question being asked is whether there is a handicapped person or do not
section related to this subject and through the relevant people there
we cooperated in the preparation of Form
we recommended to have more details
Clarify first the gender of the disabled person whether male or female
and does he got help or not
in fact even if the numbers are correct we didnt reach a precise result
also the interest and care should be in progress, fatma al-dosari with us from Qatar welcome fatma
and peace upon you too
i am a Qatari citizen and i have a child with disabilty
and i thank his highness the ruler of our country, sheikh hamad
and his wife sheikha moza, for embracing this category
i'm really proud to receive all this care and attention
for her important role
lateefa Al-mseefri welcome
Because they represent major disruptions in the community without education, without treatment
thank you very much Lateefa Almseefri from Qatar with us now Naseem
Abdul kareem from Jordon welcome naseem
go on kareem we can hear you
peace be upon you too
God bless you, i frankly have an intervention
first thing, I am an Audio Specialist and i have worked in the State of Qatar for about four years
and we had a month of awarness for speech and hearing problem
we were doing conferences, lectures and awareness for the Hearing disabilty
now i want to talk about Jordon i lived there for almost three years now
honestlly it provides new and good services
Frankly it offers new services whether material terms or non material or moral
even the jordanian ministry of education, the resources
for the ministry of education in government schools
as well as our private institutes
they receive a good support
ok kareem do you have a direct question its only because of lack of time, i apologize
do you have a direct question
in the state of Qatar, UAE AND Jordon they are great services and i thing they are excellent
can you comment on the viwers questions
someone who work in this field
relating to the subject
i will also get back to the issue of the agreement
which obliges as soon as it gets ratifications and join it
As a duty on the State or on these organizations
Because it is based on the issue of rights to these people, regardless of
and honestly what
to do during that period for disabled people and why
and you wish now that it would happen
of course I hope whether
I hope that is measured on this research or this survey and provide more quality research in this area
Also it became clear to me from this experience
six years experience
and the coordination between the Arab states as well
they also have a role it is not a matter of rights only they receive rights
Sheikha Hissa ben Khalifa Al Thani, former Special Rapporteur of the United Nations on disability thank you
We have now the presenter from Aldawri and Alkass channel, Lana on line, Good Morning Lana
I'm also pleased to welcome the bright Captain in Um Selal, Captain Ali Kassim
Welcome Oh! Ali
Welcome %pw
Good Morning
I want to open the floor for congratulations, each one can congratualte openly, Lana, please
I had an open studio for five hours and a two hours one the day before
I've congratulated Qatar, the land, government,and citizens, they deserve that international achievement
I may have the opportunity to congratulate Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani
and his crown prince, Sheikh Tamim
Yes, of course Lana you are from the sport field and one of the experts in this field and the very knowledgeable of these lines and this field
Because even our file
and competetive, wich means we deserve the six votes difference between us and the US, fourteen votes for Qatar and eight for The US
that was because our file is rich, comprehensive and supported by many of the ambassador, very well supported, for example the stadiums
Maybe some peple were afraid, maybe there was some %pw, like The US
and there might be some countries that are ready, they don't need to provide stadiums, and prepare some projects specially that for this event
because they are already prepared
But they were worried about this point
Captain Ali, you as athletes, I think this is a very important achievement for athletes
will impact the eonomic, political and health sectors, I asume
But, you as athletes
what does that achievement mean to you?
Of course it's a huge achievement specially for us, even you saw how non-athletes were very happy
God wills, Ali, tel me about the moment of announcing the winning
I was going out from the training and we were listening to the radio station
We were waiting the announcement, me and one of my friends
while driving the car and listening to the radio
the moment they announced that Qatar and
We, both of us, yelled, and of course we had the roof window open
So my friend stuck his body out of the car roof
we were shouting, everybody were looking at us, we put the flashers on and started our celebration alone
We started the celebration from the begining
Thanks God, it was a very special day, I assusme, all the chanels foucused on that event to a great extent
Lana, of course you were involved in this event
specially the sport channels
How dis they celebrate this event and how was their reaction
many media and channels from all around the world were there
it became a key landmark, very evident on the map, Qatar became renown
Sure Ali, the player's presence in the team is a very important thing
and I assume it's a responsibility that shall be taken seriously
What do you think of that point oin particular
Alright Ali, do they state the characteristics required for being in the league
now there are more upcoming sport events
and we have to prepare a powerful generation
that has fundamental foundations and well planed football sport tactics
so, what are the rules and basis that a player must be characterized by
and I think professionality includes everything from
hard and persistent trainings and discipline
All of these are basic things that help devote all his efforts in the games or in the trainings
I think that each stage has a unique feature
it has a distinct feelings and taste
talk shows and sport programs, which one do you prefer, where do you find yourself?
It's great
it makes you keep your body fit and know how to maintain your health through sport, and that's the important part
also everybody watches football games, you will automaticly love it when you enter the field
does it confine the people working in media to one aspect
doesn't it limit you in one part
it's an open field, it's not only football
it's all sport but sport is great
Ali, also there are some other important issues we would love to talk about
didn't you wishe that you go back ten years in age so that you reach the two thousands and twenty two
si, didn't you wish that
Of course, one now dreams of this thing specially that it's the Word Cup, now any player
any one who just watches word cup game would be happy, what if he was playing in the word cup
I hope they meet the expectations and it's their chance
What do you want to say as a professional player, =captain Ali, what do you want to say to them from the bottom of your heart
we love to have you with us
As you just said, I'm currently on vacation, but
for its return to leagues after twelve years of absence from the Gulf Cup championship
You had a beautiful remark from Qatar TV and nice memories
God wills, Qatar TV is becoming like a University that graduates a large group of media people
Our league is brave and hopefully will win many different awads
Let's talk about an important point regarding Um Selal club
How is your situation there, how are you, hope you're doing well
Sure, thanks God, honestly
yesterday of course, in the studio, we talked about many players
So, I guess some youths who were watching us thinks that you are
is needed
it's a very usual thing in the Qatari league that players move to other clubs
I think I had a good chance in Um Selal, *as an offer*
I was able to get a place in the Asian cup with the team, thanks God
and my situation is very good with the team
How can we make of sports a social matter
and apart from Qatar, how can we make women, children and youths interested in sport
it connects everything, everything supplement sports
women plays a role in all sports fields
and expanding, each individual, whether young or adult in this society is aware of the importance of sport
nearly eleven or twelve years, until we reach this event, is sufficient
we have more new generations
the generation is growing up, but we have to set up a sport aware generation from an early age
We get Aspire, aspire is an effictive edifice
and essential for the new sport generation
we just have to be determinant and gp ahead
and football in particular
How can we attract the audience to interact in all the different match games betwen clubs
Frankly speaking the insufficiency of audience is an issue that we have in the Qatari league
but problem is attendance, Qatar Football Association still couldn't find a way to attract the audience
what is the method that we should use to attrack them to attend those football games
it depends on the person himself, some people doesn'tlike to attend at studium
Madia plays a fundemental role, by the way, in audience's abstention
and now they are using a ticket or points collecting here
No no, The Football Association has a plan and many steps to attract audience
Some clubs have methods to attract the audience such as Alrayan, Alrayan is a popular club, and dosn't need to attract the audience
Some clubs %pw, some clubs administration organise some activities and events
for the audience, to motivate them, I think those are the only ways
players, i mean the new generation
to love what they do and believe in their potential, and as you said, they not just need financial support, also moral support is much more needed
Thank you very much for this great interview, God wills
So, we would like to hear your final word on the winning of Qatar's hosting of two thosands and twenty two, Lana, please
I'de like to reconfirm that Qatar is always supportive, and
Hpefully, Captain Ali, your final word that you would like to say in this interview
Congratulations and I hope you on going success
Thank you captain and player Alim I hope you success in your sport progress and your life, may god bless you
and love sport more
The episode is going to be about young talents.
Some youth argues that these songs are popular nowadays; however it has a very deep and great history.
A group of young men who sings arabic word or english words,
Today we are going to talk about this with a group of amateurs of rap,
We will know them more through the interview which will brings us together with them live.
Welcome to our show our dear viewers wherever you were.
For years, there was a new genre of singing dominates the arabic and Khaliji arena,
Coming from the west particularly from the America which is Rap.
Before we start talking about Rap singing,
There is a boldness in using any word without any reservation.
Anyone can sing Rap.
For the lyrics writing,
Almost all the rappers write their words by themselves.
So, we will know all these many and crucial details through two who are entered strongly in this domain.
They did a nice band.
Yousef Alnuaimi and Salman Abdullah, good morning Yousef.
Welcome with us, good morning Salman.
Good mornign, hello.
I'm very happy to have you with us through this program,
And of course through the topic Rap singing.
Yousef, how did you get into this?
We find out that Rap didn't exist in Qatar.
In a better way.
By speaking for the citizen.
Including mirth, sad and the political topics.
Yes, I can say that Rap,
And these lyrics, I think it is on of the artist draw a painting and the poet writes a poem.
The singer can sing and the musician can play on any instrument.
Do you think that there is an acceptance by the Qatari society, by the Khaliji society for this type of lyrics?
Two thousand and ten.
Do you feel that people like to buy CDs of Rap songs?
A variety of ages,
There are families and so many people who are listening much more than before.
There was a something like a website.
How many of you on this band until now?
That means all of you can say words, write poetry and perform by the Rap style.
As you can say the one sings, the Rapper,
He is the one who plays sometimes, write the words,
Ah ok !
I ask to listen and I tell him I have recorded this song.
Alright, all these songs that you have produced from you Salman, from Yousef, from, from any person in the same band.
You didn't think about having it on a CD and available on markets,
But you know if someone is alone that means that I will do the album and put it in the market, so that's difficult a commercial registry, and procedures.
Alright, why you did not think? You are twenty five and always one hand cannot clap,
It should be two, you if God wills have twenty five hands may God protect you, all of you as youth and brothers.
You make a CD and this CD you can market it through more than a website in the internet.
You have Facebook, Youtube and also the local newspapers.
I think it has a thirteen songs.
The recording is not like now,
It's a little bit old, but it was clear.
It has a weak quality, not like now, but it is clear.
He did approximately fifty CDs.
There is Rap, I can't say that there wasn't because there might be some youth who know this art before ten years,
Not as strong as recording and I think distribution during this time, Now it's different.
Especially that there is a variety of music, a wide range of types of techno music now.
Those guys and those artists who produce a group of wonderful songs.
Also, we would like to talk about the concerts that you participated on it,
See, the party that we participated on it in Doha is one.
It was organized by Al-Sadd club and they were very collabrative.
we peeked to see the audience
we were surprised, we didn't expect that huge number
and we were also surprised that there are more families attending
more than the youth
the organizing was amazing
we were little nervous because it was happening for the first time in Doha
We didn't expect that much of attendance
audeince interaction was wonderful
and it took a long time, so there were too many songs
ok, let's listen to something, or lyrics that you composed, and the audience, specially the youths like them
let's hear some lyrics, to show the audience
Can we listen to it live
Take your time
Go ahead Salem
The problem is that it's random
Let's listen
I don't know
We're here is Sabah Eldoha program
one is plesant to come to the program in the morning
Salman is an expert, this is his fifth year of practicing Rap
Even if people don't like it
They have no idea about it
The words are random
Ok, the songs that you performed, give me some of your previous lyrics
see, not all the songs are random, or what they call in English, "Free style"
they are on the same rhythm
But when we sing, some words are chosen carefully
Thank you, let's see
We can say, Good morning my country, Good morning Eldoa program
We are live on TV, for the audience
to see what one one two one are going to present
together from Sabah Eldoha
The beautiful song that you just heared
I insisted that the guys distribute it everywhere and on the internet
I really appreciate it, when are you going to release it
a collective work
Every one compose, himself
he will not find it easy to perform
so each one write
Sure, I assume every artist whether pointer or poet, always
he can also write it for the love of sport
or country love
and I'm sure you participated in the National Day
through the beautiful songs, you repesent Qatari youth
is waiting for Doha to shine for recieving the Asian cup, and there will be a celebration in the cornish
to celebrate that event
we are transmiting this footage live
from the reception of the Asian Cup, Doha
from Doha Airport till now
let's see together these live shots
The reception, the audience, our children, students
The asian cup has arrived to Doha Airport this morning to continue
the preperations to host the huge continental event
Let's go back to our guests, Yusuf and Salman, that we're happy to have with us
They are from an Arab Khaliji rap band, am I right
can we call it this way
Currently, honestly, we
are preparing a party, but that's not sure
But, you're working on a party that will be announced, if God wills, Ysusef
If God wills, but that's not confirmed, we are still beginners
You are still in the begining of your career, I wish you the best of luck, and be sure that our program will support you by hearts
Also, Salman, where do you gather, all of you, twenty five person
where do you meet, and how do you put all the ideas together
sure there are some shared songs
it's not necessary that someone lije Salman or Yusef or anyone of you sing a complete song
There must be a collacollaboration between you all
Honestly, it's difficult to have the twenty five gather in one place
I start calling Yusef, and the other guys and ask them to gather in one place
to consider the song and the words
and there is another way
I record my part
and he continue
So he record and send it back to me
and see other experiences
collect some CDs for well known artists
do you benefit from their experience and techniques
Sure, we always
Artist who were doing that for years and have experience in the field
we listen to them, lear the teqniques and try to come up with a unique line
because if we do the same, same tone, wame wordings,
we are not producing something new, we want to do some thing that's
so we benifit a bit from them
Yes, there is also a big group of khaleeji youths, in the Gulf
in a primitive way, let's watch together the report to benefit and enjoy, let's watch it together
this talents that some people have is mysterious
using a very primitive tools
Abu Ibrahim Abdulla Aldayel
that is one hundered and fifty KM
from the Saudi capital, Alriyadh
has a good experience and ability
of discovering the lacations of the surface groundwater
of depth of more that one hundred meters
You know that well drilling is very expensive
locating the suitable place to drill the well, but with the expert, one can
discover, of locate
groundwater locations
Since ancient times
our parents and grandparents
used to seek help from experts to locate wells
to drill
Abu Ibrahim's techniques in searching for groundwater
are not modern techniques
or analysing in soil in laboratories
He rely in his work on God's grace
and it's underground streams
it's either pomegranate sticks
pomegranate branches or fig branches
now, the process of discovering water streams is applied scientifically
to close, this is the end of the stream
go back again
go back
so, from here, we start putting a sign
and here, the stream ends
needs a lot of experience and patience
to be able to know the sensitivity of too's movement
I went to many places
wich means ninety five persent of success
of course this way and using copper rods
and there is no accurate scientific explanation for
this method
what is really surprising is that the persentage of success of thoes who practive this primitive careeer
eceeds ninety five persent
in searching for surface groundwater reservoirs
Glory to God who taught the man the unknown, this report is from Saudi Arabia
who got their own band and more than one CD
whether on the internet or by phone
some times there are contests between Gulf countries such as Qatar vs Bahrain and Qatar vs Kuwait
They produce more powerful song of a stronger topic
adressing a problem, etc, there are a lot of issues
see as a role model for me
God wills
and in the same time we want to
to broadcast a wide range of songs
as much as possible
Once in a while, let us keep in touch with you
so that we know the latest news of the band
but let's emphasize on the name of the band
it's Rappers
Lets go back to our guests at the cornish and the beautiful atmosphere
We are on air with you through this live link
Wherever you are in the Conrish recieving the Asian Cup

This KJ Mrs Bobo with SKT one hot to body
We can say, Good morning my country, Good morning Eldoa program
We are live on TV, for the audience
Don't forget, the show is broadcasted at nine thirty, everyone must watch
to see what one one two one are going to present
together from Sabah Eldoha
Produced by Hassan Naama, Presented by Shaima Alhamadi
, the director is Nasser Almalki, and the guests are Qatar Rappers, of course
It can be repeatd again and used at home
such as a trolley or shopping cart
while shopping in the supermarket
when you put any commodity, or anything you want to buy in
a big screet will appear with the components of this commodity
That was also a brilliant and applicable idea
just a barcode, a scanner in the cart that detect the sommodity
and make shopping easy for the buyer
he can get all the details on the screen
I assume it raises health awarness
when the device is with you or in the trolley
the components
any warnings, and side effects
the details are complete
or ambition, for example there is a number of projects, about four or five
that deals with traffic issues
it deals with traffic jam and other issues such as parking issue and it was creative and very nice
God willing, the Cultural Centre for Children
Mr. Abdulla let's talk about the different activities that will take place in the coming days
Yes, and there is also surprises, but we'll disscuss it in brief
The ideas, donno if you want me to mention some of the projects presented or
for example, for the underground transportation, the briliant idea is
that once a man gets out of his home, he finds an elevator
and gather in one point
I assume all the viewers are enjoying the pictures viewed now
of children's creations
Exactly, this is for example is like a cash machine
for women, for example I have a card
I insert it, and say I need T-shirt
this is for example some shops, or If I have lost items t home, such as key
that is lost,for example office key
we have a fundemental goal that Her Highness Sheikha Moza has determined
His Higness's wife
at early age, and this is of a great importance in designing projects
for three hundered of selected children
we have also invited speakers and orators
Yes, she's the one who presented the closing ceremony
to present their programs, we really have to open the doors for children who are interested
and then they can start off
we need them to be there and support us, this is our priority
This programs and activities that serves that major idea
of different diverse children's skills
self development
fine, do you have any colaborations with youth clubs in Qatar
also there are scientific clubs in Qatar
of course, all of our programs are build on exchanging ideas
it's all a professional partnership
with other community service institutions specialized in improving such talents
a participation of all concerned foundations
photographu association,
creativity center for girls, and the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers also had a very significant role
Yes, they played an important role in explaining Qatar's vision
and training children for it
attracting, and encouraging the children, as each programs is based on Institutional partnerships
according to the major of the projects and institutions
and what does it change
being here in Katara gives us a powerful push and support
and faster
we are now, in participation with Katara, preparing for some projects that will be ready to be lunched in the next two months
of course, there is a colaboration in many of the programs
specially what's elated to reading
the Chairman of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
and we are running it, specially that we're in preperations stage
for building a promising future for all children, future generation and young people
What's your final word that you would like to say it for parents and children who are watching us now and are interested in joining the center
than what we offer them now
some times our children come up with ideas that we should not underestimate
we should consider their ideas whatever they are
because when we take it seriously, it will develop, at least we will encourage the child to think
so it's important to give child care and concern
and spiritually as well, our problem is that most fathers
,support him
and encourages him, so we encourage parents
to pay more attention to the imagination of the child, today's children are the roots of the future
we took a tour in the exibition and while seeing thier projects
we lived the dream
dreams and thoughts were of a broad imagination
and dreams become truem many of them achieved and become reality
thanks God, we wish our children who were there success
Our hearts with you
God wills
of different ages and nationalities
up to seventy projects
it's considered very pioneer and worth implementing
To talk more about this national exhibition
and the Cultural Center for Children also
Mister Abdulla, talk to us in brief about the exhibition
there has been a lot of activities, for sure, so what can you say about it
Children presented a new style of expressing patriotism and loyality to their country
It was under the patronage of the Minister of Education
in the tour at the exhibition
will grow up until twenty thirty
we started with training children on Qatar's vision of twenty thirty in all it's three themes
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, environmental development
First, to know Qatar's status in twenty thirty
Then, to start thinking of
creative ideas, and how to be innovative
I assume, they already have a broad thinking
but when we help him
I assume their mind will grow more and more
Mister, you launched the exhibition under the slogan of "Dreams of Generation, Facts or Tomorrow's Nation"
The slogan says dreams of generation
will be a part of Qatar's future, Qatar's tomorrow
we felt that when we were wandering with the children, when the child says to the Minister,
I want you to open my project, I invite you to visit my project for twenty thirty
a child that thinks ahead of twenty years to come
expressing their love for their countries in the field that they are interested in
there must be some activities, events and contests
one of them won the Stars of Science award
There were also the winners of the first prize of the League of Arab States
Sure, all children
on the sidelines, there were different shows in a certain schedule
for presenting the projects that they've done
There is a large presence, very unique presence
The Stars of Science
Some winners of the projects that paricipated in the exhibition
who won one of the main prizes
which is the innovative or creative forest or reserve
Also we want to talk about the colored ball
The colored ball is also one of the children's dream and vission of Qatar's future
it's an idea for twenty thirty
How can a child participate with a creative idea for twenty thirty
The main idea of it is that, there is a chip in the ball
it gives the referee a colored alert
for example te referee can watch movements of the ball
or the playground changes through this electronic chip
that is installed in the ball
There are creative ideas, of course it's the main idea, some people might ask
and projects
We always say, we reached this stage
of development of skills and broaden their horizons
giving them an idea of how to express patriotism through these projects
giving them confidence of how to present the project, deal with public and explain his idea
in a field that he love, related to something that he like, all of this is achievement
He offered support, we thank him for it
whch are now in the development stage
also the puplic, the committee and some people in charge supported the projects
the forst, no, it was the second, because this girl
pipes, channels for the attendence underground, and the method of viewers entery needs arrangments
a very huge reserve forest
where a visitor can wander in and see animals and reptiles
Also there is a sensor installed on some anmals to examine their state
there is also the marine environment, the entery method is also creative
also one of the reasons she won is the broad and detailed imagination
all this qualified her to win
there is also someone who talked about an underwater tourism city
, a butterflies city
a forest on the ground
and many tourism ideas
veey interesting
perhaps this is a need of their minds, in this time, perhaps in twenty thirty
and in the future, it will be achieved
Three projects
are adopted by the Scientific Club, they said these are the projects that we need to work on
There is a project that is, the unneeded water of the air conditions
Let's see Alarab news paper
The article says, Qatar University celebrates the graduation

He pointed that Khaled ibn Al-Waleed
Some historians relates the well-known poet Imru Al-Qais to the city of Marat.
So many things and information related to that city in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
For more information, we will watch with you this wonderful report by our colleague Abdulrahman Morshid.
Let's watch it together.
So for sure it's the testimony of people who does know about complimentary nor favoritism
and as an assertion of the history of this city or the other.
As much as we see from its antiquities and from what we hear about it from its storytellers and poets
Their classical and modern, therefore this comes as an important record added to the city's record
The city od Marat is one of the cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Historically, its an ancient town which was established in the Jahili age.
There was a controversy among the historians about how it was named?
Some of them believed that it was called after the well-known poet Imru Al-Qais Al-Kendi
And the brook which is called after it.
The date of its establishment is unknown.
In the Jahili age.
The most famous thing in the city of Marat is the mountain Komait in which some many proverbs were based on it.
Because its in the city and its close to it.
Al-jef. Those are historical places.
This sight is considered a tourist attraction in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Marat muinciplity have done a termendous effort on making
a park above this mountain
And sitting areas for the locals and for everyone in the kingdom.
It was called with this name after the prophet companion Khalid ibn Al-Waleed may Allah be pleased with him.
To fight the apostates and Musaylimah Al-Kathab.
And from its antiquities, Komait brook.
It's a place where water from streams gathers and preserved for a long time.
It was one of the most important sources for water in the past.
From its antiquities, also Al-Dowahi House for heritage.

By its beauty, its ruins and it's well-known mountain Koumait.

But this is of course effect works at the expense of other works, always.
There are people who only watch tv in Ramadan.
He stay up watching tv and people turns the worship months with the tv.
Lessen, lessen, lessen series, lessen, let them do one work every two year, is that better?
Of course.
I hope that they like me in Ramadan,
But I would like to extend you all my regards.
And hopefully,
And also with the plays.
From drama to fashion.
A fashion show was made in Katara the Cultural Village.
Of course, we are continuing with you a great love and honesty.
And develop the children potentials and skills more.
Differently than the various schools on this generous country.
We are having a model and we talked to our guest whom we had earlier.
Now we have Mr. Ibrahim Hussain Abdulsalam welcome with us and good morning.
How are you Oh! Omniyah?
I'm fine.
In which grade you are now?
Professor Ibrahim in the beginning, Can you introduces us to the course provided by the center?
And Omniya is an example of this.
We will also try with her the technique or the method which Mrs. Nesma talked about it
Do you feel that there is a differene in his mind?
Do you feel that this skills and methods,
Thing will change regarding his mental skills or even his educational level will change.
Scientific methods
Including testing the child in the beginning by an international test callled Tony test before starting anything in the program.
I start part two of also the Tony test
We can measure throught it the level or the change in the student level
Now a test will take place or something like a
Omniyah will count and answer immediately live.
Of course, Omniyah doesn't know anything about the questions.
We surprised them with this thing.
Of course I have other question as a start,
We would like to ask you about you participation in part II this year.
What is your participation, can you tell us about it?
Of course after we presented the series Tesaneef part I,
Thanks God, I was lucky with serveral roles.
Mr. Ghanim,
Distribute the roles with the excutive director Ashraf Shahatah along with Mr.
It's an opportunity from Tara for art production
For the youth.
Mr. Ghanim have nominated me this year for
Of course every episode is different.
I have in more than one episode which I will act different characters.
And on the contrary, this is a wonderful experience. In this work, we have
A pyramid from Kuwait's Pyramids, Mr. Saad Al-Faraj.
We have actors from Bahrain, Abdullah Malik, Ali Al-Ghurair.
Like Ali Mirza, we have
You also have a group of young actors like Abdullah Adham.
Yes, from the young actors, we have Abdullah Al-Asam.
This happened before a year and last year we worked two works per year.
May be this the reason why I've asked you before being on air. You are acting, since 1997,
But you couldn't achieve something, or your ambition on acting.
Thanks God for everything.
Have you studied acting or it was just?
No, I take it as a hobby.
I took acting as a talent. %PW The one who adopted me in my beginnings the actor Abdulaziz Jassim.
He is one of the actors who considers me as his son.
If I need anything, I call him.
We were in all his series.
We worked hard and thanks God.
Now, without Tara, a very special thanks to Mr. Andulrahman Al-Sulaiti, a very very special thanks to Mr. Abdulrahman.
If you will compare us to Kuwait. In Kuwait, there is a twelve to sixteen new actors came every year. Why?
They have.
Of course , thank you so much to it because it gives so many opportunites.
But, let's say,
Let us speak about the other series, we had an idea about Tesaneef,
We need to know about the Deadly Feeling.
And also the foot.
We have a sample, we have with us the therapist Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Mayoof Al-Tamimi.
So that this procedure happens on air
And we can see how we can treat the person. Let me first say good morning to Mr. Sobhi bin Hamza, you welcome.
You welcome, And peace be upon you.
So let's start with you sir, please.
If God's will.
With the name of God.
We hold the hand.
We see the nerves.
It's like a painting or a message from God may he be glorified and exalted that show all the organs in your body.
From the inside and it's problems.
You feel dizzy sometimes.
A pain in my head and dizziness.
Loosen your hand, loosen it. Let your nerves be relax, yes.
By doing this Mr. Abdulaziz, you will discover something in particular from his hand that he is suffering from a particular disease.
From his left side. His ears, he have a non-severe infection on his middle ear.
There is a pain ! What does that mean Mr. Abdulaziz.
The ear. Do you have a problem in the ear?
Since I was born and since I was a baby.
You also have pain here?
It's the paranasal sinuses!
You have a pain in the nose and a headache here?
I have headache here.
He have a problem with the paranasal sinuses.
It causes a headache between the eyes for him.
Weight is increasing without food.
His thyroid is not working properly, you feel lazy and idle all the time and you feel that your body is heavy.
I sleep a lot.
It's either oversleeping or laziness, you always feel heavy.
You always have an infection in your tonsils.
There is. Look at the shakiness, you notice the shakiness.
He is suffering from stress and you never walk barefoot, may be the last time.
You are from Tunisia?
Wow, you have mentioned things about him
This massage is also helpful for the kids?
The mother's thumb, glory be to God, is similar to the size of the palm of the babies hand.
Most of the kids doesn't sleep, why?
When you carry him, he doesn't like to be carried, but people think that he likes to be carried. He has a gases in his stomache, God bless you.
By the time the mother puts her thumb, by stretching the thumb
In the palm of the babies hand.
The hands are parallel and the child is parallel to her.
Let's watch it, so that every mother can learn this motion.
She will start pressing like this. Right and left, and right and left.
This thing is about the child, about, about, about the child and it's nice.
Alright, regarding the discoveries, you have a specific discoveries specially for women.
As we said that in every house there is a ninety percent of women, may God protect them.
The first thing, the first warning is from the ceramic and even grounds.
When we walk barefoot on the ceramic, it is ok to walk barefoot, but walking on an even ground that's dangerous.
Walk barefoot ! The evidence for this when they ceramic is used in the houses, health problems were increased.
Because its a cold and even.
When it was carpet, there were problems, they were suffering from asthma.
It has increased.
Woman should be keen on concentrating on walking barefoot on the malleolus.
This is the foot and the malleolus area which is at the back, the malleolus
From here, this is the foot and now below the malleolus.
This is the first discovery, the second discovery is the way of facilitating the delivery.
Just focus little bit with me.
In her seventh or ninth month.
Generally, just by being in the delivery month.
That means, they don't come in the eighth, the eighth is dangerous and the most dangerous thing is to walk barefoot.
The pregnant woman should be cautious about walking barefoot,
If she was in her due,
I seek refuge in Allah from the accused Satan, "And shake the trunk of the palm-tree towards you, and it will drop ripe dates by you".
We already know that Maryam peace be upon her, we know that her livelihood comes to her.
I've even discussed scholars and they have told me: Why you are changing Tafsir Ibn Kathir?
I told them, I'm giving you the idea which God put it in this science and he inspires me.
Shake the trunk of the palm-tree towards you, when she shakes the palm tree, how does it look?
It is sharp just like studs or spikes.
When she shakes the palm-tree, she gave order to the wombs which is the wombs area, here in the middle.
It is the viscera. It gives orders for facilitating the delivery and re-sitting the fetus.
The rise in the fetal head or reposition, so that it come naturally.
Glory be to God, this one of the benefits of this fruit.
and hold the hand and starts to relax it.
Some of the take as a practice and some of them knows that it's a science.
Therefore, they are afraid to tell you and you don't believe them.
Yes. Mr. Abdulaziz your discoveries are important.
But I would like to ask you a last question because time passed very quickly.
If someone would like to contact you, anyone would like to contact you, any specific email address or you are.
Alright, the mobile number is at the control room, if anyone would like to contact with Mr. Abdulaziz, he can call us after the program
Of course on Qatar Television numbers, so that he can contact us and take this number.
I was only created for serving people.
If we believe on this believe, God will bless your work and will led people
I have sins like other people and I do everything you can imagine, I'm a normal person.
However, we aspires to the goodness more than.
We always think about the good.
Our viewers, I hope that you enjoyed this segment about Reflexive Medicine and the massage through the hand.
And also through the foot.
We saw a live model on air, how he discovered the diseases that this person have,
And what he is suffering from. I hope that we benefit from you and if anyone would like to contact him, he can read about him through the internet.
The way it will be applied through whether in the upcoming days or next years or whether it will includes more schools.
Good morning
How do you rate this experience?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the most Merciful.
The fact that obesity in the Gulf countries have became a big problem.
So, we were afraid that Qatar becomes the fifth country along with them.
This program to be honest, it happened that he first lady in New York
Visited Doha and they have a program for this.
They have offer it us, we adopt it and we said it's ok.
Our students along with New York , Spain and England students,
Therefore, we can notice the level of our our students in Qatar among the world and this is something we want it in the future.
Because we encourage students to eat fruits.
And he stops playing sport.
Of course, the fifth week is your family meal with your family.
We kill two birds with one stone (Idiom).
In the sixth week, he tells us what he gained from this experience, thanks God we are at the closing today.
We are happy with te students.
You know they were three independent schools, for boys Abo Obaydah,
Independent for girls Roqayah,
And in a high spirit.
The family is more aware and their brothers were excitied at home and they started to eat this food just like them.
It became a transitive culture between the student and he transfer this culture to home and to his family.
He go and tell them, they gave me this or they taught me this.
The training staff or the one who gave these information to students,
How did you choose it and how connection was made with the student? Who did the connection?
Yes, there were many authorities that helped us, may God rewards them.
We have the brothers at Diet center who educate them about the food the healthy food of course.
And they learned with Mrs. Aisha Al-Tamimi the the the eating etiquette.
How they arrange themselves, how they arrange their priorities !
To learn about cooking, sport, or educate about the value of the healthy food.
It was in the form of separate lessons, curriculum, or
How these ideas delivered to the students?
In a various ways, some of it are inside the school,
We organized a day in the beginning of the program at Aspire Zone, we gathered all the students boys and girls.
This things is not something related to someone spesific, but we are all incharge, incharge, because those are our children.
Those students how they deal with in the beginning!
You have said in the beginning that the results were satisfactory,
Is it enough to have three classes or specific classes at those schools
Now, when an experiment in the world starts, it doesn't starts on a wide range.
It starts at a reasonable range that has all the characteristics; boys, girls, independent, and private.
Since it is not suitable in our culture, environment and the family conditions like they accept things for their kids and they don't accept things.
They basically want to participate on it and to be honest it is very important.
The twelve or thirteen years old student, this is the right time for him to know about his health.
This is a suffering for so many people who wants to people slim, but he imagines that this is impossible.
Some of the actors we saw at the cinema with slim figures, he says this is impossible, no!
We talked in details, but there were so many weeks which we couldn't cover.
And through Sabah ElDoha we can remind them of it.
And the fruits with vitamin B which you can take it from the fruits and vegetables.
So the person should know the benefits of the fruits and he should know that it he eats it his health will improve, so he will be in high spirit.
In terms of the fruits, they went to the supermarket and pick their fruit.
So, that's a point.
It's a diversity and of course they compete, every school was creative with it's different ideas of it's teachers.
The spirit of competition.
We give them guidelines and everyone should innovate.
The teachers trained the students, or you have a special staff?
We trained them, we trained them.
But the the teachers were adding, for example, some schools like Abo Obaydah said that they will make saturday for students activities.
This is a day outside the school hours, they decide and adopt it, Roqayah school said that they will make procession.
They said that they will do a health cooking day for girls, but we didn't force boys to do healthy cooking by themselves, girls were more skillful on this.
Also, I would like to thank Al-Rayyan water which provided all the water free for schools, Al-Rayyan water for this matter.
Of course, water is much more healthy because he needs to clean his body from all this toxic materials that enters his body daily through water.
We said the third week.
Which means that his his body is moving.
He might be playing football or basketball and he doesn't know that this is the game that I love.
Correct, correct, exactly and some of them maybe want other game, may be he don't like a group games.
Welcome with us live.
Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Jaber, the founder and the director of the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Society, welcome with us.
In which we of course try as much as we can to focus on the important topics
We would like to introduce and to introduce our dear viewers about what is Multiple Sclersios disease?
Because also this name might be awkward to us,
The number of women had this more than man.
All the availabe treatments now are preventive treatments.
The white blood cells which supposed to protect us starts to
It kills us by hitting the nerve cell.
Let me make it easier to the audience, it is like a wire
Covered with a layer that is called the Mellin, let say it's the nylon layer
Of course it generally lead to dizziness and dual in vision, duality of vision.
It also lead to problems in digestion system, respiratory system.
It leads to madness on it's worse conditions, it leads to tetraplediga or paralediga.
Of course treatments.
The the most important functions in the body will be damage so badly.
Or from this disease a disease which called multiple sclerosis.
Some theories say that it transmitted through a virus.
That the disease is a non-epidemic disease.
It doesn't transmit to children
Some people consider it as a disease depending on the region.
The equator, for instance, was excluded from this disease.
Currently, we have some cases with this disease on the equator.
This disease until now has now cure because it has an unknown cause.
Until now scientists are unable to find the cause of the disease, so that they can find a cure for it.
Currently the process now is reversed.
They try to avoid the impact of the disease it self on the human body.
In other words, they start to work from the back.
We might be little bit afraid from this topic in which we can say that this disease comes suddenly.
Is there is a specific group, group that you feel that this disease spread in in in a specific group?
Internationally, it was classified between twenty to fourty
Currently the international society for the disease it self reduced the number from twenty to fifteen.
Because it started to get the young people until the age of fourty.
However, the human being doesn't heal from the it.
Of course as a society, we are open to alternative medicine and prophetic medicine.
Yes, so through the society, Multiple Sclerosis Society Qatar
Why do we have this society?
There was a large group, so you thought about having a society for this topic.
Of course, I'll give you some random numbers.
In Kuwait, It says that there is sixteen thousand case.
Thousand case.
The rest of the Gulf countries ranges between a hundred to a three hundred.
When I was diagnosed before five to six years,
My number was sixty for or fourty six.
Is there are any symptoms that shows that the patient is already suffering from this disease !
We are not sure that it's a virus, that's why we don't want to adopt a certin theory, this is a point.
They other point is how can I know that I'm having it or not.
This is so difficult.
I'm confused Oh! Mr. Abdulaziz in try to find out a specific point
