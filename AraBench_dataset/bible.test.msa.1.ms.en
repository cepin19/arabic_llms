 Who Is the Most Important Person in the Kingdom?   
 At that time the disciples came to Jesus. They asked him, "Who is the most important person in the kingdom of heaven?"   
 Jesus called a little child over to him. He had the child stand among them.  
 Jesus said, "What I'm about to tell you is true. You need to change and become like little children. If you don't, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.  
 Anyone who becomes as free of pride as this child is the most important in the kingdom of heaven.   
 "Anyone who welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me.   
 "But what if someone leads one of these little ones who believe in me to sin? If he does, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and be drowned at the bottom of the sea.   
 "How terrible it will be for the world because of the things that lead people to sin! Things like that must come. But how terrible for those who cause them!   
 "If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It would be better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with only one hand or one foot than to go into hell with two hands and two feet. In hell the fire burns forever.  
 If your eye causes you to sin, poke it out and throw it away. It would be better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The Story of the Lost Sheep   
 "See that you don't look down on one of these little ones. Here is what I tell you. Their angels in heaven can go at any time to see my Father who is in heaven.   
<.>
 "What do you think? Suppose a man owns 100 sheep and one of them wanders away. Won't he leave the 99 sheep on the hills? Won't he go and look for the one that wandered off?  
 What I'm about to tell you is true. If he finds that sheep, he is happier about the one than about the 99 that didn't wander off.  
 It is the same with your Father in heaven. He does not want any of these little ones to be lost. When Someone Sins Against You   
 "If your brother sins against you, go to him. Tell him what he did wrong. Keep it between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won him back.   
 "But what if he won't listen to you? Then take one or two others with you. Scripture says, 'Every matter must be proved by the words of two or three witnesses.' (Deuteronomy 19:15)  
 But what if he also refuses to listen to the witnesses? Then tell it to the church. And what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Then don't treat him as your brother. Treat him as you would treat an ungodly person or a tax collector.   
 "What I'm about to tell you is true. What you lock on earth will be locked in heaven. What you unlock on earth will be unlocked in heaven.   
 "Again, here is what I tell you. Suppose two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for. My Father in heaven will do it for you.  
 Where two or three people meet together in my name, I am there with them." The Servant Who Had No Mercy   
 Peter came to Jesus. He asked, "Lord, how many times should I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"   
 Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but 77 times.   
 "The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to collect all the money his servants owed him.  
 As the king began to do it, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought to him.  
 The man was not able to pay. So his master gave an order. The man, his wife, his children, and all he owned had to be sold to pay back what he owed.   
 "The servant fell on his knees in front of him. 'Give me time,' he begged. 'I'll pay everything back.'   
 "His master felt sorry for him. He forgave him what he owed and let him go.   
 "But then that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He grabbed him and began to choke him. 'Pay back what you owe me!' he said.   
 "The other servant fell on his knees. 'Give me time,' he begged him. 'I'll pay you back.'   
 "But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and had the man thrown into prison. The man would be held there until he could pay back what he owed.  
 The other servants saw what had happened. It troubled them greatly. They went and told their master everything that had happened.   
 "Then the master called the first servant in. 'You evil servant,' he said. 'I forgave all that you owed me because you begged me to.  
 Shouldn't you have had mercy on the other servant just as I had mercy on you?'  
 In anger his master turned him over to the jailers. He would be punished until he paid back everything he owed.   
 "This is how my Father in heaven will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart." 
 Jesus Teaches About Divorce   
 When Jesus finished saying these things, he left Galilee. He went into the area of Judea on the other side of the Jordan River.  
 Large crowds followed him. He healed them there.   
 Some Pharisees came to put him to the test. They asked, "Does the Law allow a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?"   
 Jesus replied, "Haven't you read that in the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female'? (Genesis 1:27)  
 He said, 'That's why a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife. The two will become one.' (Genesis 2:24)  
 They are no longer two, but one. So a man must not separate what God has joined together."   
 They asked, "Then why did Moses command that a man can give his wife a letter of divorce and send her away?"   
 Jesus replied, "Moses let you divorce your wives because you were stubborn. But it was not this way from the beginning.  
 Here is what I tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife and gets married to another woman commits adultery. A man may divorce his wife only if she has not been faithful to him."   
 The disciples said to him, "If that's the way it is between a husband and wife, it is better not to get married."   
 Jesus replied, "Not everyone can accept the idea of staying single. Only those who have been helped to live without getting married can accept it.  
 Some men are not able to have children because they were born that way. Some have been made that way by other people. Others have made themselves that way in order to serve the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept living that way should do it." Little Children Are Brought to Jesus   
 Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to place his hands on the children and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.   
 Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Don't keep them away. The kingdom of heaven belongs to people like them."  
 Jesus placed his hands on them. Then he went on from there. Jesus and the Rich Young Man   
 A man came up to Jesus. He asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to receive eternal life?"   
 "Why do you ask me about what is good?" Jesus replied. "There is only One who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, obey the commandments."   
 "Which ones?" the man asked.  Jesus said, " 'Do not commit murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not give false witness.  
 Honor your father and mother.' (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) And 'love your neighbor as you love yourself.' " (Leviticus 19:18)   
 "I have obeyed all those commandments," the young man said. "What else do I need to do?"   
 Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go and sell everything you have. Give the money to those who are poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."   
 When the young man heard this, he went away sad. He was very rich.   
 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "What I'm about to tell you is true. It is hard for rich people to enter the kingdom of heaven.  
 Again I tell you, it is hard for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. But it is even harder for the rich to enter God's kingdom."   
 When the disciples heard this, they were really amazed. They asked, "Then who can be saved?"   
 Jesus looked at them and said, "With man, that is impossible. But with God, all things are possible."   
 Peter answered him, "We have left everything to follow you! What reward will be given to us?"   
 "What I'm about to tell you is true," Jesus said to them. "When all things are made new, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then you who have followed me will also sit on 12 thrones. You will judge the 12 tribes of Israel.  
 Everyone who has left houses or families or fields because of me will receive 100 times as much. They will also receive eternal life.  
 But many who are first will be last. And many who are last will be first. 
 The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard   
 "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who owned land. He went out early in the morning to hire people to work in his vineyard.  
 He agreed to give them the usual pay for a day's work. Then he sent them into his vineyard.   
 "About nine o'clock in the morning he went out again. He saw others standing in the market place doing nothing.  
 He told them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard. I'll pay you what is right.'  
 So they went.  "He went out again about noon and at three o'clock and did the same thing.  
 About five o'clock he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, 'Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?'   
 " 'Because no one has hired us,' they answered.  "He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'   
 "When evening came, the owner of the vineyard spoke to the person who was in charge of the workers. He said, 'Call the workers and give them their pay. Begin with the last ones I hired. Then go on to the first ones.'   
 "The workers who were hired about five o'clock came. Each received the usual day's pay.  
 So when those who were hired first came, they expected to receive more. But each of them also received the usual day's pay.   
 "When they received it, they began to complain about the owner.  
 'These people who were hired last worked only one hour,' they said. 'You have paid them the same as us. We have done most of the work and have been in the hot sun all day.'   
 "The owner answered one of them. 'Friend,' he said, 'I'm being fair to you. Didn't you agree to work for the usual day's pay?  
 Take your money and go. I want to give the ones I hired last the same pay I gave you.  
 Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel cheated because I gave so freely to the others?'   
 "So those who are last will be first. And those who are first will be last." Jesus Again Tells About His Coming Death   
 Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the 12 disciples to one side to talk to them.   
 "We are going up to Jerusalem," he said. "The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will sentence him to death.  
 Then they will turn him over to people who are not Jews. The people will make fun of him and whip him. They will nail him to a cross. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A Mother Asks a Favor of Jesus   
 The mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus. Her sons came with her. Getting on her knees, she asked a favor of him.   
 "What do you want?" Jesus asked.  She said, "Promise me that one of my two sons may sit at your right hand in your kingdom. Promise that the other one may sit at your left hand."   
 "You don't know what you're asking for," Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the cup of suffering I am going to drink?"  "We can," they answered.   
 Jesus said to them, "You will certainly drink from my cup. But it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or left hand. These places belong to those my Father has prepared them for."   
 The other ten disciples heard about this. They became angry at the two brothers.   
 Jesus called them together. He said, "You know about the rulers of the nations. They hold power over their people. Their high officials order them around.  
 Don't be like that. Instead, anyone who wants to be important among you must be your servant.  
 And anyone who wants to be first must be your slave.   
 "Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served. Instead, he came to serve others. He came to give his life as the price for setting many people free." Two Blind Men Receive Their Sight   
 Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho. A large crowd followed him.  
 Two blind men were sitting by the side of the road. They heard that Jesus was going by. So they shouted, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"   
 The crowd commanded them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"   
 Jesus stopped and called out to them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.   
 "Lord," they answered, "we want to be able to see."   
 Jesus felt deep concern for them. He touched their eyes. Right away they could see. And they followed him. 
 Jesus Enters Jerusalem   
 As they all approached Jerusalem, they came to Bethphage. It was on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent out two disciples.  
 He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. As soon as you get there, you will find a donkey tied up. Her colt will be with her. Untie them and bring them to me.  
 If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them. The owner will send them right away."   
 This took place so that what was spoken through the prophet would come true. It says,   
 "Say to the city of Zion,  'See, your king comes to you.  He is gentle and riding on a donkey.  He is riding on a donkey's colt.' " (Zechariah 9:9)   
 The disciples went and did what Jesus told them to do.  
 They brought the donkey and the colt. They placed their coats on them. Then Jesus sat on the coats.  
 A very large crowd spread their coats on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.  
 Some of the people went ahead of him, and some followed. They all shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest heaven!"   
 When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up. The people asked, "Who is this?"   
 The crowds answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus Clears Out the Temple   
 Jesus entered the temple area. He began chasing out all those who were buying and selling there. He turned over the tables of the people who were exchanging money. He also turned over the benches of those who were selling doves.  
 He said to them, "It is written that the Lord said, 'My house will be called a house where people can pray.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you are making it a 'den for robbers.' " (Jeremiah 7:11)   
 Blind people and those who were disabled came to Jesus at the temple. There he healed them.  
 The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did. They also saw the children in the temple area shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all of this, they became angry.   
 "Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him.  "Yes," replied Jesus. "Haven't you ever read about it in Scripture? It says, " 'You have made sure that children and infants  praise you.' " (Psalm 8:2)   
 Then Jesus left the people and went out of the city to Bethany. He spent the night there. The Fig Tree Dries Up   
 Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.  
 He saw a fig tree by the road. He went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" Right away the tree dried up.   
 When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?" they asked.   
 Jesus replied, "What I'm about to tell you is true. You must have faith and not doubt. Then you can do what was done to the fig tree. And you can say to this mountain, 'Go and throw yourself into the sea.' It will be done.  
 If you believe, you will receive what you ask for when you pray." The Authority of Jesus Is Questioned   
 Jesus entered the temple courtyard. While he was teaching there, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "Who gave you this authority?"   
 Jesus replied, "I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.  
 Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven? Or did it come from men?"  They talked to each other about it. They said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'  
 But what if we say, 'From men'? We are afraid of the people. Everyone believes that John was a prophet."   
 So they answered Jesus, "We don't know."  Jesus said, "Then I won't tell you by what authority I am doing these things either. The Story of the Two Sons   
 "What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.'   
 " 'I will not,' the son answered. But later he changed his mind and went.   
 "Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing. The son answered, 'I will, sir.' But he did not go.   
 "Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?"  "The first," they answered.  Jesus said to them, "What I'm about to tell you is true. Tax collectors and prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God ahead of you.  
 John came to show you the right way to live. And you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. You saw this. But even then you did not turn away from your sins and believe him. The Story of the Renters   
 "Listen to another story. A man who owned some land planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it. He dug a pit for a winepress in it. He also built a lookout tower. He rented the vineyard out to some farmers. Then he went away on a journey.  
 When harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the renters. He told the servants to collect his share of the fruit.   
 "But the renters grabbed his servants. They beat one of them. They killed another. They threw stones at the third to kill him.  
 Then the man sent other servants to the renters. He sent more than he did the first time. The renters treated them the same way.   
 "Last of all, he sent his son to them. 'They will respect my son,' he said.   
 "But the renters saw the son coming. They said to each other, 'This is the one who will receive all the owner's property someday. Come, let's kill him. Then everything will be ours.'  
 So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard. Then they killed him.   
 "When the owner of the vineyard comes back, what will he do to those renters?"   
 "He will destroy those evil people," they replied. "Then he will rent the vineyard out to other renters. They will give him his share of the crop at harvest time."   
 Jesus said to them, "Haven't you ever read what the Scriptures say, " 'The stone the builders didn't accept  has become the most important stone of all.  The Lord has done it.  It is wonderful in our eyes'? (Psalm 118:22,23)   
 "So here is what I tell you. The kingdom of God will be taken away from you. It will be given to people who will produce its fruit.  
 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces. But the stone will crush anyone it falls on."   
 The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' stories. They knew he was talking about them.  
 So they looked for a way to arrest him. But they were afraid of the crowd. The people believed that Jesus was a prophet. 
 The Story of the Wedding Dinner   
 Jesus told them more stories. He said,  
 "Here is what the kingdom of heaven is like. A king prepared a wedding dinner for his son.  
 He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the dinner. The servants told them to come. But they refused.   
 "Then he sent some more servants. He said, 'Tell those who were invited that I have prepared my dinner. I have killed my oxen and my fattest cattle. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding dinner.'   
 "But the people paid no attention. One went away to his field. Another went away to his business.  
 The rest grabbed his servants. They treated them badly and then killed them.   
 "The king became very angry. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those murderers and burned their city.   
 "Then the king said to his servants, 'The wedding dinner is ready. But those I invited were not fit to come.  
 Go to the street corners. Invite to the dinner anyone you can find.'  
 So the servants went out into the streets. They gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad. Soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.   
 "The king came in to see the guests. He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.  
 'Friend,' he asked, 'how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man couldn't think of anything to say.   
 "Then the king told his servants, 'Tie up his hands and feet. Throw him outside into the darkness. Out there people will sob and grind their teeth.'   
 "Many are invited, but few are chosen." Is It Right to Pay Taxes to Caesar?   
 The Pharisees went out. They made plans to trap Jesus with his own words.  
 They sent their followers to him. They sent the Herodians with them.  "Teacher," they said, "we know you are a man of honor. You teach the way of God truthfully. You don't let others tell you what to do or say. You don't care how important they are.  
 Tell us then, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"   
 But Jesus knew their evil plans. He said, "You pretenders! Why are you trying to trap me?  
 Show me the coin people use for paying the tax."  They brought him a silver coin.   
 He asked them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words?"   
 "Caesar's," they replied.  Then he said to them, "Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar. And give to God what belongs to God."   
 When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away. Marriage When the Dead Rise   
 That same day the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people rise from the dead.   
 "Teacher," they said, "here is what Moses told us. If a man dies without having children, his brother must get married to the widow. He must have children to carry on his brother's name.  
 There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.  
 The same thing happened to the second and third brothers. It happened right on down to the seventh brother.  
 Finally, the woman died.  
 Now then, when the dead rise, whose wife will she be? All seven of them were married to her."   
 Jesus replied, "You are mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures. And you do not know the power of God.  
 When the dead rise, they won't get married. And their parents won't give them to be married. They will be like the angels in heaven.   
 "What about the dead rising? Haven't you read what God said to you?  
 He said, 'I am the God of Abraham. I am the God of Isaac. And I am the God of Jacob.' (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead. He is the God of the living."   
 When the crowds heard this, they were amazed by what he taught. The Most Important Commandment   
 The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees weren't able to answer Jesus. So the Pharisees got together.  
 One of them was an authority on the law. So he tested Jesus with a question.  
 "Teacher," he asked, "which is the most important commandment in the Law?"   
 Jesus replied, " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Love him with all your mind.' (Deuteronomy 6:5)  
 This is the first and most important commandment.  
 And the second is like it. 'Love your neighbor as you love yourself.' (Leviticus 19:18)  
 Everything that is written in the Law and the Prophets is based on these two commandments." Whose Son Is the Christ?   
 The Pharisees were gathered together. Jesus asked them,  
 "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?"  "The son of David," they replied.   
 He said to them, "Then why does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,   
 " 'The Lord said to my Lord,  "Sit at my right hand  until I put your enemies  under your control." ' (Psalm 110:1)  
 So if David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be David's son?"   
 No one could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions. 
 Jesus Judges the Pharisees and the Teachers of the Law   
 Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.  
 "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat," he said.  
 "So you must obey them. Do everything they tell you. But don't do what they do. They don't practice what they preach.  
 They tie up heavy loads and put them on other people's shoulders. But they themselves aren't willing to lift a finger to move them.   
 "Everything they do is done for others to see. On their foreheads and arms they wear little boxes that hold Scripture verses. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the tassels on their coats very long.   
 "They love to sit down in the place of honor at dinners. They also love to have the most important seats in the synagogues.  
 They love to be greeted in the market places. They love it when people call them 'Rabbi.'   
 "But you shouldn't be called 'Rabbi.' You have only one Master, and you are all brothers.  
 Do not call anyone on earth 'father.' You have one Father, and he is in heaven.  
 You shouldn't be called 'teacher.' You have one Teacher, and he is the Christ.  
 The most important person among you will be your servant.  
 Anyone who lifts himself up will be brought down. And anyone who is brought down will be lifted up.   
 "How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You pretenders! You shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves do not enter. And you will not let those enter who are trying to.   
<.>
 "How terrible for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You pretenders! You travel everywhere to win one person to your faith. Then you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are.   
 "How terrible for you, blind guides! You say, 'If anyone takes an oath in the name of the temple, it means nothing. But anyone who takes an oath in the name of the gold of the temple must keep the oath.'  
 You are blind and foolish! Which is more important? Is it the gold? Or is it the temple that makes the gold holy?   
 "You also say, 'If anyone takes an oath in the name of the altar, it means nothing. But anyone who takes an oath in the name of the gift on it must keep the oath.'  
 You blind men! Which is more important? Is it the gift? Or is it the altar that makes the gift holy?   
 "So anyone who takes an oath in the name of the altar takes an oath in the name of it and of everything on it.  
 And anyone who takes an oath in the name of the temple takes an oath in the name of it and of the One who lives in it.  
 And anyone who takes an oath in the name of heaven takes an oath in the name of God's throne and of the One who sits on it.   
 "How terrible for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You pretenders! You give God a tenth of your spices, like mint, dill and cummin. But you have not practiced the more important things of the law, like fairness, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the last things without failing to do the first.  
 You blind guides! You remove the smallest insect from your food. But you swallow a whole camel!   
 "How terrible for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You pretenders! You clean the outside of the cup and dish. But on the inside you are full of greed. You only want to satisfy yourselves.  
 Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish. Then the outside will also be clean.   
 "How terrible for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You pretenders! You are like tombs that are painted white. They look beautiful on the outside. But on the inside they are full of the bones of the dead. They are also full of other things that are not pure and clean.  
 It is the same with you. On the outside you seem to be doing what is right. But on the inside you are full of what is wrong. You pretend to be what you are not.   
 "How terrible for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You pretenders! You build tombs for the prophets. You decorate the graves of the godly.  
 And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of those who lived before us, we wouldn't have done what they did. We wouldn't have helped to kill the prophets.'  
 So you give witness against yourselves. You admit that you are the children of those who murdered the prophets.  
 So finish the sins that those who lived before you started!   
 "You nest of poisonous snakes! How will you escape from being sentenced to hell?  
 So I am sending you prophets, wise men, and teachers. You will kill some of them. You will nail some to a cross. Others you will whip in your synagogues. You will chase them from town to town.   
 "So you will pay for all the godly people's blood spilled on earth. I mean from the blood of godly Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Berekiah. Zechariah was the one you murdered between the temple and the altar.  
 What I'm about to tell you is true. All this will happen to those who are now living.   
 "Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and throw stones in order to kill those who are sent to you. Many times I have wanted to gather your people together. I have wanted to be like a hen who gathers her chicks under her wings. But you would not let me!  
 Look, your house is left empty.  
 I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.' " (Psalm 118:26) 
 Signs of the End   
 Jesus left the temple. He was walking away when his disciples came up to him. They wanted to call his attention to the temple buildings.   
 "Do you see all these things?" Jesus asked. "What I'm about to tell you is true. Not one stone here will be left on top of another. Every stone will be thrown down."   
 Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There the disciples came to him in private. "Tell us," they said. "When will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? What will be the sign of the end?"   
 Jesus answered, "Keep watch! Be careful that no one fools you.  
 Many will come in my name. They will claim, 'I am the Christ!' They will fool many people.   
 "You will hear about wars. You will also hear people talking about future wars. Don't be alarmed. Those things must happen. But the end still isn't here.  
 Nation will fight against nation. Kingdom will fight against kingdom. People will go hungry. There will be earthquakes in many places.  
 All these are the beginning of birth pains.   
 "Then people will hand you over to be treated badly and killed. All nations will hate you because of me.  
 At that time, many will turn away from their faith. They will hate each other. They will hand each other over to their enemies.  
 Many false prophets will appear. They will fool many people.  
 Because evil will grow, most people's love will grow cold.  
 But the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.  
 This good news of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world. It will be a witness to all nations. Then the end will come.   
 "The prophet Daniel spoke about 'the hated thing that destroys.' (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) Someday you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader should understand this.  
 Then those who are in Judea should escape to the mountains.  
 No one on the roof should go down into his house to take anything out.  
 No one in the field should go back to get his coat.  
 How awful it will be in those days for pregnant women! How awful for nursing mothers!  
 Pray that you will not have to escape in winter or on the Sabbath day.  
 There will be terrible suffering in those days. It will be worse than any other from the beginning of the world until now. And there will never be anything like it again.  
 If the time had not been cut short, no one would live. But because of God's chosen people, it will be shortened.   
 "At that time someone may say to you, 'Look! Here is the Christ!' Or, 'There he is!' Do not believe it.  
 False Christs and false prophets will appear. They will do great signs and miracles. They will try to fool God's chosen people if possible.  
 See, I have told you ahead of time.   
 "So if anyone tells you, 'He is far out in the desert,' do not go out there. Or if anyone says, 'He is deep inside the house,' do not believe it.  
 Lightning that comes from the east can be seen in the west. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.  
 The vultures will gather wherever there is a dead body.   
 "Right after the terrible suffering of those days, " 'The sun will be darkened.  The moon will not shine.  The stars will fall from the sky.  The heavenly bodies will be shaken.' (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)   
 "At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the nations on earth will be sad. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky. He will come with power and great glory.  
 He will send his angels with a loud trumpet call. They will gather his chosen people from all four directions. They will bring them from one end of the heavens to the other.   
 "Learn a lesson from the fig tree. As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.  
 In the same way, when you see all those things happening, you know that the end is near. It is right at the door.  
 What I'm about to tell you is true. The people living at that time will certainly not pass away until all those things have happened.  
 Heaven and earth will pass away. But my words will never pass away. The Day and Hour Are Not Known   
 "No one knows about that day or hour. Not even the angels in heaven know. The Son does not know. Only the Father knows.   
 "Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.   
 "In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were getting married. They were giving their daughters to be married. They did all those things right up to the day Noah entered the ark.  
 They knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be when the Son of Man comes.   
 "Two men will be in the field. One will be taken and the other left.  
 Two women will be grinding with a hand mill. One will be taken and the other left.   
 "So keep watch. You do not know on what day your Lord will come.  
 You must understand something. Suppose the owner of the house knew what time of night the robber was coming. Then he would have kept watch. He would not have let his house be broken into.  
 So you also must be ready. The Son of Man will come at an hour when you don't expect him.   
 "Suppose a master puts one of his servants in charge of the other servants in his house. The servant's job is to give them their food at the right time. The master wants a faithful and wise servant for this.  
 It will be good for the servant if the master finds him doing his job when the master returns.  
 What I'm about to tell you is true. The master will put that servant in charge of everything he owns.   
 "But suppose that servant is evil. Suppose he says to himself, 'My master is staying away a long time.'  
 Suppose he begins to beat the other servants. And suppose he eats and drinks with those who drink too much.  
 The master of that servant will come back on a day the servant doesn't expect him. He will return at an hour the servant does not know.  
 Then the master will cut him to pieces. He will send him to the place where pretenders go. There people will sob and grind their teeth. 
 The Story of Ten Bridesmaids   
 "Here is what the kingdom of heaven will be like at that time. Ten bridesmaids took their lamps and went out to meet the groom.  
 Five of them were foolish. Five were wise.  
 The foolish ones took their lamps but didn't take any olive oil with them.  
 The wise ones took oil in jars along with their lamps.  
 The groom did not come for a long time. So the bridesmaids all grew tired and fell asleep.   
 "At midnight someone cried out, 'Here's the groom! Come out to meet him!'   
 "Then all the bridesmaids woke up and got their lamps ready.  
 The foolish ones said to the wise ones, 'Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are going out.'   
 " 'No,' they replied. 'There may not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves.'   
 "So they went to buy the oil. But while they were on their way, the groom arrived. The bridesmaids who were ready went in with him to the wedding dinner. Then the door was shut.   
 "Later, the other bridesmaids also came. 'Sir! Sir!' they said. 'Open the door for us!'   
 "But he replied, 'What I'm about to tell you is true. I don't know you.'   
 "So keep watch. You do not know the day or the hour that the groom will come. The Story of Three Servants   
 "Again, here is what the kingdom of heaven will be like. A man was going on a journey. He sent for his servants and put them in charge of his property.  
 He gave $10,000 to one. He gave $4,000 to another. And he gave $2,000 to the third. The man gave each servant the amount of money he knew the servant could take care of. Then he went on his journey.   
 "The servant who had received the $10,000 went at once and put his money to work. He earned $10,000 more.  
 The one with the $4,000 earned $4,000 more.  
 But the man who had received $2,000 went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money in it.   
 "After a long time the master of those servants returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.  
 The man who had received $10,000 brought the other $10,000. 'Master,' he said, 'you trusted me with $10,000. See, I have earned $10,000 more.'   
 "His master replied, 'You have done well, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things. I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'   
 "The man with $4,000 also came. 'Master,' he said, 'you trusted me with $4,000. See, I have earned $4,000 more.'   
 "His master replied, 'You have done well, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things. I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'   
 "Then the man who had received $2,000 came. 'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man. You harvest where you have not planted. You gather crops where you have not scattered seed.  
 So I was afraid. I went out and hid your $2,000 in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.'   
 "His master replied, 'You evil, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not planted? You knew that I gather crops where I have not scattered seed?  
 Well then, you should have put my money in the bank. When I returned, I would have received it back with interest.'   
 "Then his master commanded the other servants, 'Take the $2,000 from him. Give it to the one who has $20,000.  
 Everyone who has will be given more. He will have more than enough. And what about anyone who doesn't have? Even what he has will be taken away from him.  
 Throw that worthless servant outside. There in the darkness, people will sob and grind their teeth.' The Sheep and the Goats   
 "The Son of Man will come in all his glory. All the angels will come with him. Then he will sit on his throne in the glory of heaven.  
 All the nations will be gathered in front of him. He will separate the people into two groups. He will be like a shepherd who separates the sheep from the goats.  
 He will put the sheep to his right and the goats to his left.   
 "Then the King will speak to those on his right. He will say, 'My Father has blessed you. Come and take what is yours. It is the kingdom prepared for you since the world was created.  
 I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in.  
 I needed clothes. And you gave them to me. I was sick. And you took care of me. I was in prison. And you came to visit me.'   
 "Then the people who have done what is right will answer him. 'Lord,' they will ask, 'when did we see you hungry and feed you? When did we see you thirsty and give you something to drink?  
 When did we see you as a stranger and invite you in? When did we see you needing clothes and give them to you?  
 When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?'   
 "The King will reply, 'What I'm about to tell you is true. Anything you did for one of the least important of these brothers of mine, you did for me.'   
 "Then he will say to those on his left, 'You are cursed! Go away from me into the fire that burns forever. It has been prepared for the devil and his angels.  
 I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink.  
 I was a stranger. But you did not invite me in. I needed clothes. But you did not give me any. I was sick and in prison. But you did not take care of me.'   
 "They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and not help you? When did we see you as a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison and not help you?'   
 "He will reply, 'What I'm about to tell you is true. Anything you didn't do for one of the least important of these, you didn't do for me.'   
 "Then they will go away to be punished forever. But those who have done what is right will receive eternal life." 
 The Plan to Kill Jesus   
 Jesus finished saying all these things. Then he said to his disciples,  
 "As you know, the Passover Feast is two days away. The Son of Man will be handed over to be nailed to a cross."   
 Then the chief priests met with the elders of the people. They met in the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest.  
 They made plans to arrest Jesus in a clever way. They wanted to kill him.  
 "But not during the Feast," they said. "The people may stir up trouble." A Woman Pours Perfume on Jesus   
 Jesus was in Bethany. He was in the home of a man named Simon, who had a skin disease.  
 A woman came to Jesus with a special sealed jar of very expensive perfume. She poured the perfume on his head while he was at the table.   
 When the disciples saw this, they became angry. "Why this waste?" they asked.  
 "The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to poor people."   
 Jesus was aware of this. So he said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me.  
 You will always have poor people with you. But you will not always have me.  
 She poured the perfume on my body to prepare me to be buried.  
 What I'm about to tell you is true. What she has done will be told anywhere this good news is preached all over the world. It will be told in memory of her." Judas Agrees to Hand Jesus Over   
 One of the Twelve went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.  
 He asked, "What will you give me if I hand Jesus over to you?" So they counted out 30 silver coins for him.  
 From then on, Judas watched for the right time to hand Jesus over to them. The Lord's Supper   
 It was the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus. They asked, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?"   
 He replied, "Go into the city to a certain man. Tell him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover at your house with my disciples." ' "   
 So the disciples did what Jesus had told them to do. They prepared the Passover meal.   
 When evening came, Jesus was at the table with the Twelve.  
 While they were eating, he said, "What I'm about to tell you is true. One of you will hand me over to my enemies."   
 The disciples became very sad. One after the other, they began to say to him, "It's not I, Lord, is it?"   
 Jesus replied, "The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will hand me over.  
 The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But how terrible it will be for the one who hands over the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."   
 Judas was the one who was going to hand him over. He said, "It's not I, Rabbi, is it?"  Jesus answered, "Yes. It is you."   
 While they were eating, Jesus took bread. He gave thanks and broke it. He handed it to his disciples and said, "Take this and eat it. This is my body."   
 Then he took the cup. He gave thanks and handed it to them. He said, "All of you drink from it.  
 This is my blood of the new covenant. It is poured out to forgive the sins of many.  
 Here is what I tell you. From now on, I won't drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my Father's kingdom."   
 Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus Says That Peter Will Fail   
 Jesus told them, "This very night you will all turn away because of me. It is written that the Lord said, " 'I will strike the shepherd down.  Then the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)   
 But after I rise from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."   
 Peter replied, "All the others may turn away because of you. But I never will."   
 "What I'm about to tell you is true," Jesus answered. "It will happen this very night. Before the rooster crows, you will say three times that you don't know me."   
 But Peter said, "I may have to die with you. But I will never say I don't know you." And all the other disciples said the same thing. Jesus Prays in Gethsemane   
 Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane. He said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."   
 He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him. He began to be sad and troubled.  
 Then he said to them, "My soul is very sad. I feel close to death. Stay here. Keep watch with me."   
 He went a little farther. Then he fell with his face to the ground. He prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, take this cup of suffering away from me. But let what you want be done, not what I want."   
 Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Couldn't you men keep watch with me for one hour?" he asked Peter.  
 "Watch and pray. Then you won't fall into sin when you are tempted. The spirit is willing. But the body is weak."   
 Jesus went away a second time. He prayed, "My Father, is it possible for this cup to be taken away? But if I must drink it, may what you want be done."   
 Then he came back. Again he found them sleeping. They couldn't keep their eyes open.  
 So he left them and went away once more. For the third time he prayed the same thing.   
 Then he returned to the disciples. He said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look! The hour is near. The Son of Man is about to be handed over to sinners.  
 Get up! Let us go! Here comes the one who is handing me over to them!" Jesus Is Arrested   
 While Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the Twelve. A large crowd was with him. They were carrying swords and clubs. The chief priests and the elders of the people had sent them.   
 Judas, who was going to hand Jesus over, had arranged a signal with them. "The one I kiss is the man," he said. "Arrest him."   
 So Judas went to Jesus at once. He said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" And he kissed him.   
 Jesus replied, "Friend, do what you came to do."  Then the men stepped forward. They grabbed Jesus and arrested him.  
 At that moment, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword. He pulled it out and struck the servant of the high priest with it. He cut off the servant's ear.   
 "Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him. "All who use the sword will die by the sword.  
 Do you think I can't ask my Father for help? He would send an army of more than 70,000 angels right away.  
 But then how would the Scriptures come true? They say it must happen in this way."   
 At that time Jesus spoke to the crowd. "Am I leading a band of armed men against you?" he asked. "Do you have to come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courtyard teaching. And you didn't arrest me.  
 But all this has happened so that the words of the prophets would come true."  Then all the disciples left him and ran away. Jesus Is Taken to the Sanhedrin   
 Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest. The teachers of the law and the elders had come together there.  
 Not too far away, Peter followed Jesus. He went right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see what would happen.   
 The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for something to use against Jesus. They wanted to put him to death.  
 But they did not find any proof, even though many false witnesses came forward.  Finally, two other witnesses came forward.  
 They said, "This fellow claimed, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God. I can build it again in three days.' "   
 Then the high priest stood up. He asked Jesus, "Aren't you going to answer? What are these charges that these men are bringing against you?"   
 But Jesus remained silent.  The high priest said to him, "I command you under oath by the living God. Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."   
 "Yes. It is just as you say," Jesus replied. "But here is what I say to all of you. In days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One. You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven."   
 Then the high priest tore his clothes. He said, "He has spoken a very evil thing against God! Why do we need any more witnesses? You have heard him say this evil thing.  
 What do you think?"  "He must die!" they answered.   
 Then they spit in his face. They hit him with their fists. Others slapped him.  
 They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you?" Peter Says He Does Not Know Jesus   
 Peter was sitting out in the courtyard. A female servant came to him. "You also were with Jesus of Galilee," she said.   
 But in front of all of them, Peter said he was not. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.   
 Then he went out to the gate leading into the courtyard. There another woman saw him. She said to the people, "This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth."   
 Again he said he was not. With an oath he said, "I don't know the man!"   
 After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter. "You must be one of them," they said. "The way you talk gives you away."   
 Then Peter began to call down curses on himself. He took an oath and said to them, "I don't know the man!"  Right away a rooster crowed.  
 Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said. "The rooster will crow," Jesus had told him. "Before it does, you will say three times that you don't know me." Peter went outside. He broke down and sobbed. 
 Judas Hangs Himself   
 It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and the elders of the people decided to put Jesus to death.  
 They tied him up and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, who was the governor.   
 Judas, who had handed him over, saw that Jesus had been sentenced to die. He felt deep shame and sadness for what he had done. So he returned the 30 silver coins to the chief priests and the elders.  
 "I have sinned," he said. "I handed over a man who is not guilty."  "What do we care?" they replied. "That's your problem."   
 So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.   
 The chief priests picked up the coins. They said, "It's against the law to put this money into the temple fund. It is blood money. It has paid for a man's death."  
 So they decided to use the money to buy a potter's field. People from other countries would be buried there.  
 That is why it has been called The Field of Blood to this very day.  
 Then the words spoken by Jeremiah the prophet came true. He had said, "They took the 30 silver coins. That price was set for him by the people of Israel.  
 They used the coins to buy a potter's field, just as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus Is Brought to Pilate   
 Jesus was standing in front of the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"  "Yes. It is just as you say," Jesus replied.   
 But when the chief priests and the elders brought charges against him, he did not answer.  
 Then Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the charges they are bringing against you?"   
 But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge. The governor was really amazed.   
 It was the governor's practice at the Passover Feast to let one prisoner go free. The people could choose the one they wanted.  
 At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.  
 So when the crowd gathered, Pilate asked them, "Which one do you want me to set free? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called Christ?"  
 Pilate knew that the leaders were jealous. He knew this was why they had handed Jesus over to him.   
 While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him a message. It said, "Don't have anything to do with that man. He is not guilty. I have suffered a great deal in a dream today because of him."   
 But the chief priests and the elders talked the crowd into asking for Barabbas and having Jesus put to death.   
 "Which of the two do you want me to set free?" asked the governor.  "Barabbas," they answered.   
 "Then what should I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" Pilate asked.  They all answered, "Crucify him!"   
 "Why? What wrong has he done?" asked Pilate.  But they shouted even louder, "Crucify him!"   
 Pilate saw that he wasn't getting anywhere. Instead, the crowd was starting to get angry. So he took water and washed his hands in front of them. "I am not guilty of this man's death," he said. "You are accountable for that!"   
 All the people answered, "We and our children will accept the guilt for his death!"   
 Pilate let Barabbas go free. But he had Jesus whipped. Then he handed him over to be nailed to a cross. The Soldiers Make Fun of Jesus   
 The governor's soldiers took Jesus into the palace, which was called the Praetorium. All the rest of the soldiers gathered around him.  
 They took off his clothes and put a purple robe on him.  
 Then they twisted thorns together to make a crown. They placed it on his head. They put a stick in his right hand. Then they fell on their knees in front of him and made fun of him. "We honor you, king of the Jews!" they said.  
 They spit on him. They hit him on the head with the stick again and again.   
 After they had made fun of him, they took off the robe. They put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him away to nail him to a cross. Jesus Is Nailed to a Cross   
 On their way out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene. His name was Simon. They forced him to carry the cross.   
 They came to a place called Golgotha. The word Golgotha means The Place of the Skull.  
 There they mixed wine with bitter spices and gave it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.   
 When they had nailed him to the cross, they divided up his clothes by casting lots.  
 They sat down and kept watch over him there.   
 Above his head they placed the written charge against him. It read, ~this is jesus, the king of the jews.=   
 Two robbers were crucified with him. One was on his right and one was on his left.   
 Those who passed by shouted at Jesus and made fun of him. They shook their heads  
 and said, "So you are going to destroy the temple and build it again in three days? Then save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"   
 In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders made fun of him.  
 "He saved others," they said. "But he can't save himself! He's the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross! Then we will believe in him.  
 He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him. He's the one who said, 'I am the Son of God.' "   
 In the same way the robbers who were being crucified with Jesus also made fun of him. Jesus Dies   
 From noon until three o'clock, the whole land was covered with darkness.  
 About three o'clock, Jesus cried out in a loud voice. He said, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" This means "My God, my God, why have you deserted me?" (Psalm 22:1)   
 Some of those standing there heard Jesus cry out. They said, "He's calling for Elijah."   
 Right away one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar and put it on a stick. He offered it to Jesus to drink.  
 The rest said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."   
 After Jesus cried out again in a loud voice, he died.   
 At that moment the temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook. The rocks split.  
 Tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.  
 They came out of the tombs. After Jesus was raised to life, they went into the holy city. There they appeared to many people.   
 The Roman commander and those guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened. They were terrified. They exclaimed, "He was surely the Son of God!"   
 Not very far away, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to take care of his needs.  
 Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of James and Joses, was also there. So was the mother of Zebedee's sons. Jesus Is Buried   
 As evening approached, a rich man came from the town of Arimathea. His name was Joseph. He had become a follower of Jesus.  
 He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.   
 Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.  
 He placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb. Then he went away.   
 Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there across from the tomb. The Guards at the Tomb   
 The next day was the day after Preparation Day. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.  
 "Sir," they said, "we remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'After three days I will rise again.'  
 So give the order to make the tomb secure until the third day. If you don't, his disciples might come and steal the body. Then they will tell the people that Jesus has been raised from the dead. This last lie will be worse than the first."   
 "Take some guards with you," Pilate answered. "Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can."  
 So they went and made the tomb secure. They put a seal on the stone and placed some guards on duty. 
 Jesus Rises From the Dead   
 The Sabbath day was now over. It was dawn on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.   
 There was a powerful earthquake. An angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled back the stone and sat on it.  
 His body shone like lightning. His clothes were as white as snow.  
 The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.   
 The angel said to the women, "Don't be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.  
 He is not here! He has risen, just as he said he would! Come and see the place where he was lying.  
 Go quickly! Tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."   
 So the women hurried away from the tomb. They were afraid, but they were filled with joy. They ran to tell the disciples.   
 Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings!" he said.  They came to him, took hold of his feet and worshiped him.   
 Then Jesus said to them, "Don't be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." The Guards Report to the Chief Priests   
 While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city. They reported to the chief priests all that had happened.   
 When the chief priests met with the elders, they came up with a plan. They gave the soldiers a large amount of money.  
 They told the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came during the night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'  
 If the governor hears this report, we will pay him off. That will keep you out of trouble."   
 So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has spread all around among the Jews to this very day. Jesus' Final Orders to His Disciples   
 Then the 11 disciples went to Galilee. They went to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.  
 When they saw him, they worshiped him. But some still had their doubts.   
 Then Jesus came to them. He said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.  
 So you must go and make disciples of all nations. Baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.  
 Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And you can be sure that I am always with you, to the very end." 
 John the Baptist Prepares the Way   
 This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.   
 Long ago Isaiah the prophet wrote, "I will send my messenger ahead of you.  He will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)   
 "A messenger is calling out in the desert,  'Prepare the way for the Lord.  Make straight paths for him.' " (Isaiah 40:3)   
 And so John came. He baptized people in the desert. He also preached that people should be baptized and turn away from their sins. Then God would forgive them.  
 All the people from the countryside of Judea went out to him. All the people from Jerusalem went too. When they admitted they had sinned, John baptized them in the Jordan River.  
 John wore clothes made out of camel's hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. And he ate locusts and wild honey.   
 Here is what John was preaching. "After me, one will come who is more powerful than I am. I'm not good enough to bend down and untie his sandals.  
 I baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus Is Baptized and Tempted   
 At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee. John baptized him in the Jordan River.  
 Jesus was coming up out of the water. Just then he saw heaven being torn open. He saw the Holy Spirit coming down on him like a dove.  
 A voice spoke to him from heaven. It said, "You are my Son, and I love you. I am very pleased with you."   
 At once the Holy Spirit sent Jesus out into the desert.  
 He was in the desert 40 days. There Satan tempted him. The wild animals didn't harm Jesus. Angels took care of him. Jesus Chooses the First Disciples   
 After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee. He preached God's good news.  
 "The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Turn away from your sins and believe the good news!"   
 One day Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the lake. They were fishermen.  
 "Come. Follow me," Jesus said. "I will make you fishers of people."   
 At once they left their nets and followed him.   
 Then Jesus walked a little farther. As he did, he saw James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat preparing their nets.  
 Right away he called out to them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men. Then they followed Jesus. Jesus Drives Out an Evil Spirit   
 Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath day came, he went into the synagogue. There he began to teach.  
 The people were amazed at his teaching. He taught them like one who had authority. He did not talk like the teachers of the law.   
 Just then a man in their synagogue cried out. He was controlled by an evil spirit. He said,  
 "What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"   
 "Be quiet!" said Jesus firmly. "Come out of him!"   
 The evil spirit shook the man wildly. Then it came out of him with a scream.   
 All the people were amazed. So they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching! And with so much authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits, and they obey him."  
 News about Jesus spread quickly all over Galilee. Jesus Heals Many People   
 Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. Right away they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.  
 Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed. She had a fever. They told Jesus about her.  
 So he went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her. Then she began to serve them.   
 That evening after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick. They also brought all who were controlled by demons.  
 All the people in town gathered at the door.  
 Jesus healed many of them. They had all kinds of sicknesses. He also drove out many demons. But he would not let the demons speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus Prays in a Quiet Place   
 It was very early in the morning and still dark. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.  
 Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.  
 When they found him, they called out, "Everyone is looking for you!"   
 Jesus replied, "Let's go somewhere else. I want to go to the nearby towns. I must preach there also. That is why I have come."  
 So he traveled all around Galilee. He preached in their synagogues. He also drove out demons. Jesus Heals a Man Who Had a Skin Disease   
 A man who had a skin disease came to Jesus. On his knees he begged Jesus. He said, "If you are willing to make me 'clean,' you can do it."   
 Jesus was filled with deep concern. He reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing to do it," he said. "Be 'clean'!"  
 Right away the disease left him. He was healed.   
 Jesus sent him away at once. He gave the man a strong warning.  
 "Don't tell this to anyone," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded. It will be a witness to the priest and the people that you are 'clean.' "   
 But the man went out and started talking right away. He spread the news to everyone. So Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He stayed outside in lonely places. But people still came to him from everywhere. 
 Jesus Heals a Man Who Could Not Walk   
 A few days later, Jesus entered Capernaum again. The people heard that he had come home.  
 So many people gathered that there was no room left. There was not even room outside the door. And Jesus preached the word to them.   
 Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.  
 But they could not get him close to Jesus because of the crowd. So they made a hole in the roof above Jesus. Then they lowered the man through it on a mat.   
 Jesus saw their faith. So he said to the man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."   
 Some teachers of the law were sitting there. They were thinking,  
 "Why is this fellow talking like that? He's saying a very evil thing! Only God can forgive sins!"   
 Right away Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?  
 Is it easier to say to this man, 'Your sins are forgiven'? Or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'?  
 I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins."  Then Jesus spoke to the man who could not walk.  
 "I tell you," he said, "get up. Take your mat and go home."   
 The man got up and took his mat. Then he walked away while everyone watched. All the people were amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this!" Jesus Chooses Levi   
 Once again Jesus went out beside the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd came to him. He began to teach them.  
 As he walked along he saw Levi, son of Alphaeus. Levi was sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him. Levi got up and followed him.   
 Later Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd following Jesus.   
 Some teachers of the law who were Pharisees were there. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"   
 Jesus heard that. So he said to them, "Those who are healthy don't need a doctor. Sick people do. I have not come to get those who think they are right with God to follow me. I have come to get sinners to follow me." Jesus Is Asked About Fasting   
 John's disciples and the Pharisees were going without eating. Some people came to Jesus. They said to him, "John's disciples are fasting. The disciples of the Pharisees are also fasting. But your disciples are not. Why aren't they?"   
 Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the groom go without eating while he is with them? They will not fast as long as he is with them.  
 But the time will come when the groom will be taken away from them. On that day they will go without eating.   
 "People don't sew a patch of new cloth on old clothes. If they do, the new piece will pull away from the old. That will make the tear worse.  
 People don't pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wine will burst the skins. Then the wine and the wineskins will both be destroyed. No, everyone pours new wine into new wineskins." Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath Day   
 One Sabbath day Jesus was walking with his disciples through the grainfields. The disciples began to break off some heads of grain.  
 The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the Law to do this on the Sabbath. Why are your disciples doing it?"   
 He answered, "Haven't you ever read about what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food.  
 It was when Abiathar was high priest. David entered the house of God and ate the holy bread. Only priests were allowed to eat it. David also gave some to his men."   
 Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath day was made for man. Man was not made for the Sabbath day.  
 So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath day." 
 Healing on the Sabbath
 Another time Jesus went into the synagogue. A man with a weak and twisted hand was there.  
 Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They watched him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day.   
 Jesus spoke to the man with the weak and twisted hand. "Stand up in front of everyone," he said.   
 Then Jesus asked them, "What does the Law say we should do on the Sabbath day? Should we do good? Or should we do evil? Should we save life? Or should we kill?" But no one answered.   
 Jesus looked around at them in anger. He was very upset because their hearts were stubborn. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was as good as new.   
 Then the Pharisees went out and began to make plans with the Herodians. They wanted to kill Jesus. Crowds Follow Jesus   
 Jesus went off to the Sea of Galilee with his disciples. A large crowd from Galilee followed.  
 People heard about all that Jesus was doing. And many came to him. They came from Judea, Jerusalem, and Idumea. They came from the lands east of the Jordan River. And they came from the area around Tyre and Sidon.   
 Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to get a small boat ready for him. This would keep the people from crowding him.  
 Jesus had healed many people. So those who were sick were pushing forward to touch him.   
 When people with evil spirits saw him, they fell down in front of him. The spirits shouted, "You are the Son of God!"  
 But Jesus ordered them not to tell who he was. Jesus Appoints the Twelve Apostles   
 Jesus went up on a mountainside. He called for certain people to come to him, and they came.  
 He appointed 12 of them and called them apostles. From that time on they would be with him. He would also send them out to preach.  
 They would have authority to drive out demons.   
 So Jesus appointed the Twelve. Simon was one of them. Jesus gave him the name Peter.  
 There were James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges. Boanerges means Sons of Thunder.  
 There were also Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James, son of Alphaeus. And there were Thaddaeus and Simon the Zealot.  
 Judas Iscariot was one of them too. He was the one who was later going to hand Jesus over to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebub   
 Jesus entered a house. Again a crowd gathered. It was so large that Jesus and his disciples were not even able to eat.  
 His family heard about this. So they went to take charge of him. They said, "He is out of his mind."   
 Some teachers of the law were there. They had come down from Jerusalem. They said, "He is controlled by Beelzebub! He is driving out demons by the power of the prince of demons."   
 So Jesus called them over and spoke to them by using stories. He said, "How can Satan drive out Satan?  
 If a kingdom fights against itself, it can't stand.  
 If a family is divided, it can't stand.
