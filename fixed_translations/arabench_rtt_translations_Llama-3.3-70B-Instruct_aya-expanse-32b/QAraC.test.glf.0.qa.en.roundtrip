environmental khoaos If you don't want to, I do.
khoa, what are you saying?
This is unfortunate! It's an opportunity we shouldn't miss.
I'm not being principled. It's my right to take it, and you really have the right to take it before me.
khoaan, God bless your parents, don't bring us problems.
Salih, don't be..... God forgive me!
"Would a brother really advise his brother to do as you say?"
khoa I'm hungry
And she threw a big party.
No one owns Eid.
Say it to yourself.
This holiday won't come around again.
Why are you different, Saleh?
And take the opportunity from us
No, no, no, no, you're not going to convince me, that's impossible, impossible, I don't do that.
The problem is that he's scared.
What are you afraid of?
This is a government project! Everyone benefits.
This is the base!
Even people who don't own it benefit from it.
He is the head of a huge project.
This means he's in control.
Third millennium beaches, more specifically, the first phase of infrastructure.
This ignorant person
Here is where we can loot!
If he refuses to take
Who gave you the right?
You have no right to exploit her.
When his car wouldn't start
Who left him at the project site? Was it me?
No, if that's the case, you're right.
Whoever gives you money to wash your car four or five times!
Leave it to me.
Don't be stupid and don't bite.
Take advantage
See Uncle Khamis.
And now, as you say, they call him a millionaire.
A third of the project,
The remaining third is a commission.
One who plays in a popular band,
They say there's a national celebration.
And he bought a hundred lanterns.
We found out what they did.
He added a zero.
There's no use, Auntie.
No, God guides him if He wills.
We eat with him.
I spent last night trying to convince him.
Opportunity
To support good.
And with God's will, good will triumph.
This is common.
Keep it between us.
Don't talk to anyone about it.
Should we be afraid?
But my friends
Neck pain
The man began to change his mind.
I spoke to him today.
Two-hour morning.
Started to convince.
We have a meeting with him in a bit.
And we must convince him.
He's cutting us off at the pass.
Let them bring him to change his mind at the meeting.
Brother Ali, Brother Uthman.
I don't know.
Today is my first day at work.
Rely on me.
How could you not take it!
Sure. But are you sure I'll get something?
I want to ask you
If you are hungry and walking down the street
Will you eat or not?
I am a person who eats a lot.
Don't worry.
The plate is large.
We're still working on the first article for the meeting.
If you don't feel better,
If you have any concerns
What I really want to know
It's legitimate.
"O Allah, guide Saleh."
That's reasonable because you're a boss for the first time in your life.
Just easy.
Here we'll skip our class.
In the project budget!?
What do you think?
So that no one suspects our work.
Let's put our share as a separate article!
This amount of money was stolen.
In the department of those responsible for the project.
Couldn't
No, no, no! Oh! Alright!
You have an idea how these things happen.
But it seems you have some concerns.
It's their right.
First and foremost,
Everything is in our hands.
I told you he was a liar.
What's wrong with you?
He says the new car belongs to his friend, and you believe him.
He said that!
Let's say it's his friend's car.
At a very special location, too!
Except for a very rich man.
What I heard from people,
He told me that he bought the land and registered it in his name.
"Please say" o
He has the money now.
Now he's going to start lying.
Am I his family?
Is that all?
Aren't we getting anything?
The sentences are empty!
He wants to eat it all by himself, the glutton.
Don't nod your head!
Not your brother
Sit down and everything will be fine.
I talked to him all night.
I told him they were your relatives no matter what.
And he finally agreed.
This is how things should be.
And I hope you don't get it just once.
This is the international beaches of the third millennium.
Specifically, infrastructure.
After this, they will start the second phase.
And it will continue with him.
May God replace your loss with good.
Good, I made him agree.
You're no different from them.
No problem
I hope you made it clear to him.
We want a percentage.
They all take a percentage.
He said even after I convinced him.
They want their friends to attend the meeting to determine the project budget.
They have to follow up on matters, it's their money.
We identified, and I'm certain of it.
Submit it as soon as possible for approval.
Take your time.
Who is this? Do you recognize him?
He is my brother-in-law and shares with me.
Do you mean him?
We are responsible for doors, windows, and everything related to finishing.
Okay, okay
How much do you want, so we can finish?
How much will you take?
I think we should take the money.
Let's give ourselves a week to think.
And determine the amount of money we will get.
Some people wish and want something.
Abdulaziz is correct.
If someone decides to take half a million,
During this week, everyone will think carefully.
And they specify the amount they want.
Next week, they'll figure out their minds and decide how much they want.
It's none of your business.
Then, it's up to you?
Crush him.
Hello friend, what's this? What's wrong?
I don't know what he's doing here.
Hey! Who invited you to this project?
Government project
Salih, your brother's name is Sultan!
This is our neighbor's driver.
Sometimes he drives us when our car breaks down.
Write.
Sanaad Abdullah
No, no, there are three other people.
Something else I can do, I'm tired of it.
I told him, "Enough, man. Let's propose the budget and be done."
No, no, this will cost money.
How much should I lift for him?
Son of sad, does he have children?
Yes, make it twenty-five thousand four hundred.
Four hundred
They add it by force.
How much will you give them!
This is too much.
This is my mother, just as we were talking about her.
Oh, Mother.
Oh, no, no, no, this one is too much, son.
No, son, she wants to go to Thailand for treatment.
Wait, wait, what happened?
Why are you stressed?
Only from phase one, the infrastructure in particular.
Not used
Add three thousand.
He buys me watches from Thailand with bling strass.
Did you add her?
Yes, Mother.
No mom, I added her. I just wanted to make sure of the name.
My beloved, my mother.
Let's make the holiday bigger.
Yes, but the budget needs to be defined; it can't be open-ended like this.
Tomorrow is the final meeting and everyone must decide on the amount of money they want.
I have this.
A million is enough?!
My dear love
Guys, guys, wait, there's noise, give us a chance.
The committee is in session now to approve the project budget. There are no financial issues to discuss at this time. That's all.
I want more
We told you not to embarrass us, we are in the ministry's courtyard.
Oh God, please don't pay us any attention.
If someone comes and asks what's wrong with you here
Here, tell him that the power is out or there's a power surge.
Do not make noise in the ministry's courtyard.
%pw Silent %pw Silent
Sew it! Do you hear me!
"I was with them, how many are there now?"
Without counting my brother
Full, 50 million %pw
Just fifty million for the first phase.
How much is it now?
Something, suitable
Passing by others is love, man.
In any case, bon appétit.
Hurry up, let's work, all the beneficiaries are waiting for us.
No problem... The main thing is that there should be no discussions, they decide the budget and that's it.
And implementation starts tomorrow.
And it serves a very large segment of society.
God bless you, this is the International Millennium Beaches Project.
This is the first stage.
More specifically, the infrastructure.
For the coming categories
Certainly, on behalf of our team, we would like to greet and congratulate you on the occasion of the project's inauguration, which will take place tomorrow, as far as I know.
What we took was one and a half million years.
One and a half years
Once again, in the name of the Future Achievements Program,
This project
And future generations
May God preserve the blessing of oil for us.
Second stage, third stage, and tenth stage.
actor
Welcome aboard.
Why did they gather us here? When are the trucks coming to take us away?
What? Where are they taking us?
Praise be to God, you've grown up and lost your mind.
Let's sit down, the sun is hot.
Yes, she's a kind girl.
But I don't see anything.
Anything but the sea.
Why did they demote you?
Aman told me that my sister Manira is here.
My father's land in the desert.
I was surprised by who deceived her and gave her false information.
It's not her land.
I saw a farm in the desert and said, "That's your father's farm."
In short, why are you asking about these things?
Do you have sisters?
Whoever works hard, invests in land, real estate, and businesses, and makes an effort.
Free from headache
I'm disappointed in you, Iman.
And also, my sister.
However you know
They must give it to me.
They are your sisters.
And there is nothing better than the truth.
Because of the money.
Now we appoint her and transfer her to the hospital.
I don't know how many years her sisters spent in court.
Nineteen years, if not more.
No, but
The sisters of Umm Sulaym are thieves.
Sister, she was telling me yesterday that
She wants to build a mosque before she dies.
What do you know?
I'm not saying your sisters are like hers, God forbid.
How many years have passed since my father's death?
Why this time?
And she saw the farm.
Something else you love?
Aren't checks paid every three months?
Falcon, relax, let's understand the story first.
Not in her hands.
If it were someone else, his sisters wouldn't have paid a single penny.
He finally got it.
Where from?
It's not like my money.
Look what, Munira
Wait and see.
Becomes fifty thousand
Because I had the courage to ask about my father's land, which is in the desert.
I'm sure my share is more than that.
Everyone lives in a villa like this.
Their children are in the best schools.
Something I say, O Munira
I won't stop fighting for my right.
I will get my rights.
"I think we should invest your money in the company!" "No, thank you."
Everyone fights with each other.
People have no mercy anymore.
You think your brothers are better than mine.
Look at me.
Twenty years
I used to go to the court regularly.
And in the end
I didn't take anything from him.
Why do they do that?
That's why I'm telling you, be gentle with them.
Take care of them with kindness.
And I am fed up with them.
And why do courts take a long time?
We are four hundred thousand of us.
If we reach a million like other countries.
I really doubt, dear, that an order will be issued.
Look at my brothers.
I'm dividing what I want, all this.
What should I say, dear friend?
I can only say that God alone provides for us, and He is the best manager of our affairs.
God is our guardian, and He is the best Appointer for us.
Didn't you have a court hearing last week?
As usual, my love.
The judge asked us to file a brief.
We've been through this many times.
My love, they will invest millions, and you will only see them.
And as I told you, you'll get tired of the courts.
And who will take your right?
That's why I'm telling you, if I were in your shoes.
I'm satisfied with what they give me.
Because the woman
We have nothing to lose.
Men ask you!
She has some.
Just questions about her class.
She just wants to know something and leave.
If you can't find it
I'll drag you and show you what.
He's going to find a way.
You signed the surrender document.
Two hundred and fifty is more than enough for her, her husband is working.
Take it or leave it.
Why is she asking this time?
But he is eager.
As if it's not real.
This is my father's inheritance, and he wants to decide how much I should take, take it or leave it.
It's neither mine nor his to decide.
This is God's command.
Why do they trespass on my father's grave?
I didn't expect that from them.
Because of the money.
Opened thirty years ago,
I don't know what to do, Nasser!
Land, buildings, and real estate are easy to understand.
I don't know how much they charge.
Even the company,
It's your right to go and ask about everything.
And we'll leave them alone.
How are you going to get back to them?
Not your business.
And you are not responsible for them, I have the right to know everything.
**T
Your sister gave him permission.
Who is allowed to examine almost everything in the company.
Falcon, Saad
He's shouting at us.
Falcon, enough.
Brother of Nasser
Excuse me, I'll take it.
Yes, sir.
Go away now.
Excuse me, I'm leaving.
Don't give him a chance to attack us.
Now, if he went and told on us,
He said that he hit you.
So what does he want!
I have an official document.
Official! We can't stop him.
It is his legal right to inspect everything.
If he had seen the budget and accounts.
We give her forty thousand every three months.
If he had examined the budget,
Multiply twelve by eight.
Divide it by three.
Thirty-two
Do you have any idea how much?
This is the amount we owe him.
Excluding land and projects
We are free to do what we want.
We have nothing to fear, we are not afraid.
If he disagrees, this is what we got. If he agrees, he's welcome.
Let them go and deal with it.
They only give their sisters enough money to live on.
She is married.
She has a reliable husband.
What does he want to do with the money?
This is what was supposed to be from the beginning.
Yes, I recommend it.
As he likes.
Even my desk.
Brother Rashid, this was supposed to happen before.
As you wish, sir.
File by file
When she knew her true inheritance,
Villas and lands that you didn't know about
They were seven.
They were sixteen.
She didn't know.
Poor Haya was shocked.
Not fair
Don't leave them alone.
My son, I don't want to hear about the courts.
The more anxious you are,
The least of a judge
For half a minute
And then he'll say his usual phrase,
For the seventh, the fourth, the two thousand, I didn't know how much.
They're going to be very happy, son.
You are absolutely forbidden to leave your bed, O Mother.
May God heal you.
No, no, come with pleasure.
Nasser and my sister Manar
After we locked the door and expelled him from the company.
He's sending one of my old schoolmates.
His name is Abdullah.
And now
I won't allow him.
It means he can influence them.
God creates.
AI AI AI
Do not rely on fate.
Courts do nothing but reports.
Delays and arguments, useless lawyers.
Contracts pass.
And time passed.
And we won't take a single real.
May God have mercy on the mother of Muslims.
My advice was heeded one day before her death.
Don't go to the courts.
Our judge said
She died without taking anything from her inheritance.
She died while the judge was still unresolved her case.
What if we were like the other countries?
Hello Abdullah
Abdullah's brother
The years passed.
This is my brother Saad.
May God increase you in blessings.
The most important thing
Brothers
Brother Rashid
You are a brother to me.
Why don't you leave the money problems alone?
Do you have anything else to talk about besides my sister?
Sorry
When I ask him, he stops talking.
It's correct.
What they want from me is to claim my share of my father's inheritance.
My mother told me yesterday that Saad's wife, my brother-in-law's wife, was very kind.
Her father is a messenger at the ministry.
It's all my father's money.
We've been waiting for a long time.
We'll try one last time.
You sent them your friend, Abdullah.
They neither respected him nor even expelled him.
Let's see what Sheikh Abdurrahman will do.
He is a very generous man.
Of course, Nasser said.
Don't worry.
Scare them with the law.
Did you forget what Umm Salama said about the courts?
Perhaps the brothers of Umm Salama do not fear the courts.
But my sisters
He might be afraid of rumors.
They might be afraid to go to court.
We are waiting and seeing what will happen after Sheikh Abdul Rahman's visit to them.
God bless you.
Is this the Friday sermon?
If you don't have it, get out.
What did you say, son?
Tells the truth
Go, %pw go
I'm going to court tomorrow morning.
And why do I have to postpone it until after tomorrow?
I decide, not you.
What will happen if I wait until after tomorrow?
Hello, brother Rashid
This is a promise.
I've told you before.
Let's scare them with the law.
Now, he is asking me to postpone going to court.
Because they knew you were serious about it, my love.
It's important that we visit your sister Manira.
What is this?
You asked me what this is, this.
God bless you all.
It's a miniature model of the courthouse.
God bless you.
And all of you
May God protect you.
I didn't say that.
I told you not to go today.
Postpone it until after tomorrow.
To get that sample, this %pw of the courthouse building
I'm ready to show you the way.
Enter through that door, this one.
When you enter through the door,
You put all your things there.
Mobile and anything metallic so as not to make beep beep beep beep beep sounds.
You're recording the case, they're asking you to go to the eighth floor, one two three four five six (elev) (anggangganggangg Round . . .
Look for the offices.
See the judge, if you need a particular judge, for instance.
Also, those
He threatens to sue us.
We're here to light the way.
"We'll be attracted when you take your rights."
Either you take the six thousand.
As he said.
Goodbye
Here tomorrow at my sister's today.
Oh, did the ministry approve his project?
My sister told me he was very happy, he didn't believe it.
He said, "If they approve the project, I'll invite you to dinner at my place."
Praise be to God, luck comes in pairs.
How happy you are, Abu Waleed.
He has good luck.
My sister told me that he was so happy he couldn't sleep last night.
Praise be to God! Oh, Manaal!
He's not used to work, but good men helped him.
Hey, tell your father
I hope you enjoyed the food.
"Thank you, oh! By the way..."
Thank you, Abu Waleed. May God bless you.
O Allah, fill your life with wealth.
A very delicious meal, Mother of Waleed.
Hire an accountant and a secretary to organize your business.
They told me to rent an office, and they would take care of everything.
Take it, uncle.
Oh my darling, my son.
I want a BlackBerry.
We want a bigger house.
See, he's doing better now.
Dad, hadn't we agreed that you would speak after lunch?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the owner of the project, my father, Bou Walid as. indădădădă Farquhar
Forgive us
Congratulations, Abu Waleed.
You are worthy.
But, frankly, you're not an expert in business and trade.
Oh man! There's a story behind this project.
I'll tell you how!
Praise be to God, %pw
Last year,
When the Japanese team played against our national team.
I was at Souk Waqif.
He doesn't know right now.
This is a manufacturer's catalog for multi-purpose halls, which our ministry is looking for. Provide it tousalemusalemusalemusalemusalemusalemusalemusalemusalemusalem...
Any contractor can build it for you.
I don't understand.
Any contractor
Japanese people are awesome.
When you open it, the computer says:
Cinema, if you want
I want a kitchen, click kitchen.
When I presented the catalog to the committee at the ministry,
And what's in the contract between you and the factory?
I paid some.
Deposit
Most importantly, your contract with the factory.
I described him, praise be to God.
Give me some time to place the first order.
What are you waiting for?
It's true that they agreed to it.
But we are still waiting for Bu Fahd's signature.
What did the secretary say?
He said, "What brought Fahad here?"
Well, do you want tea?
"Abu Waleed, tell me, what did you do!"
You know Bou Fahd, he might come, and he might not.
One day, it will appear.
No time.
Come get it.
You are the boss here.
You want to kill me?
No, he has to sign.
Look at all these files in my library, they all need the signature of Abu Fahd.
So, what should I do?
God help you.
"Five minutes to two, oh! Come on, Mr. Walid."
It's time to leave the house.
I don't think Boufahd would do that.
God help you, come tomorrow.
I said that you've known the manager for a long time and he's a friend of yours.
What's wrong with you?
He is a useless manager.
A manager that stupid, they don't do anything.
Alright, they seem like wise men where they are not.
They don't do anything useful.
Do they do anything at all!
They won't move the chair without Fouad's permission.
The manager didn't ask about you yesterday.
People's issues are pending.
It seems you're going to them today as well.
I'm in trouble.
I face problems every day.
Because the factory gave me limited time.
No, God willing.
And if they ask about you
Not just you who's waiting for Abu Fahd.
Look at these files.
Each one of them needs the signature of Bu Fahd.
I thought this day would come.
Please sit down.
Or take a walk.
I'll call you when he comes.
If something happens, I'll call, don't worry them.
Goodbye
Pardon me, she's my wife.
Oh boy, they've been sitting on my application for two months now.
I just need him to sign, what is this?
My son, here comes the registration period, my daughter will lose her university scholarship, her papers need hundert hundert hundert hundert hundert hundert hundert hundert hundert hundert. needs.
My problem with the factory, the deadline, the deadline.
Just wait.
All your papers are going to be signed.
He's drinking his coffee. When he's done, you can come and see him.
Please, I ask you all to be quiet.
Yes, sir.
Goodbye
Wait, wait oh! People
Wait, where are you going, wait.
I know what happened first.
What happened?
He has an urgent journey.
He has a unique voice.
I am delighted by this.
Our interests have stopped, my brother.
We are waiting for Bu Fahad every day.
What do we do, wait for Abu Fahd?
Peace be upon you, my father.
He's not responsible.
Everything is getting worse.
The factory is in Japan.
He was told that the time had run out.
And your aunt is a different story.
Daughter, she lent him money.
He's facing problems from all directions.
Mom, I'm very worried about Dad.
Don't leave him alone.
Who are you going to call?
Yes, who is this?
Bu Waleed
We're talking about the factory and your brother's wife.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Dad, how much longer do you want me to wait?
They always say,
And we are waiting for Bu Fahad.
Oh father, you've done your best.
But all my friends will enter university next week.
What do you want?
Phone, my love.
Don't worry, just give me some time.
OK, who am I going to talk to?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
I don't know what to say, my sister.
You were very patient with us.
God help you.
Bu Waleed is in a pitiful state.
And he was trembling like leaves due to the fever.
That's because the appointment is about to end.
Five days left.
He's going to lose all his money.
God is our guardian.
How wonderful! It attracts me, attracts me, attracts me.
I hope I get better, I feel.
I have an unusual fever.
The top is sliding.
The other part is completely immobile.
Fifty percent of my body isn't mine because of the fever.
Discount
Don't worry.
Everything will be alright.
My sister helps.
She's going to wait until we pay her back.
God rewards her good deeds.
Not worried about your sister now.
Rice bowl, God bless me.
It seems he heard.
Only God knows what's in his mind.
I'm disturbed by him and Bu Fahd.
He drags me, that's a problem.
Tomorrow is the last day.
My wealth is going to be gone.
Don't drag us in.
In the brain, in the brain
How are you able to speak?
Take it for me, let's see who's calling.
Sidi Bou Said
I'm inviting you because I feel sorry for you.
Be on standby.
Goodbye
I have been a committed person throughout my life.
You were a role model.
What do you think, that I'm free from you going to work every day?
I am able to deduct from your salary.
What's on your phone?
Instead of you deducting.
I'll put you on the stock committee.
Are you going to the stock market with them today?
You never leave work during working hours.
If you do
Then do not blame me.
Today is the last chance.
You can see him forget forget forget forget Antonio, he's, ' and, their waiting andabsencewaiting theirandandand. and absence-
I'm afraid they'll fire him.
This is my phone, oh! Bou Walid
He is poor.
Let him go, you mourn for him.
Oh! Bou Walid
Yes, hello.
What's wrong with you, Abu Waleed? I'm talking to you, you're walking with your phone.
Go finish your paper.
Don't worry.
Many thanks
It seems that Bu Fahd is here.
How can I assist you?
He is a very important officer.
Where did he go?
Soul of Uzbekistan
Brother, where is Uzbekistan?
This office is the third one on your left.
Don't quit.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't sit.
Don't show me.
Or do you want?
House by house
Go forward.
Oh people, this man is busy.
Do you know how much I spent?
For all these years, you
He took the papers, and brought the papers back.
My knee is weakening now.
Going back and forth between all these ministries.
But we were young.
I was carrying bundles of rice on my back like packs of potato chips for kids.
After that, God knows, and I learned how to ride a bike.
Especially the bicycle that she learned to ride and bought.
Olive green
They're trying to pass me while I'm riding this bike, oh my god.
Our daily bread, raising our children
The manager has arrived.
We need to celebrate after you finish.
Praise be to God, praise be to God.
Are you finally going to quit your job?
I testify that you are truly a good citizen.
Now I want to rest, brother. Goodbye.
We are all for you.
What do you want us to give you an extension for a year?
Enough, enough.
May God replace your loss with good.
You already gave me a four-year extension.
I should have quit a long time ago.
All my children are currently employed.
Last, yesterday was his first day at work.
And now, O Abu Abdulaziz,
I want to rest.
And you're nothing but a delivery driver.
With the traitors
Do you believe that
I haven't eaten khanfush in four years.
How beautiful
I'm smelling it now.
Here we do everything you want.
Transfer me to the Human Resources department.
Have you finished all the papers?
Yes, since yesterday.
Your papers will be delayed.
I'm bored.
Done
Stay in touch.
My son Khalid
From this moment on,
Inshallah, I will rest.
Wonderful, wonderful
I'm at work and I can't leave.
Can you stop by the Human Resources Department?
I have paper there.
I want you to take them to the Civil Service Bureau.
Thank you, thank you, Father.
Where are you going?
I have to go to the bank.
And she invites us all.
Yes, now.
I have to go to the bank.
Send it with someone else.
No, sister, I can't get out of work.
Bye bye, goodbye.
It seems he didn't agree, right?
He said he couldn't leave work.
What are you going to do?
I'll go to the bank tomorrow morning.
He is in the habit of going to work every day.
I'm sure he'll get bored.
This is good for him.
Will you let him rest?
Son of sad, happy because he will come home early.
He called and said that Khalid...
You sent him to complete his papers.
Fear God.
Everyone must rely on themselves.
You'll regret the snub.
Mum, I want it.
"I don't want to sell it, my daughter."
But I say, since he resigned from the job and left.
And he assigned Khalid tasks to accomplish.
He's sleeping in his room.
Those who are lost in their sea (sing)
Good morning, Father.
Hello Betty
Father, please.
But they called me and said the manager is not skeptical.
And leave your papers.
Yes, Saeed's mother.
I told you to let the children be independent. Why don't you listen to me?
As if you hadn't resigned.
I am the best.
I'm waiting for you, and the crowd is in front of me.
Here we eat it today.
Goodbye
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
Sorry, my dear father.
God help you.
Yes, the one next to the market.
Get out of here quickly.
I'm gone, my daughter, I'm gone.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
The will of God
There's nothing better than finding your home.
Sat, sat, sat
I told you to stay home.
Let your children learn to be independent.
What can I do for you, Uncle Saeed?
They're both going through a tough time, I need to help them.
Enough, enough, rest.
I'm coming to get you a glass of water.
And the khonafrush for eating.
Son, he's so dear to him, very tired.
And from the taxis
It's simple.
He went to the market branch.
And they want an identity for it.
She didn't even walk to her car.
He handed him the papers.
I did well, praise be to God.
Rely on yourselves.
I told you.
I want you to relax.
Take a chair and sit with us.
Lunch is very delicious.
I went from one ministry to another.
I ran from one ministry to another.
I've finished my children's paperwork.
You worked to protect them when they were young, and you will continue to protect them now, you are entertaining them.
My children are in good positions at work.
And they're always busy, what should I do?
In daily meetings, either with the manager, or with the director, or with the minister.
They have good jobs, when they are needed they must be present, %pw work.
"In order to go and finish your work, other people stop you and force you to sit all the time, what were you thinking?"
I'm coming right away. May God compensate you.
Just now, goodbye.
Sorry now, ah ah Bou Shahin
Brahim
If you send your father tomorrow to finish your work,
So I'll be late to work.
Fear God.
Impossible, especially tomorrow, I can't.
It's because he loves you.
Although he is troubled and tired of your bad behavior towards him.
You don't even respect his age.
He's finally exhausted and has been sleeping in his room for two days.
Due to wandering the streets under the hot sun.
Make him give you the papers.
And go now and finish it.
A committee, starting from early morning until afternoon.
Did you hear that, Mom?
Do you want to delay the construction of a building?
Since you have a deadline and a committee tomorrow,
Your papers need to be ready by tomorrow.
Some of them at night.
He has a committee meeting tomorrow, he has to be there.
What are the dangers, my lord?
Keeping back his tears
In truth, I didn't lie to my father.
The committee changed its mind.
And they said they will come by the end of the week.
Okay, why didn't you tell him?
Oh father, don't go.
Go because the committee hasn't come.
Instead of sitting in the cafeteria with their girls
Deceived him.
Enough is enough.
I apologize.
I will
Thank you.
Oh father, Khadija is...
He is wrong.
And I am also hurtful.
When he found out the committee wasn't coming.
We praise God for you.
"And from now on, O Father"
Here, we'll do our personal work ourselves.
Stay at home.
Let me kiss you on the head.
Hello, hello my son
Good morning
Oh my dear father
The value of the whole world to me
I don't want to lose you.
No bother.
As I told you,
After finishing this research
I wanted to do it myself.
He asked me to come quickly.
When I have a meeting
With the happiness of the minister
Please.
He met with important figures.
I feel happy when they say my children are with him or with that.
Don't worry and go to your work, (singing)
Where is Bou Saada?
Father, please.
The wallet is with me, I'll give it to the tea boy.
Come over to me, I'll ask him if he wants tea.
My dear father
Fear what he does not possess.
He might have forgotten.
Because the committee will meet in an hour.
No, God bless you.
My son has a meeting with the minister today.
Leave the papers for me.
This is my daily routine, work, home, work.
I don't see anyone.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, hello.
Yes, no, I didn't tell him anything.
He takes a week off and goes to the sea.
They said he enjoys himself on the farm.
He goes early in the morning.
He is having a great time there.
And guess what?
They say he's a good cook.
And he will go to him.
Goodbye
What's stopping you?
What's the matter, sir?
May God guide you.
No, no, my son, I'm not wrong, there's nothing.
Your papers are scattered.
He is at the farm.
And she
Her friend's paper to
Thirsty, I want water.
Gulf (Qatari Arabic): Give me water, water.
My dear children
No, no, get it out of there, I don't want it.
Don't write that.
My father left them puzzled.
Thank you, sister.
You are correct.
No, no, no, I told him.
You are right, sister.
I'm sorry, sister.
They call it my league and cup.
Talk about the rules of the game.
He started talking nonsense.
And they named him with the title of "Stopping Corruption."
People started inciting him.
He has a lot of things to say on television and radio.
And also
They imprisoned him.
Believe it or not, my sister.
These days, everyone only cares about themselves.
Why is he looking for trouble?
Now, I never worry.
Let him speak, and say his famous line, "Stop corruption."
Praise be to God, he's good.
We praise God for your presence among us.
Goodbye
I'm late for work, Mom.
Listen, son.
I was warning you.
Last night
Now I just want to remind you.
Imagine my mother.
I will never say.
Radio or TV, or telephone, Q-tell
Your sister Ayesha, was
And your fiancée cries every day.
Have mercy on us, Lord have mercy on you.
As I said.
Stop talking about chaos.
Because I don't want to bother you.
Your uncle, Abu Munira
I came here two days after you entered prison.
He said he was done.
It will be cancelled.
After many attempts, I finally settled.
But next time he will come to court to divorce his daughter.
"Taf mama"
I promised you.
You won't see any good if you invite a TV or radio show again.
I told you I won't.
Sorry, I have to go now.
Just tell you to lower your voice.
The coordinator told me that
Keep your eyes peeled.
So you can talk about management.
And he starts dragging us into problems.
How is the manager going to detail this decision?
He has a million excuses to say.
Where are you going!
Are you serious, resign.
Something I told you before.
Hello, yes.
Goodbye
I told you.
"At your place, because of public interest."
We will reduce the number of correspondents in the ministry.
You are right, but
Please, once, tell us "Stop corruption."
Good
Stop corruption.
Correct, yes.
You're still here!
We have work to do.
It's a disaster.
Until this issue is resolved.
What did I tell you?
I told you they would fire him.
And Mona is standing here and heard me say that.
Yes, Father, I did.
I heard them say it myself.
Go, let me speak to your father alone.
Let me speak with your father.
He went to prison, we considered it a slip and forgave him.
We have no pardon for him after he was stripped of his rights.
Because we were relatives,
I heard that.
Calm down.
Insha'Allah, everything will be alright.
May God guide you to the right path.
I didn't come to drink coffee.
I know you.
I'm bored.
Your uncle gave you two weeks.
I swear he'll take you by force to court to divorce his daughter.
Even if you leave,
Why do you want to get into trouble?
But be careful.
Even if someone asks you,
Crush him.
Wasn't he the one who stopped corruption?
Yes, man, he is.
He's not doing well these days.
We want to hear it, at least once, please let us hear it.
No, it's no problem.
Are you police officers?
No, no, Mom, I didn't understand.
And he asked him to speak on a radio program about a problem my cousin faced.
He was hesitant.
We felt he was hesitant because we talked to him in public places.
So I said to my uncle's son, "Let's go to his house and speak to him alone."
Did you feel like he agreed?
He was hesitant.
And a journey.
Enough, enough, enough
I'm going to be upset and never speak to you again, did you hear me?
Are you Saleh Saad?
No, God bless you, no more, I've quit that habit, praise be to God.
You have a strong sense of responsibility.
An ideal employee
But unfortunately,
Although I tried
Peace be upon you
We came to you, you didn't have to.
I was about to call the secretary to tell you not to come.
Shahin, what's up?
What I knew
In Qatar, someone lives who doesn't know Saleh, the corruption stopper.
Are you Saleh, known as the Stop Corruption Movement?
Stop corruption.
Ay, the work.
There are no vacancies, I know.
It's better that you didn't rent it.
Am I crazy to bring him here?
I've been everywhere, Manira.
Even one of them told me there was a vacancy five minutes before I came, but they rented it, meaning they gave it to someone else.
My sister Aisha got divorced yesterday.
I'm responsible for them now.
I am a high-ranking official now.
I don't know what to do.
He moistens the minister's tongue.
But I didn't feel like it was the right thing to do.
I'm afraid this man will take my place.
Enough, stop it.
Who said I would be silent?
I just want it to be done in a way that doesn't affect me.
I'm thinking of a way to get rid of it.
"He will finish it."
But how?
I know him.
He's the one talking nonsense on the radio.
I'll bring it to your house.
And give him only the information.
You are dedicated, patriotic and
A very enthusiastic citizen.
Thank you.
I'm done with it.
I consider your voice the voice of truth.
Bofahed, I spoke to him.
Believe it or not, Saleh.
He says, "It's been a long time since we heard him say 'Stop corruption.'"
He wanted to meet you.
This is normal, acceptable.
I am running in the tent.
Forward, forward, forward
You are one of a kind.
For your kind words
Your talk on the radio is better.
Let's hear the end of corruption once and for all.
Ah, please, just one, Bou Fahad will say, listen, listen, listen to him.
Stop corruption.
This is the original, sir, this is it.
Continue, don't stop.
What I can
And then he stopped.
Even though I want you to continue solving people's problems and interests.
Lester is good.
I'll ask you one problem.
You are the voice of justice.
My father wants to speak to you alone.
He is a very important person.
You can't say no to him, you have to say yes.
Yes, correct.
This is your chance.
Opportunities don't come twice.
No, he is %pw.
Don't you understand?
Please wait for my brother.
From these issues and problems
Dear Minister
The ministry requested eight thousand tubes for its latest project.
The theater holds a quantity of one hundred and twenty toxins = pressure poison.
But this employee
To align the pipes that
Because he wants to take the budget.
Stop corruption.
Thank you, thank you very much, Brother Saleh, for stopping corruption.
No, God bless you.
This call is a special request.
I hope you hear it.
The situation has stopped corruption.. Stop corruption.
Do you have an idea?
Necessity forced him to do that.
This is the last one.
The sultan was deposed.
The minister dismissed him immediately?
He provided accurate information.
Now, Bou Fahad can do whatever he wants.
I'll do all the tasks.
Yes, sir.
Confirmation, Minister
Goodbye
Stop corruption.
It was the last one, for sure. We won't try again.
And here is my job application, sorry, I was in a hurry.
They got what they wanted.
Listen to me.
Because he is afraid that one day
And exposes his evil deeds.
To criticize and expose corruption,
They're afraid of you.
They deceived me, my sister, Aisha.
You're kind.
Your uncle, Abu Munira
I assure you that I will find a job.
People who speak critically are strange.
They are envious; they envy our country.
Do we have any problems?
We have no family influence.
I haven't heard this word before.
In our government circles,
We don't take bribes.
We know her.
Employee
Does a foreigner get more than a national? No, never.
We produce everything locally.
Our problem is with your family; we never have such issues.
If a manager or supervisor gets angry at you,
We are the best people.
Our country is the best country.
Open to any problems
And thank you.
What did you say on the radio yesterday?
Daddy, I want candy.
No candy until dinner.
No sweetness.
Why is your shirt torn?
Mom, Adoul and I were playing.
I know you were playing.
But what tore your shirt?
God is enough for you, O Aad.
Come see what your nephew did wrong.
I told you we don't need to buy it because it's expensive, and you said that's okay because it will come to our son anyway.
See what he did.
The shirt is currently useless.
That's why he's not afraid, no one can stand up to him.
Mother, where is the candy?
See how he wanted to peel her, it's clear it was intentional.
The poor man's hand.
He was happy to wear this shirt for the first time.
He will see.
Where is it?
In the garden
Why, what happened?
Something between me and him.
Don't be upset.
A little shy
Don't argue with a child.
A child should not be left to do as he pleases.
It's beyond repair.
Don't ask me to watch my words.
Are you a repairman?
We'll lift them.
Mind your own business.
Don't argue with him.
Why are you fighting like children?
Stay out of this, mom.
Don't interfere.
Tell him to raise his children well.
He is a boy.
You can't tell the difference between a child and an adult because you're crazy.
Do you have an idea?
It's not your problem.
Go to the Most High.
They don't deserve it.
Wasting our time responding to them.
Should not
When people loved each other.
Come, come here, goodbye, goodbye.
But, Sir, some papers need to be signed by you; the minister wants to see them.
Relax, relax, I'll talk to the teacher, don't worry.
I saw the catastrophe, the devastation.
New, no oh! Aisha
This is not a child's work.
You are correct.
The dress is ruined.
Look, look
This is not suitable to wear.
Look at Adol's pants; they can cover one leg, and the other will be exposed.
It's clear that this wasn't torn by hands.
It appears to have been torn using a power saw.
I say that God will provide for us.
I'll ask you.
Who wants candy? Come here.
I know too.
If you know, take a tour around the villa.
I love you, not just because you know how to ride a bike,
Also, because of something else.
Telling the truth is right.
Taf, do you want candy?
Yes, I want two.
I'm giving you four pieces.
I sorted through our clothes in the closet.
How did your father cut them?
He has a big pair of scissors so he can cut the car.
Under the bed, take all the candy.
Not to that extent.
No one else can do something like this.
Why do we have to be silent?
The most important thing
We insist on what we say.
I undressed the child.
Which computer?
What does he say about him?
It's impossible for a child to make these cracks.
Why don't you believe me?
Go discover your friends.
Give me a second.
You're always like this.
Fight every day, son!
Days of yore
"I seek forgiveness from Allah and grant him well-being."
May God guide you.
Who can carry such a large pair of scissors?
Go and meet your friends.
Liar like Helo, my mother.
He went and brought a big pair of scissors.
Act on your own, Sultan, soon.
Come and discover a solution to this, come my son.
How do I start?
Each one of you
You are fathers.
A child was born.
When a child is born,
You are my brothers.
Listen to me and make peace among yourselves.
Imagine, tell me, what will you do right now.
So what, tearing their clothes
There's no point comparing it to the disaster he caused. I lost all my documents and information; he destroyed everything.
I'm crazy to leave him.
He speaks very formal Arabic, like they do in museums.
Crush him.
He's going to beat him until he's tired and leaves.
He's crazy; my brother and I know him exactly.
And you're shaking hands.
He is filled with hatred and envy.
He's angry because I broke the computer.
Oh, I see.
Sulan, they beat him, beat, beating
Fear God, my children.
Practice, practice, [silence] gently, gently, [silence]
Take your siblings and play with them outside.
May God guide you.
Please God.
Old men
What have you left for the children?
Taf, Mom
Your brother, Abdurrahman
Maybe the last time, son.
He introduced you as his older brother, girls.
He knows how to talk to people.
And he argues
Don't be mad at me.
You are expected to
Plays a role
May God guide you.
Even you, you've become like them, my son.
Mother, they hit my son, it's a conspiracy against us, and you're saying, %pw, stay away.
Go away.
There's blood coming out of my son.
Be ashamed, children.
It was the boys who were throwing them.
He doesn't want to believe.
I saw them.
We told him it was the children, but he didn't believe us.
He said from his window.
He saw children throwing stones and because they were far away, he thought they were adults.
I'm not crazy.
You can go.
Perhaps you are tired or dizzy.
Do you know who they are?
And you tell me they're throwing stones.
It seems
Oh, my darling
I'm telling you to go home and rest, they signed an agreement, what more do you want?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Oh my God, God.
O Allah, suffice us the evil of the enemy.
Mother, Mother
All this is because of you.
Because of you
Your men, but they behave like children, sick minds.
Take me to the hospital, I will do it, I'm going to die.
Yes, and this isn't the first time I've seen him.
And I noticed that he didn't take his eyes off you.
He's not enrolled in the business class.
But he has been attending the class with us for a week.
It's clear he really wants to get to know you.
Don't restrict yourself because he loves you so much. Don't confine yourself too much.
No, my sister.
I don't want him to think I'm easy.
I went after him.
Let her walk normally.
Now that's chasing you, death from those who want to know you.
It's true that I like him too.
But, I don't feel it's the right time.
One hundred percent
She sees you and *
You're waiting until you come and say, "Excuse me, may I introduce myself?"
Take the initiative.
You are correct.
But I'm waiting for the right opportunity.
The right opportunity
What are you saying, you're registered in the same class as her.
What did the teacher say?
Please ask her, Professor.
I mean, what's her name?
We've been exchanging glances for three months.
But they didn't get to know each other.
You are too old.
You must go and say, "Excuse me,
May I introduce myself to you?
Not yet.
I have to wait for the right opportunity.
A quiet and polite girl.
I don't know what it requires.
We finished filming all the episodes yesterday.
Yes, certainly.
You never forget about us.
As long as I am free.
He is buying the villa behind ours for Waleed.
He will have his wedding tomorrow, he won't leave us.
No use now.
You're late.
You didn't know.
I saw it empty two days ago, who bought it?
And they bought it through a housing loan from the Development Bank.
God bless their home.
Hello hello, son, good morning
Uncle, start the engine.
Thank you, son. May God replace it with something better for you.
Hello Nora, come out, the car is working now, come, I'll drive you.
Peace be upon you too.
What do you want?
The neighbours are talking to each other, what do you want?
Stay away from us.
The neighbors are talking to each other, you're troublesome.
The gentleman parked his car behind mine, I can't get mine out.
So, if it's not too much trouble, give me your car keys.
Even the car key
I'll leave you in this Titanic atmosphere.
See you.
Goodbye
Now you know a lot about me.
I only know that you are Waleed.
Walid Rashid Abdullah
Surely when people hear your father's name, many will deny that you are the son of the famous actor.
The name itself, God willing.
Indeed, my father Rashid Abdullah, the actor.
Rashid Abdullah, the famous actor, is your father?
You're eating cookies! Why didn't you eat dinner with them?
Tell me,
How did you know that the famous actor, Rashid Abdullah, is our neighbor?
Ah, yes
My friend at university, he knew them, she told me this.
He loves his acting and only watches his works.
He finally said that we live next to a famous and valued person in the community.
My heart, O how much happiness!
He's very cute, he has a sense of humor.
And his son is a kind man, he helped me, may God reward him well.
It is said that
Do you have an idea?
Do you know why I want to take pictures with him?
Mom, talk to my cousin, Aboud.
I read an interview with him in the newspaper.
He said they would film a series about diving.
You're lucky, you got a sheep, a gift from your new villa.
He proved to be a good neighbor.
Hello Saleh, is there anything new?
Indeed, we have many names.
They told me, "O Abu Sa'd, may our Lord preserve you, my name is on the (list)."
This will be determined according to the need and experience of the employees.
We don't know.
We might not translate it.
You must excuse me, I won't be able to do anything for you.
Thank you
Let's move and settle first, and then when God blesses us with money, we'll buy furniture.
You did the right thing.
Oh! Bouali
Do you consider me strange?
Whatever you need,
I'm ready to help you.
Neighbors are each other's back.
But now I heard and saw it.
That's good, God willing, you are an expert in furniture.
Here, I'm going with you.
Don't worry, sister.
Whenever you want to choose the furniture, let me know.
My love, your father applied for a loan. If they approve it, we'll change all the furniture in the house.
And I repeat it again,
Feel free to ask me anything.
We're like a family now.
Doesn't your sister know how to study without your help?
I just want her to be independent.
I'm sure you were talking to her!
Well, do you want me to lie and say he was my friend?
Oh my son, oh Ali.
I don't have a problem with that.
As long as she loves me and I love her, that's all that matters.
You are dreaming.
Let me suggest your cousin to you.
Leave it to me.
As you wish
They rejected you.
Here I am.
Good evening
Good evening
What happened, Abu Ali?
Oh brother, the car is smashed.
From time to time, I feel annoyed.
My daughter, God bless her, has a lecture.
This car is always breaking down.
Your daughter is our daughter.
What matters
Don't worry about it, brother Rashid.
May God not bless you.
The car is parked in the yard, and the driver is sitting idle.
It seems that the development bank bought you a house and a car.
We don't have a car.
Our neighbor Rashid Abdullah's car.
I see relationships evolving.
Here we will discuss matters of mutual interest that benefit both parties.
Oh, this is a very significant development.
We went.
Mother, this is embarrassing.
I didn't agree.
Nora said, "Like my daughter, her driver will take her to university every day."
Did you tell her that my father's car will be under maintenance for a week?
I swear, no.
She said the driver would take her every morning.
God is a witness, O Mother of Ali.
They are good people.
No, no, no, man.
No initiative nor power except from God.
Oh problem, oh problem, what am I doing now?
So, something is working, I have responsibilities.
Who's going to drive my daughter to university?
Oh Abu Ali, since I was referred to you by Mr. Rashid Abdullah
We have no choice but to reject your request.
Bu Saad, Bu Saad
I'm sorry, Bu Saad.
Bu Ali knows how much we love him.
Thank you, may God reward you, O Abu Saad.
They love you, God willing.
This is beautiful
People, Mr. Rashid is busy, let him go.
Pardon me, pardon me, Mr. Rashid, if we took up your time.
No problem.
Good luck, you have good connections.
We are your friends and siblings, take care of us when we need something.
Keep in mind, tell me where you want it, I'll get it for you.
What happened, what happened, why did you bring me?
Are you offering me to Manal?
Their mother agreed, she agreed.
Manal talked to her mother about me.
Why aren't you believing?
Umm Waleed
Dresses too, do you have a party?
I don't understand.
I wish for Walid to get married soon too, my beautiful eyes.
She called me, wish I had.
She's taking some accessories.
No accessories! Jewelry.
Is this my mother?
She's also going by the elegant vessel.
Insha'Allah, Insha'Allah
If God wills, I cannot look at you.
This cream is from Um Waleed.
In addition to all that, the car gave you
With the driver.
If I went with you this year, they would believe that this dead man is the queen's husband.
Oh God
Are you going in those clothes?
Oh God! No, no, no, no, no, don't be afraid.
I'll change my appearance, you won't be able to recognize me.
They'll be surprised to think I'm a sheikh.
Get him coffee and let him live a long life.
Bouali, I don't know you. I thought you were an important person, but you're not Bouali. You're not Bouali.
What do you think?
You even walk differently.
May God bless you, the people we will suggest to her.
They are important figures.
I arranged everything from the headscarf to the car.
I'm sure I'll find it with you.
In the last series you worked on.
There was a job, as I remember, a wedding.
I was wearing a shiny black coat.
And I also want you to teach me how to wear a bisht.
Because, please, I've never worn a bisht in my life.
Inshallah, you look amazing.
Thus, even when you enter the guest room
This is not correct.
My brother, Rashid,
Do you have any napkins?
Good evening
"The one who is always with me and Khadoud."
The reason
You are my child.
We're a family now.
And we don't want our daughter Nora to be far from us.
Noura suits Waleed.
He told me he sees her at university and he won't find a better wife than her.
We praise God for this.
I will ask her father, and God will satisfy us with good.
Why did they return it, for what reason?
Because his father is an actor.
Ask your father to come.
Quick, tell him Rashid wants to see you.
Where are you, man!
I am screaming with sadness
Because his father is an actor.
You have no shame.
I am an actor.
And thus, I work diligently.
I've been performing on stage for a few hours and my role is coming to an end.
When you finish acting.
You role-play.
I act.
I'm seeing a useful vision.
But you
I wear costumes to role-play.
On the stage
But you
I wore it in the guest rooms.
The rich and wealthy woman's role.
Who is the actor?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be sad, Waleed.
Lift your head up.
This is a shame.
I missed the scene.
I heard her shout at him, "Don't turn your head, don't turn your head." "Alas for him," she cried, "my heart is broken."
And walk straight.
Like a horse.
It's a tunic, man, a tunic.
Thursday
His wife is crazy.
She is jealous of other women.
That's why he's walking like that.
So he wouldn't see a woman, and no woman would see him.
You see how his wife drives him crazy.
Be straight, don't twist your face.
I'll show up at his office tomorrow.
James, please, take them to the city center.
James, show me the shape of the city center.
Let your wife dress like a city center look.
Come Thursday.
I'm going to see what Salim wants.
"Son of
When will you learn!
If you only hear what they say about you.
Even my elders say more than that.
Why is she doing that?
She envies women for being around me.
When you're so jealous.
When I sit in front of the TV sometimes
She, she
I swear to God.
No, no, no problem.
Hello, peace be upon you, my sister.
You see that.
I just spoke to her, in front of you, I heard a man's voice.
I swear, sometimes my clothes are thrown in the street.
Respect yourself and divorce her.
I find it difficult to divorce her.
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't come near me, sit over there.
What's on your mind!
Nothing bad.
Who are you talking to?
You're spending time with these useless people.
Especially this deep man, he is the most hated one among your friends.
He has chubby cheeks and hair like little plants.
That rough guy has no shame.
You want to torture me in my grave.
Let me talk to her.
Tell me, what's wrong with you?
Who are you talking to!
I can't see anyone here.
Salem, what's wrong! What happened!
Our friend is a hungry man, his mind has flown away.
After a while, he stood facing the wall and started talking to himself.
Broken
James is a poor man.
He always imagines his mother and thinks he is talking to her.
God provides for His wife.
They say Thursday is with you.
Busy right now, he's on an international call, very far away, even the call is cutting out.
What does the message say?
May Allah help you, Thursday.
Why are you awake!
I'm not sleeping, I can't sleep.
Regarding tomorrow's meeting
With the women's delegation at the ministry
Could it be that they...
O Allah, guide Thursday.
These names are selected by the Office of the Minister's Happiness, Ministry Office.
Just come.
Why are you afraid of her?
If you were talking to Salem, why would you still be hiding?
Tell the truth.
Why are you hiding behind the tank?
This way only
I saw the last number you called, read, it's with you.
Last number!
You dialed the last number after deleting the woman's number you were talking to.
Tell me, what's her name!
I told you, I told you, I told you.
I told her that I had been talking with Salem.
My friend at work, Saloom.
You didn't believe me.
What are you wearing?
Are you going on a diving trip?
I swear, brother, you didn't let me change my clothes.
Who do you want me to call!
Call my wife.
Call my wife.
Tell her, "My brother, give me the password, a pen, call, give me the number."
Help each other.
You men are always like this.
You're like him, a liar. I'll ask you.
If you enter again, I will go to the minister's office.
She insulted me.
And she threatened me that she would complain about me to the minister's office.
She is really brave.
She is planning to destroy my career.
This is my mistake, I listened to you and called her.
Listen, Khamees.
She complained about me in the minister's office.
You come with me and tell the whole truth, get me out of this mess.
This has nothing to do with me.
You are a coward.
Sisters and brothers
Good morning, everyone.
Glad you attended the meeting.
Where's the rest?
Fled
Where is Thursday?
He's coming.
Turn off your mobile phone.
Leave it as it is, don't turn it off, keep it in the office.
The meeting is only for one hour.
This is not my phone.
The war began.
"And Allah, from that day, has always been with you."
Where can he go?
Let's go.
And since that day, his condition has not changed.
Jealous, jealous of the women around him.
This is not jealousy.
He's sitting here alone in the living room at night.
He says she is my mother.
Mother! Mother is dead.
That's why I invited myself, to find a solution for me.
I asked you to move to a section with women.
Is it a military decision?
Look at the signature, it's very clear at the bottom.
Brother, sorry, I moved to the Department of Social Affairs.
Department of Welfare! Are you sure they transferred you there?
Why is this strange?
Thank you, may God bless you.
Are you the fifth lady, sorry, sir?
The minister's office called and informed us.
Have you been to your new department?
Who's with you in the office?
Article, Saleem, Jasim,
Oh Thursday! The minister decided to promote you just yesterday.
And you just moved to the new department today.
I explained my problem with my family to you.
The minister decided to transfer you.
For I must go to the minister.
He started his annual vacation today.
He's coming back in a month and a half.
The problem with his clothes.
If you want my opinion,
The minister will tell you the same thing.
Work there until we find you another place. This time we're transferring you because many people have told us about your problem with your wife.
I'm telling you the truth.
And what shall we do!
Don't talk when your wife calls you.
What you don't know, they might comply with you, respond to them.
I asked them to put the abayas in the car, I had put them in a box for you.
How much?
I gave you a 10 because you're a 5 in the office, which means 2 for each one.
It seems he's very afraid of his wife.
Imagine he named all of us with masculine names.
And they call me Abdul Qadir
What's his name?
And he is beautiful and handsome, that's why she is afraid that other girls might love him.
In the name of God, what are her affairs?
Who called me?
Ah, Abdelkader, who is sitting next to Hassan, over there behind Khalil.
Here are the abayas, each one can choose what she likes.
Look at this.
How much is this one?
What happened? What occurred?
Sorry
Where is the social welfare office?
There are five employees among them.
What's your name?
I am handsome.
I'm crazy, my wife drove me crazy.
I am crazy.
She opened the project to us.
And he met them.
What did they say?
They said.
Manar, bring tea.
What I can
Do you want to go to the kitchen and ruin my clothes?
Go now, make us some tea.
Go, go, this is this.
Go, listen to what the man is saying.
Don't forget we're from Aqrab.
Go, go, and bring me tea without sugar, go, go, go, go, go.
The bank said the project is good.
I called him many times, his phone is busy.
Alas for them, they have waited for you for a long time.
My sisters, as usual.
One of them took a month's leave, traveled for three months and didn't come back.
Farewell, O Generous God.
And all the changes are in our favor.
Pour for us.
Oh, if only I had built a garden.
It will take the place of two or three villas at least.
The park is a place for the residents of the complex to relax.
Men don't need women's opinions.
Keep it for yourself.
Take the tea and go.
There's no park.
Just a moment.
Sister, you know I love football.
Your uncle and sisters will kill you if they find out you're playing it at school.
What are you planning, to kill yourself?
See, I told you.
I suggest you forget about it.
You're only hurting yourself.
No, no, no, no, I'm upset with you.
I'm busy.
Forgive me, you are our blessing.
Oh Uncle, Shain is coming.
Inshallah
Is this a shirt?
Grew up
The man became.
I'm tired of looking for a woman for him, I didn't find one.
I come from a deeply rooted, authentic family.
Do you have an idea?
Leave his passport problem to me.
Is this from the HR department?
Yes, God grant you a long life.
Set it aside.
I have a few comments on his proposals.
Long live your majesty!
Something else
No, I wish you a long life.
I'll keep an eye on them when I find the time.
What did you do about the employees I sent you yesterday?
What's stopping you?
Go now, I'll talk to you later.
What happened?
You're crazy.
We are your older sister.
And we have suffered from them.
Do you know they asked me what you play at school?
I told them you play table tennis.
"Good, they didn't kill you."
That was just the beginning.
Do you know who we are?
What tree is our origin?
Do you know what that means?
This time, we're showing you our faces.
Scorpion Leader
Small scorpion
Uncle, let me slap her in the face.
Enough of that.
Lock it again.
You've changed your mind! Didn't you say you wanted to study architecture?
You're crazy.
A Scorpio's daughter cannot work in the streets with men.
Engineering and Construction
You're going to hide us.
Let me smash her head.
No, neither a sultan nor anything else.
Confirmation, Scorpion Chief
I just beat Fatoum.
Let your brother take the risk.
This is a shame.
Not walking ducking, at least she got a slap in the face.
Show my face.
Why do they want you to go with them tomorrow morning?
What do they want?
Come here.
Walk, in front of me.
Where are you going?
Don't say a word.
Where are you going?
I told you to shut up, don't say a word.
And write "education" instead.
Or even nursing, that's fine.
Anything else you want?
You have two options.
So you know we're open-minded.
Don't say we paid you to change.
Nursing, or education
Go away from here.
We took a copy of the request.
Go, go away
Leader of the scorpions, my son.
Even the big scorpion might sting you.
Thank you, uncle, but when is the wedding?
Miss Munira
What you ask is difficult.
I can't travel, oh! Bou Khaled
I have personal circumstances.
Recommended by the minister
Difficult
Think about it again.
You can't decide now, think about it until tomorrow.
How do they allow you to work then!
Why don't they say anything?
I have a suggestion.
Ask one of them to go with you.
Girls who don't study don't travel.
This is illogical.
No shame!
You should be thankful that we allowed you to go to work.
Go tomorrow and tell them you can't travel.
Shut up, don't argue.
Listen and be silent.
James is the son of scorpions.
He is related to us.
It's true, he's stupid and he has no qualifications.
But it's a scorpion.
What are you going to do, sister?
What should I do, Fatima?
I am weak and tired.
What can I do?
There's nothing I can do.
What can you do?
Involvement the day after tomorrow
I'll call you to come according to the time the sheikh arrives.
Oh God, such a sweet laugh.
Go buy a new dress.
Go get some nice tiles, son.
I love this laughter
Brother, I invite you.
I don't want to hear a word.
Bring us tea, coffee, and cake.
Your luck, Issa, Ayesha, has made me the minister's friend now.
I'm afraid it's a rumor. Oh! Bou Khaled.
Muna is a candidate to become a minister in a new ministry in the new cabinet structure.
Muna deserves all the best.
I hope it's not a rumor.
Are you traveling for work tomorrow?
And we must all cooperate to serve this country.
Through the efforts of each one in their place, thank you.
I wish you all success.
Thank you.
Thank you, Your Excellency
Thank you.
Hello, come in.
Peace be upon you
Yes, with soap as you requested.
He is the general supervisor of the women's football league.
Ask him about Fatima's game.
Inshallah
Captain Fatima scored two goals like professional players.
Captain Fatima is talented, my brothers.
Captain, what do you think of Fatima's game?
She is a good forward player.
She's going to China.
Captain, isn't China a bit far?
God bless you.
Your sister is going to play an important match.
She was a good teacher, but I went today and asked for a transfer for her.
She is going to study architecture.
There is no difference between man and woman.
Really? I'll go make some coffee.
Where are you going?
I'm impatient to wait.
Stupid, are you stupid?
Go, say hello to her and tell her you were fired.
Go, *
Oh stupid one.
The coffee in the pot you have is cold.
They don't call all year, but when they realize you have a chain, they call.
Hello, how are you, how are the children?
What did I tell her?
I told her she'd be with us in the series.
Confirmation, and she will be the main heroine.
Look, Ali, Sholol is going to play the role of Nouf.
There's something called makeup, which can make her look younger.
Mary's role is only for twenty-six or seven episodes.
Let the chips fall where they may.
He's going to make us listen to endless lectures.
I'm afraid he might have tortured us.
The most important thing is that he doesn't find out that the producing company is yours and Hamad's.
Sorry if I'm late.
Rashid is here too.
The director and the cast are ready.
For the sake of time, folks, let's start the meeting.
Tell us your opinion.
Hamed, do you want to say something?
Frankly, I think she's the best.
You see why the maid committed suicide.
You have the idea closest to me.
It was when the maid committed suicide.
When she hanged herself from a fan, she spun around and bled to death.
She found it and called her son, "This is delicious."
And he kept kicking him until he reached the yard of the house.
It is excitement.
The police come, search the house, and arrest the mother.
This is really a very wonderful series.
You were about to do that work here on this table.
In fact, it's artistic blackmail.
My community
It's all about extraordinary events.
This is unbelievable.
Seventy murder cases.
What's with the crying?
You are known for holding people up.
Okay, Sidi Hamed, let's keep an open mind.
Let's take a majority vote.
Mr. Nasser, don't claim openness and use the majority as an excuse, this doesn't work with the critical assessment of art production.
You're involved in this because of your government job.
Goodbye
I heard the doorbell ring.
An Indian man with a bag in his hand.
He asked me, "Are you Ms. Hassa?" I said, "Yes."
I opened the suitcase.
It was a ring worth about seventy to eighty thousand.
I'm afraid the Indian man brought these things by mistake.
No, no, it's not a mistake.
Samira
Hamed's wife, the supervisor at the company.
A gift from her to you, may God bless you.
Ah, for you.
The ring is a very luxurious ring.
I never wished to have a ring like this.
God bless you, my dear.
Ah, that's it, I call it the series of blessings.
Ali and Hamid own the production but they are employees there, they cannot present it under their names.
What is more valuable than a ring?
Don't share it with anyone, keep it between you and me.
Am I crazy to do that?
Your distinguished husband
Who is called the wizard?
Just five percent, that's a little.
No, excellent, they agreed to four million for them.
Your husband will get 200,000 riyals, okay.
I thought she'd be happy to play the role of the college girl.
This is a wonderful ride, she loves a man and runs away with him on a bicycle.
The series we are going to produce is called "Coercion of Conscience".
They told me about the role in the series.
I really want to know.
Gulf series are always like this, the trend this year is blackmail.
"Hey, tell me, what's my role?"
You're my darling too, your turn is secured.
Don't embarrass me.
I'm coming, I'm coming, now.
I made all this breakfast, don't go and leave me.
This is Omar, the manager's secretary.
God protect us.
"What did Yaacov ask me to see at this time of day?"
He told him it would be a weak series and a flop.
Don't waste your money on that.
Imagine, what happened after that?
God preserve me, what should I say, I'm afraid Rashid told them something bad about the series.
Don't be afraid.
Leave it to me.
Mindless person
It's a social series.
I saw it on TV.
May God not grant you a long life.
The series on TV now is called "Blackmailing a Little Flower."
But I think the budget they're asking for is too high.
Requires a high budget
But don't forget that the producing institution is a local one.
We have his support.
What matters
Have you read the arts page?
We heard they're about to start filming the series "Exploitation of Conscience".
And a huge budget is allocated to it.
According to what was said, the series is weak.
And others said that the series consists of a school that teaches corruption.
They might stop the launch.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Hello. Welcome, please sit down.
Good morning
Good morning, hello.
I'm Eli Mounir. I'm a journalist, and I have an appointment with Mr. Hamed, if that's not a bother.
Come, please, sit for a while, because there's a meeting.
Mercury, this will allow us to use a design for the universe.
By the way, we will reach out to all the world's correspondents to get in touch with us.
This is your task.
Mercury Media Production Company
He discusses his issues in a way that qualifies him as the best output in world history.
You can believe who wrote this.
He has no shame.
Do we have a journalist like this?
Do we have a journalist like this?
A journalist must have a sense of ethics.
They work.
You think they're here to
I met the minister, do you know what he told me?
Very touching and its events are extraordinary.
The first episode will be tomorrow, we'll sit and watch it with people.
What do you think, Mother?
No problem, Mom, it's just the first episode.
Have you seen people talking to themselves, except in Gulf series?
Also, have you seen or do you want to kill your children, except in your soap operas?
My son! Art is a light weapon, it's not right to judge it by the standards of people and society from rare cases.
Mom, that's something we can do in visual arts, but theater is completely different.
My head hurts.
It seems they are imitating the Turks.
Don't judge right away, at least watch the first five episodes.
This series failed.
We don't have the right to let our children see it.
Not yet, my brother.
In TV shows worse than this.
Indeed, not anyone
This is your mistake.
For all people, in every home.
Go and gather the young people who understand these dimensions and hidden lines.
And I show them to them.
For us
Tell me, what happened?
The minister passed by with some guests.
I stood up to greet him.
We agreed to produce the series.
How will the minister bring it?
Let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleagues wrote that
I'm sharing the messages that say something nice about the series.
No, no, don't worry.
Read the newspaper tomorrow and I will publish the letters of praise from me and will mention that the viewers sent them.
Inshallah
You will be happy.
For this year
Exoneration, if they had an agreement with him.
It's the best series in the history of Gulf drama.
They all agree on them.
Okay, let's say they all agreed with them.
I'll only read the translations.
I hope they bring back the series "Exploitation of Conscience."
Thank you, Minister of Arts, for that series.
I hope they repeat it again.
When the minister's office first contacted me
I can come to collect the final installment of the serial amount.
They were right to call you the wizard.
That's not all.
The profits were rewarding, and we got our money.
And the series also failed.
The writer himself told me that he regrets what he wrote.
I'm here to propose the second part of the series.
The minister believed the press hoax I invented.
He believed in the illusory success we achieved.
He is not satisfied with the series.
It means that it's impossible to get his agreement on the second part.
I assure you that the minister himself will apply for Part II.
I can only
Thank you.
For all people
Who worked on this series?
And we congratulate them on their success.
They all deserve it.
In fact, winning those awards from distinguished festivals
Proves that there is
That's a common misconception.
You are excellent.
Sure to win the gold prize
What is he saying?
He said to the readers and the press, "You lied about me."
Ah, why not have a second part?
As long as Arab and Gulf TV festivals are artistic whitewashes.
Art wash!
I've heard about money laundering.
No art
Illegally obtained money
The series are the same.
What can we do with "one two"?
What does it mean?
We didn't sign a contract with them, they need to honor their commitment.
Write them.
Our products are exported worldwide, bread of all kinds and shapes, flat, large, small, triangular and diverse.
What did we agree on in the contract?
Two million dollars
What happened with the Australian baker?
He is the inventor of bread.
Who told you about his product?
No, they told me it's bread, but I don't know what's in it.
Bread with cheese
You call it a zipper.
Instead of cutting bread, (smooning) as you call it = Semolina bread
The inventor tried to make it easy.
Genes bread
The secret
You eat bread with the zipper.
These people make very strange things.
This soda is amazing, it's made in a way that when you put it in your mouth, it melts.
It can have different flavors: strawberry, ketchup, coffee.
Do you know how much money I've invested in this project?
Three million dollars, with patents.
Enter, Sameh.
Yes, Abu Nasser.
Yes, sir, I am at your service.
We delivered it today, sir.
Tell him "Oh, forgive me."
I was with your son Nasser yesterday, playing a football game in his team.
I agreed to the treaty.
To form a team of their drivers and security men,
And our team is also short-handed, we only have one goalkeeper, if we get injured we'll be in trouble.
I'm supposed to have fans too.
When you took seventeen players,
I didn't say anything.
Important people in the company
"Those who are not deprived of them."
Take the pie to the hospital.
Why do you upset the man?
I said he can't, he's from a well-known family, he can't run after a ball and make a fool of himself.
He can do what he wants.
But don't take the most important ones.
What should I do, Mom? I have a game for my team and I need four players.
No justifications.
Okay, what's done is done.
Hamdi came to work today, sir.
I went with him.
He said, "Put it on."
They had me stand in the goal area.
The match has started.
Then I didn't feel anything.
They told me that the ball touched me while I was not facing it.
Did you play goalkeeper before?
I played only because Nasser asked me to play.
"There is no power or strength except from Allah."
We're tired of your love for football.
From now on, oh! Nasser
No football.
You need to disband your team.
And all the sparrows must return to their own bakeries.
What are you saying?
Father, it is
I don't want to hear anything.
Please, Abu Nasser.
Listen to what he wants to say.
Taf, hsoof, but since you asked me.
Speak, what do you want to say?
Tomorrow we will have the last match of the tournament.
Don't make him sad, Abu Nasser, please, I'm crying for you.
Alright, guys
Congratulations, congratulations
Excellent, excellent, excellent, congratulations.
Oh, Sir Nasser, I'd like to speak with you for a minute, please.
Thank you, my team was on time today.
Sir Nasser, we must
You promised us a party.
Do you want me to call and book a room at the hotel?
Invite the press and journalists to come there.
No way! Rashid did that at our house.
So when my father sees the players and their success, he might not cancel it.
They won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup.
I hope so.
No, no, I saw him taking pictures with the players and he was with them, talking to the press.
It seems that Sami, the sports page editor, is conducting the interview.
Photographic image
Keep it close to me.
Take a beautiful picture.
He is happy.
Your comment on your children's, the bakers', victory made them
Full of vitality
And the effort.
Loyalty to bakeries
Sorry, Nasser, we saw the team playing with a 4-4-2 formation.
Loyalty to the bakery and the coach's plan.
Thank you, Uncle Bou Nasser.
May God protect you.
Hello, goalkeeper.
The league and cup journalists are coming to take your photo.
No, it's just an argument.
They sent their representative to conduct the interview.
They brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup.
In your hands, we encourage the youth.
I expect a bright future for them.
Okay, goodbye.
Insha'Allah, your phone will always ring, and your pictures will be in the newspapers. You are blessed with this thrown ball.
Do you know who was talking to me on the phone?
He said, "I agree to lower the price of the engines."
Ah, I've become famous now. Under every picture of me in the papers, they write: "First baker athlete."
Were you busy with soccer?
What do you say?
Since I was in school
The person who sat next to me loved football.
You say, "Why weren't you close to the ball?"
Since the person next to me plays football, I am close to football.
Being related to sports means I'm a sportsman.
So we are no longer international bakers, we have become international football.
I heard him say yesterday that he's going to the gym.
And today we meet the first athlete from the International Bakeries, Bo Nasser.
To promote football
Before the match, tell us about your prediction before you go to the theater.
The game is difficult today.
The team that controls the midfield will win today.
Ay, God willing, we are reaching out to professional player agents to develop the International Bakeries team.
His name is Saud. Listen, we want commitment.
(Yes, he wants the previous deal for the players)
It was useless.
Why did prices change you?
I gave you the international price.
Is there a part of the world from the Gulf?
No, of course not.
This is none of your business.
You just need to let me know once if a buyer from the Gulf comes.
Open your fax line.
Two of them are defenders, one is a midfielder, and the other is a central midfielder.
Look, these four players
The cost of three of them
$200,000 per player
Take them all in one bundle.
This is six hundred thousand, bring them to you for five hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Excellent, that's about African players, now, about the Brazilian player.
He's the player of the season, he alone makes one and two million dollars.
They quoted this price but then I received a fax, let me show you, wait, look, I received it from a club in the UAE.
The decision is yours.
Thank you.
"Masha'Allah, look at the muscle on his leg."
How are you?
Knee, knee
The knee is good.
We don't try to deceive, I hope there's no cross-connection.
Oh! Bu Nasser
What is this tendinous muscle?
Butcher! Make a key (rice and meat, a traditional dish).
I'm being frank with you. You're lucky to have Brazilian and African players. Congratulations, congratulations.
Thank you.
For the shop, the shop.
Insha'Allah, you will have another business.
No, no, no, only players.
I see them unloading the boxes.
Young players! Ah yes, we want them, from the forests of Africa.
Ay, why so?
Generous, open one box for him.
He is a human being like us.
The youth said, "Did you hear that?"
He said they were young.
As long as we
Why don't you give us these little gifts?
Listen, Abu Nasser, if you take his life, raise him, and bring him up with kindness, he will repay you with kindness afterward.
And they went and left him in the stadium.
Come, come, come, come
Take care of him because he's still young.
Put it in the annex, let him raise it.
Don't hesitate to ask if you need anything, all the players are with me.
Your coach must understand.
"God 2-0, we were in control of the game."
Father, he is a coach for Spain.
Don't let him go.
Successful coach
The game must be controlled.
And this one, the opposite, the way of Waquar.
We can't let your coach do what he wants.
He spent less than two months with the team.
We need to finish this.
If he were an expert in football, he would have utilized the corner players and attacked from the flanks, not the center.
Ah, he fell into the ambush.
Oh Mother, don't make my head hurt.
Kakuno Malawi must be fired.
And replace it with Shinamo's bubbling laughter.
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want him to play.
Forget Shlulu Habobo Tabo Loa
What line?
Execute the plan.
Forget Honolulu.
This shouldn't be between the coach and the team manager.
Star of the game, star of the team
You mean we're not experts in marbles.
Listen, Sultan
Let him go home.
What you take with this car, let it go by taxi.
Mind your own business.
Stay informed.
Do you see what my father did to Adel?
Withdrew confidence from the coach and sent him back.
What happened?
It's ruining the team.
Say goodbye to our team.
Mama Mama
No, he's crazy. He said you're divorced. Tell me the truth, what happened between you two?
From the first day I saw him, I told your mother, I don't like this person.
I feel he is incapable of responsibility.
Forget the waste and talking about the past.
You need to go to his father and find out why he divorced your daughter.
I don't know what to say, oh! My brother Rashid.
Why did he divorce her after all that?
It's not fair, Abu Abdullah! We need to know, we have the right to know, why did they divorce her?
Please, don't interfere. This is none of your business.
How can I not interfere? The man is waiting in the living room to find out why his daughter got divorced.
She doesn't know how to appreciate her husband and respect his feelings.
Who is Barcelona?
It's not your fault. You don't know La Liga.
Barcelona is not a lady.
This is Guardiola's team.
It means I'm going now to the man who's waiting for me in the living room.
If you go, I will go. Enough, stay here and leave him to me.
She has to leave, don't bother your head.
It was enough for her to insult Barcelona.
Messi, the magician of the ball, who scores a hat-trick in every match.
Maradona himself said that Messi would be better than him.
And your daughter, who has no life, mocks him. Listen,
Your daughter isn't a fan of Barcelona and she isn't online.
What does this mean!
Listen, perhaps God will guide you.
Don't tell me you want my son.
To apologize and to please her.
God's curse
Praise be to God, we have a lot of money.
We spend our money to educate our children.
Oh, stop it.
Most importantly, I'm looking for a Barcelona fan.
Mom, I'm not angry.
She's crazy, son. Forget about her.
Drink your tea, son.
You know, son, they are the losers.
A thousand girls wish to marry you.
Drink up, son.
I'm sorry for her.
Daughter, she left two days ago.
After a month of marriage.
What's your problem? Do you want me to fight him?
I don't want to create a problem with him.
Who told you these illogical stories!
Don't listen to her.
She doesn't know who he is.
I want more!
Her wealth alone.
Do you remember the building I want to buy and turn into an apartment hotel?
Those in Mansoura
Owned by his father, and when his son marries our daughter, I will ask him for this building.
If you can't
Talk to her sister.
Listen carefully.
A millionaire's son proposed to you.
Do you know what a millionaire is?
Opportunity only comes once.
They are so rich that they bought a palace in Spain to spend every summer there.
"So, what's the news about Barcelona?"
Perhaps the girl's family spread this rumor to prove their daughter's innocence.
Let's say the story is true and the man loves Barcelona and is loyal to Catalonia.
His wife has to respect that.
I don't want to mock the team.
Assuming this story is true.
God bless you, they called his father Abu Borgain because he owns two towers on the corniche.
Design them in a strange way, like twisted ropes.
When people saw them from a distance, they thought it was a single tower.
What do you think? All the luck is with you.
Welcome
God bless you. Take this, everything.
Thank you, my love.
But tell me, my son Abdullah, the apple of my eye, I am waiting for your reply.
No, don't worry, Noor of my eye, Umm Abdullah.
If I searched all the Gulf countries, I wouldn't find anyone better than you.
Tell them to give us their estimates for building the structure.
Alright, my esteemed master, is there anything else you need?
Ah, the family will call you.
Figure out their needs for the wedding, prepare the check, and I'll sign it.
In the name of God, God's will, in the name of God, God's will, with your permission, your excellency.
Abdullah got divorced again!
I wished for children from you and wealth from him.
Please, Auntie.
It's cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey.
Ah, but I don't understand where my mother booked us?
Where did my mother book us?
My mother says she booked us to Malaysia.
What's Malaysia's problem, then?
Light traveler
What's wrong with you? Have you ever heard of anyone crying over spilt milk?
What's wrong with you, my daughter? Tell me.
Tell me what happened, my daughter.
My mother, she is also arrogant.
Why?
She's haughty, forget about her.
You worked on Rashid when you chased her.
I'm sorry for her.
She is her mother.
Why is she sad?
What happened to her?
God bless you. Don't forget to bring us olive oil from Spain.
Ah, Spain. Where are we going?
Okay
My mother says she booked us to the Maldives.
Okay, okay, oh! [Daughter] The Maldives is beautiful too.
And she also smooths it out.
I thought you would come back happy from your trip.
What really bothers me is why they took the children?
Come! Take the bag.
What's their problem?
Why are you sad, light of my eye?
Shut up! May God guide you, you're talking to me about my son's face.
Son! Why are you stressed?
When I see the peel, I'll get sad.
Whoever bothers you dies, my son.
Leave her, divorce her, divorce her. Your father has a lot of money and there are many girls.
Shut up, and I know my son, anything small bothers him, why does he live not pampered!
My son, call her and divorce her.
May God help him with it.
Tell her three times.
You are divorced. Wait, wait, don't hang up, stay twice.
Divorced, divorced.
You're very neat.
Oh son, oh beloved, relax and don't worry too much about girls, as they say, oh son.
Oh, problem.
Just because they saw you at the disco.
Call him, call him, let me talk to him.
What do I call my mother? Let me go, he said, you're divorced, divorced.
When he divorced you, he didn't know shame.
Now if someone went to a place for the night, what would they do?
One if needed %pw.
What happened to him! What's wrong with the world!
You'll see, I'm going to his house and I'll insult him, and he won't even know who you are.
I, I, my daughter is divorced from Abu Abdullah!
My daughter is divorced!
Your daughter is different.
You buy them and sell them at Toys R Us stores.
As you feel the bitter taste in your mouth now for your daughter, and you are discouraged.
And they did nothing.
"She didn't bring you the apple peeled, let her go."
There's no problem with you calling them whatever you want.
She is still married to a man.
This is good for you, let it go to hell!
And he felt the same as he had with others.
What you accept for yourselves.
What you accept for others.
Do you know who owned the land this shopping center is on?
In a strategic location?
Leave it to God.
And also at a ridiculous price.
Out of business
I need to get Abu Sakr's approval.
Yes, I went to his office and didn't find him.
I went to his office last week and they told me he had traveled.
He has a meeting, come tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, I'm done and the problem is that I need to get Abu Sakr's approval, it's necessary.
Go to his office.
No, no, no, no, this is official business.
The right place for that, may God preserve you, is the office, not the house.
Eat again?
What will Abu Sakr fill?
Everyone has a key.
Tell me, Abu Fahad.
Do you know him?
What I know, I see it on TV and you told me you found it during Umrah.
But we don't know each other well.
Enough, that's enough.
Oh, please, you came so quickly, at least ask about the reason for this holiday.
There's no occasion for that, may God guide you.
The month is thirty days long, and he gives fifty banquets.
I suggest that you be put in the Guinness Book of World Records.
As the largest banquet maker in the world.
Frankly, who is this guy with you?
Hello, this is a blessed time.
It is an honor to honor you.
Oh God! Abu Flah
You say Abu Sakr gives a feast every day.
That's what we see.
But good Lord! Abu Falah is having a dinner tonight for a special occasion.
Today, may God grant you, your son Saqr.
God's will, may His blessing be upon you, is worthy of your honour.
He's here, welcome my son.
Peace be upon you
Why?
On this occasion, my son Sagar should go to the agency tomorrow and kindly choose the car he wants.
I waited a year and a half for approval.
I was out of work.
But when I reached him.
And I give him money.
O Allah, guide you, O Abu Sa'd.
Nothing will happen like that.
I said to him, "Okay."
He should go to the showroom and choose the car he likes.
Here are three for him.
Take it!
Take me to him.
You told me you found it during last year's Umrah.
Today, his youngest son is Shahin.
Banquet game.
This is your chance.
He returned to him and praised him.
He deserves to be well, oh! My lord judge.
"Shahin or Abu Sakr"
God bless you, thank you, oh people!
Praise be to God, the falcon is fine, esteemed sir.
God bless you
Where are you from?
The potter.
You didn't recognize me.
I can't lie to you.
Your Honor, I was with you on the Umrah pilgrimage last year.
I remember you bought a red rosary.
God bless you.
I was in the hospital.
Visiting a relative
You will be honored by meeting you.
So, Falcon, are you still wavering about entering the field of commerce, or have you made up your mind?
I'm sick of him.
Why, son of Falcon, is trade good?
You have to start, open an office and then see.
Abu Sakr
Please, Sir Excellency, say yes.
Why?
I have a gift for you, a falcon.
Full floor
And if the merchants love you and come to you, you will say no.
Who else has everything available to them today like you? Since you took the program, everything has come easily to you, a free car and the best office on the corniche.
Yesterday, Abu Abdulaziz told your father that if Suqer wants to join the business, he will make him a partner with a 50% share.
Mom, how can I balance business and university?
Oh Mama, don't force me to do something I don't like.
And you're lucky because agencies, offices, and cars are thrown at you for free.
This is an opportunity, son, for anyone who can start a project at this time without capital?
Your only capital is people's love for your father.
Be smart and invest it.
Believe in yourself, [my son], this is your once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Rowaida brought the dinner quickly.
He also reached the pickle and pepper.
Nothing is left, nothing is left, I'm afraid he'll take over the samosa agency.
Your son has a good appetite for work.
That's what I was looking forward to seeing. Do you know what he told me today?
Mom told me she wants to expand her investments.
He wants to enter the Caribbean and invest in the islands there.
And Allah protects it from the eyes of the envious.
Abu Sultan was telling me yesterday, "Your son joined the company."
She has twenty agencies, six restaurants, and is a shareholder in two banks.
**T
I thought, and Allah knows best, that they haven't opened it yet.
Oh, the one in the northern area of our office, what's there?
No, but I love him.
Thank you, and may God bless you, congratulations Abbas.
In the name of God
God bless you all.
Now there's nothing to regret.
What are you saying, man! A whole year of misery and hard work to prepare the supermarket.
What's the story! I think he passes by the shop every day.
He saw her and sent me a message, his name is Samer.
This is what Saber, son of Abu Saber, told me: He wants to be your partner instead of taking over the business from you.
He also wants to be your partner?
"There is no power or might except by Allah."
It looked like you were talking to him, right?
Who are you, my brother?
I said work!
Did you tell him you have an Iranian bakery?
When we were walking past this bakery, there was a small sign. What was written on this sign, what name was written on the sign?
The neighborhood bakery
No, I want another name.
Peace be upon you.
How's your job?
Very well, sir. Certainly, tomorrow or the day after, we will prepare the drawings for the Future Company's worker housing.
No, no, Sir Sakr is my wife Elisa. Let me introduce you to Sir Sakr, the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?
Let her take one of the company cars.
Thank you very much, you're very kind.
Even cooking now is based on science and study.
Today, someone says they want to work in business, they have money and want to invest it.
But he doesn't have enough knowledge, understanding, or study of economics, or even business.
Someone like him.
Do you think he will succeed? I don't think so, he will waste his time and lose.
Listen up, Abu Nasser!
Did you hear what these two parrots are saying?
What is this?
You have my son, Falcon.
See it.
See him today.
Your Honor, we are not talking about your son, Saghyr.
We're talking about the law.
Your son, Saqr, God willing, and I don't want to envy him, is an exception.
Thank you, he's talking about the law.
You scared me, son. He's building himself up alone.
He once gave a car as a gift.
He sold it and invested the money on his own advice.
And as Allah wills, look at him now.
Oh! The falcon is talking about ordinary people.
One of them is a falcon, and that's what Abu Nasser did with him; he took him and placed him on the path.
Saquar has business talents.
Strong economic preferences.
We can ask who his father is.
I swear I'm surprised.
"What Allah has willed" or "Praise be to Allah"
Gulf Financial Magazine in the Economic Referendum
Enter.
Peace be upon you, hello hello Salim.
What happened to him?
I swear, I don't know what to say, oh! Salim.
Yes, I remember.
The story was true.
They say the company sent a fax to my father.
And they said to him
"Son of the sad one, he couldn't bear it."
As you can see
They say that when he heard the news,
He fell in the office and the fax was in his hand.
And he had done many kindnesses to him.
As they say, I taught him archery, and when he grew strong, he shot me with an arrow.
What did the doctor say?
Pray for him, O Saleem.
I am shocked.
I can't believe there are people like that in this world.
A man who gives to the poor without letting his left hand know what his right hand is doing.
Donations from this organization are distributed to all Muslims in Asia and Africa.
But I also want you to elaborate on your goals and future steps, God willing.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, our goal at the Saqr Charity Association is to achieve solidarity in this nation.
In addition to sixty blankets for our brothers affected by the Pakistan earthquake.
Last but not least, we also now support seven poor families.
With a monthly salary of only one hundred and thirty riyals.
They're running late.
That's why I'll come to you right away.
Who is this sweet person?
This is Khalid and his wife; they are inviting us to the hotel tonight.
Father, wherever you are, wherever you are, I and you together, I am happy.
My love, (may God keep you for me)
Oh, my darling
This isn't fair. This is my source of income.
These bakeries
And took money from your account.
Five riyals for onions, three riyals for free bread.
Chickpeas
5 spaces, okay, okay.
Inspire six onions!
Come on, divers! Oh!
The captain is here and brought breakfast.
Needs men.
Please, sir.
So what?
No, no, the thing I'm asking you about is that I want to hear a yes coming out of your ears.
Hello Nora.
You're being stubborn.
Can I bear your anger?
So what's the matter?
Why are you stressed?
Noura chose a simple and plain dress.
What you say annoys me.
Oh my God, Lebanese people speak so well.
And don't say much to him.
Me too, I'm jealous of her.
The most beautiful dress for the lovely Nouara.
He flirts with her using the nickname "Nawara."
Your blood is boiling, how long for?
I paid twenty thousand and twenty thousand riyals, and some remained.
Congratulations, I hope you find another one.
Lord, with you.
Hello, have a nice day, Umm Saleh.
Hello Fadi, it seems you're busy, I don't want to make you late,
I'm at your service.
Hello, hello
Did you receive the text message yesterday?
I received it, you idiot.
Did you like the joke?
Where, did you bring the design with you?
I didn't have time to make them, show me your designs and I'll choose from them.
Honestly, you have better taste.
They're going to leave us, envy has started to work.
When he realizes that my project is good and has started to make a profit,
They say he will do a project like mine.
Design and Sewing Lounge
Women's clothing.
This is Abu Nasser who has no interest in business.
In banks
He will harm his cousin.
That's how it is these days.
Ah, ah, my cousin.
Do you know I was sleeping and they woke me up and said your cousin wants you.
Everything is excellent! Ask me anything!
Everything is alright, everything is alright.
I hope so.
You don't have any plans for a project, for example, like that?
Are you here to find a partner or something?
I heard you were stubborn, so I thought I should drop by.
Welcome
If you need a raise, we've got it.
Praise be to God, the work is coming along excellently.
Something I make, O Abu Salih.
But we're too late, they rented it last week.
Yes, they did.
Okay, see you later, goodbye.
There it is.
Sure?
And with haute couture, you know the big crisis!
What is it?
He rented a shop next to yours.
(Ad) You are jealous! (Ad) You are hateful!
Before you knew the market was open to everyone,
You must know.
If your heart opens to your cousin.
I didn't come to ask you.
You deny, lie, and mock me and yet, I found you.
I'm afraid to do my work in secret.
Go to the neighbor's shop, you want to mess with my work.
But they didn't say, "Come as if you were a snake next to wisdom teeth," You're driving me crazy.
This envy and hatred, I swear, I swear to strike you, this hatred, let me at him.
Come, you are relatives Oh! People?
Shame on you, Abu Saleh.
Leave him alone, I swear I'll hit you, with your nagging voice, man.
I'll translate it for you as you asked, word for word.
Come on, people!
Say "peace be upon him," people.
I swear, I swear, I've become nothing.
He advised me to come with a designer from the Philippines.
Don't let anyone fool you.
Why, specifically the Lebanese.
They chatter with him, laugh and mock, and they are very comfortable.
That's why Abu Saleh brought a Lebanese person.
He started saying sweet things to me and convincing me.
He bewitched me, he bewitched me with his words.
He convinced me and led me to pay twelve thousand riyals.
Two days later, I went to the auction market and found the same cabinet, its twin, for nine hundred riyals.
And make money,
Bring a Lebanese designer.
Can I meet with the gentleman? You told me yesterday that it was difficult, and today it's difficult too?
Yeah, today is tough too.
I feel that Abu Saleh has changed in these past few days.
What happened to him?
I don't know. What's wrong with that?
Abu Saleh is very psychologically exhausted after his cousin opened a shop and hired a Lebanese designer who looks like him.
For the past two weeks, the store's sales have been declining.
The problem here in Qatar is that no Qatari will open a shop unless another Qatari comes along and does the same project, opening an identical shop right next to it. Can I go into it?
No, no, no, no, he is with Fadi the designer now, they are thinking of a solution.
What's he doing now?
We sit as if we had eaten poison.
If we keep like this, I think it won't even cover the rent of the shop.
A place far from them.
This means we'll run the field for them.
Okay, thank you. How much is the discount?
No hassle, why not give away an evening dress with every wedding dress for free?
No, let's go.
What's the problem? What happened? We're going to the store next to you; today they put up an ad that with every wedding dress, you get two evening dresses for free, and they have a 25% discount.
Okay, let's go, let's go.
And now wait for two weeks, they will announce the same advertisement, buy a wedding dress and get two evening dresses free with a twenty-five percent discount.
They are fighting us.
I remember the same thing, if we let them, they'll destroy us.
Don't worry about it.
What happened to him again?
So it's definitely a challenge.
Of course it's a challenge.
Bravo, this scoundrel deserves it, he doesn't want anyone to earn a living.
If it happens, you'll hear the news in a day or two, I'll close his shop.
Excellent work, Mashallah.
Wait, wait, I'm coming, I'm coming. I'll be right there. Goodbye for now.
What's the story?
Saa'd says the shop is unbearable and no one can sit there, he says he doesn't know where the bad smell comes from.
The smell has nothing to do with this air conditioner, not at all.
His smell won't leave the shop for at least six days.
One hundred percent sure.
He came at night.
He cut the electrical wires from the shop.
Is this fair?
Now will you sign an undertaking or shall we start a case and open a file?
Don't do anything for him.
He ended his life from this life.
Oh God! Abu Nasser, something strange has happened, no one is coming to our shop.
Abu Nasser, throw the phone, throw it, there's a client coming, I'll talk to you later. This is strange.
He is in his bed, crying for help.
He says it's a psychological condition, and I'm afraid to tell him that the bank called and they need the installment.
Debts mounted up against him because of his spendthrift uncle.
What happened to him this time?
"May Allah have mercy on them, if they entered by mistake and saw Saeed the designer, they would scream in his face and run away from him."
Poor thing, he can't sleep. His eyes are wide open, and he's staring at the ceiling.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
Saud is at the shop.
His cheek was under a spell, he didn't know what had happened to him.
When a woman sees him, she's afraid of him.
I don't know, what happened to him!
Loss, loss
I have a lot of debts.
I'm afraid they'll imprison me.
And I have no evidence against him, so I can sue him.
I don't know what he did, I don't know what he did.
Forget him, he's not worth it.
Oh Lord, tell me what kind of magic you worked on him; you turned his designer into a monster, and women were afraid when they saw him.
A rumor spread.
Not good, oh! People, tell him the photography group needs him urgently.
Oh people, may God bless you, may God protect you, tell him they need him urgently, urgently.
I swear they're going to raise my blood pressure, kill me, paralyze me. This isn't fair, Sayyed Abdullah.
Alright, my dear Ahmed, don't get angry. You have heart disease, this is not suitable for you, man!
I swear I've called him several times, my ear hurts, but it's no use. Those add-ons are going to drive me crazy, drive me crazy.
You don't do anything, I'm responsible for everything!
Listen to me, I'm going to tell you a lot of things.
Episode 25, Scene 16, Ahmed, we want to finish.
Alright, I'll stop filming because the extra artist didn't show up.
What's the output?
I don't have anything to do with this. Oh! Sir Abdullah, why is he shouting at me?
My love, if you don't want anyone to shout at you,
What happened to worshipping God?
Additional late and they are in trouble.
Ahmed, I don't need anyone, my love.
Look for someone of high standing and good reputation who can convince people that he can truly be a millionaire and billionaire, not just anyone.
Please, sir, come in and wait, your request will be ready in half an hour.
Oh! Alaa, it was just me, I was calling him.
Alright, I'll do it myself in two scenes instead of one.
You are responsible and you are the production manager. You are responsible.
What are they doing now?
They will do anything, look at the manager, he is nervous and chaotic, but they will deal with him.
A person with special standards, where can I find him now?
Are you serious?
Didn't you hear what the manager said?
I know someone, God bless you with him, I hope he's suitable.
%PW Black people are free!
Saud Qanous! I remember him as Saud Al-Ruman.
Ah, when he was young they called him Saud Oxide, and when he grew up they called him Qans.
Why the cans?
I'll ask you why. Too bad for him, he used to walk around collecting bottles and selling them by the kilo.
My rich and distinguished brother, there is no despair.
His appearance is suitable, what I remember is that he is fat and bloated, not tall and not thin.
Are you sure it's appropriate?
Insha'Allah, but you have to do a good makeup for him and I guarantee he will be suitable and he is also fun.
Okay, what are you waiting for, call him.
I don't have his number.
I'll take the prince with me and go to him.
Where is Saud's house?
What is he saying?
Shut up, shut up.
Saud Kanz.
She doesn't have anyone in our neighborhood named Saud Kans.
Yes, I'm sure he's from this neighborhood, but I forgot which house.
This house belongs to a person named Saud and he lives with his mother.
Ah, right.
But this is not Saud Kanz.
This is Saud's laptop.
Sure, that's it, but it evolves over time because laptops are like bottles.
He is tall, fat, and a bit tanned.
He's a retired engineer and has started collecting old laptops. Come on, come on, come on, you old man.
Go to the vegetable market and buy it for me. Am I a goat? Where's the other one?
I don't know, son.
This is what you always wear.
I have another one. Where's the other one? Where is it?
Eid
This is what I'm looking for.
Fix and Axe Brand Oil.
Son, gray hair will come before you go, roasted.
But these days, I feel the worst.
Mother, God guide you, since yesterday I've been begging you to take me to the hospital to take you to the hospital, but you refused.
Yes, Mom, they said they would pay me.
Alhamdulillah, you're busy now instead of being unemployed.
Okay, Mom, goodbye.
I'm getting along with her, I'm going to disagree with her, I'm going to let go and relax on top.
You sit and move slowly, slowly, and the camera with you, it will move beside you.
Yes. Ja'far! Yes.
Who am I to you?
Any Aboud, this is a very well-known actor, Abdullah Al-Lama.
This is for you, my son %pw, Aboud, how are you?
How are you, Al Abd family?
Act yourself, you have to act yourself a little in front of people.
Yes, we're from the same neighborhood.
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, shut up, shut up.
I love acting, I hope they give me a role where I can slap you.
I'm not what you think, brother.
She's very sick, do you know she didn't sleep last night Oh! Brother!
Asthma Oh! Brother, may God heal you.
O Allah, heal her.
Your life is just a cup of cherries.
Oh sir, oh sir
Does he have asthma medication for my mother?
He is a director, not a doctor.
Look at yourself, listen to what he's saying, he has no point.
What's his mother's name?
He spat on you, what do you think?
Did you hear what she said about him?
She says you're extravagant, you should be more frugal.
Give me, give him, give him, give him, give him half a million to fix my car's open rubber tires.
Give him three million to bring me dinner.
I was about to ask you why you're talking like that.
Because I am fasting at the request of some people.
Let's see, my master is negligent, the production of our neighborhood, represented by high-level actors.
Now perfect, it suits the job.
Excellent, I'll help you, I don't care, do I?
Did your family buy this?
Your life is just a cup of cherries.
Take the man to this room for makeup, do his makeup, and I'll tell Salman to come to you with the costume.
Go, go, go, it's sweet.
Okay, okay
Listen, brother, keep the car with us when we're done shooting, I'll call you to pick it up.
What matters is, can someone just get me there?
Pick you up! Okay, I'll ask our driver to pick you up. Okay, thank you, brother, thank you, thank you, wait.
Okay, call your friend, the increase, call him.
Oh! People are calling Saud from the makeup room.
Why should I brush my teeth after that?
Written by veterans.
Okay, let's see?
This means me!
I didn't expect that from you.
Here we go, when something!
Here are critics of our rights.
Ah, wait.
And you need to know who you're talking to, Abu Abdulaziz.
Why did you divorce her, brother?
Divorce her and be done with it.
And we choose a thief's daughter.
No need, what do we promise?
He'll clean it, but later. The most important thing is to get ready because you're going to the fitting room to change your outfit, and we're ready to shoot.
My teeth, toothpaste is expensive.
People, the shooting of this scene has been postponed.
Why this?
I don't need tea. Oh, brother, I'm bored and my stomach is full of tea. What's this? I've been waiting for an hour, how much longer do I have to wait?
"I didn't see anything, it's a very normal thing."
May God grant you health.
They are fast.
Thank you, sir. May God preserve you.
Send my regards to your people.
Tell them Abu Abdulaziz sends his regards.
Alright, Your Honor %PW.
That was fun, wasn't it?
From me, greetings and a kiss on your nose too.
The first time someone kissed my nose.
How do they accept them on their noses?
This is a problem.
It looks like an ice cream stick, it'll cut your lip. It was a joke, it was funny.
I didn't laugh!
No problem.
Can I be an actor?
Something's wrong. What's with your voice?
My son, my son, I am very sick, I am waiting for you.
Come quickly.
Hello, Sheikh, hello.
Look here or there for yourself, man.
Listen to me, you!
Alright, I'll go now.
I see a lot of reverence.
What happened, son?
Peace be upon you, what happened to you, Your Excellency.
Let, let, let, let
And don't tire yourself, God willing you will be, Dr. Hassan come here, come here.
Yes, Dr. Hani. What happened?
Let your most honorable one rest in the office.
Don't worry.
She is the mother of all, God willing, she will come safely.
Hello, hello Your Excellency, hello.
Shut up or I'll slap you in the face.
Here my name is Abu Abdulaziz.
Call me, sir.
How are you, sir?
God damn you.
Yes, Your Honor.
Hello, sir, welcome. Please sit down.
God bless you.
Ugly face
Go with him, Sir Rashid.
I swear, if I didn't do anything to you, tell me and you'll see what I'll do to him.
Oh friend! Can I quickly find a doctor, please?
Doctor, my mother is sick!
Wait in line, it's your turn.
Listen to me, you!
Can I ask you, friend?
Oh son of Saree', I am sick.
You go to the hospital a lot, you take your mother every week, she didn't find anyone, they are good people and accepted anything.
Unlike citizens.
Don't forget the citizens.
Alright, then look for a wife in the hospital.
I love her.
My brother, but she's ignoring me.
Okay, then approach her, smile at her, look at her, give her your number with good intentions.
Nothing is wrong.
Behave yourself well.
"Get out, get out, if you don't leave, they won't provide security, so they can teach you a lesson."
No, I don't need anything.
Why, sir, you must drink.
Please.
No, thank you.
You can take her and leave the hospital.
The one who is talking to you is Fahad Al-Marzouk.
You're going to marry him, meaning you will marry him.
No, no, I need the money, clothes, and the car too. I'll take them from you.
So I can give you your money.
No, no, no, wait.
We went.
What's that, %PW Al-Marzouk!
Welcome, welcome, welcome. You are most welcome.
The light of my eyes got engaged yesterday.
I wish you had come.
They were amazed by what you did for them; it was a very elegant and private party.
One regular and one diet.
You have no excuse now.
What is this?
My mother promised my friends tomorrow at work.
You're going to take these for them!
What's wrong with her?
Noura, come here!
What is this?
He's going to take something for his friends, for trouble.
What you're considering taking will make everyone talk about you.
Give me money, tomorrow I'll buy you something classy.
I, I promised them now.
And I have to take it tomorrow.
Don't worry, they're still open. I'll go and change your clothes so we can come back with something that pleases people.
What's wrong with you! Let's go.
It has a reasonable price and very excellent quality.
Above average, not the best!
Of course there's high-end chocolate, but I'm sorry, I thought you were looking for the right price.
This is too expensive, why are you making it even more expensive?
This is incredible, look at this artistic touch.
This is called royal chocolate.
The same chocolate that is always requested at the Spanish court.
Take this one for me.
Congratulations, however, it comes with a warranty.
Welcome, welcome, rejoice!
Come here, brother. Give us some of that chocolate, brother.
What's the occasion, man?
No, Saleh Abdulqader, the one in accounting.
By the blessing of God, it's worth it, give me another one.
Quickly make some coffee.
Aunt, did you go to their wedding?
Yes, my love, I was at their wedding, it was embarrassing, disgusting. Do you believe that, sister?
Did you listen to your aunt's words?
That's why I want to throw you a wedding like no other.
No time, you only have one and a half months.
I'll organize everything.
But he doesn't let me do anything.
You're not living in the community; you don't realize how people beautify everything they have in their celebrations.
And you see for yourself.
When you buy something nice, I've seen how they praise you and your taste.
Didn't they tell you it's wonderful and amazing?
That's true, but how much did we pay?
The money we paid for the chocolate, she bought four sheep for the wedding with it.
Don't interfere, your mother knows how to do everything, give her the money and be done with it.
This means they will accept whatever we choose.
Yeah, you have very bad taste.
What's your opinion at this stage?
But excellence costs a lot of money.
Why, why, the previous one was beautiful!
What do you think about this?
This is the first time in Qatar that someone thinks of making a stage like a computer mouse.
Sorry, one minute.
He spoke about everything except the stage and arrangements, this is the place where women who have nothing but gossip will remain, just shut up.
The man is waiting for us.
Here we go to the mouse stage.
This is a very strange stage.
Latest model in twenty eleven.
We had already warned the mouse.
You can sit on the side, it's all for you.
So you have to choose, if it's Noah's Ark, you have to pay twenty thousand more, and if it's the mouse, you'll pay one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Keep your eyes open and we're ready.
You're not the first one to get married.
Take a look at yourself, are you going to get married in the Comoros? That's how we do things in our country.
And we, too, are still at the beginning.
If you don't need a platform, where would you put the bride? In a box?
Iron, paint, and some wood.
And the people are happy.
They profit and lie to us; in reality, they are criminals.
What's wrong with you this time?
Are you angry and oppressed?
If you want to get married, fine.
I'll ask about the bride's mother and tell her that Saleh is going through very difficult circumstances.
He wants to get married? Doesn't he have money for the wedding expenses? It's not suitable for me. Do you want me to call her? I'm serious, I'll call her.
We received a bouquet of flowers from the Netherlands.
In my opinion, if you put it on the table at the wedding,
Are you sure this is your first time in Doha?
Middle East bow!
Charge it to the bill.
How much will it increase?
One hundred and seventy-two, okay next.
But I don't want to see this collection at any wedding.
Do you have any tea for visitors?
Okay, they're reserved.
Your salary is higher than mine.
A problem we can't handle is about to start.
God help you, Saleh.
But you, God guide you, should have tried to sort things out.
Praise be to God, I have decided to look for a wife in any Arab country.
They say there's a wedding that costs you only two thousand dollars and you enjoy it.
God bless you, my dear.
God willing, her wedding will be next month.
You just need to decide how many cards you want and let me know.
If the invitations are sufficient, that's good. The most important thing is that people know they are invited, where, and at what time, and that's it.
You only love him, you don't love what people say.
People know the standard of the wedding from the invitations.
Tomorrow when they see these invitations, I know what the ladies will say.
Look at their wedding, if these are their invitations, they didn't see the invitations of so-and-so and so-and-so.
We didn't say anything like that, we'll order him online.
It has a cloth cover, panda skin, and a silver sheen.
No one can blame you, you can't stop me.
I won't answer a hot topic for girls, we'll send out the invitations, we'll send out the invitations!
I'm sorry for him, man.
Son, his family pressured him a lot, of course.
A man who takes money from everyone.
What he says, until he sells his car.
And he looks twenty years older, this morning I saw him talking to himself.
Don't blame my brother, he's kind-hearted. I don't know when we'll improve.
Close the door, please.
Sorry, brother.
Did you try to convince them to have a wedding according to your budget?
What does that mean based on my budget?
Why, am I living alone?
The problem our societies suffer from is the disease of appearances, boasting, and showing off.
He forces you to be sick with the same illness.
If you want to live there.
Once, I had hinted at the bride's mother.
I was persuaded by her words.
Trust in God.
In any case, tell me.
How did you get married?
And I don't want to get married, I'm not crazy.
Even if you, my brother, decide that I should get married,
I'll consider marrying a foreigner or even an Arab.
And your country!
We decided to bring in a DJ for the music.
But because Umm Nasser brought a famous singer to her son's wedding party.
He is a very famous singer, but I forgot his name.
Why are you so stressed?
It seems you don't like what I do!
It's enough that he sold his car, and every Sunday one of his friends gives him a ride.
Before, I entered the room and found him talking to himself.
I understood, now you've changed your mind.
Enough, Uncle Saleh is tired, his mother finish this thing.
I don't care about you and him.
I'm not less than anyone.
Don't joke at our expense.
Mom, it's enough, he's gone too far. My brother spent everything he had and took money from everyone.
Just be quiet.
My mother is not asking for new demands for the wedding, and my brother said he doesn't have money, so she shouted at him and said, "Here is the wedding, I don't want to get married."
Where is she now?
She's inside, and they're giving her first aid now.
He said she was much better now and they would find a room for her in the hospital.
Big problem!
Relax, my sister.
The doctor told you to wait calmly and gave you a sleeping injection.
How can I rest when he wants to make a joke out of us for good and evil.
I was telling him to buy me a CD by Abdullah Roaished, and he said he didn't have any money.
I'm sorry about your mother.
He was afraid for her.
Go to someone, go to someone and kiss her head.
And tell her I'll do whatever she wants.
I'll bring Abdullah Roeshd to you.
Abu Yusuf is kind; I don't think he won't help me.
It's not fair, I couldn't find anyone but Abu Youssef.
What happened to her!
Are you crazy, Saleh?
But the minister kept him because he was an old man and, moreover, he was disciplined and honest.
Do you want my opinion? If you tell him the same thing you told me, there's a good chance his heart will stop.
Yes, I did.
That's because of the financial crisis you're going through, and you love to ask Abu Youssef for money, of course, from the ministry's funds.
And Allah knows when you will return it to Him.
And when the accountants came and asked him about the money,
Of course, there could be a problem.
No one will know, and he will know how to deal with it.
It's up to you, the man in his office, and you're responsible if anything happens to him.
I'm stealing in my last days!
Their aunt doesn't call it stealing.
On the first floor.
In, in a white bottle wrapped with blue ribbon and has a circle with a dove wing picture, bring it, bring it.
Alright, Uncle Abu Youssef, me, if I didn't have the difficulties I have,
I'll answer you everything.
They call me Abu Yusuf.
I came in the last of my days.
And corrupt me, O Thursday.
Salih, Salih.
Okay, listen to what I'm saying. If someone else had done that, they would have gotten a slap or something worse. Oh, oh, oh, Khalid.
Salih, Salih.
All the methods I've tried are useless, Uncle Abu Youssef, I'm drowning.
I can't change the past of my marriage.
And you don't know them, they are all bald.
What's wrong with you?
No, no, the other one, the one with the narrow face, the one with the narrow face.
In the drawer, in the drawer.
My uncle Abu Yusuf, the stairs are full of computers, which one do you need?
The can with the picture of a scary man.
We booked two rooms for hair and makeup, just for us.
And from tomorrow.
We brought Abdullah Roaished and his band.
You'll see, my love.
No, I won't tell you.
Will this be the success of the season?
We were the first people in the world to use it.
Mom, mom,
Goodbye
There is no god but God.
My son, don't forget to read the Mu'awwadhats when you enter the dance hall.
The women here have evil eyes.
I told you before, she's amazing.
The best groom ever, God bless you, I don't want to envy you.
Mum mum, the police are knocking at the door.
I was wrong to obey you, O God.
It's not fair, today is my wedding day.
The people who are coming to choose arrived.
And now solve it, I'll be imprisoned, oh God.
Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf!
It's still early.
But that wouldn't be fair if that happened!
The company offered a contract worth three million, two million of which was just for building materials.
Wrote a memo to the minister.
We know there is corruption, but it doesn't go this far.
It seems you're not living in this world.
Tell me, what did the minister say to Uthman?
And why didn't our supervisor object? They say he was in agreement!
As far as I know, I swear to what I know.
Where is the literature?
Right has become wrong and wrong has become right!
Oh Saad, are you sure the minister has raised it? Oh people, what has happened to the world?
Just fire him!
Something else?
Owned by the minister's sister.
This girl is in a relationship with the minister.
A strange world
What's your problem? Don't you know who she is?
This new employee that the minister hired to replace Osman Al-Ghareeb.
Go, go, go.
What do you want to do, Saleh? Object to the minister!
You're crazy!
Listen to me, man.
We have children, we want to live.
We want to live.
What happened?
Here he is, standing next to the elevator.
This is the reward for honesty and integrity, brother Saleh.
I hope we can do something for you, brother.
Praise be to God, praise be to God for everything.
What's wrong with you, Saleh?
These are among the strange things we see before us in this world.
We see things that are unbelievable.
I'm at your service.
I want you to go to the supermarket after work and get some vegetables for the salad.
I'll try, see you later.
Who's driving my sister home?
And she is sitting in the front, laughing and talking, who is she?
This is my university colleague, what's wrong with him driving me home? No problem.
Oh my God, I can't believe it, why are you so old-fashioned!
What do you say?
Don't you hear what I'm saying?
You're old-fashioned.
This is old and new, right and wrong!
Right is right and wrong is wrong.
Life has evolved, and we live in the age of technology.
The age of international variables that make up the world, and no one can keep up with them.
The more I live, the more I see!
What's my fault, Munira, against my interest to be nervous and angry?
This is one of the things seen in his day.
Tell her he's tormented.
Life doesn't go the right way.
Don't worry, come tomorrow for lunch.
Let me sleep to rest.
The leader is not angry with you.
Is the leader not angry?
No, I'm not in a hurry. Go wash your face and eat lunch.
Okay, my love.
I'm very excited to meet you on my first day of work.
It is an honor to honor you.
Of course, of course.
Of course, I know you don't need anyone to remind you of the principles of the job.
However, at the same time, it is extremely important.
To remind you of some of the values and principles you uphold.
In the public interest
This is what your honor should be.
We all have to work.
Lottery is very necessary, Your Honor.
To be thieves
Thank you, thank you all.
What I also want to say
And I'm warning you from my first day at work,
There is one employee among you.
From the truthful, honest, and loyal, and from these bad things,
Just doubt.
There is a loyal employee.
So we can take the necessary legal action against him in our ministry.
No, the thing will be as you wish, sir.
Praise be to God, we are all thieves.
As you wish, I'll say it in front of and behind my colleagues.
Where is Khalid?
Yes, Your Honor.
Khaled, you were very, very famous, God bless you.
Alright, Your Honor
Your Excellency! You know how to choose.
God willing, He will guide you.
Why did you let the devil control you?
You should thank God it was only about honesty.
Mom, why is Dad in prison?
Be quiet, my daughter.
No, no, I won't do that again.
Mom, why is Dad in prison?
Alright, stop it.
This means he became honest.
It's wrong to say that your father is trustworthy.
Is this a costume?
Your whole body is covered.
What do you see people doing?
And I hope, when you're looking for a job, someone won't take you when you're like this.
Is there a respectable lady who covers her body and beauty.
She covers her chest, she wears it even here, she's choking herself.
I'm empty, my son.
And I bought her long shirts and pants that reveal her midriff above the navel.
But it's a hopeless case; it doesn't want to be on the right track.
Here I am telling you!
You'll only blame yourself.
We ask for the hand of your daughter Sarah for our son Rashid.
One of us is busy right now looking for the right man for his daughter.
Stay, Rashid, my son, I tell you.
He is a very good man.
He doesn't stop drinking.
He's drunk twenty-four hours a day.
Intoxicated, tipsy, and heavy all day.
And don't ask about the chaos.
He is well-mannered.
And I tell him that he is a hypocrite.
And how about theft?
That's what I expect from him, and how is it with drugs?
Clear, finish. Give me five riyals, if you can get his eyeball, I'll hold a contest for it.
In any case, Abu Sara, we have come to ask for her hand.
You know how to have fun and hang out with friends.
We know she came from a good family.
With the boy's blessing, with the blessing, that's how life works, with the blessing.
I'm drunk.
I can walk.
Come, let's go.
Goodbye, goodbye.
Okay, call Dad to come pick you up.
Why do I need to call him?
So he can come and pick you up.
Where is he?
Look, he's there, hanging out with a drop-dead gorgeous blonde.
Really, your father walks straight, he enjoys it.
Hello my dear Betty Mona!
Majid! His name was Abdulaziz.
Ah, right.
You're confusing me, my daughter.
And you know since the establishment of the State of Palestine with its capital in Jenin in the year one thousand nine hundred ninety, after signing the comprehensive peace agreement with the State of Israel,
Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure, and siege on it.
The latest is what the Israelis and their Arab friends have raised of accusations against the Palestinians.
They smuggle plastic knives through the tunnel.
Especially Article Two, paragraph A, which states that the Palestinian people must cut their nails every day.
We are now entering the crucial meeting.
Mr. Cheap
When Israel agrees to the establishment of a Palestinian state,
Oh man, what are you saying, man? You're ruining our reputation, leave me alone!
Please
Sorry, Sir Tiger, sorry, Mr. President.
Can you give me a chance to speak?
We are fully committed to the comprehensive international agreement.
What did the Israeli representative say?
To find any solid thing, stone or plastic, as a commitment.
Dude! Even our houses!
What's her name among you Gulf people?
In Palestine, everything is made of wood.
American companies, according to the agreement, will make us cars out of wood.
And all the doors of our houses are made of thermally treated wood.
We don't need speeches.
Don't change the subject.
Mr. President,
This is a very crucial point and I would like to vote on this matter because nail growth is a violation of the agreement.
If you agree, raise your hand.
But I had a very strange dream.
So you can control the students.
I'm done talking to him.
This is the fourth school you'll work on tomorrow.
Because I established my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The boys follow him and tear his clothes, and he doesn't do anything.
How many times has he come to me without a drop.
The school principal told me.
Rashid is kind and we don't want him to lose his job.
Boys are throwing chalk at him.
They are dragging his gutra in the break in front of everyone.
They said that this teacher is very indecisive and will ruin everything.
Should I tell them the ketchup story?
Come here, Mary.
What's the story with ketchup? This is new, no one told me!
They poured an entire bottle of ketchup on the chair.
He came and sat down.
He knew nothing.
When he saw the children laughing at him in the schoolyard.
Alright, stop it.
By the way, the school principal you'll be working with tomorrow called me.
Alright, no problem, we'll give him a chance.
Because I'm waiting to tell you.
The era of softness and weakness is over.
Oh my life! Oh Abdullah!
Rashid is different from Hisham.
And what is the need to remind you of the important educational saying?
You are a graduate of education, and so am I.
And we all know the text,
The teacher is the son of the first grade.
You will see Mr. Rashid the strong.
If anyone does wrong,
He's going to face problems.
When you start talking, he just said shut up.
I'll show you how I'll tell him.
Who among you mocked me and said just shut up? Who?
You're the one who told me to shut up!
No, it's not me.
So close to you, you!
Come, I'll go to the market.
And tell him that Mr. Rashid fired me.
I don't want to see your face here, you hear me!
What do you think of my fear?
You should not only be like your first day, but you should be like that all year round.
Be aware of the consequences.
If you hear someone's voice
While I explain or speak
You know what he does.
Nervous, you know what nervous means?
Means nervous.
Did you hear what I said or not?
I heard it too.
Leaving the classroom.
Go to the school principal.
Take your stuff and get out now!
Take what you need.
They're fine.
It appears he's still being watched.
No, sir, we didn't see it.
In any case, strawberry ice cream with yogurt is very nice.
My beloved Abdurrahman.
Everyone makes mistakes, and humans are fallible.
Joke, sonny.
But the most important thing is that your father doesn't know the story!
I don't want that, I want the chocolate in my bag.
Okay, where is your bag? Where is your bag? Where is your bag?
In the classroom
I'm at your service.
He says he's happy with you.
You don't know how to distinguish between a rich boy and an ordinary boy.
Misfortune, how does it resemble green or red?
Come here, where did you go?
In the bathroom.
Are you still in the bathroom?
Knock on the door quickly and tell him the first class started half an hour ago, quickly.
I was before all of them, one juice and one chip.
I took him before each of them, I wasted their time. My friend Abdurrahman and anyway, this is very healthy.
Okay, now go to the store and get a PlayStation DVD from there.
So what do we learn from this story?
That man
He must have morals.
This is a PlayStation thing, he also told me to bring the whole PlayStation at once.
Okay, do you want anything else, my friend Abdulrahman, my friend?
Nothing so far.
We learn from the story.
You all know that I'm leaving this week because I've been accepted to graduate school.
I thought I had to submit the party file before I traveled.
How can I pick you up in the afternoon? Abdurrahman told me, and I don't know where he wants to go, but he didn't tell me what time!
As long as my father returned and didn't understand anything, praise be to God, I felt relieved and reassured.
Let's say I found out about it this afternoon, and he got upset and told his father, "No, no, no, it's a disaster, no, no."
Hello, my friend Abdul Rahman.
God help you.
What he does is a matter.
Do you like it, do you like it like this.
Today or tomorrow, we will learn a new lesson in science.
Peace be upon you.
Thank you.
I need water.
What did you ask? You didn't ask anything. I'm at your service.
Teacher, teacher. How can you ask water from the teacher?
"Which teacher brings water for a student? Are you his tea boy? This incident will not go unnoticed, I will write about it in the report."
And you're mocking me too, you're mocking me.
Don't raise your voice or shout at me, do you hear me or not?
How much is this enough for?
Excellent, how many cars is that?
Four to five cars.
Excellent, this is excellent, beautiful, excellent.
What is he saying?
As you can see, he will park his car in front of our houses at the expense of our comfort.
Don't remind me of the days of Abu Nasser.
Abu Nasser is finished.
He studies abroad.
Excellent, you broke the table.
Don't worry, brother.
Why?
Are you different?
Change your behavior towards me.
Me or you?
We didn't say anything. Oh, brother!
What is this?
Listen, leave everything as it is, it's better for you.
Am I not scaring you, brother?
What does it mean, there's nothing and I want to finish you?
What do you say?
Instead of what, what do they call it?
It seems you want.
You want this, as you wish.
Faster, faster.
Is this good?
It's not what he likes, that's not fair!
There's no authority over the live one.
We're coming to Abu Naif's uncle's to discuss, not to shout.
Who is this Rashid doing as he pleases in the neighborhood?
Did you give me the opportunity to speak?
Alright people, let's be quiet and listen to what Uncle Abu Nayef has to say.
Now, this good-for-nothing loser is playing with your nerves!
Leave it to me.
If you hadn't cared for his face, he would have stuck to the umbrella he made.
The game is played by its players.
Is this okay?
Goodbye
I haven't seen anything so far.
Do you know he owns a jewelry store now!
That's why I see him here wearing all these earrings and bracelets.
God bless us.
Go for a walk, are you going to stay in the heat?
I can't believe that Rashid, who was so simple and poor, has become like this.
Became the vice president of the Global Education Center.
Let him tell you, let him teach you. You are a teacher and he is a teacher, but look where he is now and where you are now.
Don't mention it.
No problem, Abdullah.
I'll tell you the secret.
The teacher has come, the teacher has come.
Teacher, I didn't do anything!
Teacher, don't you know who he is?
Yes, Adabi, I know who he is.
Here I'm telling you, we won't get a chance as good as this.
I, am looking for a job! This is funny, I swear this is funny.
No worries, the job is in my pocket.
Thank you for everything you've done, thank you, thank you.
Convey my greetings to him.
Your mother sends you greetings. May God protect you, I'll tell her, he sends his greetings.
Take care, my love, in God's trust.
What more do you want, your brother is going to be a minister, don't believe it, my son!
Oh mother, we will do it, we will do it to a high standard.
Son, if I worked with him, would they say anything?
He's just giving it to you like that.
This thing is good, right?
Confirmation! This is automated, without any doubt.
My beloved, please let my dream come true.
Before your dream, my dream.
He is building a tower between the Corniche towers.
Come on, let's go. What are you waiting for?
Thank you, thank you, thank you
You can do it, Abu Saleh.
It seems your friend is upset.
It looks like that, brother.
You can do it, Abu Saleh.
He thought he had stopped, took the mobile and gave it to Abu Saleh.
Look, there's something behind this, and it's one hundred percent that Abu Sultan holds a grudge against him.
His relationship with Abu Saleh was not good.
No, Abu Sultan won't do that unless he intends to do something else.
Really, to this extent?
Open the car door for him!
Finally, he works on opening the minister's car doors.
Oh my son, don't break my heart, don't break my heart.
For your information, all the stories we hear in the cafes happen in the country.
I can't believe what I'm hearing!
My heart stopped, my heart stopped.
I'm afraid, my daughter, that women are starting to talk about him and not mention the kind dish collector. She's spreading rumors about me among the women, my daughter.
Say something, Abu Sultan, speak. I'm shocked, I'll fail.
I know what I'm doing, please.
Mind your own business.
Manira, I'm playing it cool.
By opening the door for him, that's the beginning of the plan in my head.
I deserve to become a minister, not him.
Let me work, I have a plane.
Let them allow him to be expelled.
Yes, plan.
He should have trusted me from the beginning.
They told me we're appointing him minister because he was appointed two months before me.
Because I'm very sure he'll be fired from his job.
Magic may be undone.
What is it?
What's this again?
And at every event he attends, the photographer will take many pictures of him until his photo becomes very common in the newspaper.
And he shits until he floats to the surface.
Sure?
Wait a sec. Let me work against him and you'll see.
On the contrary, Your Honor,
Of course, sir.
So will you inform me,
Did you thank him for the lamb? In any case, the meat was very delicious.
The man is outside, go see him.
Don't be silly, people want to elevate you and you want to humiliate yourself.
Minister only, enter, enter.
No, no, no, don't take my picture. But His Excellency the Minister, please take a picture of His Excellency.
Take another one.
Oh brother, I really liked your plan.
I want you to take it to her.
Picture, picture, picture.
Yes, he is a minister, he has one too.
Okay, I'll tell you, wait!
Go to the second-to-last page.
Look how big his picture is with the groom.
Say: "There is no god but Allah!"
Yes, every day has one or two pictures.
As you say, he is a social activist. Goodbye.
Everyone loves you, but I don't know what's happening to you.
He is everywhere.
They are envious, they envy you. But the tree that bears fruit is the one that gets stones thrown at it.
Take me to the market!
Aren't you ready?
Peace be upon you
Hello, and peace be upon you, hello.
You are very famous.
Yes, your name is Abdulaziz Abdullah, right?
This is my husband.
How many times have I told you?
Three hundred and fifty
For this famous person,
You're home today, is something wrong?
Leave me alone, I have a headache today, my head hurts, I feel pain all over my body and my diarrhea is getting worse.
I'm tired, really tired. It's been a month and I'm still dealing with it.
Let me rest today.
Hello, Umm Sultan.
Can I say something?
Oh woman! I want him to take me.
It seemed like you liked it.
You saw for yourself what fame does!
We knew. Thank God you're convinced.
Frankly,
Your minister is worried, it seems he loves this story.
My brother Saad sent me.
No, I didn't follow any activity and I didn't read the newspaper, I don't know.
We served you, goodbye.
If God wills the end of an ant, He gives it wings.
Peace be upon you, man, is there a conference here at the hotel tonight?
Wedding?
No problem, do you have any events like a party, birthday, or wedding?
I don't know, but you can see the hotel behind us.
Ah, in a hotel behind you, right?
Is it possible for me to leave you in the car while I go into the hotel to ask?
Go, go, go and take your time. Go and ask, go.
O Allah, help everyone.
Does this minister let us sleep or rest?
This means he didn't find a party, wedding, or problem to throw himself into.
He took him to the Seventeen Thousand Hotel and didn't find anything. He has bad luck like his face.
Shut up, hello.
What I got him for his birthday, or something.
Go, you might find the second text!
In every case, he has a hundred pictures.
Let's not sleep! Let's not get tired, oh! Brother.
Oh man! The editor of the newspaper says the first thing is to set up his picture and then set up the newspaper.
She said my children participated in a contest featuring a picture of your husband, the minister.
One asks the other, "How many pictures of the minister are there in the newspaper?"
And the winner gets a prize.
The story isn't like that. You need to come to the café and listen to the comments every day about his pictures in the newspaper. They talk non-stop.
Wow, a collapse is im-mi-nent.
As they say, a butterfly, if God wants it to die, approaches the light.
People will push you and congratulate you.
He became one of the most famous people in the country.
No problem. Who is he?
You ruined my position.
May God bless you and bless her.
She said that we all got married except for poor Amal; she's the only one among us who hasn't married.
This is my destiny.
It's not my luck to get married.
And I forget about marriage.
God will take care of whoever was behind that.
Do you see those distinguished people sitting over there?
Yes, what's wrong with them?
Do you see the guy playing with his hair?
Is this a boy or a girl?
After my father died, meaning he was murdered.
You saw him, he's doing well, right?
It's not right to leave the servant alone with him.
Go and make tea.
I'm getting tired of talking to my mom. But she doesn't have just one maid, she has two for him.
I've told you a hundred times not to interfere, my son Khalid is not your son.
The only problem you have is Kholood, the maids, and the maids and Kholood.
Mom, this isn't good. Kholoud spends twenty-four hours a day with the maid and doesn't like anyone else.
Exit. I want rest, I want sleep. How?
Oh my God, Saud, your brother Khalid has become a girl.
Wait a bit, if I don't tell my father about you.
Stay with me, I want to tell you something. What's going on with Khulood?
Saoud says Kholoud is showered and acting like girls. What happened? What happened?
Whisper, whisper, whisper! Oh, Saud!
Khulud is putting makeup on his face! It's just a little makeup. A child saw a makeup palette and played with it.
I saw a very small dot, barely visible.
He is kind, gentle, and tender.
I will sin with you.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
I asked you last time, Saad, what do you want to be when you grow up, and you didn't tell me. Now tell me, when you grow up, what do you want to be?
And you, my sweet Khadija, my love Sa'ad's darling, do you want to be a desk? And what do you want to be?
This year we're going to London like last year.
Yes, contact Shaki in Bahrain.
Tell him to bring Susan, Khaleda, and Fahda.
And say hello to Samora.
"I seek forgiveness from Allah"
Today, my father told me to choose.
Well, do you want me to build on the land above the sea or the nearby land?
I said I don't want to choose.
I can live with you, my love, anywhere.
Thank you, my love.
And you taught me how to hunt?
Wow, Amal, I want to open my eyes and tell myself that you graduated from university.
It doesn't seem to be a men's perfume.
I don't know, but it has a very strange smell.
Oh my God, what's wrong with me?
The way you speak has become feminine.
You forgot you were men.
And do you wish to speak to people this way outside?
I can't believe it! Oh, Khalid.
Alright, get out of my room!
Alas, eternity!
I disappointed myself.
Okay, don't hurt my feelings. I swear, I'll tell Mom.
This is my son, and I know him well.
Alas for you, Khulud, light of my eye. I wish all children had the tenderness of his feelings and emotions.
And when you see a kind and sensitive person, you say he's gay.
Shame on you, it's wrong of you to say such things about your brother.
Alright, alright, you made a big fuss about nothing.
Son, he's wearing a very nice perfume. Now, what's the difference between men's perfume and women's perfume?
Here I'm telling you, don't say that in front of your father.
I have.
I'll ask her for you, but be careful so that Mohammed doesn't find out.
How did these girls meet?
It's forbidden for a beautiful girl like her to do such a thing!
Don't look at it, don't look at it!
I'm afraid he'll feel like something is tied to him.
Ease up on yourself.
I know you're seeing the widespread adoption of Bluetooth these days.
I'm waiting for Saad to come.
How are you, Saad?
May God protect you.
We were waiting for you, we didn't play cartoons.
Oh, why?
Well, do you want to drink something?
I've seen him sleeping here in your apartment for two days!
Because of the Bluetooth story.
Yes, his older brother threatened him.
I'm afraid of him.
Don't try it, I told you not to try it.
Seek refuge in Allah from the devil, my son, for my sake.
I have made a reservation in advance.
I'm leaving. How can I face people? I can't!
What are you going to tell your father?
Tell him anything.
Oh, these kids are just causing trouble.
This is the end, mother.
I remember when Khadija was little.
Of course, this is the result.
Alright, please get out of here.
Truth always hurts.
The jar broke.
I couldn't live in Doha.
I can't face people.
My mobile is out of order for a while.
Are you trying to influence me, Amals?
You are a girl and you spend your whole day at home.
What should I say, being a man who meets people outside the house all day long?
Difficult, Amal
I cannot live spending my days and life with my head always down.
A father feels for a while that something is wrong at home and that there is a change.
How long has my father been absent from the events happening here at home?
Sometimes I blame the father and sometimes I don't.
What I criticize! Oh, how I lean towards remembering his expertise and dedication to his work, so that we can live with dignity among people.
And I blame him.
When the father leaves the house, the responsibility of the children falls on the mother.
We don't want to relive the past now.
Does the father know or not?
But I am ready to
Leave the Bluetooth on.
But I don't want to.
I don't want to see the shock in my father's eyes.
Very quiet.
Anything or Oh! Hope,
He knows how to put us in our place.
It's much better to know it from him than from someone else.
Alas, we have come to that in our home.
Due to the explosion of a dirty bomb called Khalood in it.
And customs and traditions.
You will find them arrogant.
They closed their ears to him.
And they don't want to listen to me.
They listen to only one voice.
It's filth and perversion.
They manage all the good.
What comes to your mind?
You suddenly decided to study abroad.
We can say only, "God help you, my son."
God help you.
The people coming to get the gift are not the ones going on a trip.
You are correct.
This is the law.
But every rule has exceptions.
Amal, come with me quickly.
Did his son see her?
I can't hear anything.
Abu Saad!
Abu Saad
Abu Saad, what's wrong with you?
Father, what's wrong with you, father?
Father!
Don't worry.
You are a wonderful person.
And any man who wants to marry you.
I didn't divorce you because of anything wrong with you.
I divorce you.
Because it's impossible.
I accept my grandfather-in-law to be.
I'm like your brother.
Salih,
You're here every day.
Before you come, always.
I was hidden underground.
That was before we were underground.
This is very strong language, can you handle language like this?
You get a thousand and two hundred, you make a lot of money!
Say "Mashallah"
Go, go.
You've only been here for seven months. Just stop there and take me home.
What shame and what a scandal! Every time he takes me to someone's house, he asks their driver, "How much do they pay you?" Nothing satisfies him, and today he asked for a raise.
This driver is making fun of you.
He came barely seven months ago.
My son annoyed me, annoyed me.
Send it to him, so we can get rid of it.
Send him back and get someone else!
Tell your son, I don't know what's behind this word! I don't know what he's taking from time, money,
And driving training. Return it, we're done with it!
The first time I came here to my house was six months ago.
Okay, I'll say something new to you.
Petrol is now 114 riyals, before it was 50 halalas or 5 riyals per liter. Everything has become expensive, O boss.
Open your mind and listen to what I say!
How much was the salary I was paying you when I first came here?
You gave me seven hundred.
You're still new, very new. You've been here for only six months and a salary of eight hundred is a lot.
I need money.
These drivers you're talking about are old-school, you're new to this.
This is seven hundred now eight hundred.
Go!
He said, "I'll give you a raise of only 100 riyals."
And what's the use of three hundred?
What I told you is right?
No, no screen. I'll cause a problem when I escape.
No, I'm afraid of screens.
Who escaped from their sponsor?
Why are you afraid?
Due to the past actions of these people's ancestors.
Give them a salary of six to seven hundred. Do you know how much they get?
How much is your salary?
Where's your fear?
Not afraid.
God is his guarantor.
I woke Nasser up and told him to go and see them.
No one.
He even stole the mobile phone I bought for him.
What have you done?
Something you did!
They did everything they were capable of, they took his passport and put it with them.
Alright, you may go! Oh, sir, you are excused.
Here we see it everywhere.
This problem, this problem.
And after all that, they fled.
They left us in a problem and caused us harm.
I told you to return it.
But do you think I'll let him go?
I will find him no matter what.
He will come back, meaning he will return.
I'd rather pay for his ticket and send him home than let him stay here and make money.
I'm done with him, I hope I find him.
A man has just entered, no one will buy now.
At the beginning of the game, you seemed nervous, as I noticed.
But what are they afraid of? They're afraid our team will concede goals.
We need more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were scared; you were afraid of the team we were up against.
I'm not afraid of the opposing team, I'm afraid of our own team. I'm afraid they won't score more than three.
This is our team's level, I know it. I'm talking about our team's level.
That's a lot of trust from you.
The opposing team has nothing.
Great! The foxes have scored a goal now, you're ahead with the first goal.
Where are you going?
Going home.
Do you have a car?
Come with me, I'll drive you.
Thank you, man.
When you try, you can't break our team!
Your Honor, the match has just started and the league has just begun.
Did you hear what he said?
He said, "A very big problem."
Mahmoud, bring us tea!
Now my friend is coming to pick me up to go to the stadium, quickly.
Take it, my friend Sajid.
Take it, sir.
Was he led to himself?
Yes, he is the Indian young man.
Yes, man, he's crazy about football.
Don't talk like that about my team, the Foxes.
They are winning, they are winning.
Come on, Sajid, come on, Sajid, hurry up, the match is about to start, hurry up. Take water with you, they will play today.
Dear viewer, we have one of the most famous fans of the Foxes club, whose name is Fox.
They say you beat them because they were incomplete.
What they say, what they say is not true.
What's missing? Each team has a dozen players.
Even if there wasn't one or two, it wouldn't change anything.
The big fox is clever.
This is our best fan.
Alright, on the occasion of the win... Oh! Fox, any last words you'd like to say to the foxes?
All words stop.
When they say the name of foxes.
His name is high in the sky.
This is a good fan.
Listen to me, brother.
He's estimated to be this excited.
Here we go! Oh, beautiful!
Where is the Indian man who is a soccer fan?
What I've seen since then.
Oh man! He's a big star now, he doesn't come here.
I saw the man two days ago and didn't recognize him. He was sitting in a cafe in Village called Starbucks or something similar.
I remember this boy, he came and sat with us at the cafe and didn't have money to buy a cup of tea.
He gave the boy twenty riyals as a tip in front of me.
Why is this happening?
Oh my God! [A man] sits with important officials in the club, they help and do everything he wants.
Can I say something, Fox?
Yes, Uncle.
My uncle says: Whether you go or come:
I don't know why you support such a bad and weak club.
This team of foxes is my heart's team.
When you open my heart
You can catch a lot of foxes in it.
I heard the poem, my lord, that he wrote about governance.
We had a match against them.
Please, please fox read, read this poem, read, read.
My uncle. May God have mercy on you, who knows my secret.
My soul bears great pain.
She never slept at night.
You know we're the Fox Fan Club.
Can you tell me the winner's name so I can be the first to know?
Here we will have a press conference, and God willing, we will announce the name of the winner.
Whoever spends
The famous Foxes, this fan who was honored today by the club's management with a generous, rare, and terrifying gesture.
Sure!
Congratulations, Fox, for this beautiful honor and this wonderful gift, of course.
What do you think? Is it a pen or a watch?
Behold, this is my father.
This is a sign.
I'm telling you, it's him.
We should notify the police.
Where are you going?
Fans, all, all, all the fans.
No, no, no! Oh! Son, this isn't him, he just looks like him.
I'm telling you it's not him.
You're late.
I don't know the game schedules, brother.
How can we avoid meeting him now?
We're just waiting for the Foxes to play their next match.
Here he is, here he is, I see him.
Okay, let's follow him.
Oh brother, I came late...
Here he is, here he is, here he is, here he is.
Go after him, follow him, follow him, go after him.
The problem is that we're not sure if it's him or not.
I'm telling you, Father, it's him.
I say it is right and wise for us to go to them and ask them to tell us, "Where did the driver you have come from? How did he come to you? When did he come to you?"
Dad always complicates things.
We quote him; I am sure of it.
Earth, may the Lord preserve. Yes, it is mine.
Yes, it's registered in my name, yes.
Also the other land next to it.
Tell your father that Abu Abdurrahman Al-Subji says hello, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
No, no, please. But I thought we were wrong. Oh, my son! We met a friend and thought you were him.
God Almighty created many people who resemble each other.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Your Honor, thank you.
No, no, God bless you. Sorry, sorry, and thank you, thank you.
Sure, with your permission. Sorry, I'm here to help you. Goodbye, may God bless you, goodbye.
And you say you're sure!
I don't know what your father is doing! I'm very worried.
What have I done, my father?
Either, either, either, or else, or else, when I was walking, the bag strap got caught.
And try to fix it now!
Go to your room, go.
I hope nothing bad happens.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Alright, try to understand your laptop!
Before my father knows?
Shattered into a million pieces.
Okay, Mom, let's buy something like that as soon as we can.
Before my father comes.
Oh Mama, please.
You have your father; when he gets angry, he goes crazy.
Go to your room and don't come out.
I'm going to do something.
By mistake, he hit the vase with his bag, and it fell and broke.
Mom, I'm worried about his account.
I don't know where this is.
No, no, no, no, his father is crazy.
Why are you doing this to the boy, my daughter?
Scaring him and terrifying him, do you want the boy to go crazy or fly?
Can I say something, my daughter?
Where do you say the boy went?
Okay, if he comes, I'll call you.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Auntie, I know where Waleed is.
Come with me, that guy is eyeing us.
Let's go. Come on.
He is here.
Oh grandma, I don't want to go home.
Hide me with you.
I didn't see the vase.
I share what I know.
This is how your father, God guide him, scares you.
Come with me, son.
Don't worry, my son, as long as I am in the house. Don't worry, my son. Oh!
I have the solution.
We didn't say anything. Oh! Abu Walid.
Please, I beg you, Abu Walid.
This time, I'll forgive you.
What did you find in the house?
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where is he? Where?
Alright, son. Oh! Waleed, your father isn't going to get you anything.
Are you sure, Dad?
Ah, yes, my son, yes.
Will you leave it here? I'm afraid one of the children might hit it and break it.
He asked me and told me that I need you to bring me one like the one you brought me that Walid broke.
He wants the same one as before. I went and found this guy, the last one in the shop. He's very lucky. Where are the kids?
In the room, I studied.
Alright, take care of her.
This game only, and I quit.
Wow
Alright, let's study!
Abu Bas is a teacher and a gamer.
Dad, please don't tell Uncle.
Father, don't tell your brother. Father, this is the last time I swear.
Haden called him.
And you especially. Did you insult me, your coffee friend?
I'll see if I can talk to my brother about you!
Okay, I won't. Here's my phone in my pocket if you want to check.
Daughter, why didn't you take him to the doctor?
May God guide you, my mother.
It's scary to death because he's always stepping on it.
My son, the torment of this boy.
Endure
Mother, where is my commission? I don't see it with you today.
And she went with her.
My sister doesn't like abayas.
Oh oh! My daughter, I haven't told you the story of Manira and her son Naif.
Her son is the age of Waleed. God will replace him.
And the same height.
Yesterday she was telling me she didn't know what to do with her son.
She wants to take him to the hospital, but her husband Youssef
I learned about the story yesterday.
He argued with her and shouted at her.
He says, "Why didn't you tell me?"
This is a psychological condition.
It's against the boy's will.
He should take his son and tie him in the middle of the courtyard.
And then he tells him to do it again and pee in your bed.
All this talk is about nothing.
What did you say, Umm Munira?
I was telling her everything, everything.
Eat and enjoy your meal.
I am the best.
Day, day
It's better that your father didn't find out about you.
Otherwise, he'll kill you with his fists.
Alright, go to the bathroom and take a shower before your father wakes up, or he'll see a disaster.
I won't listen to what you say.
Alas for them.
They weep and mourn.
I'm afraid something bad will happen to my children.
I have to take them to their uncle to punish them.
I'm nervous.
What they failed at, they succeeded.
Why are you taking them to their uncle?
Nasser got forty-eight out of fifty.
Why don't they get fifty out of fifty?
Their uncle warned them.
I frankly agree with his point of view.
Forget feelings.
And my brother must punish them.
Okay, I'll take it, I'll take it.
This is the last time, this is the last time.
Fifty out of fifty
Wastes our time, and I assure them he is our son.
Why don't you get fifty out of fifty?
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I've warned you, but you don't listen to what I say.
You don't listen to what I say.
Children without shame!
They hit him again, let me punish him.
Ouch! Stop it, Uncle.
So next time, include good things, include!
Enough, enough.
Do you know what I'm going to do?
I'll let you jump one by one and you'll be falafel.
Be aware when going with your family to public places.
He creates misunderstandings for us.
Teacher, my father is crying.
Why are you crying?
This is an excellent sign.
It's strange that you're crying.
You're expected to be happy.
Oh son! Everyone has left, even the buses have gone. You're waiting for someone to come to you.
At the school entrance means he's waiting for the bus. The bus arrived and the children got off.
Did you hear about the boy who committed suicide today?
They handed him his certificate.
And his father promised that he would punish him if he didn't get full marks.
Walid, Walid. Come back, oh! Walid, come back.
Hello and welcome, in a new episode of our program "Without Borders" live.
Oil accounts for more than thirty-five percent of the total energy sources.
And the rest goes to natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.
Therefore, oil is considered the primary source of energy in the world.
The Gulf countries and Iran alone have six hundred and sixty billion barrels.
Followed by Iran with twelve percent, then Iraq with ten percent, then Kuwait and the UAE with nine percent.
Each of them comes after Venezuela by seven percent.
Then Russia with five percent.
The Gulf countries and Iran possess two-thirds of the world's reserves.
Unprecedented prices and exceeded one hundred and nine dollars for the first time in history.
And in this episode, we try to understand many of the complexities related to petroleum.
And the problems of oil-exporting countries
Despite its prices increasing significantly
Also the problems faced by citizens and residents in these countries.
Due to inflation and unprecedented rise.
What will appear next on the screen or they can write to us through our website "www.Aljazeera.net"
Because the market today is the main factor.
And not the countries of production.
The day that determines the price is market power.
No, no OPEC.
Of course, supply and demand play a part naturally.
But other factors are
Other factors are political tensions.
in the world
Real estate markets
Stock market and other things
And moved on to prices in speculation.
"Goods" like oil, for example
And tomorrow it will reach $1000, God knows best.
In 2004, oil jumped from $44 to $100.
And today we see that even gas prices
He changes from day to day.
Oil prices fell below ninety dollars.
And increased in the second quarter.
Especially with the arrival of spring and secondly because most of the world's filters are under maintenance.
"Always, to the second quarter"
Seasonal demand for oil is declining.
In winter, it drops below ninety.
And all these indicate that speculation has the power and control over the market now.
A lot has changed since we returned to the traditional market in the past.
The market was influenced by supply and demand.
Seasonal supply and demand
Today, we see that economic growth is
Yesterday or today, General Fallon, the commander of the Central Region in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
And his resignation sparked a major reaction due to its association with the so-called expected American war.
Political or Geopolitical Impact
It can affect the oil market negatively or positively in a swift manner.
The effect will surely come and will have its impact.
Even traders also interact with political influences.
That could confirm, he will say, some will tell you that an American war on Iran is coming.
Here, what will happen to the market? The market will be optimistic in some way.
This question, Mr. Honorable Representative, now in light of what the White House
And this returned the region to a climate of tension.
This is the mystery.
But Faalon had seen this scenario.
A quick reaction to the oil market.
Today, we and the proven numbers confirm that there is no deficit.
Let me give you an example: in the past seven weeks.
In the United States, their oil reserves have increased to more than half of the past five years.
Today, I mean, I guess I should say...
Not even for the coming war, because I tell you today that the world itself has a profitable warehouse.
Even today's global consumption, you can choose any country and you will find long queues in front of gas stations.
This is something else.
What risks does this issue pose?
What number do you expect it to be? I don't know.
One hundred dollars or maybe three hundred dollars, possibly less.
He can arrive if these tensions become real tensions.
Because, as I said, the Gulf represents sixty percent.
In a country so far from the oil-producing nations.
You will witness how the reversal impacts the oil market.
And it could reach three hundred dollars.
And moved from stocks and other to the oil market. Today you will see more than two or three trillion dollars.
Today we see the print.
Predicting more than a hundred a day means-
Those tensions in the region and wait.
April, as has been said, will be the month to end this war.
God knows what I did, that is, it means, it's obvious.
in the area because it's now
This year is the year of elections.
And the current American administration still has only a few months left.
George H.W. Bush launched a war on Somalia and sent thirty thousand Canadians in his final days in the White House.
We see, but do not foresee events.
But I don't think this scenario will happen.
Due to this scenario, it is very expensive.
America won't give anything, you'll pay, along with Iran and the consumer countries.
America Today
Now it depends on Africa's oil and has many other alternatives.
Look, there's nothing, let's talk clearly.
You said in your introduction that sixty percent
From the oil reserves
But now they issue twenty-two...
I get oil from West Africa.
I'm from West Africa and all they export from any other region in the world
Oil production
Because this is a difficult number and fixed reserves and reserves.
So-called deep-sea mining or seabed mining from the deep ocean.
Therefore, the Gulf will remain a tough number.
And the Caspian Sea oil.
I consider them dreams because they are neither true nor realistic.
They are ruining and destroying it.
The important means there is
Today, Qatar is the largest source of energy in the world.
LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) is why these countries are a tough number.
And the country's energy needs
It certainly means there's something called secure provisioning.
And despite internal objections within the United States, even at the level of General Fallon
But there are still some concerns.
Bush turned around.
Try to observe how political risks do not come from the Gulf states.
It means he came, no, no, no, not because of generosity, because none of us deals with generosity.
No, there's dealing with a lot of generosity.
But not "in the current field"
We are not part of a charity.
Or be kind.
But Karim is generous to Westerners, not to anyone else.
With America accurately.
When the market
When we find economic benefits, we will go.
"We are
Like mazut and gas.
You'll leave it for the sake of generosity.
I have the proof.
I have the proof.
Over sixty to seventy dollars
Not the rise in prices.
But the decline of the US dollar that you insist on
You are in first place as the Gulf, Arab, and OPEC people.
Exports must be in dollars, and you refuse.
Change the currency despite the currency collapse.
Even if the outcome is not in your favor.
No, I didn't say it should be 70.
And this is the talk of the experts, not mine.
Okay, the dinar has fallen by thirty percent and oil has risen more than this decline.
So if we take the base year as 2004, ...
We see oil prices ranging between thirty-five and thirty-six dollars.
Of course it means
The price of that oil has increased.
But it's a minor increase, Your Honor.
It means, if we take it.
We consider it now.
Even at these prices
That is, if we compare it to 2004.
It even exceeded the rate of decline for the US dollar.
The exciting thing is
Interact with the weakening dollar.
As the dollar falls, oil prices rise.
This is something else the market is starting to feel.
Our interest now is to reduce.
"Neither the situation has changed. Maybe at the beginning of the reduction two years ago they were saying this, but the situation has changed now and has become..."
And the dollar began to lose value against other major currencies like the euro and the pound sterling.
The issue is why peg your currency to the dollar.
Low-value currency with no backing.
This is a historic age.
Petroleum and its derivatives are priced in dollars, even for European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
He says that America in the mid-seventies
The gold standard that the American dinar had was abolished.
This is not correct.
Okay, then tell me what the truth is.
OPEC includes
Four Gulf states
Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Today's OPEC share in the global market
It's forty percent.
Today, when we say that the world consumes eighty-five million barrels.
Those who deal in dollars in oil pricing.
If you put a price with another currency, everyone will understand.
You can't.
All oil-producing countries must agree.
You, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf countries are hot spots.
Those who own 66% of the world's reserves are the big people.
Archives, but I consider them an export.
Including Venezuela, Libya, and Iran
Cameron, Angola, and all these countries organized under OPEC
The company's market share does not exceed forty percent.
Produced and exported outside OPEC
And this can be linked to the forty percent.
He can't do it alone except...
In some countries, they try, but...
Not a real attempt.
You're the one who's rejected because of American ties.
From dollars to another currency.
All oil-producing countries
Before, only one barrel was produced.
It's a pity they imported them.
And his work improved greatly.
And he sells his oil in dollars.
In his entry or received by the recipient, he gets his money in dollars and then converted it to his local currency.
His salary is not related to the dollar.
True, but he...
But it's also your problem; you sell in dollars, but if your currency isn't pegged to the dollar, you don't have a problem.
My main question now is
What are the concerns and implications of pegging your currency to the dollar amid the dollar's declining value?
He has been involved for many years.
Especially in the 1970s when the dollar was a very strong currency and had great purchasing power.
This separation is not that easy.
Divorce is easy.
No, not here.
Divorce has its costs.
That works in favor of these countries, not against them.
Profit and loss
Dow Jones announced yesterday that there are 4 countries, including Qatar.
But there is also a report from the Gulf Finance House stating that there are four Gulf countries, of course, because Oman has withdrawn from the unified Gulf currency.
I read a statement in the Dow Jones, and I don't think it's a genuine statement.
The governor of the Qatar Central Bank was in exile.
He said yes and that there will be a study, but all Gulf countries must also be involved.
Profit and loss must be examined with great care, free from emotions.
Let's leave the matter for examination until they come.
Look, I can bring you other economists who can come up with another study.
That contradicts this study.
The global house said something very simple and organized and issued a report on March 8th.
Just four days ago.
The global house is the simple solution and needs a non-political decision.
The political decision can be summarized in two things.
No three, first thing.
Kuwait, along with the five other Gulf Cooperation Council states, announced in 2010 their intention to issue a unified Gulf currency or study the possibility of issuing one.
The second point is to issue a decision to delink from the dollar.
Firstly, regarding the single currency.
From my personal point of view
To see the unified Gulf currency
This currency will be strong.
Will be
Perhaps one of the strong currencies in the world as you said.
And what will come from the reserve and the huge revenues
That's why the Prime Minister focused on this when he said...
Gulf countries, because no single country can do it alone.
Only with strong economic content
And today we see economic growth, even up to the euro.
Of course, you can't forget that the central bank plays a significant role.
In the evaluation
And the profit and loss account.
From all this news
Tense situation
2008, as observers said, the Global House said that this inflation would continue.
I've been in the Gulf countries for a long time, but the solution is in the hands of the governments.
Some countries, like the UAE, have raised salaries by seventy percent.
And stop the inflation process that
And this is my problem now, when will you raise the salaries of these poor people?
I'll hear your answer after a short ad.
Today's episode: Saudi Arabia's oil reserves and daily production of Gulf Cooperation Council states
It has 260 billion in reserves.
And two barrels out of every ten barrels.
And nine out of ten are produced daily.
One million, Kuwait one hundred and one and a half, produced one billion, produced two and seven tenths of millions.
Qatar has fifteen billion and twelve billion, producing 850,000. Oman has five and six tenths of a billion, producing 707,000.
Bahrain has one hundred and twenty-five million and produces thirty-five thousand.
The total revenue was thirty-eight billion per year.
From 2003 to 2007
Europe is one hundred billion.
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion.
In Asia and other countries
And while the gross domestic product of the Gulf Cooperation Council states in 2017
Net revenues for 2007 are 799.7 billion, expected to be 799.7 billion.
In 1992, it was one out of ten billion.
And between the continuous inflation that devours employees' salaries and the people working in this area.
But it will increase in 2008 to 3.8 percent.
Kuwait is fourteen percent, but in 2008 it is expected to be eight and nine-tenths of the UAE.
It will be ten while Saudi Arabia was six and a half and will reach six.
And eight out of ten
Salaries are being eaten up.
So, what are the amounts and percentages that you will fund for the poor here?
If we want to solve the problem
Real solution
Permanent Salaries Growing Salaries
It's not the solution.
I'm not against raising salaries.
This is not true, I, this is not true
We always work.
Of course, there is a belief.
In the case of an increase, an increase without control of inflation will make inflation swallow up all these increases.
To solve the inflation problem, the Hey committee includes all experts and specialists.
And now this committee is forming.
Due to the increase in salaries worldwide
And naturally, the golden rule of economics says
It has no end.
And whatever it is
Salaries often increase, no matter how much they increase.
The inflation will rise.
The solution is necessary and urgent.
With a scientific study here at Bait.com, the specialized employment institute, a study was conducted with the help of the British Yougov Siraj.
They conducted a survey of fifteen thousand employees working in the Gulf countries in twenty key sectors.
Especially experts and those with a career path have job dissatisfaction.
Because inflation here has started to devour.
Especially those with experience.
They are considering moving from countries where inflation is always high.
Now you will lose.
This is the simple concept, you put the simple concept, and try to implement it.
The solution for inflation is to increase salaries.
Balance exists.
There
We are concerned, the state is concerned, and we are doing our best.
To solve this issue with a real solution.
Temporary solutions never solve the problem, they only make it worse.
"زيده يعني" translates to "That means" in English.
We hope to have more time for this committee to come up with something.
All applications
This boredom and your happiness.
Boredom will always be there.
True, but the government tried and filled the gaps by increasing by forty percent.
Here's an important point regarding the topic of increases.
In terms of salaries, you only want Qataris, as if non-Qataris work for Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
You count Qataris, but you don't count non-Gulf Arabs.
And the highest percentage in it.
You are Ahmed, you live in Qatar, not Germany.
And everyone is talking about this and suffering.
Much higher salaries than in the public sector.
On the contrary, we saw
In the public sector
On the contrary, the government sector has become
Because the best units and competencies started.
I've read the report as well, as you know, we're in the oil industry.
From work
Follow our experts.
Engineers and workers come from outside Qatar.
Because we also interact with the global market.
For all these things, what is the rate of increase in salaries?
"Seeking is with God Almighty, but we say..."
I have a plan for the government.
And I say that controlling inflation is more important.
I'm a temporary fix.
And we'll see, I'm sure.
There will be
Positive results
Then it will be on the verge of fifteen percent.
Okay, the second nice report says that twenty-two billion barrels of oil will come to you and forty-three billion cubic meters of gas.
No comment, not the spraying process.
It is natural that we take action.
But talk of economic growth must also reflect on people.
And any economic growth today, Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world.
On the contrary
The massive transfers "in the country are also part
And were it not for these massive belts and grand projects
In this country, what is part of the inflation is also part of the problem.
Led to some inflation
And this also led to a lot of money in the market.
Firstly, regarding the link between the dollar and oil.
He mortgaged the oil for protection.
I am from the United States of America, thus stability in power.
Thank you.
Saad al-Ghamdi from Saudi Arabia, your question Saad.
Peace, mercy, and forgiveness from God.
A good episode and a good title.
What I really want to talk about is that the region is now under American policies.
American policy in its war now, in addition to the cultural war it is trying to wage against Islam, there is a global economic war.
Now in China
The U.S. deficit with Japan also reached sixty-one billion dollars.
And Japan has already invested in two thousand.
With America to the equivalent of nine.
Billion while it now invests with the European Union in excess of twenty-seven billion dollars.
To keep up with American politics and make the dollar an unavoidable currency for the whole world.
I tell my brother to sell now.
And it will become the Gulf region.
As it should be.
Thank you, Brother Saad.
Mohamed El-Wasif from Egypt
Hello, Your Honor, who are you with?
Middle Eastern rulers, your highnesses, remind me of something.
When there is
When there are claims for price adjustments.
Salaries are adjusted against prices as Your Excellency said.
In Qatar, we considered you a role model.
And he continued not to promise to increase this from an Arabic pattern.
We want, we consider Qatar as Abu Tarka.
He has the right to say what he wants. You have a question, of course it's his right, he's responsible for this policy.
The question first.
His Excellency must take into consideration.
This one second must respond to public opinion.
With the poor, as I said, because they are the people of countries that need special care.
Arab leaders don't care about the poor.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Good evening to you and good evening to Mr. Happiness.
I want a raise.
Salaries are excellent and good. This is good.
Thanks for the topic we need and suffer from.
I am with the poor and will always be, God willing, and we know that there are no poor people in Qatar and we are certain.
And I confirm that Qatar, as he said, the money goes to the ruling family and to the ruler.
That important question now.
Let's answer the brothers first.
What we can judge
What happens to wealth?
Now there are almost new cities like Pearl and Lusail and other places, meaning even Qatar is expanding.
This is not the case. The case is...
Suitable urban plan
In short, since we still have two minutes, tell us what Qatar will turn towards.
Qatar now, there is Qatar after oil and gas.
In a clear policy of the state
Because it is he.
Non-renewable resource
Because it is a non-renewable resource.
Therefore, today's trend in the State of Qatar.
The capital of the Middle East in education
Today we see the city of education.
Today, this educational city includes the best colleges in the world.
Building medical cities, media cities, and financial cities
Because today it's oil and gas.
No, of course we don't imitate anyone.
Other satellite channels
Not just the island, you will make a hundred islands, and of course we do not stand with the island.
Because he is my brother, these countries are our countries in the Gulf now.
In the 1970s, there was a boom. Now everyone remembers the 1970s boom.
Now let's see what growth Qatar has seen.
And this calls for a special episode about Qatar in the post-oil era.
With our vision about oil, its future, and its resources in the region, especially in Qatar. In conclusion, my regards to the program team.
I am Ahmed Mansour, and I send you greetings without boundaries. Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Our greetings this week come from the capital of Qatar, Doha.
And I welcome you to a new episode of our program "Without Borders"
At the same time that Qatar hosts the largest U.S. military base outside the United States, Al Udeid Air Base.
With the United States' enemies in the region
Like Iran and Syria
Its doors are open to leaders.
In fact, Hamas leaders enjoy private contacts with the Qatari leadership.
As the Emir of Qatar was the only Arab leader
Who visited the southern suburbs of Beirut, destroyed by Israel during the Lebanon War in the summer of 2006?
And continued unlimited support for the reconstruction of what Israel destroyed in Lebanon.
And when Qatar reconciles
With its older sister, Saudi Arabia, about two years ago.
Clashes with the regime in Egypt at the same time
Like the Lebanese file where you succeeded when others failed.
To gather the Lebanese leaders in Doha where they signed an agreement that led them to safety.
To the final elections
Even tough files
He cares to be the driver of these files, not the passenger.
The smallest Arab country
In today's episode
We try to understand the foundation and principles upon which Qatari foreign policy was built.
And for whom is the benefit?
Qatar, the smallest country geographically and demographically, plays these significant roles.
And what qualifications enable her to do that?
That will be in a direct dialogue with the Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.
For our viewers who wish to participate, they can contact us through the program's numbers, which will appear on the screen shortly.
The visit made by the Emir of Qatar.
Al Jazeera is seeking to improve communications with Saudi Arabia.
From the past like Saudi Arabia's attempt to seize the Qatari government with the help of the Al Murra tribe.
In its issue published on June 20th last.
What is the nature of the confidential treatment?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Many things that are not
I don't think that's true.
In many interviews here on this program, I have always said that the correct thing is that
And we consider it the backbone.
I am from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a misunderstanding.
In addition to, the
From different perspectives
It's true that the border issue was resolved and it was a major obstacle.
The historical Saudi-Qatari relations were special.
These relationships, if we notice them.
Between the two countries and the two families.
Destroyed due to misunderstanding
Neither us nor them.
Since there are no conditions between brothers.
And things have happened, and now relations are in a state that I can confirm is excellent.
In the interest of the Cooperation Council
But how did relations improve between the island and Saudi Arabia when the island was the obstacle and the reason in 2001?
At an important point
And I repeat, if you go back to all the programs, I always said
I'm not just the older sister, but I'm saying that our reliance in the Cooperation Council is on
That Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
And we value our relationship with her.
There was some heated media exchange, and it was clear to both parties.
These countries find themselves.
It didn't work when the brothers agreed.
Especially the Saudi-Qatari house.
They even found themselves in conflict.
Wherever there are no camels
And I don't think it was anyone's strategy who was in this conflict.
But please, Sheikh, allow me to put things in their proper context or place the dots above the letters.
Many observers find that the island has changed significantly over the past few years.
At the time when they were still criticizing the conditions on Al Jazeera's screen.
What's happening inside Saudi Arabia.
Are the detainees, opponents, or others still standing?
The island stopped dealing with these issues.
Al Jazeera's Hajj coverage has turned into
Praise for the system and what the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is doing at a time of change.
First, you can ask the island management about this matter. Don't ask me because
This brings the two countries together.
For the stability of the region.
This strategy continued and ensured the stability of the region.
The region you're referring to is the Gulf region.
Gulf Region
In many cases surrounding the Gulf region
Also invite the guardian of the two holy mosques in Kuwait.
He had an impact on all listeners and the entire Arab world.
He spoke from the heart about resolving, overcoming, and burying Arab disputes.
Not just in terms of opinions
No, it's about politics and politics is a matter of perspective.
In the Arab world, it is considered
A kind of war
In the developed world
They talk about the same interest.
Now I've been sitting for many years.
The situation now
Listen first.
There's a difference between this topic and the other.
The idea of a small country resisting larger nations and making them feel weak.
Every difference or misunderstanding.
He had his reasons.
And its reasons have ended.
Because it ended thanks to their wisdom.
Is there insurance for future relationships?
There are guarantees between two parties.
Based on love, brotherhood, and mutual interest between the two countries.
And leaders, their words are considered more than a document.
Between Qatar and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
We hope for much of this Saudi-Qatari relationship to develop.
For the best, and there will be more opportunities.
As for this relationship, like we have with other Arab countries, other Gulf countries.
Qatar is an important country.
OK, so Saudi Arabia is an important country.
What is Egypt to the country? Because what is bad is that at the same time it reconciled with Saudi Arabia.
And three organizations, namely Hezbollah.
That is, Al Jazeera channel
Are you pro or against the regime in Egypt, the largest Arab country?
First, let me start with this.
Egyptian people
And we respect the Egyptian nation.
"And its benefits"
With many Arab issues and the sacrifices of the Egyptian nation
And this is the case.
There's someone who thinks that through this issue, we are trying to reach an understanding with the brothers in Egypt.
In light of what you say about respecting Egypt and the Egyptian people
And we think he is a good person.
Our disagreements with Egypt are on two points.
Or a single point.
We were accused of planning to topple Gaza, and I don't think...
And we don't interfere.
In cases falling under other states
What believes in interfering in the affairs of any country unless there is room for reform.
Does that mean you intervened in Hamas' coup against the authority in Gaza?
Of course, I don't deny that we didn't know as much about this thing as others do through the media.
We have relations with Hamas and we have relations with others.
What made Egypt different or was there a disagreement between you on this point?
I'm coming here.
Hezbollah plot
Hezbollah and
But I speak on behalf of my country.
We were very surprised about this matter.
Shake for Qatar
What did the pyramids say?
The pyramids spoke.
An attack on Egypt and its occupation.
Can I reply?
Let's go back to the plot they mentioned.
Days will reveal this.
The beginning was the Gaza Conference.
I absolve the Egyptian people and President Hosni Mubarak from that.
If we go back to the Port Conference
After the Madrid Conference, do you remember the follow-up meeting held in Doha?
And that was a coincidence, and when the conference was to be held with us.
They said they don't want to hold the conference.
People, we know you're coordinating with Israel.
"Heading to Qatar and this is it"
What we're trying to understand why.
We sat down and found that we were always talking excellently.
Two lucks
Who are they?
There is a disagreement.
In political orientation
If we look at the Gaza conference that was held
His Highness Prince spoke with all the presidents, including his brother President Hosni Mubarak.
And we were informed by a foreign state.
The brothers in Egypt have a point of view on the subject that it should not be complicated.
And people are being killed while we watch.
If you don't want it to be held in Doha, we can hold it anywhere in the Arab League.
It is shameful to discuss the matter in the Kuwait side conference.
In Israel and the Western world, people stand and watch what is happening.
When we said all or nothing, it became common knowledge. There is no power or might except through God. We, the Arabs, cannot stop it, and no major country has been able to halt this battle.
Egypt requested a declaration of a cessation of hostilities in Gaza, after an hour the battle stopped.
Even we
We should not deal with the Arab street with such naivety; our disagreement with the brothers is on one point.
And this in international standards.
And enough hospitals and doctors are being caught at the borders.
You who were standing at the border
There, and no one can enter.
The brothers received her with great joy.
Because Gaza is located next to Egypt and is considered part of the national territory.
When we talk about any human issue anywhere in the world, we are talking only about a human issue.
And we respect sovereignty in Egypt.
And we know her position, but this does not harm the Egyptian position.
And we wish a lot from Egypt.
It is the largest Arab country.
And we believe that it can carry our voices and the voices of others from the Arab world.
For all other parties
Even the rescue mission that came after Gaza.
The Europeans tried to save her.
What happened in Gaza?
Whether it was a presentation conference and all that, I consider it a salvation for the government.
We were not invited to a conference; we were invited to coordinate between the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
And we were gathered in the Cooperation Council.
These amounts will not be issued to any party.
But it will be released to
The affected parties in Gaza
Directly, and that was it.
Because it's off-limits from every angle.
I am happy for Egypt, and all the people in Qatar are happy for Egypt because Egypt...
Egypt's victory in political issues is very important to us.
But you're expecting.
Just let me have two minutes.
One of the ministers boasted of what had been denied and said...
And whoever harms Egypt, we will cut off his leg and break his arm.
Frankly, I think this official has insulted his country.
The truth is they failed, and they only talked about themselves.
What helped them in this, and I told this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia intervened because the king has wisdom in this matter.
To end things in the Arab world
We agreed.
It is the king who will decide that this is in the best interest.
We accepted King Abdullah's decision because we fear and trust him.
But for anyone to say that we stopped them is even an insult to those they stopped.
As if they were students in a school.
I thought that this
The age of majority
He thinks he should impose his strength.
We are sorry, we are sorry about this.
If you think the small state has no right, its rights are taken away.
And you enter violently and impose your noise on Darfur.
It is an Arab decision at the Arab League.
An African decision and a United Nations decision
I think the main issue is
Hezbollah is a conspiracy along with Qatar.
A conspiracy, I don't know what in Qatar.
If it happened, perhaps after the swine flu, that it appeared somewhere in Qatar, the reason behind the spread of this epidemic would be...
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and capabilities.
But Qatar has a point of view.
Qatar has a separate policy.
If Qatar can solve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor.
Because any Arab disagreement
We believe that any Arab disagreement can weaken our position in the face of the major issues we confront, namely Palestine and all the other issues we face.
The Arab world has become a future.
Even our analysis has become like theirs.
Western analysis
But there is one thing we know. We know what happened in Pakistan.
I want someone to greet me and roll out the red carpet for me in Washington.
Is anyone blaming Qatar?
Did Qatar provoke any Arab country?
Try contributing money.
These contributions are controversial.
I can drop by, say peace be upon you, and you'll say: You're saying hello to provoke me.
This is another case, meaning you have a problem or you have a shortage.
This matter doesn't concern me, it concerns you.
But if you have internal problems
We always say it.
Especially after the phrase "Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah"
In Kuwait, and I know this man is honest.
A man speaks what is in his heart.
My heart always says this.
I always say this.
I always say that even in the midst of our disputes with Saudi Arabia, I would say that...
And you can refer to all the documents you have on the island, but
It's a different case.
From one part we said no, this is everything, we stop at this situation.
And we tried as much as we could.
I don't want to get into that topic.
Let them see their own affairs and where their mistakes are.
And seeing our mistakes doesn't mean everything we do is right.
Do you mean this, Your Highness?
Due to internal problems in Egypt
And they want to get out of it.
Do you deny that Qatar contributes in any form of conspiracy against Egypt externally and tried to break its relations with Turkey and any other country?
It seems we have superpowers.
They are seventy million, if we could, not eighty million.
They also have a problem that needs to be solved.
That you have played a role in the Shalit soldier case despite your knowledge that this file is important to the Egyptian government.
And I asked with the French.
We received a call from a friendly country.
We said, "There is an issue we must address." They said, "This issue belongs to the Egyptians."
We want to see this issue as a request.
From Israel and another country, we want to see another part to see this.
When we saw him, we told them, "If the same conditions apply, let the brothers talk to the brothers in Egypt."
And having announced this, does it mean that there is a responsible party who can say that we were deceived by the Arab League?
This means he is a poor young man.
How did we let this happen to us?
When President Mahmoud Abbas remains.
And we supported that.
Does he speak to his people? Does he speak to us? Does he speak to the Arab world?
The problem is from you.
I think this is a healthy phenomenon.
I am not Al Jazeera's owner, as I have been accused.
The island must enter the media competition, as there are many media outlets in the West.
In many media entities, during their adolescence, they all curse each other.
But after a period of time, they will reach maturity.
Can or cannot
First, our situation with Saudi Arabia is different.
Even if we agree for the benefit of Saudi Arabia, we accept it in Qatar.
Important relationships
Egypt is an important country, but there is a special relationship with Saudi Arabia.
There's also a special relationship between Egypt and any other Arab country. Egypt is the largest Arab country.
That's true, but we have a history with Saudi Arabia and the relationship is different.
It's a personal dispute between some officials here and there.
We respect the president of Egypt.
I hope it's just a difference of political opinions.
I told you about the problem when there was an attack on Gaza.
The second problem is that they have issues with us, and we still don't know what Qatar has done for that reason.
Why are you trying to arrange a meeting between the Egyptian president and the prince now?
Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter.
As had been leaked to the press, they initially said it was a secret meeting, but we found out about it the next morning.
There was a meeting between me and Omar Suleiman.
In Saudi Arabia
Irreversible schizophrenia
And I cannot tell you that we agree on everything.
We say this so that it is not interpreted as you not comparing yourselves.
But dignity is dignity, whether with the young or the old.
The minister said that if Egypt received appropriate satisfaction.
Satisfaction among children
I don't think so. Egypt is not smaller than that. I guess I didn't find the right expression.
Do you have a vision to solve the problems with Egypt, or are you like the Egyptian people waiting for divine intervention?
I refuse to consider divine intervention or otherwise because only God knows who will live and who will die.
And I call
A person thinks he'll be in the way.
And our pride in Egypt.
There is a certain way that you must be.
Either you stand with me or against me.
And the pain felt by the Arab citizen
In the Arab world, we walk with him, and this is the policy of His Highness the Emir.
Nations draw their strength from sources of power.
The United States has sources of power from China, sources of power from France, and a source of power for a small country like Qatar.
Our faith in God
"Which is clearly"
You're trying.
But we are a small country, and I keep that in mind.
And I will repeat it a hundred times.
So no one can say we have any sensitivities.
No one takes from us.
For Israel, you've now tickled.
Okay, before I go to Israel.
How can you solve the problem with Egypt?
What's the problem now?
And every day they lodge a complaint with America if I could tell you the big countries you were talking about.
They deal with us on the basis of self-interest, and so do we.
All complaints and everything.
To ruin the relationship
I think any large country doing that would affect its image.
It will also affect our Arab pride if we run around complaining about each other.
Everything is coming and we know everything.
Our solution is based on Arab interests.
And we're here for them if they need anything.
Are there upcoming steps to improve relations?
But I know that there are good relations between the President and His Highness the Prince.
If someone is straining the bonds
Opposing the alliance between the two countries and their leaderships will find himself on the losing side.
No, it could be tomorrow, it could be in ten years. Honestly, I don't know, but from our side, if anyone invites us to a conference, we will be there.
Anyone who invites us to a conference, we will attend, and if we have a viewpoint, we will express it at the conference.
We don't have the capacity.
Because Egypt is our big sister, but we have different perspectives and discuss together.
This is all that is required. Whenever the time comes, it will be a great pleasure for us.
That was canceled due to this policy.
And as I said, we respect the Egyptian people.
Of course you're asking about how many contracts were cancelled, ask about how many Egyptians came to Qatar at the same time.
But as a state policy, as I told you, the Egyptian people in Qatar are very close to our hearts.
On last June 4th, you stirred the feelings of the Arab nations when you closed the Israeli office and published in the arts on June 4th.
When you say we became them, if we wanted to become them, we would have closed it twelve years ago.
When everyone was campaigning for reconciliation with Israel and before there were secret meetings between Arab states and Israel.
And after the reconciliation of most Arabs
With Israel, whether under the table or on the table, or talk to it in any way.
If we wanted to play with emotions, we would have done it at the previous Islamic conference.
At the United Nations, Nasser's allies held a dinner at the residence of the Israeli ambassador, Gabriela Shalev.
He was one of the many who attended this feast and I didn't want to know why the ambassador had organized it.
Because at the United Nations we sit next to Israel, and no one can deny that.
Or we find a glimmer of hope to dispel the sorrow of our Palestinian brothers.
Now the management has changed, and I had a small opportunity to ask about Egypt, but unfortunately...
Okay, I was.
My question is about the United States and the new administration and its impact on your (Qataris) relationship with the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
There are differences in opinions.
Worth solving for many cases in the region.
If they are serious, we will help them as much as we can.
We expect a special relationship or a solution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these cases have been resolved.
The Emir of Qatar spoke yesterday in Paris about what is happening in Iran.
And you have special relations with Iran even if its relations with the United States are bad.
First, we must place it in the context of internal affairs because we must respect every country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said on this program that the Doha Agreement ends with the holding of elections.
Is this your vision as well, or do you see the agreement as still being in effect, or will you have to establish a new agreement?
The Doha Agreement was for a phase that would make them hold peaceful elections.
A year and a half has passed since the Doha Agreement.
We followed them day by day and minute by minute until they reached the elections according to the Doha Agreement.
We recently intervened in a constituency to correct some misunderstandings that had occurred.
But you still have something pending regarding the arrangements in Lebanon.
We're always close to Lebanon. You know how much Qataris love Lebanon and enjoy going there.
The first country I visited after a Western country was Lebanon.
A quick question about what's happening in Yemen.
You intervened in the Houthi affair, and there are some accusations that you supported them.
Or your involvement brought them face to face with the state, and now there is a greater danger, the danger of the South.
We have suffered a lot, and this indicates why we stand here and not there in Qatar.
We certainly faced great pressure, but this was our vision, and this was His Highness the Amir's stance.
Houthi subject
Its stability affects us positively, and its instability affects us negatively.
Let's have an honest compromise between the two parties.
And we signed an agreement.
But I understand if that was the purpose for other reasons.
And let us be with them, and always stand by them in all circumstances.
And what is built on truth
I see that we have no need.
We sell them.
I say this with an apology, as I know there is a large Arab audience that disagrees with me.
Dear viewers, thank you as well for listening, hoping that we have clarified some of Qatar's foreign policy to you.
In conclusion, greetings from the program team, and this is Ahmed Mansour greeting you without borders.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Welcome, viewers, and peace be upon you. Welcome to this special dialogue.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani is the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the State of Qatar.
Of course, why would I say it's a special and exceptional interview? Because it is.
Qatar and this man exactly was the main sponsor
Sir, just one simple and direct question.
I believe it happened because there was an Arab consensus from the beginning.
And we have tried that when we went to the United Nations.
The Arab consensus was important, and the Lebanese management from both sides was significant.
To achieve some results
It is very important that external intervention
Many opinions and suggestions from the outside.
Lebanese and international Arabs, if you will.
She went through stages, but it meant something.
It is nothing unless these stages exist.
Does that mean the complexities in Lebanon
Since the time of truth
I mean when you were all gathered and you directly switched to the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file.
Did you discover that the Lebanese complex is huge?
A Lebanese Arab international regional needs significant decryption.
It's a simple matter complicated by external interference.
Because we know that Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, and a beacon for many things.
Lebanese don't allow it.
The impact of peace and security in Lebanon
Problem number one
They are external strikes in Lebanon.
You suddenly decided after twenty-four hours to take everyone on one plane.
From the plane straight to meet the Emir of Qatar.
They couldn't expect it; they couldn't rest for a single minute unless you were kind enough to let them.
The secret is not to give them a chance to rest and think too much.
And contact (them) abundantly.
We suggest bringing them to Doha because we need the atmosphere.
Or you will gather them with many difficulties.
In many circumstances
We take them out of these circumstances into conditions where they can find a solution.
If we want to succeed, we must get them out of this atmosphere.
And quickly.
May God grant us success through the Venetian statement or the Beirut statement.
And we succeeded because they agreed to go to Doha.
The parties decided to go to Doha.
Some believe that Qatar is more biased towards one party at the expense of the other.
And I'm from Beirut.
His Highness's policy is that we are mediators.
In this process
Of course, frankly
Did you consult seriously?
With the main parties concerned at least about what is happening here in Lebanon, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Syria.
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
I express my support for the idea.
We benefited from Prince Saud that we...
Everyone needed a solution.
His justifications are weak.
If we rely on logic
His justifications are weak.
It had to be removed because there is tension in Palestine.
In the case of the Iranian nuclear file
The Arab League should have a mechanism to resolve issues.
Is the African Union better than us at resolving issues?
And try to unite the parties.
And conferences were held to find solutions, so why can't the Arabs, who have ancient ties, not succeed?
Unite the Arabs or unite the parties if necessary and intervene to support the oppressed.
That should be under study.
If we want an alarm call for the Arab world, not for the Arab League but for the Arab world.
The Arab League is just a tool for implementation.
One of the officials was here, and he is Speaker Nabih Berri.
S-S requires
Now it seems that the Lebanese have agreed.
Well, let's hear you.
And upon them Qatar.
What doesn't lead to a result in one day
For Arab interests.
That will be a strength for the Arabs.
We tried it.
At the United Nations when we went to the Doha Agreement
And agendas designed to solve the problem, not for other reasons.
Undoubtedly
And play a more important role in the entire Arab world.
puts
Stop it with our consent.
Others may come and help us.
Because this is dangerous, though.
When we reached the stage where each of us played in our own garden.
In our garden
It is extremely important to place the interests of our people first.
Now we need an Arab university after this agreement to see what we will do with our Palestinian brothers.
What have we done for Somalia?
What should we do about Somalia not being a member of the Arab League?
Sudan is not in the Arab League! Iraq is not in the Arab League! Why don't we give it a try?
We are part of the Arab world and small.
I hope this isn't a suggestion, this idea.
Qatar has good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia.
I think that firstly, if we are not asked to do something, we will do what we can.
But I am certain that His Royal Highness King Abdullah
King of Saudi Arabia
And his brother, President Bashar
Because Saudi Arabia and Syria had a historical agreement.
It can only be a temporary phase.
And we will find, God willing.
I still insist on asking if it's okay with you to play a role in this scene.
Even if not in front of people now, you somewhat possess confidence.
What kind of rapprochement between Arab countries are we seeking?
And this has been His Highness's policy since the beginning, but this matter...
What happened in Lebanon indicates that the region is on the verge of serious changes.
Or what happened in Lebanon is local and Lebanese affairs from a region that is still
Not connected to this situation.
I wish the opposite. I wish this was it.
The beginning of a new phase in the Arab world.
We can create.
It will happen elsewhere.
In other words, are you afraid of the escalation that existed previously?
At least until the end of George Bush's presidency.
There is no doubt that I still have concerns about Palestine, now the issue of Gaza.
I want to ask
We need something else.
I am asking you to take charge of the humanitarian aspect in Palestine.
We don't have the capacity to deliver them the medicine.
No food.
Electricity for the patient in the hospital.
"He who will die when the electricity cuts out."
I wish
The Arab League agrees on an amount for this matter of food and medicine, which we call food and medicine.
We're not trying to have the Red Crescent deliver it.
Let the Red Cross deliver it.
But sorry, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli siege.
I don't want to go into details, I'm just saying that as Muslims, we should provide treatment and food even if we disagree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made a great effort and announced the covenant in the Holy Kaaba.
Because this disagreement will only benefit the other party.
Saying "Don't deal with this party because we will find a solution for you" is not correct.
And I
So far, there is no trace of a solution.
Do you fear an American-Iranian confrontation in the coming period, or do you expect it?
Of course, that's possible.
At least I'm talking about Qatar.
Iran is an important neighbor to us.
We might disagree with their policies, or they might disagree with our policies in Qatar.
For example, they tell us we don't want you to have relations or connections with Israel.
Perhaps some consider you an integral part of it due to the American bases located there.
We know how to handle this.
Who said that after the Emir of Qatar's visit to Saudi Arabia?
He has met, consulted, or spoken with the Saudi host.
In Istanbul, from the negotiations between Syria and Israel
And I say it was a coincidence.
The second subject, the Saudi Kingdom was keen to find a solution and I was in communication with Prince Saud.
What happened in the last few hours?
Change tactics, change tactics in negotiations.
From your part or other parts
We are responsible.
And from all sides, we locked ourselves in the room.
Finally, we found ourselves... and then His Highness's intervention was crucial.
And from it, the intervention action emerges.
Without mentioning it, it's over now.
And his message was clear when he said, "We know our size, our place, and our role," as if to say...
He wanted to take a role without provoking any other party.
Is it Arab, nationalist, or regional?
But still
It became a responsibility.
"Well, do you want it or not?"
We're trying to prevent some jealousy because we are a country.
These countries.
Can or
I think this will be the profitable mix.
The final question is about your relationship with Washington. Is it long-term? Is it ordinary or special?
I can say that our relationship with Washington is excellent.
This means that we don't have different perspectives in these cases.
But this is our right. If they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How good it is, how can you interpret it on earth?
If we're talking about the economy, it's excellent. If we're talking about education, it's excellent.
Also health, but if we talk about politics, I can say it's good.
In your opinion, and make it clear in the next stage.
In my opinion, we should leave confronting Israel to the side.
Even if we wanted to stop the game in the Arab court
And repair the enmity between the Palestinians.
We agree on one opinion so that we are a respected force.
I don't think we have that.
Be effective.
Thank you, dear viewers, for following us. We will meet again, God willing. Best regards.
Welcome to our conversation with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We attempt to explore the political reality of the Arabs and their efforts.
His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum
To understand what's happening in Gaza.
And I hope through this dialogue that we can
Shed light on some of your questions.
The Israeli entry into Gaza in a barbaric manner
Our goal was to unify Arab positions.
Dealing with friendly nations
Other countries
And how to find a clear and strong Arab stance that Arab countries can agree upon.
And, we find areas for reconciliation.
From our perspective, we know that more than one Arab country has been violated.
In a transitive manner
And no one was punished while
We are punished for everything, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
We are the specialized people.
in the world and who are always the targets
Always disciplined in a way.
I think
To the extent that we won't be able to
For a meeting at the leadership level
Halting the discipline campaign
We were about to create an apartment in the Arab world.
There were five other verbal agreements.
By a two-thirds majority
But the purpose of the meeting is not
In it they want to be correct and our perspective to be wrong because the goal
He is the solution to the problem, not the summit.
But will it be at the expense of Palestinian blood?
What we are asking now is that the ministerial statement does not cancel Qatar's request.
And which was also confirmed by His Highness
In the speech he gave, he stated that we do not insist on holding the summit in Qatar if it will cause any embarrassment; the summit can be held anywhere.
An Arab stance where others respect us.
Yes, and for the ministerial session.
We want to tell them that the Security Council resolution was issued.
And what about Israel?
He had no role in the decision and continued killing and bombing in Gaza, and still does.
And I need to ask the Arab what we're going to do with it.
What are we going to do?
How when Israel finished
To implement the remaining provisions of the Security Council resolution
Or there will be a stance since Israel did not stop.
Shooting, what we press on our brothers
To a decision that is considered excessive.
A few days ago
Here we will discuss the ministerial meeting.
You'll support this in the end.
Of course, we support holding an Arab summit, and this was our idea, and some other countries also called for the summit, including Syria and Yemen.
There's already an Arabic division there.
Or prepare us for the camp of moderation.
And a camp of the non-moderates.
And what do they mean by "moderation"?
That has been sorted out by the West.
As trained and untrained Arabs
You will not find a moderate state or a non-moderate state.
And we want to know what is moderation and what is immoderation. Does moderation mean following Israel's plans?
And the matter ended in a humiliating way.
Or we just need to leave the case open.
I mean, this is an important question.
Are the countries
They follow Israel's plans and want to solve problems in their ways.
What I want to say is that they follow Israel's agendas, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say
If we organize a camp for editing
What is Moderation in Western Eyes?
Do we agree on the slaughter of a certain category of Palestinians?
Of course, the elections were held.
I am neither a supporter nor an opponent of Hamas, but I am speaking from a reality that exists.
The existing truth is that there is
Idea
What some people call extreme mobility
But we must ask ourselves what this radical movement demands.
Something other than her rights or is she asking for her rights?
Or sort them
And He created another mass as well.
Against because we
My inner self is Arab and my intellect is Arab.
And it started happening.
That's why we don't want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, Your Honor, the sheikh in brief.
Who prevented the Arab summit?
What I can say is that there are some efforts, and the subject is somewhat known.
Prevention topic
But as I said, we could.
Take a vote and get two-thirds.
But that wasn't the point, because it's not a matter of challenge as much as it is a matter of urgent need. That's what we believe.
And some believed that it was not an urgent need.
We went to the Security Council.
Or there is a decision in the Security Council.
But the decision is for the Security Council, and Israel said it would end and then consider the matter.
All I want to focus on again
We will not exert efforts to implement the decision on the weaker party.
What will make it different from the first meeting?
Discussions sometimes lead to disagreements.
Often
Will we be ready to take a clear Arab stance?
Humanitarian aid
Support our brothers greatly.
Also to speak with the Israeli party and tell them
I don't think everyone is ready for that. We're supposed to look into this matter.
Why don't we freeze it?
Eighty-four and we are committed to the truce. Eighty-four and the Israelis are not committed.
It is natural for there to be disagreements in meetings, but in fact, these disagreements
Attitudes and what is in their hearts.
One of the skirmishes she had been informed about.
That there is someone who described Hamas' movement as disorganized.
Not even a little
This situation occurred and we received it, and there was a brother minister with me.
And I think that this is what the West says.
These are radical moves, fragmentation, and other names.
And we don't want to be people's men.
And then it always means and I don't mean anyone by it.
Which foreigner did they find?
A Western country or Western countries discover.
Among the Arabs
Come now, happy sheikh.
Call for a Second Ministerial Meeting
Her program must be one thing.
Where are you, Arabs, from all this, and what is the position of the nation of three hundred million?
One million Israeli shekels
that followed Resolution 1805
The issued decision.
Israel will carry out what it has planned after it completes the mission.
There is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort.
He should be grateful for that in this decision.
We can demand Chapter Seven because Israel is above the law, Israel.
If they are asked, they say, "We understand."
It's not the Arabs' fault if they
If that's the case, Israel won't be asked.
And he is above international law.
This is true.
Why did you go to the Security Council and why did you link the Arab summit to what will be issued by the Security Council?
At the summit, the Security Council will investigate us.
He needs to make a tough decision.
"Decision that" (Note:
The loss of an official's position can cause: Dismissal.
We were afraid of the West.
And we work hard after they make their decision.
I don't want to get off topic.
Those who launched the attack to rebuild Iraq entirely at their own expense because they were the ones who destroyed it.
We demand the Iraqi government, not the people who have died.
No compensation.
The same thing happened in Sudan when they started talking about prosecuting Bashir.
His Excellency
His Excellency Sheikh
A major Arab diplomatic victory at the Security Council.
Listen, they faced some difficulties in the Security Council because the first word was about a presidential statement.
Consequences
No one from Israel complied with him.
She will reconcile with him in two days, in a week, after the mission is over.
Because they did not agree with him.
Sorry, but people have to assemble.
Because Israel agreed after the mission was over.
Do you have an alternative to the decision now?
All we did
Some brothers, unfortunately, with some efforts.
They participated in the siege of Gaza.
I am friendly with the West, and there is no problem with having any kind of relationship with the West, and I am not...
Anti-West is not anti-America.
But these people know the language of interests.
Your friends if you are strong.
Or if you have a point of view.
Finally, they will take one percent from us and we say we won.
What is victory?
Including what it contains.
I'm not able to say anything about precautions right now because the decision wasn't made.
And the council is its own master.
I participated in the formation.
Yes, we participated in the formation to some extent.
But you weren't invited to the meeting with the Arab ministers and the US Secretary of State.
But I think the brothers who went are enough.
She pointed to the Arab parties for a certain interest.
In this regard, His Excellency Sheikh
For two years now.
Listen, I don't want to talk about accusations.
I can't pretend that we've been understood about everything.
If they were people who
There was an Israeli rejection, an international rejection, and we also contributed to this rejection.
And from there began the caliphate and the siege.
And last month, Israel killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the ceasefire.
And we let them starve until they're exhausted because we don't want them in power.
Those parties, happiness of the Sheikh.
I clearly state that the Palestinian conflict
"That is, if there was"
The creator of the Palestinian conflict, perhaps there was a Palestinian conflict.
Tell the other party that you are one hundred percent right.
I'm not saying Hamas is 100% right.
I'm not claiming that and I'm not saying that.
But, the average worker is usually in the middle, equidistant from everyone.
And it is not just the middle end, but as Arabs, we are equidistant from everyone.
But we don't want it to exist, so we must end it by any means necessary.
Once in training, soldiers right and left.
And once by confining them and not granting them money or salaries.
And once we set a positive example in the West Bank.
Let the people of Gaza see how people live.
Luxury living
And vice versa in Gaza.
I was invited to a second Arab ministerial meeting, but this time...
Any ongoing talks between Hamas, mediated by Turkey.
These meetings you were invited to attend seem to be trying to bypass.
It would be disingenuous if we took another initiative.
We lack initiatives.
In this issue
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
We call for a role to be taken and we support any Egyptian effort to achieve understanding.
But it's important
Why don't you come?
Tomorrow with a party that seems to have been dominated by another party.
And not the path to harmony.
Balanced Egyptian Initiative
Between international demands, Arab demands, and humanitarian demands.
And the requirements of Egypt's role, which is an important role.
It is a leading Arab country that we all respect and appreciate.
In your opinion, is this what Egypt requires?
The proposals now, the current initiative, do not meet these requirements, Your Excellency.
I have a vision for the initiative.
We hear some information from here and there.
I can't comment on something I don't know.
With all due respect to the Palestinian government or presidency, which should exist, and we all recognize the Palestinian presidency.
But there are also people
We must also take the viewpoint of the injured in the other party.
To carry out these intermediate tasks
From one point of view
Hamas' position is clear that this decision did not take our viewpoint into account. How could it be issued?
The decision to involve the Arabs in its formation without consulting or seeking the opinion of the first party concerned in the matter.
We of course deal with Palestine as a state.
We deal with power unilaterally.
But now there is a split in one party somewhere and another party elsewhere.
This doesn't mean that if we deal with people from Gaza, we'll cut ties with those in either the bank or the Palestinian presidency.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
They ask a person from Gaza to be with them.
And now we start coordinating with each other.
What was announced.
Firstly, the resolution did not mention a mechanism, but welcomed an Egyptian initiative and any other initiative.
Some consider it a mechanism.
This is an explanation, but from my reading of this decision, it welcomes an Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative will succeed in performance.
That stops the fighting.
I have no doubts about our brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the Security Council resolution.
And consider this decision to be null and void since Israel did not accept it.
Even if it's accepted later, things will have changed on the ground.
Yes, Your Excellency, the Sheikh in talking about Egyptian efforts.
In cooperation with Turkish efforts at the same time
Or an Arab excuse.
Or Arab conflicts that cannot reach a solution, and thus came to fill a void.
Supposed to be filled by Arab parties
I welcome Turkey's stance.
A stance that Arabs and Muslims should appreciate.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
So this is a natural role.
And that people should follow him.
There's no Arabic pronoun that can fix this situation.
One says, "Let them finish the mission."
There must be a clear, decisive Arab stance against all this aggression, procrastination, and continued fragmentation.
There is an opposite Arab stance.
Israel can postpone the decision, I am not talking about an Israeli-Arab war, and we are the people who always call for peace.
And we are a country that loves to live in peace.
But I am not calling for an Arab war, I am calling for...
A clear Arab stance
Within the framework of initiatives and proposals, of course you are following what is happening.
The discussions, proposals, and conditions set by Hamas
You think that
Now as an on-the-ground observer
And the politician who resulted from the military operation will now allow Hamas to set its conditions.
Must he be right?
We agree on this point and disagree on this point.
The second thing
I don't know about these negotiations, as I told you, they aren't there. Oh, now they are negotiating.
The second thing
OK in the required centers for Arabs.
This is Arab realism.
He saw us after the start of those operations.
It seems that a very advanced position is being taken by the Arab street.
As governments, we have...
Of course, I'm sorry that some people misuse others' gifts.
They're telling me about this subject again.
Represents the views of the people.
The presidents now.
It means, "If they want to."
At least they see what.
A request with a high ceiling and a modest ceiling.
End normalization and diplomatic relations with Israel.
Qatar to
The office of Israel's representative in Doha was closed.
Qatar, which takes this stance.
We believe that the Arab side should be revolutionary and take revolutionary positions.
Anything agreed upon by the Arabs will be a collective agreement.
Not at all if we had an Arab agreement.
A treaty is one thing, and relations are another.
Okay, we're ready.
To keep up with our Arab brothers
If there is a decision and clear Arab honesty.
They deal not only with others but also with countries that have relations.
But also countries that do not have any of them.
This is very important.
Don't become agents for others.
He says why doesn't Qatar set an example in this field.
If this is the only model, we are ready to be in it.
But we also want
Qatar's Arab model is committed to part of its Arab commitment.
Just like.
And no one sells to another.
Our problem is that trust between Arab countries is missing.
Unfortunately, I don't want to reveal our secret, I don't want to tell the brokers.
Therefore, it is very important.
For formal occasions anywhere because we should rise above this.
Some called the ambassador. Some organized protests. Some expelled the ambassador, like Chávez.
That's part of the dispute.
But some called for the ambassador and those who summoned the permanent member states, and these are all movies about our people.
We talk about the modest ceiling of people's demands.
Why are there people demanding the opening of fronts when there are people demanding Syria to open its fronts with Israel?
Listen, I told you that we call for peace, not for a confrontation with Israel.
And we don't want to fight Israel.
To fight against Israel
And how will they agree?
This is also a problem.
What brings us together is stronger than what drives us apart.
You said, "Sheikh, you have caught my attention."
It is on condition that states do not sell each other.
What does it mean?
I mean now.
The street won't spare us.
His Excellency Sheikh
What is happening today is a continuation of a project that began in 2006 in the Lebanon War.
Or there is a disagreement.
I don't think there are disagreements on the goals.
Lebanon had liberated land.
Some parts, of course, are still assumed to be friendly to the United Nations.
Or something similar.
Lebanon means we have dealt with the Lebanese issue to a great extent.
Israel, of course, needs weak states around it.
So he can control and have the upper hand.
Of course, there are states that support them and foreign ones.
That's why he wants to remain the only power in the region.
And now they want
To change this example with Gaza
In Lebanon, you speak with several sects.
And how many sides?
In Palestine, there is only one side.
But I can assure you once again that the problem in Palestine is that they listened too much to a large number of Arabs and foreigners.
And from here the gap began, and everyone thinks they will rule the other part.
In your opinion, as a viewer and follower
As planned, it will end in broken bones.
Do we Arabs accept this because it might happen to those who disobey?
Or he expresses his opinion.
Whether they are Israelis or others in the future
We set a high example.
In obedience and assistance in breaking bones
We have a moral saying: "I and my brother against my cousin; I, my brother, and my cousin against the stranger."
Now it's assumed that we're in any dispute with Hamas, and I'm not saying that Hamas or anyone else is infallible from making any mistake.
Each of them has mistakes.
Now we must leave this matter.
Bring the part to his knees.
Because here, failure will not be the failure of the group.
His Excellency Sheikh Qatar usually, I think, a while ago was trying to put forward suggestions.
Initiatives to find solutions have taken place in Lebanon.
In Darfur, they talked about this for a minute, even in a hurry.
I and
We don't like to rely on our brothers because sometimes there are some sensitivities.
One state will manage all these facilities, we don't have a problem if there's a solution.
Our goal now is not to make Qatar a main headline.
What was one of His Highness the Amir's goals?
One of his goals was how to stop the bloodshed.
End the dominance.
What happened was beyond imagination.
And we are in Qatar.
Do we know something they don't? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is good intention.
To achieve an honorable solution
Talking about initiatives, it is useful to know what the initiative regarding Darfur said about the Justice and Equality Movement.
The Sudanese government in Khartoum
And it will mainly focus on solving the Darfur problem because the Darfur problem is in its initial stage.
The Arabic assistant helped.
But we didn't internationalize the issue.
Based on revenge from the system, and now we want to solve the issue but we don't know how.
And we always strive, as mentioned earlier, to implement decisions; we are the best people to implement decisions.
Removing the case from the competition. Is there also a competition in the Darfur case?
I don't want to go this way.
Before we wrap up the conversation, Your Highness, there is an economic summit.
Will this summit be held? Are you going to attend it?
No, we will attend the summit.
We wished it could be held in an atmosphere different from the Arab atmosphere, but it was planned.
This would be a shame.
Okay, if the Arab leaders attended this summit.
When Palestinian blood was shed in Gaza, they were meeting for financial and economic reasons.
Assistance with heating
But it seems no one is afraid of this street.
You never know what might happen, of course I hope nothing happens to us but safety first.
"And safety"
But no one takes someone in their little pocket.
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, many thanks.
Welcome, viewers, wherever you are, peace be upon us.
So what is the usefulness of this celebration and the truthfulness of the statements of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights?
It is people with disabilities who are the most neglected in the world.
What about our Arab region and to what extent are they concerned about this issue?
These and other questions will be asked of our guest on today's show.
Former Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Conference on Disability
He earned a Bachelor of Arts in Social Work and Sociology from Qatar University.
Master of Arts in Social Planning and Social Policies from Helwan University in Egypt
And held several positions in the field of disability.
She was a founding member and general coordinator of the National Committee for Disability Affairs.
In nineteen eighty-nine
And he has been the Vice President of the National Committee for Disabled People since 1999.
Until 2003
He also contributed to the establishment of the Al-Shifallah Center for People with Disabilities.
People with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest has overseen the launch of numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
and activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world
He also contributed to delivering lectures, participating in meetings, conferences, and discussions.
Hello, Ms. Hessa, welcome to this episode.
People with disabilities
Initially, we called it disability, perhaps in the eighties and early nineties.
The most educational concept for
Among those who are given such instructions
An important document at the United Nations appeared in ninety-three.
"Let's define the term before we get into the details."
From other regions, although there are regions that are not classified or classified as developing countries and are classified as poor.
And Latin America, especially Latin America, in fact, this trend there is stronger than in any other region.
But the statistics proved the opposite.
The direction of legal rights exists in the Arab world and was found in many countries.
Resources might be available, and political will too.
Okay, here let me tell you that there are some statistics you might know about.
Eighty percent of them are from poor countries.
UNESCO says that around ninety percent of disabled children from poor countries do not go to school.
Lady Hassa, how come you're not commenting on these statistics?
He is largely genuine.
I have seen it in Darfur, in Gaza, and in areas exposed to similar events, such as wars and conflicts.
There, you can't distinguish between disabled people and able-bodied people because they are in such large numbers.
In fact, the number of children suffering from female illiteracy, for example, is around fifty-three or fifty-two.
And in other countries
In the presence of many obstacles that prevent these children from reaching school, even without disabilities.
In fact, the city doesn't have any infrastructure, even if this child finds a school.
He can't reach it.
For the children and other inhabitants
These agendas and projects are great, but we hear little about them.
Except when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated a few days ago, what is the goal of this celebration?
The situation in the world
Better than able-bodied people.
In organizations, I arrived and established many projects.
Implements a very important healthy strategy.
Through this strategy
There is a correlation between humanitarian affairs and working with marginalized groups such as people with disabilities.
Now there is a degree of awareness in the Arab world and it is better.
At the point of awareness, we pause to take calls and continue our conversation.
Thank you.
I have two questions I'd like to ask because they were at the United Nations before.
The second point
United Nations laws calling for the fight against systems that hinder society, such as the Syrian intelligence system, are now in place for the benefit of children.
Is there a law that allows for the prosecution of the regime as is happening in Syria?
Yes, Suleiman, your question is clear. Suleiman Kraou is from Syria. Thank you very much. With us is Nayef Saeed from Kuwait. Hello, Nayef.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you too.
Good evening
Good evening and welcome.
If you don't mind, I am one of those with intellectual and mental disabilities.
The Arabs heard the man say, "A free man understands by gestures."
And there is a verse in the Quran that says: "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Allah who has given us speech. Praise be to Allah who has given speech to all things."
I sat for thirty years without speaking a word or two a day.
So praise be to Allah, exalted and glorified, who enabled me to speak.
I was referring to the Quran, and I had found.
People attack me because I use the Quran as a reference and consider me a hypocrite.
They attack me, not knowing they are at the bottom of hell.
I only got insults.
And what he says is the truth.
If your house is made of glass, don't throw stones at others.
It is natural to have psychological disabilities.
The inquiry of Brother Suleiman also falls within the same definition.
United Nations programs or what are their reactions to the causes of disability such as political or other goals.
Go to several agencies and organizations.
To discuss with them, convince them, and find out to what extent.
On their agenda regarding disability topics and issues
UNESCO, the International Labour Organization, UNICEF, and the fact that these organizations have already addressed disability.
He is one of the programs that try not to lose sight of children with disabilities.
With good opportunities and schools
From various environmental aspects
UNICEF as well
But there are shortcomings, we must acknowledge that there are shortcomings in the United Nations as well.
What are the most obvious weaknesses and inefficiencies you've mentioned?
United Nations Security Council
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
I was in my country, the State of Qatar.
But it had routine and bureaucracy.
My work specifically sometimes deals with constraints or limitations.
A fighter or a tryer when advocating for the recognition of people with disabilities.
Until he reached what is sufficient, but he did not place it in a separate article as the global movement of people with disabilities wanted.
But a certain part is somewhat suitable.
Unfortunately, there is no coordination among them.
This is one of her main flaws.
Survey, which was administered by the Special Rapporteur and applied to States
Among the employees or individuals working on those programs
Unfortunately, we only received three responses out of forty-eight organizations and agencies, and they only provided us with three responses.
What are you putting?
The issue of disability is persistent and sustainable for many years, although primarily it is a human rights issue.
In the past few years, thank God, about two or three years.
The issue of disability has at least been raised through events such as seminars and the like.
Peace be upon you
Perfumed lady, why are there no binding laws and decisions for Arab countries, and who is responsible for activating these international regulations?
For Arab countries and the allocation of salaries, for example, allocating a salary for the disabled.
Is there money allocated by the United Nations?
Will this money go to governments or to UN agencies, and will this aid actually reach the disabled?
The final remark: If there were no binding decisions for Arab countries.
Thank you very much, Ahmed Halabi from Greece.
With us is Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia. Hello, Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
Why adopt this proposal?
which consists of writing directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations
Move it to this box.
Productive factory
Allocating only one percent of the annual net profit
I'll return to our guest to answer the callers' questions.
He said that he recommended surgery to the doctors but
It's too expensive and he doesn't have enough money, so where can he get help?
He is from Algeria.
I think it's important to meet Brother Naji's needs.
Like any other rights, the rights of persons with disabilities
All these rights and duties must be acquired by the citizen.
To participate in the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this agreement is legal and binding.
And fulfills the rights and needs of the people within the homeland.
Or even at a non-governmental level
Obligatory for all states and will be bound to ensure the enforcement of these laws.
At least at the level of officials primarily, there should be an awareness.
It must be at least if we work on these treaties in this way.
Even if there is no significant commitment to it.
Was there a response to the monitoring report you conducted, and was there interest?
But don't forget the standards, it's actually a morally binding document, not legally.
There is a commitment and it is legitimate.
And it is understood that these cases will be resolved or discussed or will be within a community suffering from many problems.
Naji Zakharna, Director, Qatar Center for the Deaf Sign Language Expert at Al Jazeera
First and foremost, Mr. Ali would like to express his sincere gratitude to the Island.
The presenter is currently broadcasting a live episode.
Now Ali is speaking and saying that he is very proud.
She was a servant to all the special needs people in the place where she was and still is.
We support her and stand by her always and forever.
And I also say that there are many people with special needs.
Some people don't know about this agreement because there are no training courses.
For them, especially in schools or hospitals or in public and private institutions
It is essential to disseminate this agreement.
As a law dealing with people with special needs in all countries of the world.
And I emphasized and insisted that these countries
We accept and sign this agreement.
Like the State of Qatar, some countries have signed this document aimed at serving people with special needs and serving us.
Many thanks, my friend Nagi, I speak on behalf of Ali.
Many thanks
Your opinion may influence a decision.
The former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Disability might start with a proposal submitted by caller Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Establishing a fund to support
A fund for donations and accepting any contributions from countries.
This means that the fund is supposed to be spent on the activities carried out by the special rapporteur when he is busy.
And indeed, among the Arab states, only one has provided donations: Syria.
To address those commitments, a problem exists within the United Nations, thus
The box
Lack of commitment from member states, unfortunately, and lack of interest.
Unfortunately, many people say boldly that we don't care about the situation now.
In fact, it's a matter of obligations.
On human rights.
In its broad and comprehensive form
The marginalized, especially
But for this reason, there are those covenants.
Because these countries must honor their commitments, yet a good idea was presented by the brother.
Therefore, it is very important that there should not be one independent box, meaning independent in form, but rather the organizations that may exist in the region as a missionary.
I have it in their budgets.
Offer special projects for people with disabilities in Gaza.
Assistance for people with disabilities
The subject always involves political factors.
His state or government dramatically guaranteed its support.
The number is unfortunately decreasing.
In symbolic quantities
The father is disabled.
Of course, he was stripped of citizenship.
They took his daughter.
Sometimes from
Teaching problems
A traveler or we left, we are perplexed.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you too.
And we can
They rebuild themselves with knowledge.
I hope that Arab countries will allocate a portion of their budget to this.
Many thanks, Behjat Kawan from Kuwait.
Aisha Mohammed from Qatar, welcome!
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
Good evening to you and Sheikhah Bint Khalifa.
I just want to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In recent years
With our best wishes; Parents of children with special needs.
For Her Highness Sheikhah Hessa's continuous support
A noble standard-bearer from Tunisia, welcome.
At another level, the genetic one.
I think there is a genetic level of care that reduces the percentage of disabled people.
In our Arab customs, a man always marries his daughter, niece, or first cousin, and so on.
At this level, a level of disability and thank you.
Can you comment on what the viewers said?
Indeed, as you said, at the national level.
I know there are programs for guidance and support.
Fall between the cracks of healthcare services.
which also falls under the umbrella of Hamad Medical Corporation.
I think inside the psychological clinic and also programs in the Supreme Council of Education
Special Education Department, to be honest, I don't know if it still exists.
But it is certainly within healthcare services. Yes, there is support and there are medical services.
The qualifications presented for these cases
Prevention is better than cure. He pointed to the genetic factor and consanguineous marriage. Are there any campaigns?
For example, to raise awareness.
In this area
Certainly, this is a very important and serious point.
One of the things that I and others have dealt with a lot of talk and a lot of shares.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns, and they are not just targeted.
Implemented by the World Health Organization
Also for UNICEF
Now in many Arab countries including Qatar
And certainly Tunisia.
There is now a binding decision for early inspection.
And it has been implemented in many countries.
This is all from the preventive side.
And do such campaigns get any positive response?
Especially when it comes to customs and traditions.
Of course, the difficulty when he encounters the collective culture.
Let the decision rule, let strategies rule, let the will to face it and commit to it rule.
The issue of early screening, for example, as it is a very important matter before marriage.
I ask you if there are statistics about people with disabilities.
Especially people with disabilities from the Arab region.
Arab region
And especially
With the recent events that have taken place in the region
In conflict zones, in wars, especially in wars and conflicts, and so on.
For every person killed, there are three injured.
And what happened in Lebanon, Darfur, and many other places.
It's not enough, and the first thing is the subject.
Human rights principles
There must be something for people with disabilities and their programs and plans.
Agendas within current institutions in ministries in the government and non-governmental organizations
In circumstances such as war or unrest
Only for you, the words of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay.
In the world, the strangest thing is what the International Committee for the Monitoring of Disability Rights said that the census...
To the extent that disabled people are not included in statistics conducted for residents.
All they announce.
For example, in the State of Qatar, when censuses were conducted, I think it was more than five years ago.
But frankly
In collaboration with the Planning Council and
Prepared by the Council indeed and with our participation like the Special Rapporteur's office.
To add more disability categories
Expected things to be found
Types of those needs, all these important details that should lead you to a result.
Is there a disabled person or not?
But at least
Statistics are progressing in this regard.
Peace be upon you
Machine, thank you for this program and thank you Sheikhah Hessa.
But I thank God that I am Qatari and receive all this care from my country.
And my daughter is now a student in independent schools and is benefiting from a good education, praise be to God.
And I would like to thank Mrs. Hessa.
Her encouraging role and her role that prevents us from fearing or worrying about our children.
Praise be to Allah, and thanks to Him, to her, and to those on whom this group relies.
Many thanks to Fatima Al-Dosari from Qatar, still with Qatar with Latifa.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
My good sister, reality, expectations, and what we anticipate is the solution to our children's problems.
Where is the role of our Qatari children's sheikha?
I hope she can answer this question.
Hello, peace be upon you
And I testify to the special service provided by the State of Qatar for the hearing impaired.
We had a program for early detection of hearing loss.
In a higher council for people with disabilities
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability.
Even civil society meetings of NGOs or other communities
Due to reality and what we hope for, if you compare them over the course of five years.
What was provided to people with disabilities five years ago and now?
Many thanks to Karim Naseem from Jordan. Now we return to our guest.
Of course
The entire community, along with its individuals and especially its families, who
Children with disabilities have great ambitions and expectations.
Whether at the planning level or at the operational level
But as for one of the points you mentioned, which is a very important point.
Children who cannot obtain documents or otherwise, whether in Qatar or anywhere else
An international convention is like many international documents.
And committed to translating that into plans and strategies.
To automatically provide those services
Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, gender, or sexuality.
Okay, Sheikhah Hessa, you served as a Special Rapporteur in the past at the United Nations on disability after six years of work.
Did you wish?
Perhaps there wasn't enough time or the financial aid wasn't sufficient.
Many achievements have been accomplished, and I am proud of them.
Through my participation or through existing organizations and government institutions in many countries.
Especially in the Arab region
There will be more research and larger studies there.
We started with the global survey and had more than one report.
Community awareness is an ongoing process that must be continuously worked on with drama.
Cooperation among Arab states
And among the people themselves are those with disabilities and their organizations because they
But they have a duty to fulfill.
They must fight for
Many thanks
Thank you.
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode, I thank everyone who contributed to us with an opinion and a comment.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will meet a new guest.
Join us with your messages and thoughts in a new episode of "Live" with safety.
Good morning
I'm so happy you're here with us.
First, before we start, we'll ask you different questions and chat in the morning.
Thank you, Shaima. You might have congratulated me.
The entire Middle East deserves this international achievement.
Qatar has truly put a pin on the global football map.
Thank you, Qatar.
Ali also go forward Oh! Ali
First, I want to say good morning to the viewers.
And I extend my congratulations to him and to all Qatari citizens for hosting
And, God willing, as Sheikh Mohammed said,
It was a dream, and with God's will, it will become a reality, and work will start from today or during the announcement period.
Did you expect Qatar to host the World Cup in two thousand and twenty-two?
Despite having strong files like the United States, Japan, and Australia, you were not intimidated in this field on this particular subject.
No, look, to be honest with you, I said it was seventy percent that Qatar would get it.
Very strong
Why global plans and competition?
We were competitors.
Why are we afraid?
But praise be to God, Qatar's bid was really strong and deserved it.
True, the profile 2022 and two, the World Cup and the hosting in Qatar.
So what do you think the athletes themselves feel?
They are in the field, of course they feel very happy, God willing.
I want to say %pw, we were talking off the air, but we want to hear it on the air.
The moment of announcement.
Where were you, how did you hear the news, you were surprised, tell me, and tell the audience.
On the radio
Then all the people joined us.
They heard about the announcement.
How did the international media find you?
On the level of sports channels, everyone was supportive, especially the Arab channels, praise be to God, everyone supported us.
Ever since they announced Qatar's win and that it had secured the hosting rights,
All Arab countries have announced their full support for Qatar, through media, human resources, and volunteers, in the future.
Gulf countries are known for their dignity.
Even at the level of international media, Shaima
I went then to celebrate in Souq Waqif.
Even the AFP was filming there.
We also had interviews.
Everyone cooperated, Qatar now, on a daily basis, is being mentioned.
A hundred times a day, believing it to be the smallest spot on Earth.
I suppose everyone will know Qatar even online.
To host the 2022 World Cup
I mean, any footballer dreams of serving his country, by being in the team.
Of course, any player, whether in the Qatari league, wishes to represent the team.
In it, it is a positive thing that someone works very hard to
He is in the league, even when he is in the league he does his best.
In training sessions or matches, because he wears the league's logo on his shirt, he must conserve his energy.
Look, the responsible people have made a great effort in taking care of the young players, teaching them professionalism from an early age.
Eat, Sleep
Tell me about your experience, having played in multiple age stages, how was your experience, and what was the most important stage for you?
Was, of course.
I progressed step by step in the league, from the youth team to the first team.
You know camping with the club and with the league.
Every stage has a special mark.
Yes, Lana, God willing, you were walking between.
We've gotten used to you because of Lana Sports.
We always see you as a sportswoman. We love to see you and get sports news from you. So, how is sports going for you?
Frankly, I don't find a difference between talk shows. In talk shows, we host stars in their fields, and in sports, we also host stars.
Like Ali and others in their sport.
On the contrary, the sports field is active.
Especially since we are the capital of sports.
And Qatar has now become the capital of sports and world football.
Instead of presenting various talk shows on social, economic, and cultural topics
In different fields, volleyball, basketball, different champions.
But it's still a sport.
Excellent, superb
I frankly wish
I wish I were ten years old right now, not twenty-five.
For I think that the young players have gotten a huge opportunity.
I hope they benefit from this opportunity.
That's great, Ali. What do you want to tell the players?
God willing, the young players who will have a bright future in the coming days, God willing.
Of course, I told you it's an opportunity, they should take advantage of it.
It's a golden opportunity.
They have a big advantage from it.
Tell us, what's your job, what new programs will you present, we know we asked you to come during your vacation.
So tell us about your news, God willing.
Always keeping up with events, we are preparing for the Asian Cup which will start in January.
Just a few days ago, we finished the Gulf Cup. Anyway, we want to say congratulations to the Kuwaiti league.
The news broadcast is also available to cover events.
My first media appearance was through Qatar TV, of course, my roots are from Qatar TV.
I'm grateful for their kindness.
Let's convey the media message through various channels.
Either private channels, sports channels, or other channels.
So, thank you Qatar TV.
We wish you success; we are still on the same subject.
First, I would like to thank the management of Al-Wakrah Club.
And its fans, I was at Al-Wakra Club since
My childhood
The sheikh was with us yesterday, Sheikh Nasser was with us.
Still at the club
I am still a son of Al Wakrah.
But, as I told you at the beginning of the program, the professional.
Relevant to every individual in Qatar.
We know that young people already love and depend on sports.
How can we make sports social?
Media awareness primarily plays a significant role in promoting sports across various aspects of life.
I said that youth are addicted to it, and schools have also become aware of the importance of sports in school.
For example, they celebrate any sporting event.
In Qatar as well, you see signs on the streets, this is due to sports awareness.
Allocating seats for women in stadiums and anywhere.
This also highlights the awareness and participation of women in the field of sports.
We now have a Qatari league for women, for female players.
For I believe that sport is evolving.
I also believe that this period of time
For massive projects and raising awareness of sports, I think this timeframe is sufficient.
If considered and implemented with care.
Sufficient, yet at the same time necessary to use wisely, as I said.
And also, at one point, how does the young generation benefit from the league?
Everything is available, including possibilities, experiences, and equipment.
There's one more important thing. Praise be to God, we're in Qatar. As all Arab and Gulf societies know, we're renowned for our passion for sports.
How to attract this audience to keep up with sports news, football matches in Qatar.
And attend the matches at the same time
Most Qataris love sports and football, but the problem is that they don't attend.
When you browse forum discussions online, you will find a great deal of interest, especially in most club forums.
There is great interest in the football league.
As a Qatari citizen, in your opinion, what is the best way to attract you to attend, aside from being a sports athlete or player?
What are possible ways to bring in the audience to attend, for example, your friends?
It depends on the individual themselves, there is no universal concept.
Some people like to watch it on TV at a gathering in the house.
For example, Japan, Japan has developed a wonderful plan to attract the public in a big way.
When they attend matches, they collect points, or anything, so they are looking for solutions, so hopefully.
and Arabic
The most important thing is that every player will be here in Qatar specifically in 2022, Lana, what are you saying we need?
Without financial support, what do you think we really need to do?
Providing the means to make them ready as a national league and participating in a massive global event, the World Cup.
Time flew by with the kindest people. When the producer told me time was up, I truly said, "Inshallah."
We always achieve the impossible, realizing the dream we thought was impossible. Alhamdulillah, we live it in reality.
As Sheikh Mohammed says, they were moments of celebration, but the hard work began.
Insha'Allah, 2022 will be an event worthy of Qatar's name.
I congratulate all the residents of Qatar, and I am frank, Qatar has become a global landmark.
To host 2022
Thank you, Lana, for the excellent introduction. I wish you success, and I will always follow your shows to keep up with sports news.
Thank you, for sure happiness.
Young Qatari talents
They are singing a new kind of music, which is popular these days.
But in the form of repetition with music and a fast rhythm.
And also an amateur rap group, God willing.
Stay with us, we're starting right now and good morning.
We'll try to take a look at it.
We can define rap simply by saying it's fast music.
It does repetition performance, but not the rapid rhythmic singing of the words in the song.
This consists of many titles and covers a number of different topics and issues.
It can be personal sometimes,
Social, emotional, or political.
Most of the time, it is controversial.
And I'm quite liberal.
The rapper performs, our viewers do not sing the song lyrics,
But he repeats it.
He is deceived by his voice, which is considered a secondary element.
Usually, the sound isn't important in rap songs.
Why is he not called a singer, but rather a rapper or a rap performer?
Rappers care about these elements in songs:
For example, flow, flow of sounds, synchronization, and delivery.
They have followers, an audience, and fans.
They have a unique style of rap.
And I think they'll give you a better idea than I personally can.
Good morning, hello.
First of all, it was a time when we wanted to do something new.
Be distinguished by something.
So we said, "Why don't we rap?"
Rap is an art present in all countries of the world.
So why isn't there any in Qatar?
So we said, "Let's invent something new."
We gave him an idea that contained a message.
We discuss the benefits and drawbacks that occur in society.
So we present a message first and second, it is art.
This is one of the various arts, for the viewer's information, and it has addressed many social and psychological issues among youth seriously.
Time changes, and I think this is linked to the changing times.
Before, there was little acceptance.
We've been singing, since around two thousand and five, acceptance was slow at first.
We can say that our new beginning was in two thousand and ten.
In greater acceptance and popularity.
People like to sing and do the same thing as the rap style these days, didn't you notice?
Yes, certainly, a high percentage of people.
There's one more thing we need to talk about. You were founders of many teams.
A beautiful band, and I think you have concerts. Can we talk about this band?
How was it founded, how did the idea come to someone to found a band, and how many of you are there in this band?
Initially, before we formed the band,
Rap came to Doha starting in 2005.
This means that anyone who loves the concept of rap and who can rap, can sing and upload it on the site.
I can carry, Salman can carry, someone can carry, so there was a competition.
We met people.
So we started competing with each other.
After all this time, after all these years, we have reached the year 2010.
Before 2020, the group system meant that this group alone and three or four together.
So we said, "Why don't we unite as one group under the name 'Rapperz Qatar'?"
Q Rappers
So we decided this, we said under one name and we are all together as one hand.
And we're coming to present this thing and say the same idea.
Approximately twenty-five people.
Twenty-five, wow! God willing, a large group.
Does any of you play, or, or, or do you all rap?
Coordinate and write.
You could say it's personal.
Excellent, how are these twenty-five organized? How is this number organized in the band?
Each person has their own potential.
It means that every person in the band can make a whole song.
Without any help from anyone else.
But capacities can be different, for example if Salman is better than me,
He listens to her and says nothing, just words.
Each one could be a substitute for the other.
Let's lift each other up a bit.
Or a company adopts it, so that an official entity can adopt these works.
And there will be the right distributors.
So that the job can be done in a classic way and remain formal with you.
Honestly, we hope to gain support and receive backing from a company that came and adopted us by producing an album for us.
No problem.
Some matters are a bit difficult.
Why don't you consider taking the first initiative?
So that an individual can submit their first CD.
By doing this, you can later attract companies, what do you think?
Around 2007, I made a CD.
I distributed them among my friends.
How was the order?
I think
So because in 2007, rap might not have been prevalent in the Gulf.
But it's not as common as it is now.
We were talking before we were on air, for example, there are large groups like Valencia and Castro.
Shall we talk about her?
They said they'd throw you a party.
They covered all the costs, procedures, coordination, and work; unfortunately, we didn't expect this level.
Frankly, we were amazed and it was a wonderful performance.
But there was little pressure because there were no ads and there was nothing before the party.
There were no ads, or anything, until two days before the party.
We guessed that no one would come due to the short notice.
When we were inside, before the party started.
That's a good point.
That means our voice reaches families as well, not just young people.
We thought the idea would appeal only to young people.
But at this point, we discovered that there were many age groups listening to us.
Is there a particular song that the audience likes?
The audience interacts with most songs.
I, most songs, but there were a lot of songs and we were many.
The whole group
Words, how they address different issues
We talk about the current situation.
At least, even if it is...
Even if they spoke, before *
It must be so.
I mean, it rhymes.
We think about every word and try to find better synonyms.
Come, you have few songs, let's listen to one of them.
One of the songs I produced.
Let's hear it and see the public's opinion.
I hope they like the words.
Thank you, Ali. I liked the introduction because it included the name of my program.
This is a KDE DJRM Doha program.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Jim, Mrs. Bobo with SKT One Hot to Body.
Don't forget, the program airs at 9:30. Everyone must watch.
Produced by Hasan Naama, Presented by Shaima Al-Hamadi
Director Nasser Al-Maliki, and the guests are Qatar's rappers, of course.
Because it really contains the name of the program, thank you guys.
I have to clap my hands for you and the people in the control room.
We broadcast it last night.
And who wrote the words, or is it?
Everyone writes their own words.
Because if I wrote to Joseph
They don't just write it for the love of singing, the passion.
I suppose you should write about the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup, I suppose if you can.
Ah of course, personally, I'd recreate a song about this topic.
But, I don't think it can be official at this stage.
So I assume there must be some national songs.
Through the art of rap
Oh, now, today, all people
We are watching a live broadcast now.
The cup has arrived and Doha's streets are decorated.
There, as we saw, Doha is adorned to celebrate the Asian Cup.
The concerned agencies have made all preparations to host.
And there will be more crowds.
I suppose they'll gather along the corniche.
I'm sure they're ready to host that major sporting event.
What parties are you going to in the coming days?
In an offer, they promised that they would arrange a party for us.
But, still, there are some complications.
Certain procedures and issues, therefore, we're not sure.
So let's try, when you meet Joseph and see.
Some of them, I have a theme song,
If we find that it fits the song.
And the possibility of doing it.
When I am at home
And then send it to Joseph via email.
This is the part of the song for Youssef.
In another need, do you like to travel abroad?
In this field, those with millions of fans
Don't imitate him, but we listen to people who are experienced in this field.
But we try to be competitors.
Why don't we take some ideas and simulate some things?
But I flip it, take the idea and apply it in a different way in my songs.
I formed a band and we have more than one CD.
A person named Abdullah Daiyel
He has the experience and ability to detect groundwater.
This talent is the ability to detect underground water tanks.
One of the residents of the city of Marrat.
In many experts
Who determines the location of groundwater before drilling?
That means or there will be some wells that need to be drilled where there is no water.
Using copper bars and pomegranate branches
Or tin, through which he can identify water tanks.
What are the tools used?
To detect groundwater
That was in ancient times.
But now, it has been replaced with copper elevators.
So we placed the two bands parallel to each other.
And he walked slowly.
We notice, when we walk along the watercourse.
The sticks are going to open.
Now, we're passing by a watercourse.
It blooms like this.
As we crossed, it starts.
Now we are in the middle of a waterway.
And here, the medium will be.
So, in this way, we can determine the path of water, or groundwater, in the earth.
And the process is repeated more than once in more than one location to determine the most severe site.
Abu Ibrahim confirmed
To reach an advanced stage of this journey
His discoveries are very accurate.
In times, outside times, in Shaqra, Hariqla, and Al-Athaithiya
More than one hundred and fifty wells have been discovered.
The error rate does not exceed five percent.
He needs training, experience, and a grant from God.
Overcomes modern equipment and laboratories
In a short time
Abdurrahman al-Marshed
Doha Morning Show
A city, northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
We'll show you this report and we promise you more reports from Arab and international countries.
And the Gulf countries, God willing.
And we reached ( ) and different topics but they have
True meaning
I assume there is a large group of Gulf youth in the Gulf.
What specific people do you follow as examples?
He follows rather than imitates.
There is a general connection among all Gulf rappers.
It's not a competition, it means if I produce a song.
He is dealing with a specific topic.
We can call it a foregone conclusion.
We have connections, but no one is me.
In Saudi Arabia, God willing, it is.
It has fans and CDs.
Many companies want to acquire it.
Do you want to reach this stage, perhaps surpass it more and more, God willing.
We wish you success through this team.
There, at the cup reception, let's see some Cornish clips.
In addition to a group of Qatari youth
That, even if borrowed from the West, is in a Gulf style.
There are also love rap songs and a unique band of twenty-five people.
It's important that we stay in touch and know your news.
I assume you have an email or a website or a forum.
How can people communicate with you?
We had our own website.
But there are some issues with the hosting company.
It would sometimes close without apparent reason.
In it, we faced many problems and eventually decided to close it.
No use, the site will definitely close.
"What is it? What are the solutions to face this problem?"
United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and even Morocco and Egypt
You communicate with them to get the latest news and the songs they produce from time to time.
So, what's the alternative now?
We currently rely on special pages like
In the name of what?
Okay, when you Google our name.
Qatar's rap or Qatar's rappers
You can produce your own music video.
For the program, I worked on it yesterday.
We uploaded many videos to YouTube.
Songs with pictures
A song and a breath, with pictures.
I think we should see you develop further.
You need a place for all of you to gather instead of each person having devices in their own homes.
Mixer, piano, computer, and guitar
Frankly, I hope we find support.
For example, a company.
CD production
We were allocated a special place.
Working separately
A drop in the bucket, at the end of the day, we're still working on our own projects.
It's not what we want.
Not different from what Joseph said.
We need a video clip.
And album
Videos make the song go viral quickly.
Conveying ideas as quickly as possible.
If there is support, everything else will eventually fall into place.
And your beautiful voice will be everywhere.
It is a type of art that deals with various issues and problems.
Thank you, Youssef Al-Naemi and Salman Al-Abdullah, for attending.
Let's see it and show them our support. All the best, guys!
These projects were, yes.
There's a project that's almost ready, but it needs some technical development.
Expiration Date
When you go to the cashier, you have the total bill and all the details.
Knows the goods, instead of reading the components of each commodity.
And I walk with the cart
Attached to the cart, so you can choose the material you want.
Most projects reflect children's feelings to solve a problem.
I have many activities and goals.
The center offers a range of programs and activities that focus on one main idea.
We have ten goals set by Her Highness Sheikha Moza in establishing the center.
Also possible, yes.
That which he conveys as good news to the underground train from his house.
But his idea is that it's for clothes.
All stores in Qatar that sell shirts will appear.
It could also be with the car key, I press the button.
Identify the things I've lost and take me to the key.
Yes, let's go back to the projects the center will work on.
Early childhood education
Developing skills and nurturing talents
In it, there is a difference between the various skills of children, media, and research skills.
Personal skills, such as public speaking and persuading audiences
Skills vary, and we have developed a special program to cater to them.
We worked with Media of the Future, this was a legitimate right, we have reached the end, the project is complete.
We also have numbers of speaking children and adolescents.
And their creativity...
Do you have young broadcasters?
For television, it's important that they provide programs for children.
We're preparing them for television.
Through their television, Qatar TV
We support them until they turn eighteen.
We welcome them wherever they are.
This is also the national television.
We need to attract and enhance the discovery of these talents.
Media, research
Intellectual dimensions
Reading and various other fields
Is there collaboration? Do you exchange ideas?
In all fields, such as the Promising Preachers Program sponsored by the Ministry of Awqaf
Our exhibition, the Generation Violin Exhibition
The Science Club played a significant role in improving projects as well as providing technical support.
The main role was for the Higher Council for Education, through supporting schools and partners.
Sir Abdullah, move towards building something like Katara.
Also embodies a range of activities and clubs.
Do you consider that a push towards more success?
In addition to moving to a separate building
Regardless of the very large place
And it makes it easy to deal with the public.
And among them are pioneers and excellent projects.
And in receiving guests and introducing them to programs offered for the child
It is our main project for the next three years.
National Development Project for Reading
Under the patronage of Sheikhessa Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
I adopted this project and you supported it.
A big project, developing reading and writing stories and nurturing children.
Various cultural skills related specifically to reading
There are certainly different programs.
We recently moved.
And we're rearranging some activities.
Its design, and improving it to suit Katara visitors
We wish you success, through this center.
This contains very important ideas.
First, I want to thank you for hosting me.
The most important thing is that the more we deal with children, the more we discover that
Childhood today is different from our childhood.
They need more care, focus, and time.
Listen to his interests, his imagination.
Communicates with him mentally.
They ... %pw, their way of dealing with their children is like a hotel, they provide accommodation.
Or like a bank, save money.
Real boys need someone to listen to their ideas, their imagination.
In the past few days, they transferred us to 2030.
At this exhibition
I wish success to the winning projects.
Thank you for being with us, Professor Abdullah Al-Jumaily, Director of the Child Culture Center. We wish you success.
So that these projects can be realized and not remain a dream forever.
Hello ladies and gentlemen, the Children's Culture Center was launched last night at the Diplomats' Club.
Closing Ceremony of the National Exhibition of Dreams of Future Generations under the slogan "Dreams of the Generation.. Reality or the Homeland of Tomorrow"
Organized on the occasion of Qatar's National Day, with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar.
There were many activities and several competitions at the exhibition.
Children's Creative Projects
We welcome Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Children's Culture Center. Good morning and welcome.
Good morning, dear sister.
First and foremost, I'd like to thank you for giving us your time.
Speaking of this exhibition, it's really unique.
We are happy to have you with us on the program to cover as many of the exhibition's activities as possible.
This is the National Exhibition of the Dreams of a Generation
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. This is the exposition.
Contribution from the Center for Children's Culture
Celebrate the National Day.
"Who was"
In an attempt to stabilize the children
Live with a dream.
With the project
This project or dream
Children's imagination is very expansive.
We have bound her with twenty or thirty.
And other key areas of Qatar's Vision 2030
We want to train the children in four stages.
Then, think about the brainstorming mechanism and the tools that expand the scope of thinking.
What exactly does this sentence mean?
Is it facts or the nation of tomorrow?
I mean, whatever the child dreams of today.
He will grow as the project develops.
In fact, that was the true explanation of the vision, that the children will live from today.
With a big dream
Whether it's environmental, health, human development, or any other field
He who serves the country.
I think when we know that there are children somewhere
Or at a specific exhibition
All that was available through
The exhibition, there were also guest of honor.
Children learn from them, as an old model.
Yesterday, a day or two ago, there was the *
As there were winners of various awards in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a schedule for submitting their projects.
Yes, the pictures are the best evidence of what you say.
This is a collection of photos from the exhibition and various activities.
Here is also the owner of the last project, the forest.
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
An excellent idea, we can simplify it for the viewers, this is one of the children's innovations.
What exactly is this topic, the colored ball, let's talk about it.
Suddenly, there are four or five projects dealing with this subject, one of which is the colored ball.
The clever professor was also invited.
Once the ball goes out of bounds.
Colors differ.
I think in the future, this will help a lot in matches.
What's next, after all these dreams?
And he sticks to matters related to his area of interest.
I assume especially when there are responsible people who take these small projects into account from small minds.
But we don't know, maybe these projects serve us, what does the football federation president say?
Think about the idea of a colored ball.
Does he like it?
Often, he visited football-related projects.
Support us and embrace these projects the moment you see them.
These projects were also adopted.
It was our children's work, people also voted for many projects.
Okay, what were the projects that were on the ballot and received the most votes from people?
There is an evaluation committee with a method to evaluate projects.
The first, second, and third projects that won the awards.
The forest, won the first prize.
He was very precise in the details of the projects, and the project was ready for implementation.
Of course, it needs many administrative elements.
There were very detailed points in the pamphlet distributed to visitors.
Surely the pictures we see now.
These are some big projects.
Maybe they're not exposed to what they see in movies and cartoons.
It actually works, part of it has been adopted by institutions.
For example, let's name the projects, what are these projects?
To collect, use, and recycle them.
Out of two hundred and forty-seven students
Qatar University celebrated yesterday the graduation of two hundred and forty-seven students from the thirty-third batch.
And His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, Minister of State for International Cooperation
A large number of parents and faculty members
The university is celebrating today the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen female students.
We would like to thank our colleague Salman Al-Majed, and we are going to continue in the same artistic atmosphere. We will have a very dear guest today.
From the family of the serial classifier, the actor Abdel Hamid Sharshani.
He proves himself through numerous works such as Hearts for Rent,
They strived hard to prove themselves in the art scene.
Especially since the field of art does not know praise.
Which means
Thank you and all my best regards. Good morning, and I hope to say to all the viewers, good morning.
No, I'm impressed with the cast of the show.
Here, we'll read a very short scene from one of your works, and then we'll start talking to you.
Are you complaining about me?
Take the fake coat and leave the original one.
Go get it.
You have the coat, you will return it.
What? Leave the coat, bring it to me! How can I bring it to you?
The heifer has already trampled her in the belly, damn her.
I am a member of a five-member committee.
In the Higher Committee of the Conference
I won't agree to that.
I have no objection.
This is a quick glimpse, a very short part of the series Tsanif that we will watch the second part of.
We would like to ask you about your participation this year in Part Two.
Can you tell us about your parts in which there is a series of classifications with a different theme in each episode?
What is your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
Of course, later.
I went through tough times back then.
Famous peaks are also associated with the mountain.
The quantity that poets have celebrated over time.
When history is a witness and remains in the city's memory,
And it shows how historically old it is.
Located 170 kilometers north of the capital, Riyadh.
And those who believe that it was named after Amr al-Qays al-Tamimi.
It is characterized by its archaeological sites, the sweetness of its water, and the freshness of its air.
Poets drew inspiration from her and enjoyed her company. She was famous for her renowned mountain, Muta.
They call it Wadi Kmit.
Of course, Marrat City is an ancient city.
It was established before Islam.
There were some old things with an unknown history, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
What we're currently in.
The Prophet's companion Khalid ibn al-Walid (may Allah be pleased with him) ordered, during the time of the Ridda Wars, the digging of this well.
It's still standing.
The proverb says "Commit once, and I'll vouch for you twice."
If you see Kamit, you can see times.
Another effect is the Wadi Kmit.
Any sweet river will do over the years.
It was enough for the city for a whole year.
From the beginning of the rainy season until the next rainy season.
The date of the establishment of these monuments is unknown.
The following is Al-Aross and there
Mount Komit is one of the landmarks of the city of Marrat.
There were many proverbs based on this mountain, poetry, and poems.
Many people from different parts of the kingdom come to it.
One of his most important works is the Al-Waleedi Well.
This is because he stayed in Medina during the Ridda Wars and was on his way to Yamama.
He camped there and ordered the men to dig this well.
Some people still drink from its water and wash in it.
Yaqut al-Hamawi writes in Mu'jam al-Bulan that Khalid passed by Marot.
It is an old house made of mud that has been restored to its original state.
It consists of multiple sections reflecting the area's architecture, heritage, and antiquities.
The poet once said of her: "When we passed by the water, it was free water."
He came to us on a dark horse, not a white one.
Mr. Ayman is there, God willing, with cooperation between the family, guardians, the center, and also the child.
And I think there are different ways that you can have with you at the same time.
Generally to run the training process.
Since everything that comes to us, whether it be the apprentice, the student, or the child,
This record contains his full personal information.
Even his monthly grades, for example, every month he has a rating.
We were responsible for the Minds program.
In every four sessions, there is a report.
The guard through a password and username,
We gave it to him, can he enter?
Yes, he can see the level he has reached, since he registered at the center until now.
Yes, we have different models that we will see.
We have a daughter.
With Mr. Ibrahim, who will join us later,
Here we can see different models. I wish we had enough space.
Alright, we've brought a model of a girl.
You will then undergo various tests before being broadcast.
Here we will ask her math questions and a series of questions.
Here's a short break, and then we'll be back with you to watch this smart girl. Stay tuned.
The actor's performance, the audience is very smart now.
If any show from the first, second, or third ring catches his eye, if he feels he's not interested in the show he'll use the remote.
He's self-reliant, he has twenty thousand other strings to his bow.
Correct, the Twenty Thousand series, that's right.
Twenty thousand episodes. Some people don't care, he focuses on one job.
He can follow other tasks.
That's true, that's the majority.
It is claimed that I only watch TV during Ramadan.
Of course, we welcome you among us, our dear and honored guest, Abdelhamid Charshouni.
Do you want to say something to the audience, or to your fans who love you? Of course, I'm one of your fans.
Do you want to say something?
And I say to them, happy new year.
It's true that we don't go out much, don't appear much and don't do much for that reason, I just mentioned the reason.
What's coming is better.
Insha'Allah, we wish you all success in this year's endeavors.
Insha'Allah, we will have another interview with you, so we can talk about those plays.
Everything leads to the other.
Due to the popularity of fashion shows among many people and the expectations of trend enthusiasts.
Welcome, dear viewers, to our live broadcast from the morning of Doha.
Of course, today we are talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of students who have registered at this center.
This center offers a variety of different sciences.
Of course, they focus on developing other capabilities.
And also to keep their minds fully engaged.
Mrs. Naseema and Mr. Ayman Khaliji, Executive Director of the Skills Development Center.
Hello and good luck.
Welcome with us.
And with us is the beautiful Oumanya, good morning Oumanya.
Good morning
How old are you, my love?
I am in the seventh grade.
God willing, we wish you all the best.
What things are presented to our sons and daughters?
This was clarified with Mr. Ayman and Ms. Nesma and was specifically directed for the benefit of our children.
Which program is the mind for mental engineering?
By fingers and abacus.
To achieve certain specific goals, we tried to present a small part of them.
Did you feel, Sir Ibrahim, that there was really a difference with the student on his first two days?
And after maybe three or four months?
Whether he was studying in public schools, private schools, or even independent schools,
Basically, the program works scientifically on specific methods.
After completing the first level of the program,
The display that shows the missing capabilities or needs to continue developing them.
And what level has it reached or what updates have occurred to the child?
So we work on a scientific method, a scientific program.
Not all methods and mechanisms are applied in a routine manner;
But in a scientific, organized manner.
Before the start of the program and after taking this course or the levels he has passed.
Mr. Ibrahim is with us now, as you can see, viewers. Amia is one of the students who joined this center.
We've chosen to do this right away today, to show you superior people the importance of this.
If you're going to return the mission, I have no objection.
This part is very fast and a small part of a series of classifications that you will watch the second part of.
But as we have seen, this part of the series is part one.
Can you tell us a bit about your role in the series "Tsanif," which covers a different topic in each episode?
It became clear this year that she...
"Qafil Fadil"
He who promotes, gives opportunities.
It will consist of twenty episodes in two seasons.
He will be a manager in a ring, one ring will be an old man and the other ring will be a baker.
Alright, it's a set of rings.
Mr. Ghanem Al-Sulaiti is from Qatar.
We have representatives from Qatar.
I can't remember many actors now. Of course, we have actresses from Bahrain such as Zahra Arafat, Ibtesam Abdullah.
We have
Faisal Rashid and Muhammad Adil.
Certainly
Without Tara, the young actors won't perform.
We have little work in Qatar now. There are two jobs a year.
Qatar TV also produces dramatic works, can we say that too?
Qatar TV provides an executive producer.
Qatar TV did their best, but they produce one show a year and all Qatari actors want to work.
That was the reason.
I replied to you. It's just one series, and all Qatari actors want to work on it.
For if one finds a blessing, they should thank Allah.
Praise be to God for everything.
So we go back to your beginnings.
Of course, I want to thank him a lot.
I consult him on various matters.
Of course, the actor Abdulaziz Jasim is one of the best humans, even after the discrimination, yes or no.
In his plays, we started working with him in theater when he became the first executive producer. Abdulaziz Jassim, we worked with him for television and theater.
It is He who brought us up, taught us, and nurtured us.
Then, Mr. Ghaniem in his autobiography, did his best, in Visa Tosh 2000.
Because it gives us opportunities as youth.
They have thirty by thirty and two jobs a year.
We have two tasks a year, so thank you, thank you, Tara.
The killer feeling is produced by Tara Arts as well.
The chain manager is Mr. Monir %PW.
We're back, dear viewers, and today we'll be discussing Reflexology.
The message is in the palm, the palm of the hand.
This treatment has actually been practiced since ancient times.
We have a guest with us.
The test method is as follows.
It's swollen, the degree of pain.
You can feel inside that there's something like sand or broken veins inside.

Let's work together, I advise everyone who is listening to me right now.
Make charity a habit and deal kindly with people. You were created to worship God and then...
To serve people, that's the first thing. Second, I'm not a religious leader or a sheikh, I'm an ordinary man.
I would like to thank Professor Abdulaziz for this wonderful dialogue, and also our guest.
Thank you for your visit and I wish you all the best.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of Public Health at the Supreme Council of Health, will speak more about it.
Good morning, Sheikh.
We start by looking at these activities.
The program is healthy steps towards Qatar.
The program is part of the national strategy to combat obesity.
Around four of the world's top countries in terms of obesity are Gulf states.
We launched a strategy at the Supreme Council of Health, of course, jointly with the Ministry of Education and other bodies to combat obesity.
I'm afraid it will spread more and more soon.
One of the programs to combat obesity is Healthy Steps for Qatar.
We can hold this competition together, that way it becomes an international competition.
The program consists of six weeks.
Every week is different from the next.
To make seventh and eighth-grade students aware of the importance of health at this age,
Because this is the first age at which they become aware of themselves.
In the first week, as I recall, it was about what is your favorite fruit?
The second week is going well.
You have to walk! The more you walk, the more points he gets.
This is a map of Qatar, and whenever a person earns points, they move forward, progressing their school and their class.
There is a beautiful competition among the students.
In the second week, he drinks water, we don't want him to drink soda.
We tell him to drink water, not to drink so many sodas whenever he feels thirsty. Drink water!
Later, in the fourth week, your favorite sport.
At school, there are some games that some people don't like.
We are looking for a sport he loves.
So we force him to exercise.
The child is eating a healthy meal.
And her family knows they should let their child eat a healthy meal.
And Al Jazeera Academy, an academy for girls and boys, so that we can take.
Of course, this is a model, and with its success, God willing, we will gain more experience in the coming years.
The students are happy and feel more energetic.
We need more games, we had so much fun with our colleagues.
The girls say their skin is better now, and the pimples have decreased.
That's true, that's true and it becomes knowledge.
Parents know about their children.
And their classmates from different classes, asking them how are you? And learning from their classmates.
Praise be to God, many schools are already expressing enthusiasm to participate next year.
Inshallah
Qatil was the official sponsor in supporting this.
We had Aspire Zone, which provided sports competitions and awareness.
On, on, on, on the dining table.
Well, thank God for the many authorities, some of which you mentioned and some you overlooked.
But praise be to God, all participants are paid a part.
And the other, the brothers did it in the form of separate lessons, curricula, or
There was variety.
We tried to do different kinds and include as many people as possible.
They are the next generation.
To spread this experience as much as possible in Qatar.
When you're settling in, there are things that need to be fixed.
After its spread now and its satisfactory results,
God willing, we will participate so that people don't ask us why we weren't there.
You eat, you eat healthy and you get there, you don't have a problem.
When we are at this age, when it starts from a young age, it will reach what it wants by the age of twenty or twenty-five.
Your Excellency mentioned a series of titles, each group had a title.
If we go back, we'll try to make our segment today about closing events.
And when we reminded people again, in our program, we had more than one host.
We repeat, what information do we want to present to the student each week?
Okay, of course, the first week is your favorite fruit.
Each chapter was about fruits and their benefits.
What are the benefits of fruits containing vitamin C?
He starts to like some fruits, not all fruits are his enemy.
He might be allergic to one or two, but why not eat the rest?
The second week is walking, people think that walking is only for the elderly, and why should young people walk?
So when I grow up, I'll walk.
On the contrary, you walk because it calms your mind and brain.
And that eases the individual, meaning he walks with a clear mind, his thinking improves.
I took the students for a walk.
Yes, they were all required to walk, whether at home or at school.
They are recording their points with the class teacher.
I walk every day.
That was an event; some people held a procession, the girls' school held a procession.
We want them to like this, be creative with unique ideas.
The spirit of competition and teachers should think outside the box; we don't want them to give them ideas they have to stick to.
Everyone has a skill in this thing.
Of course, in the third week, drink water, all the time we try to make them drink water, so they don't feel thirsty and craveậyậyậyậyậyậyậyậ
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite sport.
If we can find out his favorite sport and support him in it,
He is interested in sports.
In their love for sports by playing them, he plays sports unconsciously.
We said before that we would talk about the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Qatar.
Let me welcome our guest for today who is with us in the studio.
Thank you.
We're happy to have you here at this show.
Including these diseases that some of us may not have heard of.
Initially, as the Egyptians say, we will go straight to the point.
It's a chronic disease.
Impact on the nervous system in a person's body.
The period between twenty and forty years.
These diseases are still incurable, and the cause of the disease is unknown.
It affects the active segment of society, usually the youth.
Treatments used for cancer patients, may God protect you from any harm and other illnesses.
This disease is an infection in the brain and spinal cord.
Central nervous system of the human body.
The body assumes that a foreign body is entering the body.
A neuron is
Cover this wire.
White cells or white blood cells start to kill or dissolve this insulating layer.
The one who leads when the nerve signal doesn't reach him, or weakens, or is interrupted.
It leads to paralysis, God forbid.
No, with the development and progress in medicine, there is still no cure for this disease.
Alright, apart from the solution, we want to know how to get it.
Also, one needs to be cautious about this thing.
The main reason for it, is the quality of life, the nature of food, or circles of life?
Or what is the exact direct cause that leads a person to contract this disease.
Everything is theories with us now.
Even through marriage.
They are trying to solve the health problems that humans suffer from.
Yes, yes.
All of these topics may be controversial in some way within society.
So far, we don't know his reasons.
Okay, what age group might be affected by this disease, multiple sclerosis?
Of both sexes.
Of course, after forty years, the disease starts to subside with the person.
So far, we haven't found a solution to these diseases.
Is this evidence of a lot of people in the Gulf, the Arab world, or let's talk about Qatar.
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, statistics indicate that they have twenty-five thousand cases.
And Qatar as well.
Recently, just last week, I was told about three to four cases that were diagnosed.
At present, we have one hundred and twenty-five patients, as recorded in the files.
Many people, when they confirm the disease, go to treat in other countries.
Alright, Mr. Abdulaziz, has there been any similar case of someone affected by this disease?
Are there any signs that inform the patient's family or the patient themselves that they are suffering from multiple sclerosis?
And this virus, for example, kills.
We must know this well, it is not a virus.
Due to the nervous disease, the nerves control the whole body.
In providing a specific reason for a particular location, the nature of the food, or the lifestyle.
