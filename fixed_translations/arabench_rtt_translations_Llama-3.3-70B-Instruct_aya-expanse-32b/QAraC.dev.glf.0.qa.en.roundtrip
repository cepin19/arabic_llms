environmental I'm saying what you refuse to understand, Saleh.
What's the problem? Saleh, open your eyes, open your mind, look at the world around you, see what people are doing.
If my brother is blind
He refused to improve himself and improve those around him.
Oh Saleh... Don't be stubborn.
No, no, no, no, I don't care about anything you say.
He walked in the street.
And some dates, two dates.
And you're hungry.
Will you eat or not?
No, I'll eat.
Tell me, did he accept it?
Your husband is too old to accept that.
I've had enough of it.
This is our chance, our cars are shamefully old.
Try to talk to him, please.
These things are common and normal.
Stupid! He has a lack of self-confidence.
Haha, scared?
What's making him laugh nervously?
He is in charge of the budget.
Isn't this the project he's responsible for?
It's a massive government project.
Hidden at the bottom.
I have the right to take the money.
Do you have another job in a different ministry?
Oh mom, how could you forget!
And today in the workshop
Which means I will do.
I consider myself a participant!
It's not fair that I don't get anything from him.
Am I missing something?
This means I'm involved too.
We're all supposed to take.
This is a government project.
But your stupid son won't make a difference.
Here I spoke with him.
The good that you reject
This is a government project.
This is your chance.
Just like others do.
The feast is before you.
Take your share.
He only had one dirham in his pocket.
I heard it myself.
It is known that government projects are...
And the final third is negation.
His son Salem
He went to Souq Waqif.
One jellyfish cost him eighteen riyals.
Price it in the budget.
Each person has one hundred and eighty riyals.
They said they hadn't done anything wrong.

Seek refuge from the evil of Satan.
I, but I remember him changing his mind.
God willing.
He is the president and everything is in his hands.
Sure, don't forget us.
We are your friends.
When we are together.
A government project like this is an opportunity.
Ah, of course, Ali.
We don't have the ability to do it without you.
Don't worry, Ali.
God willing, all those involved in the project.
Of course
Yesterday, I was talking with our friends.
From your side
We are not afraid because you are members of the project committee.
They are worried about Saleh, the project manager.
They say that
Don't worry, Ali.
And tell your companions not to worry.
Are you sure, Abu Fahd?
This is good news.
Oh God! Saud, don't forget.
No, no
Inshallah, everything will be fine.
Let Saleh agree first.
I'll do it.
I was wondering if I'd get some interest.
Possible?
Then, you're involved in the project because you work with us in the same department.
But the most important thing is that it remains our secret.
You found a plate of rice and meat in front of you.
Confirmation bias.
Your welcome
What's wrong with you!
If you're going to stay this busy,
He doesn't want to do it.
It won't work.
Or questions
We'd be happy to help you.
How do we get our rights?
Is it logical?
What shall we call it!
We're the only ones who will be taken.
Every participant will get their right.
Why not!
Don't be afraid, Saleh.
We're the ones who will set the budget.
What about the land he bought today?
Did he find it too?
No one can afford to buy it.
Where did you get this information from?
He called me today.
Because my brother's phone was turned off.
I said, "What's stopping us?"
Tell your brother.
It is the other earth.
The one next to the land he bought yesterday.
Agreed to the sale.
He said, "Please call him to confirm if he wants it, and I'll book it for him."
He doesn't want to share the money with us.
What about our money?
We are considered participants with him.
Even if we're not subscribed!
You're eating a big mouthful by yourself.
At least give some to your brother and mother.
I'm not here to ask you.
We are participants in the project as well, we have the right to claim our right.
Tell her, tell her.
It is true that when the sultan came and asked him about his right, he refused.
But you didn't agree.
You should give him a share of the project.
Phase one
You are no less than anyone else.
Project Committee Members
I heard him speaking to them.
They allow their brothers and friends to enter.
I know that government projects are free for everyone.
I don't want limited money and to make do.
Equity capital
That his brother Sultan can attend committee meetings if he wishes.
Because it seems that the committee members
Project budget
But we want to
Thank you.
Yes, Abu Saleh
Your wife's brother!
You will love him.
He will benefit from the project.
Let's remind ourselves.
We divided the task, right?
You, O Saleh
I'll be responsible for the cement, bricks, and concrete.
And leave the rest, from water to electricity, to me.
Oh people!
Take your share.
I, I swear,
Sometimes I decide to take some money.
And sometimes I say
Let me take a cut.
No problem, okay, no problem.
Take what you want using the method you prefer.
The most important thing,
We too,
Because during this week,
Everyone determines the amount of money they want to get.
For example,
And after a few days, they change their minds.
And I ask for more, one hundred thousand.
Okay, but why like that, eh?
What do you think?
I agree.
Even the participants,
Focus on your work in looting, brother.
It also contains the wealth of orphans.
More budget.
Many people want to eat.
Who does he think he is?
What is this! Is this your father's project!
Yes, he is a sultan.
Oh, my brother Sultan.
It means he is involved.
Is that the nickname?
Your friend Saud adds a lot of names.
He continues to add names, saying, "Let's benefit them."
In which group do I add it, percentage or amount of money?
No, put it with the beggars.
%pw How much do I need to give him! Put twenty thousand for him.
Yes, enough.
They even add a note here saying
He is our neighbor.
But Saud's list is longer than Abdulaziz's list.
All of it will be considered part of the first-phase budget.
As a bundle, no one will notice.
Ay, I'm in this list that my mother sent.
Every two hours you call and add people without asking.
Haha, may she live long.
My eye, my son.
Please, God, she is sick and poor.
But the woman has no money.
May God bless you, I told you so.
Tell him it's a liver transplant.
Hey! Wait, wait... How much is enough for you?
How much of this is enough for the liver, residence, and hospital!
Around one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
How many livers will you transplant!
One is enough, his sister is expensive.
Yes, God bless you, add her name to the list.
Good, yes, yes, Good daughter of Hialal.
Will you give her from your money!
Reassure him and tell him that I didn't take anything from phase two.
Oh, one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
Oh man, they're just replacing her liver with a new one.
Tell him, tell him to add two thousand, I want to buy gifts for my daughters.
Alvin
Write for me.
Yes, Husaina bint Hilal
Can I embarrass you in front of your friends!
No, Mother.
I have a lot of work.
Later, I'll talk to you later.
The people who ate from the feast increased.
The infrastructure is capable of enduring.
Don't forget me.
Write the number you want.
I don't know.
On your shoulders
I am the chairman of the council.
And I say that you deserve the million.
They decide that the project will start tomorrow.
And they will grant us continuous payments.
How! We want to know!
They will give it to us all at once or in parts.
Why is she taking more than us?
There's an electric shock or there's looting, it doesn't matter. The most important thing is that you stay quiet. We're waiting for them to come.
He told me to stop talking, so I stopped talking.
What are you avoiding?
If you hear someone speaking
I will sew his mouth shut.
We became very close.
You know this money, it's not easy.
How long ago was it?
Fifty million
It seems you're taking a big bite.
You are the boss after all.
We won't yield to pressures.
Let's agree on the budget.
Sir Saleh, from your talk about the project, we noticed that it is a very exciting and important project as well.
And not for this generation only
Ah, ah
Tomorrow, the first phase of the project will be inaugurated.
We would like to thank you for your presence and congratulate you once again.
And I welcome
On this occasion
I am from the United Nations.
Lean? For the project
Where are we going next!
I don't know where we are.
I'm sorry.
What you see is the officials speaking and the people clapping their hands for them.
We are at the official opening, what about you?
Alright, now speak, meaning that we are in the project.
Yes, we are in the project.
And people are sweating.
And these divisions, I don't know what they put inside them.
Leave the box alone.
These divisions are the infrastructure.
Official Opening of International Beaches
Third millennium, what's wrong with you.
I really don't know.
Ah, thank God, old age is a disease.
I wish I knew why they isolated me.
He's just parking his car.
I found this visit strange.
But when she told me
No one told me anything.
I saw it myself, on a big farm out there.
Praise be to God, you are comfortable.
You receive checks while relaxing at home.
Why are you tired, my love? Don't let anyone walk all over you, Mona.
You should thank your God, Munira, for having brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Saqr.
Their income is concerned about your share and invest it.
Here I see my friend now.
Her brothers don't let her have a single penny from her father's inheritance.
We act this way.
This is your legal right.
This is a matter of trust... You can trust us!
I don't know.
I am satisfied with what my brother Rashid said.
He always reminds me of the check they leave me every three months.
But, this is my right.
He always tells me.
Don't you trust us?
Money and inheritances must be clear.
If you, my excuse, are not satisfied
Do you have any idea what people are doing?
For example, the mother of Salman is a model for you, the poor lady.
Who would believe she inherited millions?
Because of her brothers.
Money destroys people.
But work is work, and you have a legal right to it.
And after that, what?
And we run the company.
Investment in land, real estate, and money
No problem, no hassle.
She said she was walking through the desert.
This is more than enough for her.
I'm afraid her husband Nasser is behind this.
What's the problem?
Your sister has started searching.
The problem
She's planning to get us into trouble.
We, of our kind, make it money.
Calm down, Satan.
We must find a solution to this, oh! Rashid
In my head
What is this?
Make me feel my father's legacy.
The charity he gives me every three months.
Everything is clear.
No more than forty thousand.
As if they're not putting in the money.
I see, I see, I see, I see
Clear
Clear.
They said let's give her more so she feels happy and stops asking.
That's correct, everything I said is true.
They are gradually tempting me.
If you only saw their wives.
She has many different diamond jewels.
And I am half of what they have.
They don't think I'm entitled to my father's inheritance.
If you ask about him,
This is your right.
Legitimate and legal right
I feel like they are stealing and cheating me.
I'm comfortable with how they're behaving.
Life is unpredictable, oh! My darling
You exhaust me, you make me sick, my love.
We know there is judgment and punishment.
And that God will punish them for taking people's money.
And be careful, don't mention anything about the court, my dear.
They will become happy.
Is it because of our population density?
That's why I'm telling you, my dear.
Calm down.
Everyone has an apartment that resembles a skyscraper.
I only want my right.
I want to build a mosque before I die.
Give charity to the poor.
Mother of the Believers
Shut up, darling.
And don't mention anything to them about the court.
Or anything else
I know why!
At this time
Her rights are stolen.
You were asking the accountant.
Who are you!! to ask him.
Answer them!
I am ... no, no, I'm here for your sisters.
The door through which I entered.
Don't slap your cheeks.
Do you know the door I entered through?
No, no
No falcon.
Alas, Saad.
Don't bother your head.
If you want your share of the company and property, we have no objection.
Six hundred thousand
She was comfortable her whole life.
I'm sure she's his evil wife.
She is also kind.
Just as I always beg them.
It is a known and definite legitimate law.
He tells me it's either six hundred thousand or nothing.
Not fair
Expect anything Oh! Munira
My father's company.
Eight buildings.
Without mentioning lands and houses
He says it's only six hundred thousand.
I agree to the waiver document.
No oh! Munira
Don't be fooled and sign that paper, be careful, I warn you.
It is your right to know everything about the lands, the money, and everything else; they have no right to decide.
But the company,
You are a partner.
Let them fire you from the company.
No one can stop me.
What do I know?
Is it your father's company?
I can't see him crying.
"It occurred to me to tell you."
Leave it, there's nothing.
He has a paper, I don't know what it is.
He's shouting at us, please be quiet.
Sorry
My brother Saad is going to the office and explain to them, they don't know.
Entered the interior
See if Mr. Nasser wants something to drink.
Please come in.
Sure %pw
You're going to get us into trouble.
He will see how many she has.
He will see that we owe her four hundred thousand, not forty thousand.
Let's calculate
In six and ninety months,
Here's the problem, multiply it by three hundred sixty.
Eleven million five hundred twenty thousand
Okay, what?
Why does he do what he can?
I'll ask him frankly.
Our money
All the people who inherited did the same thing.
Hello, welcome, let's forget what happened.
Welcome
Here is the accountant, Samir.
Answer whatever Mr. Nasser wants to know.
The whole company is under your management.
If you want to enter, please do, don't ask for permission.
Thank you.
Rely on me.
Go get it, boy.
To see all files
She is supposed to take more than ten million.
They didn't even mention it.
The poor thing said.
He left her father.
Four buildings.
I thought they had three plots of land.
Every land is greater than the other.
"Allah suffices us in all things, and He is the Heir. O my son..."
It's not fair that they don't happen.
Don't leave them alone.
What should I do, O Mother of Sahlman?
I have no choice but to sue them.
He will quickly read a newspaper or two.
The case is adjourned.
Beware, O children of Oh, O Nasser Oh
Don't mention anything about the court.
Madam! You are here and the doctor is looking for you.
My tribe is that of the Banu Salama.
Go to your room.
And all the Muslim patients
"What's up with me" or "What's my news" (depending on context)
Excuse me, who's speaking?
Oh, I remember you now, ayy, I remember you.
I I I I
About what, brother!
No problem, thank you.
Now that he knows we have money, he's gone crazy.
Do you think this is Abdullah whom I sent to them?
Is he a close friend of Rashid?
He knows him well, for years.
You can believe Mona.
Even Abdullah gave me some advice.
Chase them.
Don't leave them alone.
Try to take as much as you can from them.
Do you know what Abdullah says to me?
I am not for one who lives seventy or eighty years,
This is for people whose lives will be at least two hundred years.
Mother of Muslims, may Allah have mercy on her.
God have mercy on her soul, she used to say.
Our population hasn't reached four hundred thousand.
And the case takes ten years or more.
Do they need to *mummify* us to consult the court?
That's it.
Yes, my love, are you sitting with them?
Good luck.
By the way, he's an old friend from school.
Life is short.
And I ask for your benefit
And you come from a large and famous family.
Genuine and rooted.
Oh Rashid, we are friends.
Go and I'm still calm.
Or you'll get hit.
Go, forget the need for friendship.
"So you're leaving or what?"
Paid one hundred and ninety thousand for a diamond jewelry set from the jewelry exhibition.
Where did she get so much money?
They squander their money on their wives.
And her brothers deprive her of her money.
Are you still hoping, Nasser?
They killed you.
When I spoke to him yesterday at the mosque.
Let me do what I told you.
Well-known and grounded people
Maybe, why not?
But, I also suggest
God bless this talk from these bright faces.
O God, enlighten our hearts with what is good for us in this life and the hereafter.
You, listen.
If you have something to say other than the matter of my sister's share.
Correct
"I'd better go or I'll get angry."
I don't care what you say.
I invited you two months ago, and you refused.
They're fine.
Walking in the morning mist.
Get it for me.
Hello, hello
Don't listen to her.
She won't go to the court.
After tomorrow
Here's a chance to see how it will come to you.
Goodbye
The deceased is of no use to them.
And they realized that their reputation was at stake.
%pw Hungry, let's see what they decide.
Saud, are you busy tomorrow?
I've decided to take legal action against them.
I asked her to postpone it until tomorrow, so we can go to her tomorrow.
What is this?
You are correct.
I asked why.
You want to go to court and sue us.
To get your share of the inheritance
Yes, I did.
Your life will be beautiful.
Your life will be complete.
Why, I told you we want to leave the day after tomorrow.
When you get there, first park your vehicle in the parking lot.
You'll find the security guards.
Go to the eighth floor.
The judges are on this floor.
Business card data of all lawyers in the country
I'm sure you'll need them.
Come here to mock us.
We want her to start legal proceedings against us.
Go to the court.
Listen to *Manor*
Sign a waiver for us.
Which is better?
You know the way.
I showed you the way.
Go, brother.
I forgot to give Monira something important.
This is today's Al Raya newspaper.
In a very good article
A woman wrote it, I think she's a doctor.
I want you to see, a gift *from me*
His housing situation must be changed.
Regrets
He has four sons, but his house is a mess.
It will surely be, for he risks all his wealth.
He risked himself on this project.
I didn't expect that it would be Bou and Walid who would start the project.
Eat, eat, the new merchant's sons, Bou and Walid.
My love, do you want me to prepare something for you to eat?
No, it's not a problem.
Get up and move, get yourself some fruit.
Mom, I want Hamood's toy.
Good food, good life.
My son, Waleed, put candy out for your uncle.
Congratulations on the project, Oh! Bou Walid, you deserve it.
My friends found me an excellent accountant.
Thank you, thank you, my son.
Father, if we become big merchants, I want my own room.
Look what he asked, he has no ambition, my dear son.
Taf, I'll send you a large volume of BlackBerry.
Forget their desires now.
Like everyone else.
Replace our dear little house.
First, let's pay off all our debts. Then we'll see.
We're waiting for you, very happy, Bou Walid.
He eats more than before.
He is a merchant, may he be healthy.
All my father's trade is poetry.
Blessings to the project.
Save some for my friends.
God willing, may God bless you.
I found a Japanese young man, he was among them.
Where we were sitting, I switched seats with him, he gave me a gift catalog.
After that, one of my friends saw it.
He said, "It's an opportunity."
Multi-purpose halls?
100 days of school
They are computer labs.
Press the cinema.
If you want a playground..
This is magic.
Astonished, they all said yes.
I took a loan from the bank, and some of my relatives, I sold my land, praise be to God.
Now that he has agreed with the committee,
Why did the ministry agree to the time you requested?
And then an email will be sent to the factory.
He will call you when he arrives.
Thyme tea
Nothing, I'm still waiting at Ali's office.
The secretary didn't call, brother.
I'll be away for ten days.
It's a matter of luck.
My papers are ready.
And the committee approved it.
Why don't you sign it?
Aren't you a full-fledged CEO?
When you go to him, ask him to sign for you.
I told you he can't.
Not just him, all the workers there do the same thing.
Appearance can be deceiving sometimes.
You must thank God.
I was there trying to get the signature, and I was anxious.
Finished?
How can I do that when Father Fahd doesn't come?
What can't I do?
After this, I'll arrange my finances.
I want him to sign as soon as possible to get it over with, I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid the manager will ask about you.
Tell him I'm sick, anything.
I myself am waiting.
You, as his secretary, what about us?
And give me your mobile number.
Not the writer, please sit down, sit down, it's not him, what happened?
Whatever you claim, you terrify people, they thought the secretary...
No, we're still waiting for Bu Fahad.
%pw, My money for fixing the bathroom
He is stupid.
Oh people, wait, wait.
A lot, a lot,
He told you to shut up, enough, be quiet.
Bu Fahad has to go to the airport.
How did he get out?
Let's see him at the car before he leaves.
What's his problem?
God help you.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't blame your father, dear.
He's just acting strange.
If he does not accept the goods,
He will keep recovering his money.
And now she needs him.
Where is he currently?
What are you asking for?
Here, in front of you.
You're calling me in the middle of the night.
Brother, I told you.
I told you.
It's out of my hands, my daughter.
I know, Dad, but that's not fair.
The semester will start next week at the university.
If I don't enroll, I'll have to wait until the next semester.
Three months would be a waste of time.
My beloved, I am striving.
I don't think I'll go to the ministry every day.
Wait until Abu Fahad comes, Abu Fahad.
And I will stay at home.
I don't understand!
Don't disturb me at lunchtime.
This is the fourth time you've called me.
Are you stupid?
I know you need the money.
But I hope Bou Fahd signs the papers this week.
And they will give him the first installment.
I don't know what my sister likes.
He wakes up in a panic.
He walks in his sleep and talks to himself all night.
If it weren't for Abu Fahad, he wouldn't have signed.
God bless him.
Therefore,
Bu Fahad needs to sign this paper this week.
What's written?
He shows up for work once in a blue moon.
And he traveled for a year.
And leave the welfare of the people
Oh oh oh oh oh, what's the matter?
Do you feel better now?
Tears me into a thousand pieces.
This strange fever drags me, pulls me.
What does he want?
I heard I am the spirit of the ministry.
To process my papers.
He told the company's employees that he would punish me.
The time period is about to end.
Leave the phone, leave the phone.
I am Bu Fahd's secretary.
I want to tell you that
Bu Fahd will come tomorrow, for sure.
Every time I call you,
Come directly.
Okay.
I was never that kind of person.
I'm talking to you.
And your eyes on your mobile phone screen
I said shame on you.
So you feel responsible.
And if you adhere
I'll ask you to go back to your department.
Fifteen boxes of printed paper.
Fifteen boxes of paper for printing.
He is poor.
The manager punishes him.
By bringing him with us
Have you heard about the factory?
He'll lose his money if they don't sign his papers today.
If he went, the agent knew about it.
Yes, tell me.
What if the manager asks about him?
We'll handle this here, let him go.
Bu Waleed
I'm going, but I'm waiting for a phone call.
Tell me
God bless him.
Wait, people, wait, people, wait.
How can I know where he is going?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Do not move.
Don't sit.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't go to work.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
We have to go look for him in Uzbekistan.
Room after room
Alley to alley
**T
Call the hospital, quickly.
What does the hospital claim?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
I have spent my entire life as a messenger, for years, until today.
A long time, O Abu Saeed.
What did you think?
Perhaps around fourteen years.
As a messenger
My head hurts.
And the heat without air conditioning in the past years.
You think riding a bike was easy before.
With a yellow sign
It was a very difficult time, O Abu Saeed.
Pain, my son.
But what can we do, son of man?
Bu Saad
Taf, sorry guys, the manager came as he said, let's finish our work.
The manager has arrived. Oh! Great, let's go.
Congratulations, Bou Said.
They said your son Khalid was an employee.
Something I told you
I told you, God willing.
Thief's bath
I told you when my eldest son graduates, I'll resign.
Graduated and got a job.
Praise be to God, I've finished my work.
Served correctly.
Praise be to Allah.
Change your mind, oh! Bou Said
And you are worthy of it.
"Thank you very much, oh! Abu Abdulaziz"
I am very grateful, Abu Abdulaziz.
It's you or me.
We did our duty.
Let them continue the journey.
This is your right.
After all this age and work
Means all the back and forth.
You must rest, Abu Saeed.
After I leave here, my wife calls me.
I celebrate my recovery.
A cup of coffee and some dates, how wonderful.
When are we going to eat, son?
You're on a fast track because of the caterpillar, oh happy Busa'id.
Don't worry.
The carpet is ready.
I'm coming, for sure, goodbye.
I told you the contraption is ready, waiting for me.
I'll finish all your paperwork now.
This is your chance to introduce him today.
Their manager told me he would travel.
Keep walking straight.
I don't want to move until
Send it with someone else.
Now, you are officially free.
Thank you.
Now, you are free to rest.
Thank you very much, Abu Abdulaziz. Goodbye.
Congratulations to me.
There's no other job.
That means you're a free man.
Dad, please.
Yes, Human Resources
Thank you, goodbye.
Zahra is throwing a party to celebrate her son's success in the exams.
She brought a cake.
What I can
I sent my father myself to get me some papers.
The flower will be afraid.
Taf, Mama
My father left work.
May God guide him now.
Enough work, let him rest.
Let him rest.
He asked me to cook some khonafrush.
I gave him the choice.
And I waited for him.
Fear God and have mercy on your father.
Your turn now.
He will eat it tomorrow.
He likes to rest.
You've made this old man into a child.
As he went, so he returned.
He was tired.
What hurts me about them (singing)
What hurts me about them (singing)
I should take these papers to the bank on my way to work.
He said that he would punish anyone who came late.
Of course, my love.
Go to your job.
With this nose, and from these small Chinese eyes, goodbye.
Bou Saada
He sends you every day to a place.
As you wish, Mother of Saeed.
Yojes
In my nose
"Khunafresh Khanafresh"
When I went to the central bank
No dad, take it to the market branch.
And go there.
Sure? I don't want to go there and they tell me he's not here.
"Taffy is good"
I got sunstroke.
The sun hit.
I entered our neighbor's house.
The maid recognized me.
She asked me what's wrong.
What compelled you to do that?
No, Mother Saeed, I can't eat the khunfush now.
Mother, where is Father?
I'm going back and forth.
What bank does he go to?
They told him that some documents were missing.
I asked him to take a taxi back.
Mom, we had a meeting with the principal.
How is my father now, is he feeling better?
I slept a bit, the headache is gone now.
I'm telling you in front of him.
Leave your father, let him rest.
They are all sad except for Saeed's mother.
Everyone has to commit to their work, they will evaluate them, what can they do?
As you wish
"Path of the Shining One"
You could say I'm retired, but I'm not retired.
How?
Before, in the past
Misery is written on me.
Your children are grown up.
I have to help them.
They used to tell me
You are wrong.
Do you think all young people without a father don't complete their personal tasks?
It depends on the job.
In some jobs, they allow you to leave to finish your personal work.
May God replace your loss with good.
I'm close to you, the coffee shop behind you.
Where are you going, Abu Shahin?
I'm finishing some papers for my son, Saeed.
In this ministry, the one next to that cafe.
I'll take it to the Land Registry.
Goodbye
What's my mom's problem? Okay, I'll see you later. Goodbye.
This is what will benefit you.
I warn you.
I heard you say that to Saeed.
Your father is sick.
I don't care about you.
If your father didn't complain
He is silent.
And what they speak about
"I benefited from him, fear God."
Your very loud scream pulled me out of sleep.
Father, you were a government employee and know well what it means to store.
And they write this first.
And now they are %pw, working like this.
Tomorrow is the last day for loans at the Development Bank.
No, no, who said that?
Dude, come on.
You believed his lie.
He says he has a Sufi committee tomorrow.
What's wrong with you!
%pw, as you like
Go now to finish his work.
Nothing, nothing
He has been silent since he came home.
That's what replies to me.
You have no life.
I do not blame your father for being angry with you.
If you agree with this.
Often, and may Allah reward you with good.
He should've called you.
When he calls his servant.
You are the most respected among us, O Father.
And thank you.
Please forgive him.
Let me discipline him.
"And from now on, O Father"
And relax.
"Khunfush Khunfush (Singing)"
Thank you, ...
Your satisfaction, my father.
May God reward you with good.
We've decided that from now on,
Here we make our papers with our creativity.
Thank you all so much, may God reward you, thank God.
But please, Father
Consider him the other.
But I can't.
Call me now.
Father, I won't go to the meeting. I hate meeting the minister.
The minister will be angry with you.
No, no, no, that couldn't be, you can't disturb the minister, you have to go, even before he does.
I'm not going to see my father, what should I say, I don't want to upset you.
What are you saying?
Your papers are with me, and consider the matter done.
She's on her way, as soon as you can finish Saeed's papers.
Father, please.
Consider it the last leaf you fill in for me.
Glad to be of service to you, Father.
But your son needs to sign this paper.
You mean I have to go back to get it for you tomorrow.
I advise you to take it back today.
And if they don't see the papers
You will need to delay for two months.
No, take it from me until he signs it and I'll return it to you.
No, no, no, no need.
Call him and ask him to come, but only for two minutes.
Here we are.
I don't know if you're happy.
No, it's a vacation he's taking.
He comes after the sun sets.
All our friends are there.
Every time I ask a friend, "Where are you?"
He answers that he is with Saeed.
I waited until the end of the shift.
Taf, khoy or ok, man.
Why didn't you complete your paperwork yourself?
Why didn't you sell your stocks?
Doesn't she have any children?
Are you alright, sir?
Please, sir, take them.
Many thanks
No use.
I'm going to leave you.
Go to the elderly hospital.
I don't want to tell them where I'm going.
What are you going to tell them, Abu Saeed?
I'll write something else.
Ah, thank God.
He came from yesterday's generation.
Not my sister already
Why are you tiring yourself out?
I told him never to appear on television or radio.
These "stop corruption" talks got us into trouble.
O Allah, guide him to the straight path.
Goodbye, my sister, take care, may God bless you.
Did he go to prison?
I was absent.
What can I tell you?
The name of the program is Mylas, I think.
Spoke to the man.
Khaled Jassem
He told him to stop the corruption.
His colleagues heard him.
He started talking about the government.
And even petroleum and money
I didn't know what happened to him.
None of his friends are here.
Those who were encouraging him to do that,
He left it.
O Allah, guide him to the straight path.
Sorry, I must go and cook now.
Hello anytime.
Come, my son.
Sit here.
Stop corruption, son.
I'm tired and bored of this.
I've been in the hospital for two days.
You don't deserve that, Mom.
I'm sorry to hear that this happened.
What's your experience with this thing?
What is this, Mother?
And he raised his voice.
This pledge
God spared you this time.
I warn you.
Don't worry, Mom.
Okay, let's not talk about her.
Stop corruption.
Why did the company official fire him?
This isn't right, after all these years, you're firing me.
What are you hearing?
Stop corruption.
Again, please.
Yes Salah
You are a reasonable man.
One who follows public affairs and criticizes.
Well informed
Let's spend some time together.
And you are one of them.
There's nothing personal.
"Tasal, ma'a al-salamah" translates to "Ask, goodbye."
A good brother
I hope your uncle, Abu Munira, didn't find out.
He has been mistreating you.
"Who is he knows." (Note: The
If he asks you
Tell him I'm working.
I told you they were going to fire him, didn't I?
I asked his mother and she said he's still working.
Of course
Her mother has the right to say that today.
What should we do now?
We have no choice but to let him suffer with our daughter.
What are you waiting for? Go check it out.
I'll ask them in two months.
But if he doesn't find a job, I'll take him to court to divorce my daughter.
Drink your coffee.
You won't give up unless you have something in mind.
But frankly,
I want to go out.
You are banned.
I know you're dying to
Go to the café.
To speak nonsense
Go to your room and sleep.
And in the morning I will look for a job.
God willing, I will wake up early.
Mom, I told you, I've gotten rid of this habit.
I swear
Mom, frankly, I'm a little bored.
And don't speak incorrectly.
Act as if I were deaf.
It is a change.
What happened, man? Where's your voice? Why aren't you speaking like before?
We want to hear some of your talks about stopping corruption.
Stop corruption.
Stop corruption.
Salih is here!
He is believed to be asleep.
Did my son do something wrong?
Let's meet him now at the coffee shop.
"He didn't say anything."
Doing the right thing
Because there are a lot of people around.
Call him.
Don't waste your time.
If I see you here, I'll beat you up.
If it wasn't your fault,
It's his mistake that he didn't stop you.
I know you well.
You're like a person who's quit smoking.
How do we converse or not, do we stop corruption lectures or not?
I warn you.
If I heard you speaking on a radio program.
Or a halt to corruption.
Sir Saleh, you are a good citizen, you have a very strong sense of patriotism.
We can't hire you.
What can I do?
Sorry about us.
Hello Saleh, how are you?
I wished you wouldn't have troubled yourself to come. We appreciate it.
Not real
I long every day to hear him, stop the corruption.
You are a very brave man, you fear nothing.
Say it, just once.
May God bless you, I...
Is this a cigarette? Just say "stop corruption" please.
He's begging you, just give it to him, just once.
This is amazing.
Now, torture me.
Regarding the job
You are a loyal citizen, and very dear to us.
We were about to call you to inform you.
He was exposing you in front of people.
Are you serious?
Everyone said there were no vacancies.
They used to love to deceive me, but there were no job opportunities.
And now, how will you save money for yourself and your family?
And don't forget that you...
She had four sons.
God help you.
Do not despair.
Don't lose hope.
Don't stop.
You must look for a job every day.
So my father won't get angry.
I'll take any kind of job, just for you.
I won't say stop corruption again.
Stop corruption.
You don't know what he's doing these days.
I told you.
But you, you don't listen to me.
May God guide you.
I can go to the minister and tell him what this man is doing.
The minister will think.
Sure, he'll think about it that way.
You are correct.
But it's serious.
We have to do something.
They say he will replace you, you know such a rumor is very effective.
I'm trying to find a way to stop him.
I don't want anyone to feel like I'm behind this.
I agree with you.
What's on your mind?
The only way to keep him from influencing our interests.
Have you heard about Saleh's anti-corruption campaign?
He lives in my neighborhood.
And he will use it.
We miss your voice.
No good
I'm a big fan of yours.
Saleh is a very good man.
And I hope soon.
He's going to come back, and I'll enjoy hearing his voice.
Bu Fahd keeps asking about you.
Tell me, Saleh.
Why did you quit?
I had some problems, some health and psychological issues.
Frankly,
You are diligent.
I haven't heard from him in a long time.
Great, please validate.
Once, do it for me.
I want to hear you talk about it.
Salih says he agrees.
No, guys, this is too difficult.
What's wrong with you?
The man is talking to you.
Abdulrahman, I had already resigned.
You didn't tell us you were looking for a job.
Come, this is your chance.
Stand your ground and let him hear your voice, and go ask him about a job tomorrow.
He will surely provoke you.
I want your benefit.
Do you have an idea?
Leave it, I'll go to your house.
No, no, no, we don't need your help anymore.
Wait a minute, man. Let's discuss the matter.
No, we don't want it.
Confirmation confirmation
Imagine, if I had put the word "last" now, I would have stopped, but I'll do it one last time.
What does Bu Fahd like to hear?
Which problem concerns him the most? I mean, there are many problems here, too many.
What does he like to listen to? Or does he like chaos, I don't know, tell me.
According to the contract.
Use his authority.
80 bear = 7 centimeters
Ruined it.
Don't interrupt me.
Why did the officer do that?
Where is case number seven? Case number seven.
Don't interrupt me.
Number seven, minister.
Why did the officer do that?
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters
His brother's car garage
People, stop corruption.
Since your return, we want you to stay in touch with the program.
I am from a dear people, meaning, this is the last time.
To be honest, I stopped.
Mom, you didn't say he resigned, and that you fired him?
Yes, my daughter.
Yes, my daughter.
The man who is called the corruption stopper was talked about on the radio.
I didn't listen to her, but people told me.
I'm sure someone from the ministry leaked it.
Enough of him.
He is free.
Taf, Minister
Don't worry.
My entire day is dedicated to serving the ministry, may God have mercy on you.
Did you hear it?
I told you.
Neglect me.
He didn't speak to me.
Abdelrahman told me he would hire me.
He didn't speak to me.
You are miserable, Saleh.
I'm sorry for you.
I am Bu Fahd's secretary.
And I know the case.
They used you to achieve their goals.
But they reached it.
Do you know who planned all this?
Your neighbor, Abdurrahman
He's behind all of this.
Bu Fahd won't bring you.
You're going to do the same thing to him.
As long as I'm known.
No one is going to fool you.
I'll take you to court tomorrow for the divorce.
I found a solution.
We are the best community in the world.
Free of any problems
No, we don't.
She never has any problems.
We are pleased.
What is family favoritism?
All the people are standing in line.
Because it's the system here.
He gets more rights than a foreigner.
We depend on foreigners.
She doesn't have it.
Your effort and work make you the best, we don't have any problems.
Or an important officer
And shooting you
We're not here.
With my regards
Saleh Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Bahahiri
Known as the Corruption Stoppage
I don't want to eat dinner.
I was running and a dollar bill caught my shirt and tore it.
He's jealous because you wore a new shirt.
The father saw he was wearing the shirt we bought from Villaggio.
He dragged it with anger and tore it apart.
He's kind-hearted, he can't blame.
I believe.
You, Adoul, saw my son was handsome and you envied him.
Not on him.
Why did you take off Walid's shirt?
I saw him wearing a new shirt and you got jealous, ask your father to buy you a new shirt.
What do you say about yourself?
Why did you bring Walid's shirt?
I'm telling you
Don't hurt yourself for someone who doesn't care about you.
Sultan, my brother
Why don't you just hit him in the face and disfigure him?
He's a little boy, not your age, he's shy.
Is this a child?
Yes, a child.
He needs people to raise and fix him.
Not just lift.
Choose your words, Sultan.
You think I'm a child, to correct me.
You are arrogant.
Raise your child with goodness.
Even if I am unable to do that.
I respect him.
I don't want to scold him in front of his wife.
and the brothers
If Adel hits Waleed again,
I'll punish him.
I'm the one who takes my time debating with you.
Mind your own business.
Let me go and see her.
Associate with fools
Where have the days gone?
And the intentions were clear.
Forgive us
Do you have a larger one than this?
No, no, this is bigger.
Leave everything and come now.
Come and see the problem we're in.
Yes, my love, tell me what happened.
My brother Ahmed, please excuse me, I have to go home. There's an urgent matter and I must go.
Adol's pants are gone.
He is a hateful and sick person.
He is a sultan.
How did the child cut all these clothes?
God is the Provider, I have not used them, God is the Provider.
Here he showed up.
Sit down, listen to me.
If you go and talk to him, he won't admit it. He'll say it was the child.
What shall we do?
Walid, do you know how to ride a bike?
Yes, I know.
Walid, my love
Yes, I'm telling the truth.
But tell me
Where did you put the scissors, my love?
Under the bed
Destroy them, may God destroy their lives.
But I'll show him.
I will not be silent.
He is crazy, insane.
Until now
And do not change it.
But the computer is something else, I'll show you.
I will not be silent.
Do you think Adoul's son crashed their computer?
Ask him to come, let's see who's behind this.
No *
Go and mock someone else, perhaps your friends, not me.
I told you it's Advil.
I want to go to someone else, oh! Cheetahs, not me.
Alive, come please.
Our hearts were kind.
And the intentions were clear.
Is there a boy?
I don't go meet friends.
Let it be on me, not on you, O Sultan!
They accuse me falsely.
Hold those scissors.
Behave yourself well.
Hello, Abdurrahman, come quickly, my son.
Come and see your brothers Fahad and Sultan.
They fight every day, son!
I don't know.
At a meeting like this,
We must be.
We think deeply about our actions.
The works of the people who came before us
We see,
It serves as a lesson for us.
We should learn from them.
Don't behave like children like this.
He is growing a camel.
Do you have children?
Without knowledge
You are his role models, not them.
Just like his father.
You, Sultan
And you, Fahd
And I am your older brother.
To me
I'm going to make him pay for the computer.
You're shaking his hand.
"May you forgive one another."
No, I just shook his hand to escape.
From Abdulrahman's endless talk
Where are you going?
I swear I won't leave him.
Did you make tea?
Exit, don't hide.
Open the door, if you're a man.
Didn't you say that Abdulrahman made peace with you?
But I swear, if I hadn't hurried, I would have demolished his room.
Your brother
Crazy
Your brother is crazy.
I'll show him, hold the tea.
On his head
Shut up, shut up, stop this, you guys, they have no shame, hitting each other.
You're behaving like little children, stop it, son!
I swear I'll show you.
Beat him, beat him, oh God! Oh, my big pump.
Blood, mother
You scared me with your big words.
Oh God
Let's be alone.
Okay, my heart.
Although I am among you.
We won't leave you.
When he came at night to reconcile with them.
He didn't have time, my daughter!
"Son of
Inshallah
He speaks fluently.
But, my daughters
May God guide you.
You should calm them down.
Do not stir up strife among them, O daughters.
What happened, I hope it's good.
Disappoint me, Abdulrahman.
You're afraid to help me, not do the same thing.
You are the sensible brother, may God guide you.
Two strikes in a row.
Reach out your hand.
We are ashamed of you, may God guide you.
Our neighbor Saeed is laughing at you.
Sir! We've told him again and again.
Don't believe him, sir.
They were throwing stones, the three of them.
Sorry
No *
Secure your foot, I saw them *from my window*.
I heard him?
Means too far.
My brother was right when he said that.
I'm sorry, now that you've let it slip that your children won't do that again,
Thank you, thank you.
Hello, my brother, hello.
Officer, how are you going to clear them, I'm sure, trust me.
Listen to me.
I didn't want to say it in their presence.
Abdulrahman, the eldest brother
He is an assistant under-secretary.
The intermediary is the head of a public authority.
Take two Panadol tablets and rest.
Panadol! Officer.
Do you have two Panadol tablets here?
O Allah, suffice us the evil of the enemy.
O Allah, suffice us the evil of the enemy.
O Allah, suffice me against the enemy, they taunt me.
"What is this?" (The r
A child can throw up to this distance!
This is a man's hand, it seems to be his father's.
Who could believe?
He seems to be from a respectable family, kind and educated.
That's because I come from a poor family.
So what?
He's buying your mind.
He never takes his eyes off you.
And annoying you
And you say you didn't get a chance.
When she saw you pass by, what did it mean?
Agreement, you think!
She turned her head, and you turned yours, at the same time.
No, but there must be something.
I'll see when you enter.
She felt happy, deep in her heart.
Go ask her for a pen.
Give her your notebook.
I don't know her name, can you believe it?
Romantic, more than you should be.
Dude, we're in the 21st century.
You're really desperate.
Frankly
It's been a while since we sat and discussed like this.
No, here's the good news.
From now on, I'll ask you more often to spend time with you.
But you should go and rest now.
Especially after yesterday's outdoor photoshoot in the desert.
We were exhausted, %pw hours, I told the secretary I didn't want any press or TV interviews, nor contracts.
I want to spend some time with my family.
O Allah, help You.
Even if you are busy,
The first thing that came to my mind
I have the owner's number, I'll call him today.
Why are you late?
The villa was sold today, and the cashiers moved in two days ago.
I was busy with series and photography.
Umm Abdul Aziz says they are poor and *
This is what God has decided for them, we will not interfere.
Good morning, Uncle.
What's the problem?
This car, my son, stops every now and then.
It seems to be the battery.
No problem, don't worry, I have a charger and I'll charge it for you.
May God reward you abundantly.
At any time, uncle.
Peace be upon you
Walid is correct.
Okay, from tomorrow, I'll start looking for a villa nearby so I can visit you every day.
What do you want now?
That's enough, brother.
Take it.
What is your full name?
Rashed Abdullah
His name?
I said that to your father.
Your mother is right.
I was so happy when I found out that Rashid Abdullah, my favorite actor, is our neighbor.
Everyone loves him.
They say he is kind and humble.
Neighborhood before housing.
I want to take a picture with him.
Perhaps my friends at work believe in me.
I couldn't believe our house was next to the actor Raheed Abdullah's house.
Talk to him until he believes.
Any life
What I used to see on television.
And we hope to see him.
Our neighbor has become kind, praise be to God, thank you, God.
If they need a sailboat, I have one.
Happy to help, but folks, easy on me, I'm not quite used to it yet.
I heard about her.
That was out of his kindness. May God replace it with something better.
Peace be upon you
So, it has been confirmed that some employees will be transferred to the ministry's new branch in Dakhla.
Did they tell you who was moving?
I didn't hear the names.
But, what I heard and am sure of
Is Bouali among them?
My name!
But, we don't know exactly where we're going to move.
I can't go, please, the smoke is too much for me, I can't.
How can you, or cannot, do the job, man?
The committee is still considering the case.
But if they choose you
Thank you for visiting me, Abu Waleed. Take some.
Thank you, thank you, Abu Ali.
I'm sorry, the furniture is old.
We are neighbors today.
We're like family.
"This is too much from you, Oh! Bou Waleed"
May Allah reward you with good, Abu Waleed.
I've heard a lot about your kindness.
May God preserve this love forever.
But, my daughter
I'm ready to tour the market for you until you find the most beautiful furniture at low prices that suit you.
When? To be honest, our furniture is very old.
We'll change it.
Inshallah
I told you before.
If you need anything
Consider me your sister.
I will never cry for you.
Where did you go, my love?
I forgot to remind her when she called me yesterday.
Because you didn't like it.
No more
I'll call you later, goodbye.
In fact, I was talking to her.
But these people are different from us.
They are rich, we are nothing compared to them.
Don't worry, Mom.
Wait a bit.
Wait a bit.
And I'll give you the green light to propose to her on my behalf.
I told you.
No, my mother doesn't care.
And you come and ask me to marry you.
We set the dinner in the living room.
If you want to eat
The driver will take her to the university now, God willing.
We had agreed that we are a family.
Whose car is this, then?
And soon, God willing.
I called to thank her.
Good people, they love charity.
Yes, you are right, Abu.
Even our relatives wouldn't do that to us.
Confirmation! Is my name listed?
Sure?
Any problem, why do problems follow us?
I don't know, I'm confused now. After hearing this news, I don't know how to proceed.
Go, go, go, go, go now, okay, okay, thank you, may God replace it with something better for you, may God replace it with something better.
What happened, Abu Ali?
The committee met today.
And a list of the names of the people who will be transferred to Dukhan.
My name is listed.
Speak to the manager to have your name removed.
I don't think it will be useful, Um Ali, I don't think it will be useful.
I spoke to him, he said no way.
Famous actor
Consider your name was never on the list.
May God bless you, thank you very much. Oh! Bu Salem
If you don't mind
I want to take a picture with you to show my children.
My children will be happy.
May the Lord protect them.
Can I take a picture with you, the actor?
Of course, God bless you.
Come, please, come.
Of course, happy to help.
You and those you love
Tell me in two or three days.
Mother, be ready.
Ready? Ready for what?
You're crazy, what's wrong with you?
She said, "I don't care."
Let him go to his mother.
Go to them.
But, my son
I don't want them to see us as poor people.
You must be positioned.
I don't have any chic dresses.
You've put me in a problem.
Why are you taking all these jewels? I've never seen you do this before.
Not mine.
Mother of Ali
Umm Ali will suggest to her son.
She wants some elegant clothes and jewelry.
She wants to show them that they are rich and well-off.
Insha'Allah
Her face is beautiful.
Inshallah, is this my wife? She's taller and bluer.
God willing, I'll listen.
You are a queen, God willing, a queen.
You also need to be prepared.
They will ask you to meet her father.
I'm definitely not going in these clothes.
I feel good when I wear new clothes.
Mother, be careful with her things.
It's very kind of Waleed's mother to give you her things, so use them carefully.
Ah, ah
That's why I have to be like them.
Why, didn't his mother suggest it?
That is for women.
I have to go and find the men.
As you can see, God blesses you.
Only the bisht is left, may God keep you.
Good people, help me.
They were helpful, the pashtun hat is all that remains.
Dad, can I borrow it from you to complete the outfit?
All the people are standing with you.
Oh, Brother Rashid, leave it like that or put it away.
No, look, first.
You need to visit this place.
I held my breath.
The dress is loose, but
God bless you.
The left hand should be in...
The right hand is letting go, like this.
You hold the cloth from the bottom with a stick.
Wow, wow
Absolutely fantastic
Your steps need to slow down a bit.
Oh! Yes, pw.
Now you look like a millionaire.
Let them give you, okay, seconds.
Put your left hand, like this, your left, this way.
Do you know my friend Aisha?
What's in it?
I knew what she was saying all this time.
She told me, "Because you're my friend, and I don't want us to be far from each other."
I'll ask my brother to propose to you.
Tell your friend not to ask his sister and make himself and her feel embarrassed.
I see many suitors are interested in you these days. A few days ago, Souad offered to have lunch with her uncle, and today I wanted you to meet her brother.
They want to take my lover.
I'm just sitting and watching.
Don't they know about our relationship?
No, they only know that we're colleagues.
Alright, after this.
From tomorrow, they need to realize.
When the parents refused
I am screaming
You rejected my son Walid.
The actors are more frank than you, oh! Two-faced!
But you,
You behave throughout your whole life.
This doesn't reflect on you.
To serve people
He lies to people.
Wearing costumes in life, in front of everyone.
I wore the bisht while I was acting on TV.
Me neither!
I wore accessories, gold, and jewelry.
Play
She will get married.
Who's the scene?
A man walks in front of his wife.
He is wearing a keffiyeh on the side of his face.
He doesn't look to the right or to the left.
Reminds me of your friend you used to talk about, the one who works with you in the same office.
He is with a girl and a boy.
Why does he walk like that?
As they said,
God bless him, man.
Walk straight, don't stop.
He has no personality whatsoever.
He's talking, he's happy!
Show us the city center.
No, no, no, no, she's not beautiful when you're sitting.
You look better when you're awake, when you stand, stand, stand.
I beg you, O Khamees.
How are you? Are you going downtown?
Come, I want to talk to you.
Where are you going? Stay with us for a while.
His wife upsets him.
Are you happy about that!
Oh! Thursday
Engage it, and if the presenter is a woman.
Change the channel, lest it gets me into trouble.
I swear I'm at work.
Sat with Salem, my work friend.
Talk to her.
You hung up on me, take it, take it.
I interrupted the call, now I'll annoy you.
Now she says I allowed you to speak with her because there's a woman with us.
A minute, this might get me kicked out of the house.
Stay out!
You're not the first to get divorced.
No, no, no, I can't, brother.
I don't want to harm my mother in her grave.
"He appointed me" or "He delegated me"
She said, "Don't get divorced."
No, no, no, I can't, it's impossible.
Are you trying to find something?
No, no, no, please, please.
You are completely crazy.
Don't leave me crazy.
Tell me, I want to know what's wrong.
No, no, no, Mom, don't talk about him like that.
Salem in particular is one of the best men in our city.
He is asking you for a divorce.
Even if divorce asked me, I'm stupid to divorce, that's not reasonable.
James, you've officially gone crazy.
Leave me, leave me, please.
I was talking to him, alone.
May God guide you.
Poor heart killer.
I want to give him an important message from the minister's office.
Who do you want to give it to, may God guide you?
No, nothing, nothing
Take it to me, I'll ask him about it.
This is regarding the meeting with the women's delegation tomorrow.
Women's delegation
What's wrong with you! Aren't you going to sleep today?
Hello Salim
I am your brother, Khamis.
No, I'm really talking to you consciously.
Oh brother!
Remove my name, so I won't attend.
How can we delete your name?
Only the happy minister can erase your name.
This is a meeting at the ministry.
Official meeting
Who did you call?
Healthy, healthy, healthy
Tell me the truth.
Were you talking to one of the six women?
Safety, safety, peace, I swear to you that it is safe.
If you're talking to Salem
Will you speak?
This lie doesn't work.
Don't lie, Khamas.
You're not telling the truth!
You're wearing casual clothes.
I thought I was talking to a woman.
Oh, life in Mahla.
God bless you, please call Salem.
Please, for your belief.
He asked you to call.
Mind your own business.
Mind your own business, or you'll face something unpleasant.
A complaint from you.
Hello!? Hey, you!
How can you live with a woman who has a sharp tongue?
We're starting the meeting now.
Hasan went to invite Thursday.
Okay, let's discuss the real estate budget first.
Let's start
We hope he finds it.
He was afraid when he saw the ladies.
I studied the whole ministry and you are hidden here.
Come on, let's go, people are getting hurt in the meeting room.
I can't sit with the ladies.
O Khumays, how did your wife know?
I'm afraid she'll call.
"I seek forgiveness from Allah." Do you want her to doubt me? Don't you understand?
If I answer her call, how do I get home?
Will your wife call at this hour!
Of course, your company is a large one.
This project, which will be implemented by your company for our ministry
One of the largest projects in the history of our ministry.
Oh people, why is the table wobbling?
No, my life is long, not the table, I am.
You can answer your call.
Who is this?
Excuse me, who do you want to speak to?
My phone, %pw
I'm coming, wait, wait.
He fainted because he was afraid to go home.
Her brother came.
Tell him that your wife said not to come home unless you change your job and don't work with ladies.
That's why I sent a letter to the Ministry transferring him from our department.
Okay, the minister himself told me he approved it, what does he want!
What's with his wife?
This is madness.
I ask him who he's talking to.
I told you he's crazy.
What are you going to do! Your wife and kids are coming tomorrow.
I don't know what to do.
As long as you've done what you want, why are you afraid to go home and see your children?
She wants official proof.
Hey, give her the papers.
Wow, how did you do that? You sent the paper with her brother.
To see the minister's signature and confirm it.
And I hope you agree, if you do, I will return home tonight, God willing.
Sister, here is the minister's signature.
What do you want more?
He will start working in the new department tomorrow.
It means an office and a job, other than the one he used to work in.
Where is this section, may God bless you?
Yes, God bless you, this is the minister.
Nothing, nothing, that one, on your right.
Yes, password, God bless you.
Please come in, your office is ready.
Saud, and Abdulqadir, God willing, a big office, yes.
Goodbye
How do you ask for directions?
English: The whole department is women.
My wife
No one can enforce another decision except the minister himself.
You must work until the minister returns.
Come on, brother, make a deal with your colleagues.
And address them by masculine names, lest your wife should know.
I've added two more for the new female employee.
The new employee is a male employee.
A few days ago, the minister's office transferred a man to work with us.
Are you serious?
He looks funny, poor guy, a man working among five women, he looks funny.
They say his wife is very jealous of the other women around him.
Blind envy
Poor man, in need.
But we were asked to be quiet when his wife came, so we complied and didn't speak.
Ah, Abdelkader who is with you in the office.
"See if it's your size"
My son called, said my wife is coming to the office.
What is this?
Straight spirit, first floor to your north.
This is at the social welfare office.
With hunger ***
These are six employees.
And these here, I'm sure he came for work.
These lies don't work on me.
My wife is jealous of other women around me.
Because I'm handsome.
O Allah, guide you, O Sultan.
But we want to know what stage we've reached.
My uncle, Sakr, and I were at the bank yesterday.
It's the project.
Peace be upon you
Brother, I have an important meeting at work today.
Go to the kitchen quickly.
I'm dressed and ready to go.
In truth, your place is the kitchen.
Women must obey men.
And the scorpion's sting causes pain.
This is important for the rain, see see.
You are
Aisha, please contact the secretary and ask him to inform the staff.
The meeting has been rescheduled for tomorrow.
I hope it's not something serious.
They act on orders.
And we must implement.
They must realize that you are an important supervisor.
They have many responsibilities and deadlines.
They consider women as servants.
I haven't seen people hate women as much as they do.
What age do they think they're living in?
They asked me not to go to work today, and instead go to the kitchen and make tea.
Where are the servants?
And the other one fled a week ago.
Even the maids couldn't bear their mistreatment.
I understood them.
O Allah, help You.
There are few banknotes.
Tea
Well, they mean that
In fact, a villa complex is nothing without a garden.
Come now, the park...
Sister, before you go, I want to talk to you about something.
My love, Fatoum, I have to go, I'm late.
Imagine, what does she have?
Speak or I'll leave.
And played it at school.
A committee from the Women's League came today.
The school recommended me to be in the league.
You're crazy.
And you want to go to the league.
If you tell your uncle and brother about this, you won't see any good.
You are responsible.
We took your warning.
Why don't you come and see me, it's been a long time since I last saw you.
A year has passed, a year since I saw you.
Is he married yet?
May God guide you.
No one who doesn't have a diploma will agree to marry my mother.
No, no, no, it doesn't matter if he's my mother, he's a man.
And James is the son of Scorpions
The scorpion's sting is painful.
And it's also necessary to marry someone from the same social status.
Decorative scorpion
God help you.
What should I do, Aisha?
Ever since the minister traveled, all the papers are being referred to me.
I informed Mustafa, the head of the HR department, that I want to meet with him the day after tomorrow.
But the ministry's guests arrived today.
Do you have the schedule?
And now I am free to talk to you, Ayesha!
Yes, Mary.
Come, okay, come, I'm coming now.
What should I say, O Aisha?
My sisters are the source of all these problems.
I didn't know what happened.
Okay, my love. Ice packs are necessary so your face doesn't swell.
We didn't let her go and talk to them about the subject.
I went to them, they punched her.
Would you know if I told them it's a football?
They beat you a long time ago.
What a shame, you play football!
Next time, break your neck.
Know who you're talking to.
The Big Scorpion
That little one
Oh, uncle, I didn't take it, Sultan took it.
I heard that you
I chose economics and political science.
I chose graphics because it's in demand these days.
Architecture!
It's not your turn.
You took your chance.
Do not be stingy.
Okay, scorpion.
Sort it out, break her teeth in her mouth.
Let me hit her.
She is here with me.
Go to the scholarship office.
And cross out architecture.
Take your time.
To make sure
I spoke with Sultan and Sakkar.
They don't care if you marry Munira.
Anything else you want?
Ay, my son Khamees deserves all the good.
I'll arrange a meeting with them and let you know.
Your nomination to join the delegation.
I understand your personal circumstances.
But give yourself a chance to think about it until tomorrow.
To be honest with you,
They love you a lot.
And your nomination by the minister.
It's correct.
I know my brothers well.
They will never rest.
I'm surprised.
Their car loans are paid from my salary.
And I take care of the household affairs.
And she wants me to travel with her too.
Aren't you going to marry her this week?
What do you say?
James is crazy, he doesn't even have a school certificate.
Get married and travel with him.
Done, let's go.
This is a shame.
They will slaughter her if she refuses.
My son, I've told you many times.
When you go.
Tomorrow, I will go tomorrow.
What matters, as long as his son is safe.
Appearance doesn't matter.
I don't want to marry Thursday.
And go to the kitchen.
Put it in the living room.
Madrid vs Barcelona match tonight
I hope Valencia doesn't lose to us.
My sources are reliable.
She is dedicated and hardworking.
What do you say about that?
What do you want to do for me?
When we go
Please go to your offices.
Thank you, may God prolong your life.
Long life
Serve coffee there.
Madame Happiness
May God grant her a long life.
Hello, may God grant you a long life.
Good evening, Mr. Bay.
Yes, God willing, your life will be long.
Have you washed the coffee cups?
Go and get Captain Emad's coffee.
And also
Here you will play in China after tomorrow.
Oh, Captain, I forgot to introduce you to my sister, Mary.
I'm going to the official engagement.
Are you stupid?
You don't know anything about life, and you want to get married to a minister.
Hello %pw
Yes, ma'am.
Pour it out and make a new one.
Actors pretending
You, the torchbearers spoke to me a few minutes ago.
What should I tell her?
That's a pity, the Noof road is not suitable for torches.
Nouf is sixteen years old.
And she is in her twenties.
Okay, why don't you take Mary's place?
Suits her best.
"Nouf for thirty"
We need to get rid of the demanding person on the committee.
It's a problem, I'm sure he won't let it go smoothly.
It's detailed.
He will talk about art, family values, moral art, content, and more.
Who chose him for this committee?
The minister is the one who formed the committee.
You, me, and Hamid can influence him.
No, no, no, it's impossible.
Nothing indicates that it's ours.
Even if he went and asked at the Ministry of Economy,
They don't know our names.
The company was issued in the name of Hamed's wife, God bless you.
Don't worry about this.
Don't worry, in fact, who is the head of the committee?
The last word is mine.
No, no, man, everything is fine, come in.
I just spoke to them and agreed on everything.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, welcome Rashid, please come in.
As you know, this meeting is specifically to determine whether we will support the series "Extortion of Conscience" or not.
And it is produced by the Institute of Modern Touch Arts
It's a nice, strange, and bold work from the series.
I agree with Hamed.
The story of the series is very beautiful.
I agree with you.
I liked it when she took the gun and killed her neighbor.
She wanted to hide the gun, so she put it in the car.
And they didn't know it was for her son, that's sweet, and when the police came.
And her son comes from school.
And kicked the box.
He stepped on the cake and flew to his mother's place.
Here comes the surprise.
This part of the box goes into the mother's room.
It's good that a local company produces that advanced level of output.
We should encourage and support them.
Sir Rashid, you haven't shared your opinion with us.
You've left me with nothing to say.
With all due respect to your opinions and considerations about the series, this is "blackmail of conscience."
And human value extortion
Disgusting surprises
One and a half people per ring.
The other half is left for the next episode.
This series is written without any social awareness.
What carries a moral message that helps society progress.
Tears fall, why must you make the viewers cry?
Excuse me, Rashid.
You gave us your opinion, Ali gave us his opinion, let Mr. Rashid express his opinion.
Clear from the meeting.
There is an agreement between you both.
His rank.
People who understand and are within their area of expertise, and people who have nothing to do with the thing.
I don't agree with that series.
I'm afraid he'll be upset with us.
Crush him.
Something that he can do, he is not able to do anything.
I'll do what I want.
He greeted me and said the bag was from Ms. Samira.
I don't know what to do.
I can't believe it! Oh, Nasser!
This is the new series we will produce soon.
He who has the driver rapes the girl.
For the blessings we have enjoyed because of him.
The first blessing is the beautiful ring on your hand.
I'll tell you how.
They present it in the name of Hamed's wife, who sent you the ring.
And your husband's role was to cover their backs.
I have a five percent share of the production.
This is a nice cycle.
I played a similar role, didn't you see "Lost Dreams"?
In any case
It's called blackmail or something, I can't remember.
Ah, extortion dreams.
Why do all the names sound alike?
Last year's TV series were all about girls.
You notice that every series has more than eight or even ten girls.
Your turn is secured.
You are very beloved.
You're lucky.
Yes, Omar.
Come on, okay, okay or Yes, okay, okay
Sorry, my love, I have to go to work. I don't know what happened there.
Eat and go.
He said he wanted to see me about a very urgent and important matter.
I have to go.
I heard that Rashid met with the minister.
Spent half an hour with him.
And he told him, "You're going to bother him."
I told you he complained about us to the minister.
The minister's office called and wants to meet with me.
I also fear that the minister will believe his words.
I will meet with the minister.
The man came to explain his point of view about the series.
This is all.
This is true, live longer.
But first, Mr. Beck, I want to say that it's not acceptable to talk about your colleagues behind their backs.
Everyone knows that Rashid...
He is jealous of everyone around him.
He cares only about financial gain.
But that's his specialty.
But, God bless you, not every educated person can handle these technical topics.
Television productions in particular
The Bribed Conscience, the series we're working on
This is a massive production.
This is a media initiative at the Gulf level.
Strong distribution
Of course, it's your specialty. You know more about it than I do.
I promise you a great series.
That will raise our name.
Look what the journalist, Abdel Hamid, wrote. Listen, listen.
Also, one of the actors said
The series promotes unethical ideas.
That is limited by the degradation of fitness.
This is real, bold, and powerful criticism.
They will be in big trouble if the journalist Abdul Hamid writes about them.
And if the people whom you charge have knowledge of them.
But they are sharp, they know how to handle it.
They are a group.
We need to create our own website.
And we place all the activities of our company on it.
What's the name of the company again?
From now on, you are the media advisor.
The extortion conscience series supervised by Mercury Media Production is considered
A Quantum Leap in Arabic Drama
Due to its moral ideas and values.
It's a series aimed at developing society.
He is the same journalist who criticized them a few days ago.
Is it possible for him to change his mind to the opposite?
How can he accept that?
The journalist Abdelhamid and others like him
Don't worry, Abu Hamed.
He asked what I thought of the series, I told him it would be the best in the Arab world.
I hope so.
I feel like our series will be popular.
I don't know where he is.
The other one is getting ready and is prepared to leave.
Not an interesting beginning.
Your stories are always unrealistic, and the events didn't actually happen.
It's clear at first glance.
Your book is a group of stupid people.
*Possible to happen*
Your chain is stupid, stupid.
What are you saying?
Very sad.
Other bad series are no excuse.
This production can be understood at first sight.
These are hidden lines and dimensions, you need someone who focuses to discover them.
By the way, it's a political drama.
Okay, I found it.
What's stopping you?
Don't press it that way, please.
I was at Souq Waqif with Ali yesterday.
We were at a coffee shop.
I ignored myself.
Nasser, what do you think about what happened? If the minister is upset, that's a big problem.
Within a week, we'll all be expelled.
The TV series is a failure; everyone who watched it said it was a failure.
I heard that Rashid is planning to visit him.
And tell him that the series is a failure and lacks excitement.
This is a disaster.
Leave it to me.
Let's see what Nasser will do.
Listen, Eli.
From now on, I don't want to see any criticism of the series on your page.
Ellie, please.
A few days ago, I read an article that not only criticized the production but also cursed it.
Don't plant me.
I'm sorry.
That day I was on vacation.
They'll never succeed in writing that.
But frankly, I haven't received any grateful messages.
Once again, a great success.
Goodbye
Brother Rashid,
I am bound to believe you or the newspapers.
The Wire is the best television production.
Live longer, they have an agreement.
Listen to what the other newspaper wrote.
Do they have an agreement with the viewers' page as well?
I almost had a heart attack.
After a while, they told me.
Good luck, the minister is relaxed.
Frankly, Nasser,
Get ready to witness the exploitation of conscience II
No, no, no, no, enough, brother.
The series, he said, would not be written again.
He prefers to stay in his miserable job.
Part Two, After All These Problems
Third and fourth as well.
What's wrong with you? Don't you want to benefit?
One of his friends told me.
Here I am
What can the magician do?
I wish you more success.
Tell us what you think about that success.
I thank God for that success.
They are haters and enemies of our success.
I find that strange.
This series wins awards while being a failed series.
But they are the experts.
They awarded her the prizes, they must see what we cannot see.
Preparing the second part of the series.
Taf, your life is long.
A real wizard.
You will go, "conscience mercenariness" will be.
I saw you talking to the minister at the beginning of the ceremony.
TV festivals are a lie too!
I heard him say, "Be ready for part two."
It's the same thing.
Go to the bank to withdraw and become clean.
All the weak, silly, and perverse series you watch.
They nominate her in Arab and Gulf festivals.
To clean it, give it awards, so people consider it high-class.
Ah, that's the truth.
As long as the judges are the producers themselves.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, praise be to God, I have arrived.
It's true that we signed a contract with them, but they want to lower the prices.
Come to my office.
We don't have a small bakery or a bread shop.
We are one of the largest bakery companies in the world.
We won't reduce it.
Otherwise, we will cancel the contract.
We signed the contract yesterday.
With the British company.
Cape and up
As you wish
He did a wonderful job.
He is the first person in the world to produce that product.
He is not only the best baker of bread in the world.
I'll ask you.
How is bread with a weevil?
Open it with your hands or go to the kitchen and look for a knife to cut it, and maybe it will cut your hand.
Indeed, he baked bread with a zipper.
Put the cheese back and close it again.
This is not bread, it's a pair of pants.
So what are you saying, in fact, it's a bag of bread.
How do we remove that zipper?
So, he can tell his friend, "I ate a couple of marshmallows."
Why weren't the Noor Mountains Hospital pastries delivered yesterday?
I know, but why didn't you hand it in yesterday?
The bakers who make it
Once again, use the bakers.
That's what happened, sir.
Why are you shouting at him?
You're wasting your time with soccer and you're late for my job.
Do you know that your son loves football?
So what, what's the problem if some employees from the company enjoy themselves with him?
You have four hundred employees in the company.
Eleven main players
Four substitute players, and administrative assistants, that's all, just seventeen.
And the team spokesperson.
Why are you shocked by it?
But everything is fine at the moment. Although the fans are the most important players in the game on the pitch and they are the twelfth player.
I left you to enjoy yourself with them.
We have already signed a contract with the people.
When he first told you he wanted to play football.
Listen to you.
He did nothing.
No, you're not just angry at him because he took some employees to play football in front of him and enjoy themselves.
I said it's not possible to take some of the employees.
Even if some of your friends need some staff, you can lend them some.
Important bakers
My son, why take the important packers, that's not possible.
Next time, tell me before you hire any staff.
No, no, let Hamdi handle these papers.
He is in the hospital.
Why, didn't they understand you?
I finished the work, and before I go to use my car.
Nasser called me.
I went to him.
He said they couldn't find a goalkeeper and that they have an important match today.
He told us to find a guardian, and then we reached the stadium.
Wear the goalkeeper's suit.
I've never played soccer. I've never touched a ball.
This case
Stupid
And I'll find you a job instead of wasting your time with football.
Let me explain.
Father, you want me to disband and release the team, right?
Ah, right.
Come, father, please, I invite you.
I have no choice but to continue with the team. Tomorrow is the final match.
No, no, no, he's right.
Do you agree?
Congratulations on the win.
Congratulations, Sir Nasser, on winning the cup.
We were trying to figure out how you planned to win.
See, I prepared the team psychologically, physically, and mentally, and the coach made a great effort.
In a hotel
Congratulations to you all, and there will be a party, as promised.
Your father looks happy.
I'm afraid he's just being polite and respectful.
Uncle Abu Nasser, first of all, we want to congratulate you on the great victory of your team, the International Bakers Team.
For such a huge success
God willing, no, no, no.
No picture without a bisht, wait, wait, hold on.
No, no
He wears a bisht.
Your care, attention, and innovative ideas played a significant role in this success, undoubtedly.
And the coach's plan
But they played five-five-three-two in the final.
And as a player, you know that changing the game plan throws off the players, yet Baker's team didn't get thrown off and did a great job.
And the coach's plan
Bo Nasser, as the first athlete in the International Bakers Team, what advice do you have for the players?
For the extension
Hello hello
Long life
They are welcome. Is Hamad Sultan with them?
Welcome them to come, but they must have dinner with us first.
Dinner, okay!
Thank you, Abu Abdulaziz.
And it is considered a contribution to the private sector.
The team is still young.
Don't envy me.
No, who?
Bu Abdulaziz
The motors' deputy that we use in the factory. (Note: The original sentence is not grammatically correct in Arabic, so the translation maintains that structure.)
You see.
I've wanted to know him for a long time.
Soccer introduced me to him; I reminded him of that.
I said to him, "Oh! Abu Abdulaziz."
You've never been interested in football your whole life.
What does this have to do with you?
The ball was always close to me, there were only fifty centimeters between us.
Has Abu Nasser not come yet?
No, he didn't come today either.
There's a seminar on football injuries, he's the platinum sponsor, he should be there.
You're going to see more.
Did you see the building behind the bakeries that he wanted to turn into worker housing?
He is obsessed with football.
As usual, we tend to meet and catch up with one of the figures in the field of sports.
This man inspires the bakery team with his great ideas.
What about the International Bakeries Team? We heard you're undergoing a comprehensive development.
Compared to offices, all efforts.
It's a small amount of money, just a million dollars for all this effort.
No, man, be generous.
It's not my fault, brother Shain.
My fault
So what is my fault?
You told me you need players for the Gulf countries.
Prices for the Gulf are the highest.
So if a player chooses 2000,
It would cost three or four million dollars.
I didn't understand, explain to me.
Receive fax here
And he read it to me when he is with you.
My father bought four new players for the team, in addition to a new batch of four players.
He knows, he's amazing, he can easily outrun Billy and Ronaldinho.
But 800,000 is written on it.
That's the truth, God bless you, but a Turkish club set this price.
In the UAE, they sell it for one million and two hundred thousand.
Don't show me.
Imagine if we could study the panda.
Here
Thigh
Okay, done.
No, no, no, I guarantee you.
He is fat, God willing, a good fat.
This is slim, suitable for the middle.
The muscle connection
It is the most important muscle, a player is of no use without it.
Thank you.
Leave the market for automatic clubs, automatic, what did I say! Automatic
How?
Hamdi, let's go.
Congratulations, congratulations
These, God bless you, are young players.
Ah, we bring them from the African forests,
We feed them and raise them, and then we release them into the arenas.
"If you're happy, you can take it. Do you have a place for it, or should I put it in the pickup truck?"
When he saw them putting pressure on us.
The forward asked to play.
"Kakakano makalali dande, la" translates to "It's not easy to make a living, indeed."
Ask the defender to play.
Kajamkani lululu was supposed to play.
He is a beginner coach.
Even if it's on Mars.
Spain! Even if he were a coach on Mars.
I don't like how he runs the game.
This one should be on the north road.
In the rules of the game
Even if it's just two days.
What happened? Why are you screaming?
Your stupid son
He's not convinced that the coach is an expert in football.
Listen to her, she talks like Mitsu.
And he knows that the attacking player Selulu Tekawawa is a good midfielder, as Ahmed Tayeep said.
No one is making you suffer from a headache.
Stay away.
I know how to deal with him.
Why did the team lose the game?
The team is supposed to think about changing the plan.
Players also don't play in their positions.
And player Takulamakakolalala is out of position, he should be moved to his usual spot.
Ask the coach to change ...
Exemption of Hopway Malallo
Tap tap tap
No, no, no, no, what's happening in the stadium?
This isn't supposed to happen.
The coach shouldn't do that.
Please postpone these matters until the game is over.
People are seeing this, it's happening in front of the camera.
A fourth goal for Success Club, the ball entered the penalty area.
He scored the fourth goal, and he's the star of the match today.
This coach is mistaken.
Tell him, Uncle Abu Nasser doesn't want you as a coach for his team anymore.
And you, be quiet.
I'm watching the match on TV and you stay as a reserve player, do what I'm asking you to do.
Don't do that, it's not excellent.
We have a match tomorrow, how are we going to play without a coach?
What does your father do?
Enough, Rashid.
What's wrong with you? You've caught my attention, tell me what's wrong with you?
Divorce me, Mama, divorce me.
"I divorce you! What happened?"
I didn't want my mother, I didn't want her.
Why did he divorce you? I wasn't even married for a month.
I swear to God, mother, I don't know, I don't know.
Divorcing you without cause!
Yes, Mother, yes.
I swear to God, mother, I don't know. He suddenly came and told me, "Go to your family's house."
I asked him why he did that. He said, "You're divorced."
I swear, I don't know what's coming?
They were married for only a month. What will people say about us?
I agree with you.
I don't know what to say.
I only know that he divorced her, from you now.
Sit. I'll be back in a minute.
Because of her high morals.
Barcelona was attacked.
Light of my eye, Abdullah.
He came to me crying.
He said she insulted Barcelona, and he is very attached to this team and respects it.
I insulted him, treated him badly, and hurt his feelings.
My mom told me she insulted Barcelona, and I said to him, "Divorce her, and I'll find you another wife."
Tell him your daughter is divorced because she insulted Barcelona FC.
Just, for this reason, he divorced her, are you serious?
They're fine.
Is it easy to hurt someone's feelings?
A wife questioned her husband's loyalty.
I can't believe what I'm hearing!
We don't need a girl who doesn't respect the international team.
This time she started mocking Messi.
Problems between a couple occur, and we must...
One man for a thousand girls.
There are many girls who wish to marry him.
Listen to me.
I don't want to hear anything.
And I hope you won't interfere. This is my son and I know him well.
I told you it's none of your business.
I'm going to scold you.
Don't worry about it, son! Don't think about it.
One man for a thousand girls.
Why are you depressed!
When I remember her words
That's Real Madrid, better than Barcelona.
Okay, my love.
What's wrong with it!
Her name is Mona.
Was she married for one month?
If I tell you her story and why she got divorced, you won't stop laughing.
We want your attention to include you with it.
What's the use of a person like that, who divorces his wife for a football team?
The barber knows them and told me the whole story. Mom, don't involve me in this, I don't want to have a problem with someone like her.
That's all, you're hearing the babble of barbers.
Tell them I didn't accept.
Let her speak her mind and say what she wants to say.
Wealth is coming her way.
I told her, "Girl, don't stop your luck."
If it were only her wealth, I wouldn't care.
But she will stop her luck and ours with her.
This building
He won't say no to me.
God will deal with this bad barber.
They listen to a rumor and spread it.
Don't listen to her.
Tell her and make her understand not to close the door of luck that will open for us.
He knows how to prove himself to her.
You're lying. You believe he divorced his wife because of Barcelona.
Forget all this nonsense and don't be disgusted.
Don't miss the opportunity.
And maybe she is the reason or something wrong with her led him to divorce her.
Listen, my daughter, don't let Abu Borgain slip through your fingers.
What's that, Abu Burjin?
But when they get closer, they discover they are two towers.
That's why his father was called Shahin Abu Borgain.
Draw near to God.
No, no, no. Sweet. Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, thank you. Please.
May God grant you a long life, they took the money and you signed, and they spent the money.
Your Excellency, I was absent-minded and it seems you were very busy, that was a month ago.
The first marriage was a month ago, this is a new marriage, they got divorced.
He was married and divorced.
Oh, this is his third marriage.
And this is a story, my brother, beware of it.
Oh my God! Man, this generation is tough.
Opinion and Counter-Opinion
Congratulations, my daughter.
My daughter, don't forget your glasses; I put them on top of the bag.
So you can carry it with you when you board the plane.
When you reach London
Hey Ben, don't you want to go to London?
Hello, Mom
Okay, fine.
So you can come with us and drive too.
Malaysia, Malaysia.
Take the fur with you to Malaysia.
Goodbye, Mother.
What's in it?
I don't know.
I ask her and I don't know what's happening.
Tell me, my daughter, what's coming?
You did the best by neglecting her.
She is nothing.
On your honeymoon, she is supposed to take care of you with all her might.
Is it logical for her to sit while you pour the water?
And the glass is next to you, she doesn't carry it and lets you drink.
She didn't receive a good education.
You should have told her since I was born, I only drink water from my mother's hands.
What's in it?
She looks very sad.
And who's the lady with her?
Her name is Mashael.
Daughter, they divorced her during the honeymoon.
Can you believe it if I told you her story?
Please, Auntie, thank you.
Your aunt asked, and also your uncles.
Ah, but I don't understand where my mother booked us?
Hello, Mom
Where did you book us?
Because she wants to go there with us.
"There is no power or strength except from Allah."
Why did he do that at the airport and why did he take the children?
What happened between them?
You ask me, I don't know what happened between them!
That's really stupid.
Where is Manira?
She's in her room talking to this idiot.
Now she says she has been calling him for two days and his phone is switched off.
They found him now.
We follow what he owns.
How did you know he was stressed? The boy is tired from being outside and he wants to rest.
Every day I tell my mother to eat the apple, but she doesn't. Every day she bothers me.
And you think I don't like the apple with its skin.
She doesn't say the apple.
Hello, let me tell you
You are divorced.
And another one when necessary.
Go, light of my eye.
Go, light of my eye.
Monira, what did he say?
Why are you stressed too!
Call him three times and tell him you're divorced.
Be quiet, may God guide you and keep you.
I don't know, mom, who saw me at the disco in Spain and told him.
He has nothing to say.
True, he has nothing to say.
She dances twice or three times.
And whoever divorces my daughter will die.
How did he divorce you?
Where are you going?
Where am I going? I'm going to pour my anger onto this lifeless man.
She has a tail like a peacock.
Adorned with gold, rubies, coral, and diamonds.
And the other girls are a toy for you and your son.
They have no families and mothers who taste the bitterness in their mouths.
Who are you mocking?
And divorce them according to what is fair.
I helped you drink water, she despises Barcelona, divorce her and forget her.
I went to a nightclub.
Without shame or life
Deputy Secretary, Arab and Muslim
He cares about his reputation and that of his sons.
Stay still and don't move.
Be human.
It was mine.
Who sells land like this?
Abu Saqr took it from my father by force.
Why are you selling it?
Oh, please, if Abu Saqr wanted something, he would tell them, wouldn't he?
Leave it to God, dad.
Come inside, come inside.
Come on, let's go.
What happened to your project, Abu Saad?
As you know.
Okay, last week you said you were going to his office?
I told you, if you want to work on your project, you should start by paying for it.
Abu Sakr, this great millionaire
%pw is what he eats? Is there anyone in the world who doesn't eat?
It's not a problem, brother, we'll make him eat, get full, and fill his belly, but the problem is how to reach him.
And you must know Abu Saqr's key, so that all the doors open for you.
I met him during the Umrah pilgrimage and welcomed him more than once.
What you need to know is what you're going to give and how you're going to do your job, but you need to know the right time.
When the writer told me that Abu Saqr was going to treat you to dinner.
I came immediately.
Abu Sakr, may God protect him, every day is a holiday.
Oh man, anyone.
He enjoys gatherings and meeting with friends.
It's so nice to sleep at this farm at night.
Yes, Your Honor, this is Abu Nasser, the owner of the car agency located behind the mall.
He wants to meet you, sir.
Getting the license
Like my son who got his license.
Thank you, may God bless you.
Congratulations on the license, Sagir.
God bless you.
Abu Sakr
I asked you not to let me down, say yes.
Say yes, Your Honor.
As a gift for him
And please, don't say no.
My business projects are going well.
This means you met him easily and talked to him.
Don't be stupid.
Yes, Zain Abu Nasser.
Tell me what the technique is, what did you do?
Circumstances helped me.
When we were sitting with him
His son just got his license.
I have a gift for the early bird.
If it's about the car,
This is easy.
Come, come and lead me to him.
Yes, it happened.
I just got out of the hospital.
He underwent a tonsillectomy.
And he will surely throw a feast.
You are entitled to your son's health. Welcome, O possessor of honor.
We hope he improves, we hope he improves, God willing, he will not see any harm, God willing.
We met at the place of the prayer.
I supposed so.
Come on, man, we need to forget and move on with our lives.
They told me that your son Shahin is in the next room and that he has already left.
I thought I should visit you.
And let us bless you with the health of the falcon.
Listen, welcome, Your Excellency, don't leave without having dinner with us.
Okay, sounds good.
Say yes or no.
Because our beloved son Shahin has been discharged from the hospital,
In the Corniche Tower.
Just say yes.
"My son, do not be stubborn."
Don't even try, I don't like business and I have no interest in it.
Who can start a project now without capital?
At the vehicle and bulldozer agency, he just said let him point.
Love is from God, and people love you because of their love for your father.
Until university,
All the doctors love and respect your father.
Most of them are in his council every night.
Praise be to God, your father is loved by everyone. You simply point to him.
People take out loans from banks to start a company or business.
Am I sitting in the supermarket?
Did you open a pickle shop?
This is also something new.
This is a falcon, the apple of my eye, he brought them to me yesterday and said, "These are a model, try them."
I just took their agency yesterday.
You see.
He also told me that all businessmen are like you; may God make everyone like you.
Yes, Your Honor
When I was on my way to the office,
I saw a new supermarket.
They were preparing him.
Really, I love him.
I don't know who its owner is.
Congratulations, Uncle Sagar, congratulations.
God bless you.
In the name of God, in the name of God
Who is he to come as a partner and take it easily?
You, you can now say no.
How?
What am I saying?
Be her partner.
Do you know who his father is?
Who doesn't know his father!
I said I am a friend of Qasim Abbas, he asked me if I have experience in business.
I said, "I have a bakery, thank God I live off it."
No, no, I don't like the name.
What I noticed.
No, my brother, the name is not good.
This is a suitable name for Iranian bread.
Alright, big bread.
Qasim, we'll call it the Big Bread Bakery.
Wait for me a bit.
Peace be upon you
Peace and blessings be upon you, Your Excellency.
Excellent, excellent. Do you need anything or any assistance?
No, thank God, everything is fine.
Ayad, she is a new employee here!
Madam, she sent her car for maintenance and came to get mine because she is an advertising agent in a marketing company and cannot do anything without a car.
Maybe you need your car, too.
No, I don't need the car today.
Okay, no problem.
This is the age of science, knowledge, and study.
I agree with Dr. Rashid, everyone should have sufficient knowledge in their field, whatever the field may be.
Excellent, Dr. Sami.
Yes, Your Honor
Lesson and lesson.
You're repeating what's in the books.
We didn't study either business or economics.
He has never read a book in his life, not even a newspaper. I've never seen him hold a piece of paper in his hand.
You all know who's going to be fired today.
I didn't want him to enter this business field, but...
His uncle Abu Nasser is still alive before you.
Who likes it.
But there are people born for trade, and the love of trade is in their nature.
You are correct, Doctor.
God willing, Shahin, you'll be like your brother.
God is generous, God willing.
It's still early.
This depends on upbringing.
No one is like you, Doctor.
With honesty.
How did Falcon, who hates trade, easily reach that great economic sense?
If they count a hundred billionaires in the world today, they will count them among them.
Do you know Abu Sakr?
He had chosen Saker for the market knights.
Peace be upon you
How are you, Nasser?
Mohammed called me and told me that Abu Nasser is in the hospital.
Do you remember when I told you once that you heard that Saqr bin Abu Saqr wanted to take the car agency from my father?
You can't own the agency anymore.
Real people don't go away.
His father helped him enter the market.
He opened his eyes to commerce.
The doctor honestly said that he was in critical condition.
It won't work.
Nothing works.
Pushed or pulled, not my business, I say you'll let it go, let it go and you will let it go.
There are people like that in the 21st century.
We meet, dear viewers, with one of the benevolent and blessed men in this country.
A man who knows the way for the outcasts and deprived.
So he is the founder and owner of the Falcon Charity Company.
Of course, if we are talking about this organization, Your Excellency!
We all know your noble goals that you are trying to convey to the world and, of course, to everyone.
Without hypocrisy or a desire for fame, we belong to God and to Him we shall return.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, thirty sacrifices have now been completed for our brothers in Africa.
And now, praise be to God, we are ready to deliver.
Seven boxes of candy for our children in Gaza.
"What Allah wills, O Great One, may Allah create many like you."
My wife and I moved out of the house.
But my wife will be passing by for half an hour to open her new project.
And I'll wait for her.
Walking
I really love their company and enjoy sitting with them. I truly have a great time.
And also a source of income for my children.
She is my whole life.
I think you're wasting your time.
Stay away from trouble.
Okay, hot bread, hot bread.
Come on, people! Oh!
There are people like that in the 21st century.
There are people like that in the 21st century.
If someone wants to dive, diving requires effort.
Needs brave men.
Viva Souq Waqif
You deserve it, you deserve it, congratulations, congratulations.
God bless you all.
Masha'Allah, everyone loves you, Shahin of love from goodness.
I want to say something, but tell me yes first.
On the occasion of his license, my son Shahin must go to the car exhibition and receive the best and most expensive car as a gift from me to him.
The wind blew upon us from the valley's cleft.
Oh wind, for love, take me home.
Hello Fadi
How are you, Anood?
No, no, no, no, no.
You told me the dress would be ready in a week, and yesterday you sent me a message saying it would be ready in ten days. Oh! Foolish.
And you want your dress with crystals, which takes longer.
And if God wills, you will speak to Al-Anoud and take care of her?
How many lights do we have?
No, no, no, no, no, I wish the whole world would get angry, but Anond will not get angry.
What do you want more, Fadi, when they want to be jealous.
Oh my God, I love the way they speak. I'm jealous of them, unlike our people.
Don't make me forget about it.
Is my dress ready?
Here you are, Fadi.
Thank you, brother Fadi.
Brother Fadi, I'll come to get the dress next week, okay, goodbye.
How can I help you?
Send the dress to my house only.
No, I didn't like it.
Masha'Allah, today I went to Fadi at the shop, he's doing extraordinary work and the girls are coming and going.
Praise be to God, we were very successful in this project.
What's the story?
Abu Nasser, my cousin.
What happened to him?
Look at the jealousy!
And we haven't heard that he started a project, where will he get the money from?
Open your mouths, plunder!
And when he begins his work,
Sure?
I heard rumors.
And if God wills, you won't do anything?
7 a.m.
Would you like them to bring you breakfast?
No, thank you, I've already had breakfast.
Okay, I want to talk to you about something.
I heard that you,
You want to start a business.
I don't know anything about such things, God guide you, my cousin.
Design, women's fashion designs and other similar matters?
Who lied to you?
I am a businessman!
No, no, no, no, no, no, but I ...
You need consultation, you need %pw I'm ready if you need any help.
Thank you, thank you, oh! Cousin, thank you.
Excuse me, I have to go.
Enter, my friend.
The first time you told me you needed a raise.
Fadi, tidy up the shop. I see you're busy.
The shop is not spacious enough.
I said you'd rent the shop next door, trust God and take it.
I hope so.
Did they rent the shop next door?
Is there anyone named Khalaf Sultan Al-Seifi other than your cousin Abu Nasser?
No, none?
I'm from the Ministry of Economy. I saw his name on a transaction at my friend's place. His name is Essam, and he's in charge of his papers.
Women's fashion design
Sure?
I saw the ring and his name was written on it.
What happened to him, what happened to him, what happened to him.
What's wrong with it? What's wrong with it? There's nothing wrong with it. There's a fault in it.
Your sick heart didn't stop you.
When I saw that my project was successful,
You told me I had to destroy it.
This is an open market for everyone.
%pw Abu Nasser
Is he a shepherd? What does he say?
And I was testing you, I told you, "Are you the one who is to open the work?"
I didn't lie to you, Dad.
Secrecy is the best policy.
I don't care about you or your demands.
But this won't take you there.
Come on, man, it's a living, and everyone's gotta make a living.
You beat me.
Come, you're cousins.
No, no, no, Abu Saleh is a cross-border man.
You trained me in my house!
Open to everyone!
You are brothers.
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
Bring a Lebanese designer.
I am a lady, ask me.
I know our ladies, they love Lebanese men.
Madam, this looks wonderful on you, no, no, no, this one, there's nothing like it in the whole country.
Oh, halt your tongue, madam! With such sweet words, a thousand-dollar item is sold for thirty or forty thousand.
Yeah, do as he did.
You remember that the cabinet you made last year when you brought the Lebanese carpenter.
Madam, I will design for you a wardrobe unprecedented in every quarter.
Witness, when you desire success.
What exactly happened to him?
Why don't you know?
This means he stole the clients.
What about moving to another place? Oh! Bosnia.
What do you remember, what do you remember, Fadi!
And at this time, they will walk alone.
Which means we were defeated, no!
Let's face them!
And bringing our customers back, whether they like it or not.
Do you have money to pay?
I'm paying.
I'm ready to do anything,
But most importantly, he won't defeat me.
This dress that you chose costs sixty thousand riyals.
Of course, without the contract in the middle.
A gift from the designer, from me.
And I had it made for you from crystal. There are only fifty pieces of this crystal in the whole world, and this piece is very unique.
Of course there's no discount, our prices are world-famous.
No, of course not, who would do that?
Madam, wait, wait, what's wrong? What happened?
Strike us, O Sa'd, strike us!
Is this something they do?
They killed us, we don't have more customers.
This is called war, oh! Abu Nasser.
Let's just see!
We fight them the way they fight us, and we also respond to them.
Tomorrow I will take a loan from the bank.
And I'm starting a war against them, and you'll see what I'll do.
Abu Nasser won't stop her.
Look at the ad!
Look at the ad he's putting out!
We offer two free evening dresses with every wedding dress.
Create four evening dresses with each wedding dress.
We publish an ad in a quarter page.
See, he placed a half-page ad.
I don't know what's going to happen!
Does Mother Nasser believe in me?
For six days, not a single customer entered their store.
No, and this afternoon they didn't open, they closed.
And you'll hear that he's putting his shop up for sale.
I'm going to kill him, I'm going to kill him.
Even they can't sit there, so sit outside.
Okay, drink your tea and go to him.
"Tea, may God guide you? I can't drink it, that's a problem."
Does anyone bear you a grudge?
Someone blessed by God deliberately sprayed the store with this smell.
And those chemicals
Are you sure someone sprayed a scent in the store?
You are cousins, you are young, not children to fight like this.
He came at night and sprayed a foul smell in the shop, is that fair?
I didn't spray anything, it's your turn.
Don't cross the line.
I signed a pledge at the police station.
Don't worry.
This time
I left a hellish plane for him.
Without anyone blaming me.
No, everything is fine.
That's what bothers me.
I swear I don't know what's going on, this is the fourth day that not a single customer has come to our store.
"And this is not the place, we have to go to the other place. I had uncovered my face. May God guide you."
And what did the doctor tell you?
The shop is empty and no customers come.
I don't know if they did magic to him.
Women and girls should not come near the shop.
As if by magic, Saad was turned into a beast.
Possible, anything is possible these days.
He is charming and evil.
Okay, are you asleep or awake?
Go see it, brother, go. I'm afraid the roof is going to collapse.
You lost, Sultan, you lost.
I don't know, he brought a dog!
He created a companion for him!
Calm down, brother. Don't get upset.
I don't know what to do.
Tell me, my love, what did you do to him? They say his friends have started collecting money and paying off his debts.
It's designed.
Lebanese mouse
I told him, didn't I?
I don't know where he is?
The stars are out and I'm eagerly searching for those additions.
Call the young man again, he might have an emergency.
What happened to you, what happened to you, Uncle Ahmed?
What's wrong with you, Ahmed! You're just sitting there while the manager is yelling at me! What should I do? Where are those workers you said you'd bring today?
It's better for you to leave me alone, I've already contacted him and I have a headache even to ask Mr. Abdullah.
First of all, don't scream. We're actors and we need to relax a bit; we have to focus on our roles. Secondly, the man has called more than once in front of me, just calm down.
What did Abu Abdullah say? What did he say?
Oh God! What do I do now, Sir Abdullah? The director will finish the scene and leave me behind.
Alright, guys, alright, guys.
We want to wrap up, but the additional actors who are supposed to be in this scene haven't arrived yet.
No one wants to be shouted at, right?
Do your work quietly and without shouting.
This is always our situation, screaming since morning. We need to focus.
I've found a solution for you.
What do you think about managing yourself with a scene, even if I bring you an actor to play the role perfectly, God willing?
It's true that he'll only appear in one scene.
But this scene is the most important scene in the series.
But please, sir, let me go and be released now, please.
But if I'm not ready today, I'll leave.
Come on, guys, let's go upstairs.
I'll ask you something in Filipino, is that okay?
She doesn't know Abu Walid. She quit immediately. He needs someone who is elite, has to be elite and Qatari.
Come on, man, he'll wear the keffiyeh and the agal, no one will notice.
Are you serious, Alaa? You just want the easy way out, that's disrespecting people's feelings and intelligence.
He assigned all the responsibilities to you, divided the tasks, and became a spectator.
Be calm, so we can think. Let your thoughts wander with mine, you might remember someone from your friends.
Who is he?
Ahmad, do you remember someone from the authority neighborhood named Saud Oxide?
The same black Rabat cloth.
Say: Saud hunted!
The manager said he needs a rich man of status and you're saying cans.
Dear, by the end of the day it's extra, you will bring a rich and distinguished man to the extra shift.
But with a little makeup, Reem, in clean clothes, a clean dress, and a luxury car.
It might be suitable.
How do we reach him?
I know their house.
Peace be upon you
Happy cans?
Where is he?
Yes, yes, yes, that's it, that's it.
Yes, that's it, thank you very much.
And now how will my mother work? There is no other shawl besides this triple one that my uncle brought from abroad.
Your son has nothing but what you're wearing.
My son, she's inside the closet under my clothes.
People are wondering what's happening outside.
God help you, my son.
This means I'll see you today and you'll be on TV.
Oh yes, my mother said and they said I would be on TV as one of the elite.
Sit down, miser.
Come on, man. What's this? Spitting on you.
Organized, organized.
Here, Mother.
Quickly, Mom, do you feel better?
God willing, my son.
"I seek forgiveness from God, I hope they just give you money."
God help you.
Pray for me.
I bring you Saudi sun, Saudi laptop.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, with the blessings and mercy of God.
This is Abboud, Fatima's son, Abboud?
Hello, hello
Hello, Saud?
Is he going to create the scene?
I hope, God willing, that he does a good job, speaks with enthusiasm and remains silent, so that he makes you believe in a complex role.
Tell me how your mother is.
She's not the same person who used to gather berries like before.
Shame on you, shame on you, be quiet.
You are now wearing glasses.
You are an old man now.
Don't change, or you'll regret that I endorsed you.
The man they brought to play the role of Abu Abdulaziz.
He is here, they brought him, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Try hard, this is our manager Mr. Javle Fadil.
The most important thing is not to be afraid of the camera.
Brother, I'm only afraid of God.
Don't worry, just shut up and listen to his instructions, and say yes to anything the director tells you.
Oh brother, oh brother please, you'll be a role of the elite, one of the wealthy, understand or not?
Come here, boy, come here, boy!
I'm talking to you.
He is absent-minded, the role needs a level-headed person.
Everything is acceptable from some people.
Ask me why I speak like this.
My brother, we bought this one for filming. Listen, I'll make you up now and we'll do a rehearsal.
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you.
Come here, please.
Introduce me to her.
Stop, stop, stop here here!
Praise be to God you came, come, come.
Boss, the car you need for the scene is ready.
Saoud will make everything clean, he will fix it.
Let's repeat it again, and the assistant director will see you and please the director.
Imagine yourself as a well-known merchant.
You're saying this?
Oh, oh, I'll ask you, wait, wait, don't hurry, I didn't expect that from you. Oh! (Abu Abdulaziz), say you are Abu Abdulaziz.
For our rights
Beautiful, and you should know!
Let him clean my teeth, brother.
He will clean and complete the full name Abu Abdulaziz Falah Al-Marzook, Lovely.
Excellent, I go, I go and think.
Consider your daughter divorced.
Why do you care why he divorced her?
Your daughter is divorced, is she beautiful? Is she beautiful?
She's beautiful, go and consider yourself, we won't get married.
Why do I persist in this?
Great, you're amazing and he remembers everything, amazing.
Let %pw clean my teeth.
How? Why?
Guys! The homeowners surprised us; they need the living room. The director decided to finish the living room scenes first, then we'll do the exterior scenes.
How so? They don't want %PW!
Yes, they want to, they want to, but it's been postponed for later. They will shoot another scene, and we will follow them, God willing.
Should I tell them to bring you some tea?
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you.
Good morning, Your Honor.
Hello, which tribe are you from, boy?
My name is His Excellency Salem Abu Showei Showei.
Grilling is popular.
You deserve it.
Numb, my nose is big and also the lips can be placed here.
Tell me, brother, people with thin noses nowadays,
I hold myself.
If it were someone else, they would keep laughing.
Hold this for a minute.
Hello, Mom
It's very urgent, I need to go quickly, brother!
You're going to go with these clothes.
I don't have time, I told you my mother is sick, she is very ill and she said!
Listen to me. You can go like this, but when I call you, you must come immediately.
He and I, we can't get out of the place.
Okay, okay, I'll ask for a taxi. Oh, brother!
Which taxi? If you set your sights on a taxi for a year, you won't find one.
We were able to rent the car for the film.
As long as it's parked, take it.
Brother, give me the key, my mother is sick, give me the key, give it to me.
He's in the car.
I need a wheelchair.
Wait a minute, bring me the wheel now, oh! The sheikh.
Can I tell you something? Can I tell you something?
My mother is very sick in the car and I need a wheelchair, please.
Where is the patient? In the car?
My son, my son, what happened?
Be quiet and don't speak, just look and remain silent.
Peace be upon you
There's nothing wrong, but my mother, madam, is having an asthma attack, quickly.
Here, I'll tell them to make the bed.
Okay, okay
Don't exhaust yourself.
God save you, what have you done?
Excellent or Rashid
Take care of our son Rashid.
As you wish, come with me, Professor Rashood.
Come with me, Sir Rashid.
And I'll take Mr. Rashoud, and I'll do what's necessary for him.
This is what's expected of you.
I'll ask the nurse to come and see what you would like to drink, Excellency.
Come with me, Sir Rashid.
Sorry
What should I do where there are too many people, I can't wait!
The problem is that no one cares about us.
Sir, what would you like to drink? Tea, coffee, or cappuccino?
You're not the first; Nasser, the hospital security guard, married a Filipino woman.
Who told you I was rejected?
Not even a single woman gives me attention.
They philosophize and they demand.
He doesn't have a certificate. I don't want to see your mother. What's this, I don't want to see your mother! Go ask your friends.
Oh brother! There's a girl in the hospital, I like her.
If I neglect you, find someone else.
What I can Oh! Brother, the heart is connected.
Your brother has fallen in love, can you believe it, when I see her
Take this to Dr. Mohammed.
What's wrong with you!
Go now.
God damn you.
Your Honor, our aunt is now in full health.
You're a professional actor Oh! Saud, oh! The coming men!
Bravo, see how they applaud you and praise you.
Okay, I'll go and change your clothes and remove your makeup.
Come on, man, forget about that. Come and take a breath for me here first.
Yes, from now on, my name is Falah Al-Marzook.
Forget about this and write Saud.
Saud died.
From now on, my name is Fahad Al-Marzouk, Abu Abdulaziz.
God bless you, my dear.
One buffet!
I did two.
Until I heard one of the bride's relatives say, "Wow, they're so classy. I don't think anyone could do something similar to what they did at the wedding."
Okay, my love, goodbye.
My mother sees this.
I have to get them something for this occasion of signing the marriage contract.
What's the story, Mom?
Let's see your brother who's going to humiliate us!
Eww, that's embarrassing. Anyway, they're cheap.
But this is based on our budget, it works.
Leave this for the servants to eat.
He's going to tell us a joke.
Good, I see.
This type is the free class, it is for the upper social class.
Around above average.
No, we want something extraordinary, something no one else can afford.
Pardon me, my lady, don't blame those who don't know your worth.
Shut up, shut up, you don't know anything.
I'm afraid the money I have isn't enough.
Don't embarrass us, pay with a credit card.
De luxe, very sweet, well done.
Yesterday, Saleh registered his marriage contract.
Salih Nasser!
I'm at your service, I'm at your service.
I'm coming for you.
They reserved the small hall and the food was disgusting.
Very cheap.
She called it a happy wedding.
Sure, everyone is saying the same thing.
That's what scares me!
My dear sister,
He's only concerned about money.
And he doesn't care what people say.
He's going to tell us a joke.
But we're supposed to bring something based on our budget and circumstances.
Do you know that some people take loans, sell their homes and cars just to have an extravagant wedding and to prevent people from talking about them?
Leave it to us, the cheap chocolate you were about to embarrass us with is enough.
I said the director loved Chinese food and took her home.
Alright, if the bride's family says that we choose the reception hall, the stage, and handle everything ourselves.
And you think we will choose something!
No, nothing, but the store we've been to before has a very good price.
In any case, this store designed Abu Thahab's wedding.
Has anyone used it before?
Frankly, once.
At the wedding of Mr. Mubarak's daughter.
No, no, no, we don't need anything used.
I need a theater. We are the first in the world to use it.
This means you want to stand out.
Show me what you've got.
This stage is used for the first time in Qatar.
Inspired by the information revolution, like Facebook and Twitter.
Very modern and state-of-the-art.
How much is this stage with the other arrangements?
I'll ask for you now, and not less than one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Money, money, at this rate our money won't be enough. Everything is the best, the most expensive, and exclusive; all of this costs money.
Everyone does this.
Just be quiet.
Who decided?
So, did you like this?
This is Noah's Ark.
Both are new, but Noah's ship is twenty thousand more expensive.
No, please, I think the mouse stage is much better.
Shut up, I don't need Noah's Ark.
This is marriage and its expenses. By the way, we consider ourselves middle-class.
Do I have to pay a deposit of one hundred and fifty thousand for the hall and one hundred and fifty thousand for the dance hall, the one you booked at the Ballroyal, as you call it?
I didn't say box, why this imagery and everyone wanting to outdo the other, each one trying to do better than what's been done.
This is a battle of pride, and only wedding hall owners benefit from it.
Who knows that everyone wants to be special, they take advantage of us and lie to us.
I swear I know one of my friends who says his brother owns a wedding shop.
He says that the theater doesn't cost more than 2000 riyals.
I'm waiting for that moment, but only when his father says yes.
Okay, do something.
Like other men who get married and manage their lives.
Hello Sheikh, sorry to bother you.
How are you?
I know you love grandeur.
That's why I'm calling you.
First time in Qatar, designed by international artist Peter Salomon.
A collection inspired by the nine planets.
I am from the solar system.
With the Noah's Ark stage, the appearance will be spectacular.
There's no harmony like this one; it will be the first in Qatar to use the nine planets.
Okay
It was one hundred and fifty thousand, and now?
Okay
May God be merciful to you.
As you like it.
Very expensive, brother.
By the way, I couldn't gather the eighty thousand.
All I can gather is sixty thousand, and I took twenty thousand from my brother.
Thank you, thank you very much Oh! Brother Oh! Fhad.
How can I solve things, Fahd, as long as we boast in joy, we are in trouble.
Without exaggeration.
Of course, you'll accept the invitations you like.
Oh, this week, God willing, we'll start with the invitations.
My wedding was better than theirs.
Mom, look at the invitations my son chose for the celebration.
Where does your brother live?
People now travel to countries just to design their invitations.
Unlike Amina's family, they went to Italy to design their invitation, printed it, and came back. And also Manar's family.
They went to France, even people who aren't rich, they go to Lebanon to get their invitations.
The system works like this in the country, do you want us to be different?
Why, which country do you want to travel to?
We saw some wonderful invitations.
Sure, it's expensive, though.
But it's private, and no one has ever done that before.
Shine, I love it.
Gold will be much better, it shines.
Oh brother, if he can't afford the wedding expenses,
So why did he involve himself?
And stop boasting and showing off at weddings, and all this unnecessary spending.
The only outlet for our madness is hotels and wedding planners.
There he is, he has left, may God have mercy on him.
Let me answer him, he might not find anyone to take him.
Come, I'll drive you.
Thank you, Abu Nasser.
Brother, the bride's family has to support you.
I tried once, just once.
I told them there that there was no need for a dance theater in a very famous hotel.
Why, I found our daughter on the street, and the others are no better than her.
This is the problem, everyone is watching each other.
Who told you I got married?
At least they don't have that pride.
It's all about a simple party and some small expenses.
Oh, my dear man, they're now looking for Facebook brides.
Cheaper and less costly.
This means you won't marry from your country.
Forget about the subject, you want me to be crazy.
You're going to see.
If I don't get Abdullah Roeshd or Nawal for my son's wedding party.
Curse her, she won't be better than me.
I want to ask you something, dear.
If your son has Rawaished's number, give it to us so we can get in touch with him.
Alright my love, thank you very much, goodbye.
Mom, we agreed on the DJ. Why did you change your mind?
Is Umm Nasser better than me?
"Did you forget who she is and who we are?"
People who were less than us, became better than us.
It's not like this, Mom. Look at my brother Saleh, he broke my heart, and we don't pressure him like this.
Truly, he broke my heart.
I see!
In the hospital! When and which hospital.
I don't know, she just fell suddenly.
I heard that and suddenly fell.
He has no point and no one can blame her, after she returned everything and people knew, he simply said he didn't want a wedding.
He's trying to embarrass us.
What did the doctor say?
He's going to shame us, he wants to call off the wedding.
And I hope everything is fine.
Don't break her heart.
"My son, you are a man, and you are the provider."
Go, soothe her.
I swear, if I told Abu Yusuf this, his heart would stop beating.
Do you have any idea why the minister kept Abu Youssef until now?
In any case, he should have retired three or four years ago.
There's nothing wrong with it, it will help me.
I swear, you're crazy.
Understood, what do I want from him now?
And you will allow him to hide the documents and data until the money is returned.
They call it amount cooling postponement.
I won't ask, and I don't know why you're scared.
There's nothing to be afraid of, and I promise I'll pay you back.
Do you know what they call me, do you know what they call me?
Disciplined, disciplined ones.
Aunt, aunt, I've tried, but there's no other solution.
If I give you and then the review people,
They are strict in review, they will take me, quickly, quickly.
Fast, the board, the board, the board.
I ate, the grandmother ate.
No, no, God willing, from 7:30 we will have a reception for guests in the ballroom.
No, no, there definitely will be.
I'm going to throw a wedding for my son that will be the talk of all Doha.
Surprise!
Okay, Fatima, I'll talk to you later.
I'm worried about you. They envy you, my son, if you enter upon them like that in the bisht.
Oh mother, is the length of the coat good?
The police are here!
God willing, there's nothing wrong.
Police, just sit here, I'm coming back.
God is enough for you, Salwa.
Forget your marriage.
Marriage cage, now he will enter the prison cage.
They noticed the document I was hiding for your loan, and now suddenly, they noticed me.
Why are you depressed!
You'll hear of many more disasters than this.
So, what shall we say?
A respectful and honest employee
Whoever loves their job, the Ministries contracted a company to do the maintenance.
The employee, fearing for his job, went and inquired about the materials.
He knew it would cost four hundred thousand.
He will leave the ministry 1.6 million.
And the minister punished him! No, no, no, I can't believe it.
When you can believe!
Here is Saad.
Of course he has all the news.
He quit his job.
What happened to the world? Where are the values?
They say that he followed his office manager.
He told him: Let her work instead of Uthman.
And who is she?
She is the daughter of the manager of the same company that submitted the maintenance offer.
Any Uthman has been revealed.
No, no, no, no, this is unbelievable.
You're always amazed, oh Saleh!
Who does this company belong to?
For whom?
That's how we became!
What are you saying!
Not what I'm saying, this poor employee Uthman, what's his fault!
His fault is that he is honest and faithful!
Do you think the president is in his office?
Yes, he left a short while ago.
What's wrong with the world!
We want to see strange people.
I agree with you, Uthman doesn't deserve it, but there's nothing we can do about it.
It's not fair, sir. He has seven children and no passport.
He earns his living from this work! What will he do now and where will he go?
Do you know what happened?
The new employee whom the minister hired,
I entered Uthman's office and started working. Uthman came to take his belongings, I stopped him and told him to go, and I will send your belongings with the tea boy.
Where is he currently?
Things have changed Oh! Uthman?
This is the prize!
This is God's will.
Praise be to Allah, the Almighty.
The Almighty, the Generous God, O Uthman, God will not guide you, goodbye.
What's the story? You don't speak well!
I know, I know you're very sensitive.
What a job! I can't take it anymore. I'm leaving right now.
And this is a good opportunity for me to go to my mother's and get the things for you.
You shouldn't stay upset like this.
Why are you shouting at me? I'm your mother.
I'm not talking to you loudly, I'm just asking.
How can you do that? By what right do you go with him? Is he your husband, father, or brother?
The world has changed, where do you live?
I don't know, Mom!
You're crazy.
People have moved away, the land has become a small village, where do you live!
I say nothing!
Be modern, live in this era, and don't lag behind.
Get the stuff from the car quickly! Go, don't come out and lock it.
Something's wrong, oh! Saleh, what's wrong with you?
No, you're not fine today.
The poor maid shouted at you; it wasn't her fault.
You know I didn't mean it.
No, no, no, I don't have an appetite.
To forget the disasters I've seen.
My love, don't cry.
The leader is a bit troublesome.
We are proud of you.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Effort, hard work, and persistence.
Correct, wow.
The most important thing,
The most important thing for me in this ministry
That's right, oh! Your Honor.
Tell me, what's the benefit for an employee who doesn't take bribes?
He is useless.
That's why I want all of you.
There is no place for honest people and those who adhere to their shoddy values.
If one day you discover
He's just going to hurt himself.
Justice is a principle, no matter the reaction!
That's why I want you to cooperate with me.
If you have doubt
Just tell me.
We are thieves and sons of thieves, and who can touch our daughters?
If Nora doesn't take a bribe one day, she catches the government's tea before going home.
Excellent, excellent, bravo. This is what I expect from all of you, I don't want it to be like this only, I want all of you to be like her.
God bless you.
That's why I want you to leave the Procurement Department and take up the position of Library Manager.
By being honest, you know how to choose; you've chosen the right thief for the right place.
Enough, Umm Saud, enough. Don't insult me further.
I don't want to live in prison.
But God is sufficient for patience, He made sincerity beautiful for me and adorned me with it.
He told him to be honest.
You are a father.
Why bother with honesty and loyalty?
All your life, you've been a thief and a loafer.
It's good that I didn't become a scholar.
Let me speak with your father.
Don't do it again.
He should be on the straight path, bribing, stealing, and distancing himself to live in prosperity.
My father is in prison because all his money is illegal.
Enough, enough.
This is something to wear!
We are a respectable family.
Shame on you.
Where is your stomach?
Why isn't it clear?
There's no life in you, you're naked.
I'm shy to dress up, brother.
Are there shy girls nowadays?
Why are you screaming?
Look what your daughter is wearing!
Would a respectable lady wear something like that?
And you're walking in the street without showing any part of your body?
She doesn't listen to anything I say.
He was never here.
I bought her some unnecessary see-through clothes.
I'm warning you, if I ever see you in a place where anything is below the knee.
Since you are familiar with the subject, never blame me for the consequences.
We are here, God bless you.
He may be a playboy and a villain.
He is like his father.
As you can see before you,
He's a really good man, how can we find someone like him?
Don't worry, Uncle, I'm not feeling well.
He is a good man. Unfortunately, I love my daughter Sarah very much and care about her future.
After we heard about it.
Praise be to God, she has a very bad reputation.
I came home at three thirty in the morning.
She arrived home at 5 a.m.
Hello, hello, what! Hello.
Come and pick me up from the bar.
Start your car's engine and come pick me up from the bar.
This is the first time I've seen a father who doesn't obey his son.
Come on, Dad. Start your car, I'm waiting for you.
Mary, I love you.
I love you too, shivered, shivered, shivered.
Stop, stop, Father, Dad is here.
Where is he?
He is brave, unlike my father who doesn't enjoy life.
Let me introduce my friend, Majid, to you.
No, Abdul Aziz was my ex-friend.
Welcome, come in, a grassy opportunity.
Arab and Israeli satellites
He found that many Palestinians had not trimmed their nails.
In accordance with the commitment of the State of Palestine in the comprehensive peace agreement,
In any case, the Arab League met today to discuss Israel's request to send special inspection committees to examine Palestinians' fingers.
Let's see if their nails are long or not.
There was one condition: nothing was to be cut, torn, or anything that would draw blood.
State of Palestine
I call on the entire international community to visit Palestine.
Comprehensive Peace Agreement
Who made the cork?
Olive! Oh man.
We press olives like this, like this we press olives.
We and our Arab brothers call upon the international community
To form inspection committees for Palestinian nails.
And now, let's start the voting.
No, no, no, no, it doesn't come to that, no.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Salih, Salih, what's wrong?
Something when your dreams overwhelm you?
I dreamed of an upside-down world.
Oh Rashid, you need to have a strong personality.
Now, brother, the school you will work at tomorrow is number?
I am a teacher like you.
Since I didn't change my school, since when have I started teaching?
What character, bro?
But the problem is his weak personality.
By the way, the teachers who were with him were the ones who complained about him.
Only to that extent, my brother.
That's why you'll find it silent.
Then he started teaching.
It's not ketchup, it's mayonnaise with %Pw.
Oh brother! We're not talking to you to make you angry.
We're telling you because this is your last chance.
He told me that I accepted Rashid even though he is a weak person.
He's shy but also very good.
He is still a citizen.
Why are you so quiet, brother?
Because everything you say is true.
Everything you say is true.
From tomorrow,
The new Mr. Rashid.
Mr. Rashid,
You are absolutely right.
Okay, I'll ignore her.
From tomorrow,
Ah, that's good. And what's next?
Here I'm telling you,
I am a teacher who does not like mistakes.
Let's say a boy jumped up and told you the same thing the other boy said at your previous school, with the inspector present.
Take your bag!
Slowly, you are breaking the door.
Okay, one learns from one's mistakes.
From the first minute,
Here I'm telling you,
I'm nervous.
This is in my hand!
Shut up!
It seems he just said "Shut up!"
I heard him?
Mr. Rashid fired me.
It seems he said it's okay, but he'll see, I don't want to see your face here in class.
Teacher, don't you know who he is?
Whose son is he?
Here comes Mr. Rashid.
Saw it?
The problem is telling my father.
Who, where do you usually see him? = Sitting, during the break.
You might find him in the seating area, sitting down.
Above the chairs.
The chair, the chair.
We are finishing a person today.
But you shouted at me!
Friends mocking, you're joking with me.
My father is abroad and he will return next week, and when he returns, I will tell him.
No, no, no, no, Abdel Rahman, may God protect you.
We are friends. By the way, strawberry ice cream is really good, you should try it. It has a bit of acidity, but it's wonderful.
Okay, go get it quickly.
The only thing I'm afraid of is him telling my father.
I said his father is abroad.
Oh, he's out, his father isn't coming back? So they took his father's things and kicked him out!
I hope there are no serious consequences.
I carried a bag and brought it to him, gave him your phone number, and told him to call me if he needed anything. I'm your friend.
Ay, just.
Yes, but what?
You're the ones who told me.
Scream and pretend you're strong.
Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.
Oh Rashid!
Sleep, you can sleep, you can sleep, don't bother yourself, sleep.
Sir Abu Nasser, Sir Rashid is in the bathroom.
One juice.
Come here, come here, come here, come here, leave it to me.
Go, quickly.
Put them on the table.
All people are equal.
That's why I brought you here, to hear your ideas for the celebration.
How can one guarantee a child?
This will get us into trouble, that is, he is calling.
It's three o'clock.
Anything, hello. The line is cut, I swear he's mocking.
Faster, faster.
Peace be upon you
Stand for the inspector, sit down.
Yes, I'm at your service.
Oh professor, come, come to her, oh professor.
Are you done screaming?
I'm not mocking, oh! Man, but I'm asking you, are you done?
Are you done or not? Where is the teacher's dignity? With this behavior, you are degrading yourself and the teaching profession.
Okay, okay, alright, alright
And you're raising your voice too?
Yes, I'm raising my voice, first you need to know who this boy is?
Faster, faster.
Just two cars.
Car, two cars, no no, I want four or five cars. Wider, wider, we have plenty of space. Go, go, go.
He thinks he owns the place!
Abu Nasser used to do this and not do that.
O Allah, help him.
I am the school principal here.
Knows that Abu Nasser
Use to give all teachers extra classes.
Calculate me.
I am the school principal here.
You're the manager, God guide you, what's wrong with you?
Put your foot down.
What you put in your head, is on the chair Oh! Brother.
What does %Pw mean?
No problem, I swear I want to make things easier for you.
What's her name?
So what's on your mind now?
Do what's best for yourself and take extra lessons whether you like it or not.
What's wrong with you? Go, go, go, get out!
Okay, I'll leave.
As you wish, we've told you, man.
We keep it within its limits.
Wait, people, wait.
What's our plan, Abu Salmin?
O Abu Nayef! You are the leader of the snake and you should prevent it from crossing the line.
I am my father's son.
You'll see how I'll deal with her.
Faster, faster.
Goodbye, Your Honor.
Wow, when did he buy this new car?
I told you, but you didn't believe me.
He shaved his mustache and his face turned red.
I didn't recognize him when he arrived, but when he spoke, I recognized him by his voice.
Do you know he was promoted a week ago?
That means he is responsible for eight schools for boys and girls.
What is this crazy secret? Ask him, he'll tell you, what's the secret they found at the bottom!
Here I'm telling you from day one,
When I teach, I don't want to hear a sound.
Not even a breath.
Behave yourself well.
And you too answer me, and you too argue with me. Get out of my face, get out, get out, get out.
When you become a minister, look for a good job alongside you.
So don't tell me to come and take this job.
Either the second job, no brother, give me options, different jobs, and I'll choose the most suitable job.
My brother is a minister!
I don't see myself feeling comfortable about the call they made to me.
Everyone congratulates me.
Something they say, "O Mother, our Lord guides you."
This is very common. Every minister appoints his friends and people automatically.
From this side, don't worry, it's a pleasure to meet you %Pw.
They know I'll become a minister.
In it, they are spraying me, this is a compensation gift.
Wealth is coming to us, a treasure, a treasure that will be revealed to us.
The big earth
Go, everyone, to congratulate the new minister.
Go, go, go!
Congratulations, Your Excellency the Minister.
By the blessing of your honor, congratulations.
Congratulations to you, sir, you deserve it.
You deserve it, Sir Minister.
Oh sisters, the responsibility is great. May God help us bear it.
As the saying goes, you are very qualified for this job.
I went, then I called Abu Saleh.
It was far from him.
Forget him.
I'm surprised to see how she loves him now?
And Abu Sultan is not stupid.
Yes, I opened the car door for him.
Congratulations, you've done a lot!
We are waiting for our brother to become a minister.
I told you, Mother, but you don't believe me.
You were saying they were café stories, café stories.
After her husband died, she said I was jealous of him.
Seek refuge in Allah, seek refuge in Allah.
Ah, you don't have anything to say, you have nothing.
Mama, let's go, I'm bored.
Mind your own business.
You just need to be lazy.
I cut them off because they made me feel anxious.
Yes, they are right.
But I didn't want to say it in front of my mom, you know my mom, she'll tell everyone.
She says anything she hears, they call her the sieve, we don't want a scandal.
What guarantees do you have that, if he steps down from power, they will put you in his place?
Because I asked.
If he's out of the office, you'll be the first candidate.
What assures you that they will fire him?
No, I'm very sure about this.
Don't remind her, I saw him outside the office just as I see you now in front of me.
I will bewitch him.
But the plan in my head is guaranteed and effective.
This is a plan. Burn it and dispose of it.
I'll make him attend every event that happens in the country.
At that time, he will be burned. When he is burned, he will be removed from office. When he is removed from office, he will be expelled.
I swear, brother, I don't know how and I don't know what to tell you!
Your visit is called, it's called participation that reflects how much I love your country.
Do you think so?
Today you are a state official, you must always be present.
You have to participate in everything, sorry Your Excellency, sorry, sorry.
Before I forget, thank you for the lamb you sent me yesterday.
Come on, this is just a simple sheep, it's not your place. What do you think your honor is, coming with me today?
The man is waiting for you outside!
With honesty,
I don't want to go.
I am sick, I am sick of the place, I am sick of it.
You are the minister today, he is right. As he said, you are a social figure, do something in your own interest!
God bless this kind man.
Thank you, thank you, thank you
Don't take my picture.
God, God.
Today I took him to a poetry night and to a wedding, and more than a hundred pictures were taken of him.
Here I'll tell you about something very nice that I go with him to.
Listen, I've also arranged a very nice educational activity for you.
Yes, like this. Let it shine, I want it to shine, shine, shine until it glitters. I'm looking for this glitter.
Seller, thank you. Congratulations, congratulations. Blessed bicycle. %PW Picture, your picture. Take a picture, take a picture. Don't take my picture, I'm far away, take it.
This is a bicycle.
A blessed beginning and congratulations, Your Excellency Yahya.
Picture, picture like this. You're cute, cute on you.
Nothing, God bless you.
Go to the second page.
No, he doesn't know that.
National Participation
Say "Mashallah"
This is the fourth friend who has invited me today.
Everyone praises your activities; Umm Khalid calls you the disgruntled social activist.
Yesterday, I heard a word that offended me.
The party that Abu Sultan took me to yesterday.
The little kids' swim party winner.
A person was telling his friend,
They thought I hadn't heard them.
This minister said
I want to buy a birthday present for my brother.
Hello, hello
I see you every day in the paper.
Correct, correct,
I came in a rush when I came to this store, I'll give you a discount on everything you want.
Whether you want to pay or not, no problem.
This means you won't go and sit with your minister.
I, I am Abu Saleh, the minister.
Abu Sultan didn't come to pick me up. I'm waiting for him.
And he sat me in the front row, then went to the car to rest.
We don't need anything from you, may God guide you.
Please, Miss, may God keep your parents. I'll talk to you later, just to confirm.
And you are inviting yourself.
People are giving us discounts.
I told you.
This job is great.
As soon as this young man comes to get me!
The minister's happiness annoyed me, may God harm him.
Hello, hello Minister.
No, but I'm a bit tired today.
Okay, if you're that enthusiastic, I'm at your service.
We're at your service, but my brother Saad will take you and go with you and hopes he can find you a party or something.
Then, a party?
No, no, today we have no activities.
No, I don't have it.
Where can we find him?
Yes. Thank you, thank you.
Who can I ask?
Go ahead, God will grant you success.
Sleep and rest
One moment, Saad.
Something even for Hina's night?
Is this good?
There might be extra time.
Take it! Put it in the booth and look for a photographer to take some pictures of his face.
Okay, okay, goodbye.
Something you stumbled upon, do you have it?
I don't know, a reserve league match. Let him stay alone on the field!
What is this! This minister is turning our world upside down!
Excellent, that means he reached the summit.
His end is near as he has become the talk of the town.
Your Excellency, he has become more famous than you.
Your Highness, if you go to a place and take Abu Saleh with you,
Your Honor,
Shining star
Here we turn it off and return it to its normal size.
The minister came, came, came. The minister came.
Don't take pictures! I swear, if anyone takes my picture, I'll do something to them. Let's not go out.
Brock broke their cameras; I don't want pictures.
She sends you her regards.
As they say, I missed the train.
This is my brother's immortality.
"There is no power or might except by Allah."
Why?
This is the first time I've seen him.
The first time you meet him!
The first time I've seen him in years.
Oh my God
Is this Khaloudi?
I haven't seen you in a long time, come to me, my love.
What does he do? He's very attached to her.
"There is no power or might except with Allah, it returns to the same issue."
Exit, exit and don't give me a headache. I came back from the wedding at 3 a.m.
Let me rest and don't make it hard.
Your brother is a girl.
I swear I'll tell my dad, look at yourself, you look like a girl.
It means he was playing, playing.
Ah, he was playing, I tell you he was playing with the makeup palette.
And this is Saud, I know what to do with him.
Khalid the Orphan, I wish all children were like him.
About these campaigns and the nonsense they create about his brother.
Come here, my dear brothers, come and say hello.
How are you, my love?
No, dear, we're not going to Spain this summer.
Who are you talking to?
Fahd from Kuwait
Hello, Hamada!
Listen to what I say.
"There is no power or might except by Allah."
I'll leave it to my dear workers to choose for themselves.
But really, what do you think?
I say whoever sees the sea is better.
So that soon, if we buy a yacht, we can go from our house directly to the sea.
Us and our children.
Please, you need to make a decision about the wedding date.
Okay, just one year and two months.
What happened to your brother, he puts on too much perfume.
Frankly, I noticed that your brother Khalid, I don't know.
But he is quite different from your brother Saad.
Different or not different, my dear, everyone is free in their actions.
And your fiancé has a retrograde mind, he doesn't know that there is a unified perfume.
Let your future husband keep his opinion to himself!
They're fine.
I can't believe it, Khalid!
You don't have a perfume that you use like women.
You even use their colors.
Why are you doing this, Khalid?
Really, you have nothing to say.
Mama, why don't you want to believe in him? Don't you see his actions and behavior?
Now perfumes are unisex.
Here I warn you.
Have you seen the Bluetooth?
I heard about it from my friends at the council; they say it's very prevalent in Doha.
I've heard about it, show us.
You have to see it, and then I'll tell you.
Look how that girl dances!
Look at the moves!
These are girls! Look at this one who says she dances well and does some moves, do you know who she is? She's Khadija's cousin, Mohammed.
The doll is for my cousin's daughter.
Alright, you'll see what I'll do with it.
His brother Saad is waiting for him now.
Why? Let him come and see. Let the kid come! I'll send him a Bluetooth file so his family can see it.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, hello, hello.
Of course, I was defeated.
Why is my cousin sitting so far away?
Nothing, but is your Bluetooth on?
No, but I'll send you something.
No, thank you, Amira.
He ran away from his family.
Are you crazy, Saad?
And I'm traveling tomorrow.
I'll never forget your face in this country.
Where are you going by yourself?
What do people think?
They say their son has left them and traveled, why do you want to cause trouble for us!
Sure?
And whatever your son Khalid does is honor and glory!
A man who becomes a woman, isn't that a scandal?
I can't face people if they say this is the gay brother.
Tell him he travels for treatment, study, work, or even that he commits suicide.
The most important thing is that I don't live in a place where scandal chases me every day.
Where are you going?
I don't care where I go.
This is the end.
The second thing I don't know where it is, and that's when he's packing his bag to travel.
Even we don't know where he's going.
What did you expect him to be?
What's your problem? I brought you here to give me comfort, and you're throwing harsh words at me that break my heart.
I was telling you to watch out for him.
What you leave to him for the servants.
You don't know anything about it and you're busy.
And your father is busy with his work and left the responsibility to you.
You're right, Mom.
Is there no hope for your sister?
In this, you are correct.
What Khadija did humiliated us among the people.
I can't see anyone.
Did you tell him anything?
This is my father's biggest mistake.
We are dealing with the strange case of homosexual adultery.
I told him.
Put it on a CD and give it to him.
Only when I go to the airport.
I'm very worried about him.
Our house has to reach that point, oh! {Hope.
Don't be surprised.
Khulood and her colleagues are not concerned with the affairs of their families.
And the reputation of their brothers and sisters
Religious values called them.
They go dancing and rejoicing.
In the wicked pit
Sure, son, I'm busy with doubt.
Goodbye, Father.
Choose for yourself, my son.
Yes, Father, I have a small gift for you, Father.
A gift for me!
Now put the CD in the laptop, I'm afraid of what will happen, come with me!
Okay, Mom.
I can't believe the father is still watching the CD, it's only three minutes long.
He might go.
Where will he go? There's not enough time for him to go anywhere.
Answer me, what's wrong with you, Abu Saad?
Father!
Okay, Amal.
If I search, I will fail.
To find someone with your values,
But spare me.
God help you.
I see you coming to the roof!
Ah, yes, my love.
We are living in an age of freedom.
The age of human rights, and no one can force us to do anything.
If someone has one riya, they can take a thousand oh! My dear.
Of course I can handle it. God bless America.
Do you know that salaries are high now?
One thousand two hundred.
God help you, every time I speak to a driver, I ask him, "What's your salary?"
My salary is too low.
When he sees me, he starts complaining, my salary is low and there's no benefit. We reached an agreement with him that his salary is seven hundred and I raised it by a hundred when he got the license, what more does he want?
I told him, "When a year of work is up, we'll raise your salary."
He seems greedy and we're going to have trouble with him.
Alright, alright, be quiet, be quiet, go back and put it down.
It's easy for you to say, it's easy.
Although we praise him, I hate going out with him in the car.
Alright, I'll take care of it.
Tell me the story now, I'm the man of the house. Be quiet, okay, you too be quiet, I'll do it.
Come on, I need you outside, come on!
Come and stand.
What did I tell you?
I said your friends don't come to your room. Did I say that or not?
This is not my friend, he's my uncle.
He came for five minutes and will leave, God willing.
Five minutes!
Keep him in mind!
Don't tell the lady that I need a raise in my salary, I need a raise in my salary!
Everything in the world is expensive now.
And when did I see you for a hundred?
I have a lot of problems at home.
These drivers in Doha earn one thousand one hundred, one thousand two hundred.
And maybe one thousand three hundred.
Wait, I'll think.
Listen, I'll lift 100% more if you're quiet. Be quiet, I won't lift you.
You say I raised you an extra hundred, go work!
What did he say?
I'll tell you a story.
There's no use with water.
No use with water.
I'm scared shitless.
Why are you afraid?
All the drivers fled.
Because they work outside the home for three or four thousand.
What's the problem? When you work at home, it's useless, but when you work outside, you make more money.
I'm very scared.
Look at these people, they're all drivers.
How much?
Two thousand five hundred
But I'm afraid of the police who will pull me over and arrest me.
No, don't be afraid.
I guarantee you.
I was putting on my abaya and about to leave.
I used to pray and my prayers were answered.
He opened his room and the wardrobe was empty.
Muna's maid ran away for a year.
I'll just say, "God will judge him."
Okay, I'll come to you.
I went to the police.
If you file the reports, you won't bear any responsibility.
Here we do everything we can.
And you too, look around in the neighborhood, you might see him and let us know.
Yes, he will make money, and when he is satisfied, he will surrender by himself.
We bring them, we spend money on them, we provide clothes, food, and a driver.
It's not up to him.
The match is starting now, go inside, go inside quickly.
Yes, we were worried.
These are foxes, and foxes are not easily hunted.
Do you know if it's not more than three that means we haven't won, we need ten or fifteen.
This is blatant sarcasm, blatant sarcasm. To be clear, this is blatant sarcasm.
That's his level. If he doesn't score more than three, that's not the Foxes' team.
Take my face.
In ourselves, in the players, and in the performance.
They have nothing, they should thank God if they score less than three, they should thank God.
Any goal, these are just appetizers. Our team is still hungry, this is the Foxes team, leave us alone, man.
You've scored a goal now, you're relaxed and happy now.
Do you think there are other goals, or does it stop here?
This fox is very good, it's very smart. It goes here and there and no one can catch it, you'll get dizzy. This fox eats chickens.
No, I don't have a car.
You are my friend.
Did you hear what he said?
This fox said it's a very big problem.
What you can't find.
Yes, sir.
Do you know or not?
He is a fan of the Foxes team.
He sometimes appears on the program "Refresh Yourself."
They are winning today and you are losing.
I swear I'm a Hansup. The Foxes never lose, always the winner.
Fox, what do you think of the result today?
Why do you ask me about the result?
Finished, Foxes are the winner.
The Java birds took their livelihood and flew away.
Let's be realistic, don't say the foxes won and flew away.
These foxes are my friends.
This fox takes the chicken and eats it.
I didn't see what you did on the field, Ikram.
The audience can't stop laughing at him.
Clear on the field and thank you for listening.
The true fan with genuine loyalty to the club.
He's speaking to the Qatari elite who go to malls and places like that.
He invited me to buy a cappuccino.
That's a strange idea, man.
The guys gave me five hundred riyals in front of everyone and that's the end of it.
Let's recite the poem you wrote about our match against the frogs.
Thank you to all the listeners here.
You are a frog.
You're not alive to be ashamed that my team lost to you by four.
Speak boldly, speak boldly about the club and the team and see what happens!
You don't say!
When one of the foxes was driven out
The reason behind that is a rule.
A player from the Fox team went out.
I changed his name from Hakim to Ahmaq.
Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the listeners here.
Every month we meet and choose the best fan.
Fantastic, who did you choose to honor next month?
The board members of the club will decide.
"They're all boys, and each one of you is as big as a camel."
I manage this big club. The shirts.
Come, come and see the driver who escaped from us, he's on TV, come.
Is that it?
This one speaks well, the other is silent.
What do you think? Is it a pen or a watch?
Now, I know how to get there.
The audience left.
Turn around.
Turn here.
He was driving fast.
We lost him now.
Excellent!
Shut up, you don't decide. I'm the man of the house and I decide.
When we are certain.
Majid Abdurrahman Al-Sabji
Yes, yes, yes, God bless you.
I am from the Subay tribe.
Buy it and register it under my name. No, no, no, no, I don't want to live in it, I already have a house.
I only want to invest.
Because the investment price is rising, God bless you.
How can I assist you, people? What do you want?
* * May God bless you,
Come on, folks, want some coffee?
"You have nothing to say 'God bless you', you have nothing 'God exalt you'."
You're saying you're sure, is that right? He's about to embarrass us in front of the elite!
I'm very worried.
Wax, wax, I am wax.
Now, I don't know what your father is doing with us.
I didn't mean that, it's my mother.
Mom, please don't tell Dad.
Your father will turn the house upside down.
Of course, she's going to kill you now.
Mom, I swear I didn't break it on purpose.
Oh mother, why don't we buy glue and stick things together?
What are these stickers for my son?
How do we find another like it? I don't know where your uncle bought it, it was a gift.
I'm worried about you from him.
Mom, I'm afraid he's going to hit me.
Lock the door until I find a solution to this issue.
Quick, go to your room.
Uncle, uncle, uncle! Are you my uncle?
You're blind, breaking the vase, are you blind?
O my mother, has a child come to you?
No, my daughter, he didn't come. What happened to you?
He ran away from home, afraid of his father.
This is not right. Have mercy on the boy!
"This is not proper upbringing. May God guide you, my daughter."
What should I do now, Mother?
I don't know what to do!
I don't know, but I was worried about him because of the cars on the street.
God protect him, I think he went to the supermarket or went to the neighbors to play with the children.
Yes, he is sweet, kind, and beloved, my daughter.
No, no my daughter, come and seek refuge in Allah from Satan and don't worry, God willing, everything will be alright.
Take it, my daughter.
Where is his father?
My father is going to kidnap me.
Jeddah, Dad is going to kill me with his beating.
Don't panic, my dear.
Don't worry, my love.
I won't allow him to hit you.
I didn't mean to break it.
Come on, son, come and drink some water and rest in my room.
Your face turned yellow.
"O Allah, guide him, O Allah, guide him. Come with me, my son, a little bit."
O Allah, the Generous
I'm afraid my father will come here.
Come, my son, do not worry.
No one interferes with raising my son.
This is my son, and I raise him as I please.
But the poor salesman was anxious, trembling and terrified of something he had not intended to do.
Why are there no eyes?
Let's see!
The bag accidentally hit the vase, he assured me it was unintentional.
You! You have to help him!
Please don't say anything to him for me. Spare him this time, his state of fear breaks my heart.
Where is he? Where is he now? Why is he here at this time?
He's not here.
He's here! Where?
Get in, go!
No, no, I'll make it for my brother today.
Why don't you bring something else besides the old one!
Come on, Nasser! Oh, brother, we want to play!
And your mother says you're studying!
Dad's had enough of this game, he's going to smash it!
Don't you have an exam tomorrow?
Yes, Father.
Come on, Dad, join us and don't ruin the game.
Go, father, come, don't be afraid. Go, go, father, we'll read.
What are you saying! Listen to me,
If I go, I'll call your uncle Abu Walid.
No, no, no, no. Don't tell my uncle, don't tell my uncle, no!
They're fine.
I'll ask him if you're disobeying me.
Go. Everyone take their book and start studying.
Alright, Dad, put your phone in your pocket. There's a lesson, Dad, but don't tell Uncle.
Mom, I'm really very confused. I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid if he finds out, he'll cause us trouble.
Of course, she will ask me, "Why weren't you taken to the hospital?"
What's the problem if I tell him?
If he finds out that Waleed wets the bed, he'll kill him.
Oh mother, he is to blame. He is responsible for everything.
Oh, my daughter, it affects me psychologically.
The boy is not small, he is twelve years old now.
Okay, my daughter.
You will come to eat lunch with us, and I will give him some signals.
And I'll see his opinion.
Her mother went to Bahrain to buy abayas.
This is just an excuse, my daughter.
Fun and shopping
She says he wets his bed every night.
My son wets the bed every night and you don't tell me the story.
He said I must take him to the hospital so that he can be treated.
Her husband is stupid.
And he understands nothing.
It's true.
You must take him to the hospital, son, so they can find out what's wrong with him.
He is looking for a good dry hose.
He beat him until the last person in the neighborhood heard the screams.
Sit down!
Eat, my daughter, eat.
No, I didn't say anything.
Take it and go quickly and wash up, I'll ask for some clothes for you. Go!
I beg you, please.
I'll punish them.
Do not enter!
This is what you call a pass.
And Khalood got forty-nine out of fifty.
Is this a bus?
But their grades are good.
He told them they would be punished if they didn't get a perfect score.
Please, don't take them to your brother!
They must be punished.
They are my children.
Okay, I swear, uncle, uncle, this is the last time.
Why aren't you getting fifty out of fifty, fifty out of fifty?
Give him another one.
I'm telling you, don't go with us to public places.
Yesterday we went to the hospital and they told him not to enter. You are not allowed.
You're different, don't go with us.
Shut up! Let me punish his sisters.
Enough, uncle, I'm dying, I feel like I'm dying, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off. I'm dying, I feel like I'm dying, uncle, turn it off.
Let me punish you.
Keep in mind that this is not a punishment, what you will see at the end of the year if someone doesn't get fifty.
I'm going to drain the pool.
I'll fill it with oil.
Where is your certificate? Where is your certificate?
They said it would be ready tomorrow.
Khaled Abdul Rahman
Excellent, Khalid, great job.
Faisal Abdullah Rashid
Excellent! Oh! Faisal.
God bless you.
You are an outstanding student and were second in your class.
The teacher is crying because he got forty-nine out of fifty in math.
The teacher is afraid of his father because his father wants him to get a perfect score.
Oh, my son, I'm talking to you!
Call, call your classmate.
He said he saw him by the school entrance.
Call, call your mother, she might be at your grandfather's.
No, he didn't go there.
Where is he? Where is he?
"There is no power or might except by Allah."
What happened to him, brother?
Ah, of course he failed, and he's afraid of his family.
No, he didn't fail, but he was an excellent student and ranked second in his class.
But he was too afraid to go back home.
Because he only lost two marks in math.
God have mercy on him.
Walid, Walid.
Walid, Walid.
Oh father, come.
Forty-eight, forty-nine, lost a point or two, possible. I won't say anything, won't give you a scolding or a beating. Walid,
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
and nuclear energy
which accounts for sixty percent of the world's oil reserves
And the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia tops the list with twenty-four percent of the world's reserves.
Then Libya, the United States, and Nigeria.
Three percent each, and the rest of the world combined with fifteen percent.
And then
And also production.
And perhaps that is one of the secrets and reasons why the major industrial nations are racing to occupy this region and its countries.
And the highest among them is the United States of America, which is the largest consumer of oil in the world.
However, oil prices continue to rise.
With the fall of the US dollar
The benchmark for pricing oil.
Where were you yesterday when the price of a barrel reached...
This led to an increase in income in producing countries and at the same time
To increase inflation therein
When inflation in some of those countries reached fifteen percent

Prices of commodities and cost of living
In a live interview with the Deputy Prime Minister
Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry
Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah
For viewers who wish to participate, they can contact us on the program's contact numbers.
Honorable member, hello and welcome.
I want to start with you on the unprecedented prices that oil prices have reached.
Where will the prices go?
Of course, where prices will go is a puzzling question.
Or what we call market power.
I'm not OPEC.
And not the producing countries?
Neither the producing countries nor OPEC have anything to do with setting oil prices.
Is the only relationship between price is between supply and demand?
So far, supply and demand don't have much to do with it.
So what are the factors?
There are other factors besides supply and demand.
What drove investors away.
I feel a lot of pressure and have turned to oil and gold, or what is known as "commodities marketing."
Investors have lost confidence in stock markets.
And gold as well.
We've seen gold rise from $350 in past years to $970 now.
And to this day, as I mentioned before, about one hundred and nine dollars.
But they are all on the rise, and if they fall, it will be a slight decline.
Let me remind you that in the first quarter of this year
The second quarter is expected to see a decline in prices due to reduced demand for oil.
But we saw the market in a thrilling and strangely changing state.
In the second quarter and at the beginning of spring, it rises above one hundred dollars.
But this means that the previous factors that determined the rise in winter prices and consumption have now changed and there are other factors.
and economic growth
At the same time, we see oil prices rising to this level.
You mentioned political factors and said that political tensions play a role in this.
On Iran. Do you think Fallon's resignation in the midst of political complexities
Who accompanied her and today led most of the activities of American newspapers and the world press. It may affect oil prices.
Yes, one hundred percent, and today?
Today, we are in the age of globalization, and influence comes rapidly.
Unreal factors may influence
And created a kind of disruption in the market.
Also spreading certain types of political rumors
He said there was no plan, but did not rule out other options that might apply to Iran.
And the market always reacts to uncertainty.
Of course, there's nothing confirmed that America is at war with Iran.
And I am one of the people who don't see this scenario.
And maybe where we were seeing it, who knows what will happen in the future.
But we, who work in the energy sector
We see that these political tensions
In the world's oil supply
On the contrary, there are very profitable sources of income.
This shows that there is oil being sent for storage.
There is never a shortage of oil supplies.
They might be preparing for the next war.
In light of this confirmed picture regarding supply and the absence of any supply constraints.
In case President Bush and the United States of America decide to change their plan.
This is something else.
Prices will decline to reach record lows.
Oil prices may rise.
From the global oil reserves
You are here, today the Gulf represents the importance.
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and other Gulf states
Today they represent more than 60% of that oil reserve, of what is confirmed.
You today
If a very small accident happens.
This indicates
That means that in the event of any war with Iran, it will mean that there is no guarantee of how far oil prices will rise.
God knows the day you have reached, we have reached without you.
"Protection wars for $107.10, and it might jump to $110, God knows."
Today, petroleum, as I told you, lives under political and psychological tensions.
And the money traders rode these tensions.
I only invested in oil.
Or what is called not invested in real investment of course no future purchase and no future marketing.
And its name is oil paper.
And they're all guesses on a napkin.
Its total production is around three hundred thousand barrels or less.
This could lead these people to buy more and then to more developments.
I wish April was the April Fools' Day.
I hope it isn't
He says Cheney is coming to the region, and this is on his main agenda.
Shini is the owner of this project, as many politicians and media figures have said.
I didn't know what was in Cheney's bag.
And I couldn't predict what it would be like, you know.
Will he ignite the war?
America is in transition.
And why doesn't the son do something else?
Let's see what happens, if it's about April, April is coming soon, in a few weeks, and there in April.
And the world may pay a price
And America is a big consumer.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the tough number.
You can't throw with this number.
Their production cost is very cheap.
Compared to West African countries, most of which rely on
The Gulf, no other country in the world can
We have heard this talk from the West and the United States for many years.
Usage
Until the end, and do you remember the story of the Caspian Sea War?
What are these dreams?
When you sit with Westerners in a closed circle
We hear them speak in a different way.
What are they saying?
On supplies, the importance of the region, and the value of reserves.
When I asked one of the European officials, I said: "It's strange that we are talking to each other in closed rooms."
Not the way you talk about it in front of others.
Or to the media he said: It's for political reasons.
It is natural that there is what is called a double standard or double language.
The language you know is Arabic, and the countries of the Gulf are known as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, which include Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.
It is as important today as Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The largest producer and exporter of petroleum in the world
And her entry.
Despite all this
Commander of the Central Region
Start a war with Iran
Even with an air war or airstrike as they say
In the supplies
You are not late, you are in fact very generous.
I don't agree with what you're saying.
We even deal with Westerners.
We deal with America.
Where are the good prices?
Regardless of the nationality of this market
Put, I mean non-renewable energy.
For the sake of (between parentheses) generosity
Arab hospitality
Go and get them.
Observers say the real price of oil
The reason behind the rise in oil prices
You are the citizens of the Gulf, OPEC, and the states.
You are very generous with Americans. You are insistent on holding onto their currency.
I said the price of oil should be seventy dollars.
I said the actual price for the drop in the U.S. dollar is sixty to seventy.
The price is now one hundred.
One hundred and nine because the dollar fell by thirty percent.
And now over a hundred dollars.
If we take the ratio and the average.
No one denies it.
One of the main reasons
Compared to the decline of the US dollar
If we take
This is a comparison.
Oil prices
Because of the United States of America.
Of course, it's in our interest at the moment for the dollar to decrease.
Weakness or stagnation in the American economy, the United States cannot "do anything."
So what happened to this economic weakness and recession?
You become like them too.
The United States reduces benefits on the dollar.
Why insist on linking oil to the dollar?
We're discussing why the oil price is linked to the dollar.
The first one that is more than 100 years old.
The first country to export the first barrel of oil was the United States of America.
And it was exported in dollars.
And it has continued from the twentieth century until today.
Pricing oil in dollars
Historically, it became
And for a hundred years the world has been reacting and pricing.
And which today makes Norway the third-largest oil producer.
And oil export.
Russia is the second-largest exporter of oil.
North Sea field production in Europe
The price is in dollars, not in...
Everything is changing in the world; there are other sources and other news that indicate something other than this.
You are the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
Do you have secret agreements between you and the Americans?
And oil became the real cover.
This is true and does not exist.
And these agreements
It stands then that oil remains the cover for the dollar against the United States to maintain the coverage of these systems.
This is not true, and there are no secret agreements.
Today, let's take OPEC.
You have 660% boosted reps.
From thirteen countries.
Out of eighty-five barrels, forty percent are for OPEC.
Many countries are large in oil production.
Outside OPEC
What are the obstacles preventing pricing in other currencies?
Search for prices in other currencies.
That's not how it works when adults can make decisions.
You, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf countries are hot spots.
Today's OPEC class is like everyone else's.
Sixty percent in it.
Even if we assume that OPEC wanted that.
There is an agreement among all oil-producing countries.
Towards a direction and intention of change
What kind of attempt?
But now these countries cannot change the pricing currency.
Unless there is an agreement between
What is the impact?
Let me speak now why the European
They do not import their oil.
From the North Sea or Russia or Norway in euros or roubles
Because it is in their interest to keep their currency high and expensive.
No, on the contrary.
Here is where they have a loss.
With one euro, they can buy one and a half barrels.
No, you are the one who loses because your currency has decreased since it's linked to the dollar.
He's also a big loser, a great loss.
The monetary union here in the Gulf has a historical relationship.
Do you remember when the dollar was the strongest currency in the world?
And they're calling now when you talk about separation.
Like marriage when we get married.
And you want a divorce, it's not easy.
No, here.
Or that you've entered into a Catholic marriage with the dollar.
And costs must be examined in a way
It was examined professionally and examined.
And like Kuwait, it pegged twenty-five percent of its currency to the dollar.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar
You might exceed your budget.
Today we're talking about the topic, but this means you have no intention of studying or thinking about it.
The exam, of course, differs as indicated by the Prime Minister.
He said the Qatari currency is undervalued by thirty percent.
In this study
There's no way you're the only ones going in that direction with this topic.
Kuwait is also moving forward, why don't you follow its steps?
Economists say it is more profitable for countries and their people than losing.
But we
And otherwise
that these four Gulf states announce
Everyone believes.
And I mean those who support her personally.
She will support it.
It must be included in the study.
In itself
What was made was made from one or two countries.
Until the time of the appearance of currency
So you're not going to let the situation be like this now.
Of course, there are experts who will do this study.
They are the ones who will be.
It is not experts who need this, but political decision-making.
Let's wait and not rush. Let's see what happens today.
People started..., I mean
Of course, on a collusion website
The inflation rate in Qatar in 2007 has reached 14 percent and will rise to 15 percent next year.
Eating people's salaries, swallowing their wages, the wages of the workers here.
Salaries of Qatar residents are decreasing by thirty-five to forty percent.
We'll be back after the break to find out the extent of the salary increases that will be made.
Many of the staff are in Qatar for at least the coming period, so stay with us.
Welcome back to "Without Borders" for this episode where we host the Deputy Prime Minister, Qatar's Minister of Energy.
And industry, Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah, on the significant increase in prices.
in oil that brought tens of millions of dollars to the Gulf states and producing countries
From petroleum and my question was about the upcoming increase in employees' salaries, but before this increase, I would like to share with you some important information.
The United Arab Emirates has 78.8 billion in reserves and produces 6.2 out of every 10.
Tons only and a report on the Kuwait Times is an economic report, Gulf revenues are one of the largest.
The expected revenue for Saudi Arabia in 2008 is 99 billion.
And it was
In the past 70 years, the United Arab Emirates has turned 67 this year, and it was expected to be 75.
Kuwait was sixty-four and it was fifty-four.
One quarter of oil plus fifty billion.
It's gas, as other reports said, and God is free from envy, meaning we do not envy the happiness of the deputy.
Iraq forty-seven billion.
One and a half trillion
In terms of spending, it reached one and a half trillion dollars.
Gulf countries exported by the thousand billions, meaning trillions.
There was a group of imports worth a dollar.
U.S. investment was three hundred billion.
Nine out of ten billion
In Bahrain, it was three percent.
In 2007 in Oman, it was six and a half but will increase to seven. In Qatar, it was thirteen point seventy-five but will increase to fifteen percent in Qatar.
That means people living in Qatar can expect a rise in the cost of living, from goods to prices.
Life is getting harder, and prices are rising to hundreds and more in Qatar.
We empathize with everyone.
Then the solution must be.
And the solution means that it aims to control inflation.
That means you'll increase their salaries by 50%.
They're saying you're against raising salaries.
This is not correct.
In the Cabinet, against raising salaries.
There is a problem and the solution must be the optimal one.
And what is the solution to fixing it?
There is a balance between the two.
And so,,,this is the end.
The most important thing is to solve the inflation problem.
And here in Qatar, there is a committee.
It was issued by his silence to form.
And he places
And he lays strong foundations.
Solve the problem and control inflation.
The most important thing now is to control inflation.
Inflation
If you don't control it
But you are the deputy, now.
which specialized in market research and was published last February, days before
They are concerned about salaries.
Now you're solving the inflation problem and letting inflation eat up their income.
Many of them now
Entering another country.
Raise our salaries, then solve the inflation problem and lower it again.
I repeat what they say, and he made the balance in the subject.
But now
And it is not a temporary solution.
Add it in a bigger way.
Therefore, here.
To put an end to the chaos.
Boredom will always exist.
Because the increase was massive over the past year, correct.
The second point is
Those who work in the private sector are not the same as those who work in the public sector.
The private sector is very neglected.
Now this issue must also be looked at more objectively.
I don't know where you got these observations.
We're living in Qatar, not in Germany.
I'm telling you, on the contrary, today the private sector has started to pay.
It is more.
Some Qataris who were working in the government office moved to the private sector.
Due to high salaries.
He faced a problem.
Let's move to the private sector because it is more vibrant and dynamic.
And he gives good salaries.
Attached to what is called market power.
Or market power.
Not all of them get very high grades.
They don't come to Qatar because Qatar has high salaries and low living costs.
Or with expenses they come.
Successful with our clear understanding
I don't predict events, and I'm not saying there's a raise in salaries.
No hope either.
To control inflation
Leave it for a while.
Under inflation control
And God willing, this is what was said in the report, that Qatar in the year two thousand and eight
Insha'Allah we say that we
We see that these numbers will change.
Spray some on people.
It is a professional process.
Of course, with professionalism and everything.
From inflation
Due to spending
A lot on different projects.
Let me take some questions from the audience, and I hope everyone will ask a direct question. Abdulaziz Mohammed from Morocco, what's your question, brother Abdulaziz?
Based on the ruling families in the Gulf.
Therefore, I don't think the justification for that is an OPEC dispute.
Secondly, the total oil revenue goes directly to the governor.
Then to the royal family, and the rest will be spent on development.
In the absence of accountability, the situation will remain as is.
Peace, mercy, and forgiveness from God.
Hello, Brother Ahmed
We didn't agree on the conversation, my brother mentioned the ruling regimes and the issue of the Qatari riyal, dinar, and its link to the dollar or other Gulf currencies with the dollar but...
America wants to recruit the world and make it swear allegiance to its military faction.
The U.S. deficit has become, trade between China and America reached eighty billion dollars.
The European Union is with her with eighty-six billion dollars.
This means that all trends in global politics are against the dollar.
And we, as Arab countries and oil-rich Gulf states, are paying the price now.
Hadi ends up facing America.
And among the developed countries of the world, such as China and Russia and others, and the matter may become
Pure military
The bomb exploded in China. Bombs in Russia, bombs in Japan, and American bombs as well.
Many thanks for these clarifications and information.
Your question is to Mohammed.
Hello, your question?
Turn down the TV and ask your question.
Okay, your question is...
But from what I've seen, your happiness continues in not responding.
The topic is about not being tied to the dollar because the dollar is declining.
And with God's will, he will reach the bottom.
And he is a kind man.
What should follow the pattern of Arab brothers.
Thank you, Brother Mohammed. Thank you. Now we ask for the final contribution from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. Your question, Ahmed, is...
Good evening to you as well.
Many thanks and thank you for the wonderful interview.
What is required is a salary increase, with God's permission things will improve.
It's true that we all face problems, not just in salaries.
Matters are determined by God's will.
Okay, tell me your question quickly.
Your line will be cut off. Do you have a question?
All this is because of the high prices, the increase has reached all goods, all of them are exported.
I am from European countries.
In the Arab world, we have factories and workshops.
Thank you, Ahmed. Thank you. You took your time.
Now the issue of rising prices is an important issue.
"The case of supporting the poor, the man told you to stick with the poor, your happiness."
Anyone with less than a billion here is considered poor.
Here for some brothers we are.
Whoever doesn't know Qatar.
That's not true for the State of Qatar.
Today, anyone who comes to Qatar can see the indicators.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar?
Highest growth indicators in the world
Where does this wealth go and what do you do with it?
There is no framework for response.
When the Moroccan spoke, he spoke in a way devoid of truth or reality.
"What the eye doesn't see"
If he came and saw Qatar and the immense developments taking place there.
You're right, you're asking a big question.
And every person has the right.
And you are a small people, so where will you bring people from?
Really means you'll bring the surplus from China, for example.
No, we will not export, God willing.
The state is built on a plan and ...
Complete independence from the amount of money coming from oil and gas, and everyone knows that oil and gas will run out one day.
It will become the State of Qatar.
Considered one of the best achievements in the Arab world.
Today also
Focus on
And what will have a great impact.
Beyond Oil and Gas
For you are not headed to track Dubai.
Every country has its own peculiarities.
In the State of Qatar, we focused on education.
On the components
There is a medical city where people come for treatment.
There will be a media city that will adapt.
Of course, the world today, today we must build.
Built a vision
Beyond Oil and Gas
There were fatal errors.
Unfortunately, we did not welcome this boom as it brought us tragedy.
And we were not prepared for it, neither in terms of human resources nor technically, nor even educationally.
Now, it has changed after thirty years.
And better yet
Today there is a vision.
And vision
And vision
Thank you, Mr. Vice President, and I also thank our listening audience.
Hoping that we have provided you with a valuable service, we look forward to your continued engagement with us.
Qatar's foreign policy appears cryptic to many observers.
Qatar enjoys special ties.
At the same time that Qatar enjoyed relations with Israel and still does

The largest Arab country
What angered the regime in Egypt.
Even to the extent of accusing Qatar of conspiring against Egypt.
Qatar's bow was not far from the important files.
Like Darfur, the Houthis in Yemen, and even Israeli prisoners.
Gilaad Shalit, the hand of Qatari foreign policy reached out to him in a way that angered the largest Arab states.
And what kind of authority have you placed in this position?
These achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
Or write to us through our website www.Aljazeera.net
Hello, happiness!
On September 22, 2007, to Saudi Arabia.
The visit marked a shift in the relationship between the two countries over the past three years.
Redrawing the borders
Wash what was stored.
This is what was mentioned.
In the Hijaz newspaper or magazine.
The ambassador of Saudi Arabia returned and communication was restored between the two countries.
To Doha
First, your introduction was too long and needs a lot of answers without your last question.
Did you think you gave it to her?
Especially on the Saudi topic.
What is precise?
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's mission for the country is very important.
Between the two countries
You spoke about the silence of the island.
You talked about a revolutionary movement.
I think these matters have been clarified from both sides.
And we accepted the clarification.
In the State of Qatar
Conflict with Saudi Arabia
He was always restricted in scope.
From perspectives
Praise be to God, this was thanks to the wisdom of the leaders.
King Abdullah and His Highness the Prince
In the Gulf, significantly.
More than a hundred years have passed.
It was bright, honorable, and built on trust.
I want to clarify the misunderstanding between the two parties.
This subject has been dealt with and there were no conditions.
In solving any issue
But there was understanding and there was sincere intent between the parties.
To resolve this pending issue
And it is not seasonal, but strategic relationships.
We hope that it doesn't continue but evolves.
A pleasant diplomatic conversation.
Saudi Arabia will withdraw its ambassador from Qatar.
I'm not used to speaking diplomatically, or I've been avoiding a lot of problems.
I always say what I believe.
Saudi Arabia is therefore not diplomatic but belief-driven.
The topic of the island falls under media.
Between parties and many countries entered in the middle.
She thought she could gain points at the expense of other countries.
Or at the expense of Qatar.
Or at the expense of Saudi Arabia.
Reconciliation within the Gulf house
Compared to what it was before.
It's part of a political agreement.
No, no, there was no agreement except for the agreement of love and care.
But afterwards you might ask the island management.
Have you built strategic relationships with Saudi Arabia to prevent what happened before?
It was originally based on a close strategy.
We can say it in one, two, three, and four.
And it is assumed that there will be a union.
Some disputes were settled on that basis.
Between some Arab countries and the attempt to reconcile other differences.
Because now, if we observe the differences in the Arab world, they are all differences based on different points of view.
When we have a viewpoint on a certain policy in a certain action in a certain case, and another country has a different opinion.
There are two sides to the theory.
Some observers believe that you enjoy criticizing Saudi Arabia.
Let's criticize him.
I was exhausted and decided to move in a different direction, and from there I moved to a bigger country, Egypt.
Good, it's the same idea.
No, you don't enjoy one thing or the other. We have nothing to do.
To confront any party in this manner
I mean the reasons for the conflict with Saudi Arabia are over.
They and I know that there is a very big misunderstanding.
And consider that we have established.
And there will be some kind of form.
But Saudi Arabia
Let me put this under two lines.
You started fighting with the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram, the eighteenth edition of last April.
The Official Egyptian Gazette
In a comprehensive investigation, he stated that in the extended inquiries,
In the Hezbollah network, a sabotage conspiracy was uncovered.
The goal of Egypt is to engage three participating countries: Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
And a well-known media figure for his conspiratorial role.
Qatar is the smallest Arab country.
Conspiracy against Egypt
We respect.
And his struggle over the years.
I'm not saying this to manipulate anyone emotionally.
Let me finish, I'm not done yet.
We can
Egyptian President
"And the one who is perfect."
On Arab relations.
The first point
Gaza Issue
As they say and as we admit
It is Qatar.
A smaller country.
This could be part of such schemes.
Because we have suffered from interventions by other countries in the past, and I don't want to go back to that.
After the intervention of some countries in domestic affairs.
Therefore, the policy of His Highness's government
Now that they've discovered what they call a conspiracy
What I'm trying to say is that with God's protection, Syria and Iran can defend themselves. I'm not here to defend them.
Stability in Egypt
And why does Qatar like to change or interfere in such matters?
And the pyramids don't invent things out of thin air.
It was said that the small Qatari state sought to undermine Egypt's role and its ties with Turkey and the European Union.
And they sought to organize a conference equivalent to the Arab Summit to steal the spotlight.
And you are using a media outlet, which is Al Jazeera Channel.
Yes, go ahead.
With Hezbollah
And we are not comfortable with that.
But I say that we are certain.
I am we
The principle is non-interference in such circumstances.
They forced our brothers in Egypt, and for that we blame the Egyptian officials.
The dispute with some members of the Egyptian government
But some officials have problems with
With what?
I'm coming for this.
Days of the fragrant scent of peace, the cause of peace, and us.
And previously I lived in Egypt.
And after with us
Because of Israel.
We have a disagreement with him.
You don't have a problem with Israel.
And now, because of the conference, since that day.
Any Islamic conference, any Arab conference, they are sensitive.
This sensitivity
Why aren't you sitting with them?
Let me finish.
And we always hope for the best.
We discovered that this sensitivity
Or three
The Gaza conference is the one that was held.
Egypt doesn't want it to be held in Qatar.
No Arabic
In Qatar and that there is a summit in Kuwait, we told them.
The Palestinian people are under attack.
For over two weeks
But we held it before any scheduled conference, the Kuwait conference which we were the first to attend.
People are being killed and
And what's wrong with postponing?
The dispute began.
No small state can
I know there are some brothers in the government, and this is a crime against Egypt, not against anyone else.
When they said that after
Khair fought bravely on the island.
And the Israelis were informed the day before that there was a meeting to halt hostilities before any word or anyone or anything.
What is it?
My brother let the medicine and food in while they were beating our sisters.
Once they said the gate was narrow.
We can allow trucks to enter.
Once they told us there was an agreement from the other side and they had to come.
Now is not the time to be complacent or enthusiastic.
I don't care about Fatah or Hamas; what concerns us are the one and a half million people who are being attacked.
And those who don't have medicine.
When we started talking about this subject and discussing the Gaza conference
Qatar's involvement in the matter affects the Egyptian regime.
Don't interfere.
We said how Egypt will resolve the issue as it falls within its jurisdiction.
One of the officials told us, "We've uncovered a big plot from this."
What we don't know is the story.
I say this official.
He tells us that Egypt is a big thing.
Okay, we understand that Egypt is a large Arab country, and we always say that Egypt is a big country.
That's why we always demand so much from a big country.
Because of Egypt, we...
And you were invited to a conference where there was also a challenge for them.
We weren't invited to the conference.
Reconstruction of Gaza
We coordinated and had a unified position.
People are suffering in Gaza.
Forbidden, I know Turkey brought things through Israel.
I'll be happy if I see her enter through our brothers in Egypt.
They are part of us.
And if Egypt wins or does good political work
We believe it is in our interest in Qatar and in the interest of the entire Arab world.
Egypt's stability is very important to us.
If he does a good job, he is important to us.
Let me finish your question. Your introduction took a quarter of an hour.
The situation now is that you've lost me.
No, I will tell you, I will tell you now, anger.
Who are the officials in the Egyptian system responsible for you?
We are behind the failure of the Qatar summit.
Secondly, it is they who failed at the Qatar conference.
King Abdullah had a vision he wanted to achieve.
He wanted to finalize the accounts.
That's why he intervened and did not allow some countries to participate.
And I said this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia because we
I don't have any disagreements with Saudi Arabia, even on this point.
Because, as explained, there are internal problems.
Or an official
Among the high-ranking officials
A large country where a government official finds a small country doing such things.
It means there was something for you.
To take any role
Darfur is part of the national security of Egypt and Sudan.
The five major countries decided.
Any country but Qatar will do.
But this sensitivity will only exacerbate the situation. Why do you need to add your voice to everything around you?
We want to resolve this allergy. Take an antihistamine, it should tell us what this allergy is.
Why the sensitivities?
It's some brothers from the government.
They want, they have an internal failure.
They want to draw attention to a plot in Gaza Revolution.
As the English say, accusing the Italians.
Whenever something happens
No to instructions only, but also to analytics.
We know what happened because
The issue must be resolved locally.
And it has not yet been resolved.
Not my priority, my country.
My priority is to first look into the reasons that concern my country.
Then see if I have enough time.
And let us consider the reasons that concern my Arab nation.
Or Qatar attempted reconciliation.
And thinking about any Arab issue where he can contribute as much as possible.
Why didn't they take it as a nice intention?
I can't fix you.
I can explain my point of view.
What are you throwing at me?
From our perspective
What comes from the heart.
Let me finish.
When he announced an initiative for reconciliation and all the presidents gathered in Kuwait, we hoped for something good, and I welcome this.
There is a dictator.
Of course, the Egyptian official who clarified his heroism.
In a report, I think, or a TV interview, or something like that, I won't respond to it.
Because I have an answer for every point.
But to maintain the minimum of relations that bind us and connect Arab interests.
It is also a response to the call referred to by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
But what I can advise him is from me and from someone else.
They are trying to correct their mistakes, both internally and externally.
In politics or economics or otherwise, we have our own mistakes in politics and economics, and thus no one is infallible.
Because they accuse Qatar of all these charges.
Are you denying the existence of a relationship between Qatar and Hezbollah?
This is a funny topic.
To distort Egypt's relations and define its role and ties with Turkey and the European Union.
First, we are few in number.
If we can pull this off
This is not correct.
Level personal accusations against you.
Paying money to the Shalit detainees so that Qatar can kidnap Shalit and surpass the Egyptian role in this matter.
They always accuse us of paying money, but we didn't pay any money and we didn't talk to anyone about giving money.
But this situation
We support Egypt to resolve the same issue that we support Egypt for, and we continue to support it to resolve the issue between the Palestinians.
It is he who allowed the Palestinian president to stay until the issue is resolved.
We were there and pioneers in supporting the State of Qatar.
The Palestinian Authority and institutions can remain until the conflict is resolved.
And we said that we
"We are in the Arab League, but he said no, we succeeded in that because we believe that some people do not want that."
But we managed to achieve it cleverly.
Is he talking to his boss?
His Prime Minister
I really don't know about the problem.
I don't know if it's from us or from them.
They decided now, exclusively in the twelfth issue of April last, with Al-Shuruq newspaper.
The political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a satellite news channel to counter the media giant known as Al Jazeera.
It's only a matter of days, and everything will be fine.
Are you afraid that the island will become a thing of the past?
You mean we're now living in a political adolescence.
I also visited Saudi Arabia, and the Emir of Qatar met with the King of Saudi Arabia.
We did not surrender to them, nor did they surrender to us.
We treated them as brothers.
A small state concessions for a big state Egypt
There is one important point we must clarify about Saudi Arabia.
Qatar's relationship with Saudi Arabia is different.
And then we'll talk.
Okay, how is the relationship between Qatar and Egypt?
And we rely on him a lot.
Let me be honest with you.
Or is it a disagreement on the main policy?
I hope there is no personal dispute, because we have no personal dispute. I told you, we respect the Egyptian people.
If I asked you, you would say there are two problems: Gaza and the other one.
And this situation has affected us all very deeply.
We want to solve this from a psychological perspective, meaning to resolve this issue.
Published in some newspapers.
Minister of Foreign Affairs
In the presence of Prince Saud al-Faisal
Tell us about everything.
But it's clear that things got worse and weren't resolved.
No, no, there was listening.
I can only say that about our relationship with Egypt.
They blame us, but it's their right as our brothers.
And if we hold them accountable, it is their right, just as they are our younger brothers.
With the big country, we don't want to compare ourselves to any other big country.
I say Egypt is great for satisfaction.
It's not a matter of life or death, but the solution comes from heaven.
"It's up to us if someone is waiting for satisfaction."
Or waiting for a way
In Qatar
You will deal with neither nobility nor brothers.
As a large country, yes, we are proud of Egypt as a great nation.
But if there is someone deceiving someone
I know Israel does this to us.
The previous American policy under the previous administration was also either with me or against me.
For I do not think they want to imitate Israel or America in this matter.
Even if we take their policies, they are also pressured by third parties.
In many cases, let me finish.
We understand and know that even a large state has some guidelines.
What controls your policies?
The only thing that moves us is the lack of movement.
Qatar's internal affairs are our internal matter.
And whenever we can help the Arab world, we will.
Sources of power: Al Udeid Air Base and the island.
Can you say that this isn't a salad?
Our faith in God and confidence
Or seeing His Highness the Amir
We don't want to disturb anyone.
Let me finish, we don't want to create problems for anyone.
And we don't want to compete with anyone.
They can say whatever they want, Qatar is great or not.
But we have a point of view.
First, we closed the Israeli office. We shut it down.
The first thing they said was to close the office, so we closed it, and they got angry and went to complain to the Americans. Do you believe in these people?
They joined the team called the Devil's Team.
What they say.
Americans, Europeans, and my friends, we know how to deal with them.
Plots
What was made.
This is a flaw. We've reached a certain point and now what?
Tell me now.
In bullet points, how will you solve the problem with Egypt?
And on the basis that Egypt has a major role in the Arab world.
We believe it's important to look at him.
And I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak is reserved towards her.
But some of the crew
I need to go.
Occupying Egyptian public, governmental, or other opinion or leading them astray is foolishness.
And focus on Arab and Egyptian interests.
Are there steps?
We are behind them, not ahead of them, because they are a great nation.
In the near future
Frankly, I can't imagine how that would happen.
And I know there's time to think
And there will be a time either from us
If it were up to me.
Or them
Significant Arab interests drew them together.
One day we will find this truth.
You mean life still goes on.
It means we won't respond in the same Egyptian way you're speaking.
If we help someone, we will help him with all our might.
Now, Sheikh Saeed.
We used to run, no matter what.
Only on a good basis are we ready to run to Egypt.
Stand with Egypt
In Qatar, there are many rumors about Egyptian workers and how they are affected by this issue.
And there are contracts for Egyptians working either in universities or high-ranking positions.
You know we're not in the habit of cancelling jobs and cancelling in this business.
Because these people have nothing to do with this.
This is a market where there are changes in orders; they cancel one and bring in another.
This is supply and demand, and there are other nationalities that have increased while some have decreased.
Please provide a quick answer.
The office was there.
Since we've shown the office, we'd better move the desk out right away.
We could have overcome him during the days when they were in power, all our losses in negotiations with Israel were because of this office.
So we sealed it, and called them to repair it with Netanyahu.
He was a guest.
And he was among them, as it is our custom to invite all the ambassadors accredited to any foreign country.
This was not an official invitation to honor Gabriela Shalev.
No, we didn't oversee it before when the relations, as they say, were excellent. Now it's a bit difficult.
There's no reason for you to open the office at this time.
The office will reopen when there are no further reasons.
Grew up
Who made it as big as Egypt?
Egypt imposed this.
Let me be clear with you, our relations with America are strategic.
In some things, and that is it.
What's more important?
In the area, we have things in solving some cases where we had a dispute with the previous administration.
Now we have high hopes for the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe there is a great hope that this administration
Worthy of moving the path of peace and worthy of resolving the Palestinian issue.
They are our friends, and we don't deny it.
What is happening in Iran? What could its impact be on the Gulf and on you?
Iranians must decide how to solve their issues.
Among themselves
In their usual ways, and I'm sure they will overcome this crisis.
Iran's stability as mentioned by the Emir of Qatar.
It is important for our region, the Gulf region, and we share the same borders with Iran.
Of course, we have special relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because our country seeks peace and stability in this region.
And we intervened whenever any of the parties wanted to change the Doha Agreement.
And I think Said Hariri said
Now it's over, and what remains is the strategic discussion between the president
And Lebanese groups
How to look at it
Why doesn't Yemen play a role, or are they just taking a stand?
It is known that we supported unity when most of the Arab world was against Yemeni unity.
We are the only Arab country and the only Gulf state that stood with the unity of Yemen.
And from the south, we have spoken with Yemen, and His Highness the Amir sent me twice to meet the Yemeni president.
I clarified to him that our goal is the stability of Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
And I did not respect that agreement, and I don't want to say anything about what each party did.
But what really touched me
This is Qatar, which took this position and was then accused of paying money to the Houthis and to distinguished Yemeni elders.
Because we don't interfere in such matters.
He who stands for unity does not stand against it.
And another goal in the interest of Yemen, whether politically, economically, or otherwise.
No problem for us, but I'm honestly shocked.
Because I went more than ten times during the fighting, His Highness sent me to Yemen among the Yemenis.
Unfortunately, this is a strange accusation.
Time is up, but briefly tell me these problems that occurred to you due to your pursuit of solving problems, will it change your policies of intervening in other Arab problems?
If His Highness listened to me, I think there's nothing necessary.
There was a big show once.
Over five billion dollars at that time, if we had invested it, it would have been fifty billion dollars. Better than a headache.
But I say it with faith, because the time may be ripe in the Arab world now.
Forbidden under these circumstances
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Perhaps even exceptional with Sheikh Hamad's case.
What happened to the agreement in Doha?
How did the Doha Miracle happen?
To install the committee and provide it with all support
Let's discuss Lebanon after the Israeli invasion.
When there was an Arab consensus
By the time we went to New York, we were able to make a more balanced decision.
And we sought in this in Doha that both parties be eager.
We tried our best not to hear it or it wouldn't be.
Because we knew the committee, we knew.
The reality is on the ground, and we know what the problem is after spending long hours with the Lebanese.
And I think it's a shared success.
But there is insistence.
I think that Lebanon's problem is that the region's atmosphere directly affects the ground.
Whether peaceful or non-peaceful
Lebanon was supposed to be for this site.
Under these conditions
And unfortunately
External effect
I can say that the problem among Lebanese, even if there is a problem, it's not going to be the number one problem.
Okay Sheikh, I know the time might not be now, perhaps it's too early to talk about the sightings, but
What happened when I came here?
And I've somewhat stopped talking about participation on the ground now.
You didn't leave, not even for a single second.
I know exactly what was happening, even the Lebanese leaders were telling me what happened.
Not from the beginning
When I spoke with His Highness
I told him, "What if we go to Lebanon?"
I will put forward the idea, His Highness agreed, and we will support it.
When all Lebanese leaders are present.
Because here in Beirut, you'll have to go to each person's area.
They are in the same hotel and the same place.
They met on the same plane and talked.
So we created this climate, but from the beginning our thought was
And this was the most important decision both of them had ever made.
Of course
And I felt that from the Arab League.
Then we must be faithful mediators.
Praise be to God, I believe this has been proven to everyone that Qatar has made an effort.
On both sides
To achieve a fair solution for both parties.
And that there is a solution and no one loses.
Before you move
The consultation took place at the Arab League and we found support.
What we did
And I said to him while we were there.
If we succeed in Lebanon, we'll take them to Doha.
And he advised me.
He locked them in and took their phones.
They were able to bring them there, and brothers in Syria also supported the position.
And I told you from the beginning that without Arab support, the committee cannot do anything.
Why did they want a solution?
I think the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that occurred
And this time
There is tension in Somalia. There is tension in Sudan.
Many things happen in the world.
And every time we put out a fire
This will be in the best interest of the Arab world more than foreign intervention.
And we try to be the best we can.
Deploy troops.
Even if he's a soldier.
For example, I think this is a topic.
At one point, it must be discussed.
He always said that the solution to the Lebanese file was...
Saudi-Syrian Agreement
The Arabs, meaning Qatar and the Arab countries, have stopped.
Could what happened in Lebanon lead to serious reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Syria?
Need for self-assessment in the Arab world
Due to Arabic variations.
And any agreement between two Arab countries.
And we tried this.
In the Seventy-Three War
When Arabs agree on a solution to an issue.
I thought it was useful.
Saudi Arabia and Syria for an important role in Lebanon.
Both parties must
Practice wisdom.
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because we here in the Arab world face many great challenges.
Everyone is playing in our house's yard.
And we have neither strength nor muscle.
And how do we lock the game in the Arab countries arena?
As Arabs, at least the minimum of agreement.
Unfortunately, we complain.
Where are we seeing?
Our disputes as Arabs and the lack of trust among us; trust is missing between Arab countries.
And the Arab Gulf states
It's not betrayal, but a kind of...
Our envy is the word.
This is an issue that needs support from everyone, I mean, I think.
Okay, will you help fulfill this wish and really ask about an Arab summit?
We die when he dies and rejoice when he rejoices.
He came in the middle of the conversation.
Could you play a role in rectifying the situation between Damascus and Riyadh, even if...
Eager to find solutions, and I'm sure of their wisdom.
They might reach an understanding.
Among them in many cases
There was harmony in politics, and I am sure of it. God willing, this will continue.
Relations have improved.
Both parties need to take a step.
But I can't be sure that's what's happening now.
I am sure that if the Arabs focused on resolving disputes between Arab countries and the problems of some Arab countries that I mentioned earlier.
Optimism and a source of pride for the citizen that there is a general Arab awakening.
But I can't say what happened in Lebanon.
It can be interpreted on the ground that there is an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
It may involve an American-Iranian escalation, perhaps other cases.
Will you still be afraid of him in the coming months?
We, as Arabs
We only have the capacity to deliver food and medicine.
Electricity is essential for people.
We in Qatar are ready and His Highness is always prepared.
Over a million and a half Palestinians are under siege.
And we don't want them to be able to take either weapons or support.
They do all this.
And no electricity.
And we give it to the Red Cross to deliver it to the Palestinians.
With the Palestinians, we only provide them with food and medicine.
And our disagreement with them can continue.
And I hope that Palestinians on both sides will put the national interest first.
And leave behind the illusion.
The Palestinian schism is now a deep wound.
Perhaps we'll find a solution.
But they didn't commit
This is serious, they must adhere to the Mecca Agreement.
And they must ask even to go back to Mecca and Saudi Arabia.
And resolve this dispute.
They won't help.
And any promises from any party
I wish there were a solution, but
Our position is known and stated to all concerned parties that we
It will not be part of it and we will not accept being part of any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with him.
But we are a sovereign state and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone is always looking out for their own interests, but these interests won't harm them or us.
We believe that the fate of the Gulf should be in clear agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council.
Cooperation with Iran and peaceful neighborhood
But when Your Excellency says that Qatar is not a party.
Any details or clarifications
Just science.
No, never.
Okay, I want to go back to the Lebanese file if that's okay.
Frankly, your excellency, we are facing a major obstacle, but we have reached a solution in the last few hours.
Where is the one who linked what happened to what was announced?
It's possible that there could be disparate pieces of information that aren't related to each other, but that didn't happen.
That led to this result for you.
What happened in Istanbul, I would know if there were specific dates before.
So I knew there were negotiations.
Continuing the search for a solution
And without a doubt, the Kingdom's support is very important.
Change negotiation tactics.
These negotiations led
To a positive outcome; we gathered some parties from certain quarters.
And we started talking.
In this research, there is an Arab and Qatari approach.
Tell me what's wrong with this paper.
And we started talking about the subject one by one.
At the last moment, he overcame an obstacle that persisted until the end.
But the lizard died with its limbs.
And dispense with this obstacle.
And there was a solution.
We heard a word from the Emir of Qatar at the opening session in Doha.
What do you consider your role to be now?
The main thing is that we stay out of the spotlight.
We have no territorial ambitions.
Or even that we have control over another state or something because our state
Our size... We take pride in ourselves, believing that we can contribute to solving issues alongside our other comrades.
But in the Arab world, it is very important.
We have countries that are
We want them to do something, and it's important.
Some small countries are allowed to take on this role and are supported.
Excellent in some things, good in others, and less than good in others.
One last question, sir.
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority?
"Security or resolution of enmity"
Confrontation with Israel
We stop the game at the Arab court.
What are we fixing in the Arab countries? Our problems.
Choosing an active member in Iraq
To calm things down
Nationally and regionally
But if we become stubborn
Or he will have any hope.
Thank you, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, for this meeting.
And international efforts to end the war on Gaza.
We start by requesting your meeting with the Arab League Council at the ministerial level.
As if you've changed your mind about
The call for an emergency Arab summit
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. First of all, I am happy, my brother Hassan, to be part of this program.
Despite the humanitarian circumstances
Our people in Gaza have faced
Circumstances oblige us to do a lot.
Qatar did not ignore the Arab summit.
In fact, when we went with the idea of the Arab summit before
Not only by the Security Council resolution but also through
What is compressed is not lightened.
Let me say it in another sentence.
We are subject to discipline.
It's the street that can't bear it anymore, if we bear it as responsible for the Arab street.
He doesn't accept it.
When we were in Egypt
There were ten to eleven written approvals.
Some spoke at the meeting, and it was possible to hold a meeting.
We consider it as long as there is Arab consensus.
And I do not blame them if they are in a meeting, they may have a point of view.
And how can the problem be solved?
Because it will be solved.
This is the important subject.
Because our goal is not propaganda and advertising, our goal is to find.
You won't leave the summit.
We even ask ourselves
Here's the spirit to pressure the other side that's poor.
The previous and subsequent Security Council resolution, but let's just continue on the topic of the Arab summit, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Speak clearly that the situation may call for an Arab summit with whoever attends.
We found a majority of our brothers supporting the holding of the summit.
With whom is he coming?
And I don't know what they mean by moderation.
We are the only nation.
Only the Arab nation, if we went to any nation in Asia, in Latin America.
Unsolved
Classified as moderate countries
And what is moderation in our eyes?
Is she going to give up on the Palestinian cause?
Just because we don't like them.
Are we interfering in the affairs of the Palestinians in some way?
No state allows interference for better or for worse.
Like Hezbollah, and who knows, maybe another movement will emerge tomorrow.
Is he asking?
And can we accept them as part of the Arab body?
It was as if it was destined for us to get into an internal Arab problem.
Okay, what if we go to the Security Council?
There was no decision in the Security Council.
I hope that after Israel completes its mission
Okay, the second Arab ministerial meeting you were invited to attend.
Which was dominated by discussions, disagreements, and intense disputes.
At an important point
This is not important.
When we call for a meeting
Change stations
No peace like it.
Are the ministers ready for that?
Because there is a party that tells you we should wait.
But we are in an Arab initiative.
Frozen peace talks with Israel.
We say that we are in a party that says we are going to lose in this.
In a greater loss than we have now, but we were always respectful, cooperative, and committed to decisions since the days of the truce.
You say that clashes are not important.
There was someone who wished that Hamas would be destroyed, and something like that.
This expresses a political stance more than it does an argument between a minister and another minister.
Unfortunately, this happened.
But not everyone
I don't want to talk about others.
It is important for us to be men of independent characters and men for our state.
We shape the policies of our countries.
Who's doing these things on his behalf?
I think
I don't think they'll respect us in the end.
Yes, is there anyone doing things on behalf of the West?
No, and I hope no one accuses him, I don't want anyone to accuse him in this matter.
After the Security Council resolution
What is her agenda?
The situation began with a decision to exert Arab efforts.
And the dispute here is if Israel implements the decision immediately.
We can say in a decision.
But Israel did not implement the resolution.
Are we ready now to go and ask for Chapter Seven? I know for certain there are difficulties.
What is questioned by the international community, even if it is done.
He will be shy.
The state
See if they did something for the Jew and the Israeli.
To claim their rights
The current Arab situation
If the Arabs do not go to the Security Council
They agree to hold a summit and make tough decisions.
And the Western countries will try to influence us.
Because we are in the Arab world and there are many people, and you can see how the Arab street reacts to this.
But this decision is important.
With the case of our bosses being summoned one after another.
In the end, they said it's nothing, which is a lie.
Okay, if we were like Germany or not, we would demand.
They don't have to pay any compensation because they initiated the attack, just say you have incorrect information.
And the killing of hundreds of thousands
That is because you are a weak Arab party.
We are Arab, some of us.
He worked hard on how to do it.
To display it.
It's as if it were God's will and destiny.
If the Arab nation says that if you are going to send troops to Darfur, we will send troops to Darfur.
Arabs consider, or some consider, the decision of 1960 to be...
And our colleagues worked hard to implement the decision.
Issued by the Security Council
What I want to say is that it was a victory or it wasn't.
And what will lead to
Let's assume that victory
What will we do?
We are supposed to comply with the rest of the decision.
But I assure you that we will comply with the decision.
Unfortunately, you'll be with the decision even if you're not right.
Even after the Israeli rejection, Israel came and agreed.
Means we
Will you have an alternate, or is it you who is calling the meeting of ministers?
I don't think the Arab nation
Meanwhile, ready for any alternatives.
And I don't think the Arab nation is ready.
In implementing the Gaza blockade
Suits a different political agenda.
To make one group dominate another in Palestine instead of reconciling them.
We start trying to make plans.
Once you held a meeting, I don't know if it was an Arab-European intelligence meeting or something similar, without mentioning names.
And when they do, that means we participate.
In implementation
What is required of us from the West?
But if we go
I want there to be order in this.
Of course, I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about...
The follow-ups for this case from Gaza started two years ago, not now.
I'll ask you about the topic in two years, but specifically regarding the decision.
Do you have reservations about his conditions?
Issued but not implemented
We were not invited.
They might think we have a different perspective.
Everyone was required to be on the same wavelength.
It's not necessary for everyone to share the same opinion, but I believe those who left put in a lot of effort.
And we praise them for that.
Regarding what happened in Gaza two years ago and the decrease in political parties.
The dominant party of a faction over another that participated in the siege of Gaza
You really agree with the statements, insinuations, or accusations that have been made here and there.
Conspire an Arab plot amidst all that's happening in Gaza now.
We are partially informed.
Let me tell you that we're not too affected by the issue.
But I know.
It's the Palestinian conflict.
It was enhanced at the Arab and international levels.
Even if it wasn't being used, they wouldn't have disagreed much.
And after the elections...
And Hamas came and took power.
By a majority
We should have given them a chance and seen.
They see reform, or they are still revolutionaries who only know the gun and killing.
But the day they came
On the Arab level, some of our brothers thought that these extremist movements should not come to power.
Some say that an assault has just occurred.
Made by Hamas who violated the truce or those Palestinians from Gaza who violated the truce
Truce
The Palestinian people in Gaza remain hungry for two years.
No problem.
For Israeli security reasons
It's clear we don't want them in power, but that doesn't matter to me in Qatar.
But what is the fault of the rest of the people?
And after that, who should decide?
That or that, not every country has sovereignty in choosing.
Our government
It is the main problem.
But I'm sure it could have been solved.
If we strive, we strive to sow discord.
But it's clear that we were asked to let one group win over the other because this group...
We consider them terrorists or we consider them.
Everything that happened led to
Even the promise he made to them at the party that he would give them a proper life.
They didn't do anything for them.
Let's go back to the international and Arab efforts that were made to stop what was happening, according to what you said you were doing.
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has rejected so far.
And there the Egyptian initiative is the one.
And Egypt in Cairo
That Egyptian effort
Not at all, it has nothing to do with exceeding.
That's required for an important role.
Egypt's borders are also next to Israel and Palestine.
I am
And we don't want to stop the chaos now.
In Gaza, and we are bringing people to stop the chaos in Gaza because
This is not the way to peace.
Must be
And then we always ask them for a big role.
What was announced?
Does that mean you can't assess the initiative now?
Either to give a chance for success or to study.
I think her chances of success are good.
If the brothers in Egypt can
Make Palestinian viewpoints more similar.
And it is the party harmed in Gaza that should discuss the initiative.
Because he is the one who can say yes or no.
And this is an important point.
When the resolution was issued in 1960
This is an Arab Palestinian problem that we have.
I don't want to hear any party.
But I wanted that, when the Palestinian delegation went.
And when they went to the league, they asked for someone from Gaza to be with them.
Let's show the Israelis that these are our brothers and we are with them.
This is an important point.
We prevented the authorities.
Let our goal be, and let us build our policy upon it.
To remain in power
The sheikh now.
I don't know if we can discuss the Egyptian initiative because you haven't read its articles yet.
Do you think, in principle, this could be appropriate as a mechanism to implement UN Resolution 1860 as some people have suggested?
Balanced role
Now is not tomorrow or the day after tomorrow because
Every day passes.
That's how our brothers' blood is shed there.
Therefore, we do not want to delay or have the Israelis delay on this matter; when they finish their mission, we will put forward this initiative.
And I am sure that the brothers in Egypt know this and abstain from it.
I want to clarify everything I said.
Now we need to solve the problem.
And it's not the way Israel wants it to be.
The Turkish role has been pivotal since the beginning of the crisis.
Is it expressed?
Arab vacuum
Undoubtedly, it is a distinguished position.
And it has an Arabic depth.
An entrance for disabled people.
We know that there is an Arab deficit.
Part of it was due to disagreements.
Partly because of everyone's point of view, each person thinks that his or her point of view is the best.
And another person thinks their viewpoint is better.
And how can we, in our conscience, make people respect and recognize that there is an Arab solution?
Or they attacked us one by one.
Others will say no, no problem, we give them two or three extra days to call them and bring the young people to be equal and solve the problem.
We rise above this and accept that we accept this.
Hamas may be wrong, but we will engage with them.
At the Arab level
But so far
At least we tell them no.
Within the required frame for the location of Qatar, sites such as, we will return to this point later but
At the same time, in the square, I also heard
Yesterday, Khaled Mashal, the head of the Political Bureau of the Hamas movement.
Firstly, it is not necessary everything said by brother Khaled Mish'al, with all due respect and appreciation to him.
Why aren't they talking to Khaled Meshaal and sitting like Arabs?
Let's go to him at the Arab League and tell him.
This is an important talk.
I am from Hamas.
Imposing conditions Israel also imposes conditions
Let them impose their conditions. Are they not allowed to impose conditions while Israel can?
First, what do you think of this Arabic gift?
Cattle and we should not listen to this collectivism once they tell me De Gaulle did not listen.
Completely different, first and foremost, de Gaulle liberated his country.
With or without allies, he liberated his country from brutal occupation.
Now what are we talking about?
This is an Arabic gift that we are supposed to give.
Leaders must represent the views of their people.
The Arab people in all those demonstrations we have witnessed.
These classes can meet your needs.
Many of those criticizing Qatar in this situation are also demanding
The actor is busy with what's happening and the office is still open.
They all speak the same language.
To cut ties, we will go with all Arab countries.
Severing the relationship, all ties, even if someone says they have a treaty.
They want Qatar to sacrifice alone.
I am
And this is more important than the relationship.
Not just in this decision, but in even more difficult ones.
From this decision
We must have a unified Arab stance.
For others
No one sells to another for moral or material gain, or it is called.
Yes, before we close the file on this matter, there are also countries that have taken individual steps.
Chávez the good is a different subject. He has disagreements with the United States.
Our people don't need us to remind them.
Five ambassadors with permanent membership and the oldest arguments are these films.
We're done with him and the street now knows better.
With the high ceiling, the happiness of the sheikh.
Or demanding that Lebanese forces confront the Israeli aggression and others
Do you think if we put it within one Arab framework, it might succeed?
But we demand an Arabic website that makes them respect us.
I don't think the Arab countries are ready to fight.
"Nor that we encourage"
How are you going to include Syria, Lebanon, and other countries when there are Arab countries that don't even talk to each other?
There must be.
A shift in Arab relations.
This is the current policy now among Arab states.
It's still here, but I think it's already over.
In goals
The important issue
And we know how the Lebanese structure is.
There is no doubt that Lebanon
This is an example of what would happen if she regained her lands.
The situation in Gaza will change, they are still there.
Surrounded on all sides
This siege
Give a different nature.
Yes, I mean here the objectives for Israel, meaning the goals of the operation for Israel.
A day when someone is rewarded, a day when someone is punished, and a day when someone is pleased.
An example of what happened to them in Lebanon is not a good example.
The sample solution that became available in Lebanon.
I consider him good.
To Gaza
Listen to the problem in Gaza or Palestine; their solution is easier than the one in Lebanon.
Those who disagree with each other, should we reclaim our land today or tomorrow?
Their disputes about power
On the distribution of power
That differs because they are closer to each other intellectually.
More than a Lebanese intellectual.
Therefore, the solution is much easier.
And here's the problem.
His Excellency Sheikh
That means we'll only have a few minutes if we present the solution to the issue where it might be.
And diplomat
How can this process end?
I am a Palestinian from Gaza.
Stay happy.
Rejected or
And help
He didn't go with us.
There will be an Arab failure.
From a strategic standpoint
But from the Palestinian side
There were some efforts, but we didn't see a full initiative.
Not before, not now, why?
The problem is not so much the initiative, but rather how we implement it.
We will help whoever is facing the problem without mentioning Qatar, as some people have issues with naming Qatar.
Neither for the summit meeting, as there is a summit in March to be held.
If we take the initiative, we will be better than our brothers. I don't think so.
And what weighs heavily on them
Because history won't be merciful to us if we pressure them.
Through this initiative, we met with all parties where there was a meeting on the fourth day, which was cancelled due to the Security Council.
We hope, God willing, to make progress, and we expect our Arab brothers to provide assistance in this matter as much as possible.
And we hope to push her out of the competition.
Arab competition
In heating up due to their dispute with the Sudanese government at one point.
And these are our problems, okay? We fight among ourselves and we are divided.
I don't want to go this way.
In Kuwait on the nineteenth of next month, I believe, of course, from the Arab perspective.
As you know, as His Excellency indicated and clarified.
Is the Arab climate all about assistance? Is it the first economic summit?
His Highness
Certainly, any summit held in a sister country, we attend.
And she has no objection to attending any summit.
But not afraid to become a political summit
Of course, taking into account that time imposes itself.
It's too late even if it's in ten days.
Are you talking about the Palestinians after they endure twenty-five days of bombardment?
Will be
They won't say that the Arabs couldn't meet.
We said that we
We said that we
With all due respect, this summit has been scheduled and we are committed to it.
I mean, I think that we
The Arab street is against us.
In our way of doing things
And then
And a comfortable journey.
And say, "It is she who is guaranteed."
For this meeting
Thank you to the audience for watching.
Coverage of the ongoing war on Gaza continues with peace.
A few days ago, there was a celebration for the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani
In Doha and contributed to the preparation of a special law project
She was also a member of numerous local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
He has also delivered over seventy-five lectures, workshops, presentations, and articles published in Arab and international journals.
First, let's agree on the term currently used.
For referring to people with disabilities, it is more appropriate to say "people with disabilities" or "people with special needs" rather than using terms that may be considered outdated or stigmatizing. The phrase "people with disabilities" is widely accepted and preferred in many contexts.
Good evening
Drawn from a rights culture or human rights culture because people with disabilities
Due to his dealings with disabled people, considering them people first.
Humans
This resulted in his disability in trying to adapt to society.
The medical concept was prevalent at the time.
Moved towards concepts.
Special education teaching methods emerged.
This category became
That's why we started calling them people with special needs.
What are the adopted rules from which it was derived?
The role of the Special Rapporteur in monitoring the implementation of this document.
And quicken the steps towards the emergence of an international agreement that is legally binding and distinguished by rules in this regard.
And I set a fundamental condition or basic rule for this term.
You treat these people as humans, as individuals.
With the change in terminology as mentioned, is there a shift in the perception of this group within society?
Yes, and it is measured in a certain way.
That varies from region to region.
But the special thing about this
It is the Arab world that is distinctive or different.
Okay, but legal trends include human rights and exist, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons are probably lack of financial resources, right?
Of course, that's what I wanted to say: culture exists, but sometimes there is a lack of resources and a lack of political will.
Sometimes regulations, but
But unfortunately, awareness is a bit low, and there is also no culture of human rights.
Ten percent of the world's population are disabled persons.
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities in developed countries are of working age.
And suffers from unemployment
I mean during my visit to Darfur.
Or with mines and weapons
Men are one degree better.
Add disabilities will be in remote areas and distant regions.
Therefore, there are many directions of organizations working in this field and trying to raise.
Awareness and the Right to Achieve Education
Instead of creating a lot of somewhat religious centers
They went to establish rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
And this is one of the things we thank God for through our work in the office.
I tried with the current organization in Qatar.
Developing an agenda
Or include the agendas of these humanitarian organizations to encompass those centers.
In light of the declining situation of persons with disabilities in the world
What I can call it and agree with you that there is a decline.
If there was a decline in the Arab region due to the state of disability.
Placed in the social context and in the political and economic context, we cannot expect the circumstances of people with disabilities to be
They are from marginal groups.
In a country like I told you, like Gaza and Darfur.
On the contrary, I cannot assert that there is no improvement in the situation.
And it has already been implemented in reality, and if I can give an example, I would say
Qatar Red Crescent
We agreed that projects include
Disabled people with health issues between this strategy and other programs
We tried to include her as well.
Ground-based organizational operations
Kamal Kiro is with us now from Syria. Welcome.
Good evening, I am Suleiman Kiro.
Solomon Kiro, sorry for the interruption, Solomon.
My warm regards to you and Madam Hafsa.
First, is there a mental barrier within the laws of the United Nations?
The intellectual obstacle means that a healthy person became a result of what turned into a pressure factor leading to an intellectual obstacle.
My son became disabled as a result of torture and detention. He suffered psychological impairment and is still undergoing treatment. Only six years have passed since then.
I know there are around four hundred people between children and disabled in the prison.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
Actually, I
Because they know as they know their children.
And the whole meaning is without what they make for themselves.
There are values in the West.
People agreed to it.
Some of them are apostates or do not follow the wisdom of Islam, so they should not be taken from.
Many thanks, Naif Saeed from Kuwait.
Let's go back to our guest to comment on it.
On the calls, Suleiman wondered if there was any mental disability.
Yes, it is among the global rankings.
Of course, disability includes mental and intellectual impairments, as they are called.
Among these disabilities, there are sensory disabilities, meaning visual, auditory, or motor impairments.
Of course, as mentioned, disability is...
The relationship between action and reaction that occurs in a social context.
In the Arab world or any other provinces
Certainly, addressing disability has taken a long time.
Even at the United Nations level
For example, during my experience and work as a special rapporteur, one of the things I tried to address and work on was ...
In other words, everyone has the right.
Until they present them.
And various qualifying aspects to ensure their ability to enter schools as well as the organization of work.
Worked on vocational rehabilitation, which includes people with disabilities.
There were some improvements.
Especially after the reform
Generally, there are in this international committee
I mean, as the special rapporteur.
The fact that my work was positive for me even if it wasn't directly related.
Who supported this position?
I've seen her in many meetings, for example the international conference.
Sponsored persons have their rights.
Impaired by these restrictions or these deficiencies.
For example, with regard to legal capacity.
This is one of the main points in the world of disability.
The United Nations, unfortunately, delayed it a bit during its preparation and drafting.
Regarding organizations and agencies
For example, and I'll conclude with this.
From the governments of the world and non-governmental organizations to the member states of the United States
We took another survey.
In United Nations organizations and agencies in various regions
To know the extent to which there are programs for people with disabilities on their agendas.
If budgets are drawn up with the participation of people with disabilities.
Human rights
And they are not just development issues.
We're taking more calls. With us now is Naji Machri from Algeria. Hello, Naji.
You too
I'm afraid to ask my sister who's exactly in charge.
I wanted to ask, I'm actually physically disabled.
Wow, this question is from Nagi in Algeria. Thank you very much, Ahmed.
Welcome to Al-Halabi from Greece.
Good evening, madam. Good evening to your guest.
Healthcare Housing Seasonal clothing Even to receive them in seasonal tourism And this is what happens in Europe
And the mentally ill will be disabled.
Especially those who can harm themselves or others.
Everything we're discussing falls within the realm of unproductive conversation. Thank you.
Hessa's sister mentioned the financial shortage.
In poor countries, especially in Africa and Latin America, I demand.
Establishing an international fund to support disability and allocating one percent of the net profits of every organization in the world.
And this must be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
It will work to address the shortage faced by many disabled people, war victims, and others.
Many thanks, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Mashri was wondering and said his problem is that he is disabled.
At the local or national level, meaning through Algeria.
Needs within the community must be met within that community.
Are these the same rights that should come to anyone else?
In other words, the right to live comes first, then the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education.
Therefore, I seriously call upon the governments, and the governments of Arab countries in particular, from this platform.
In the interest of the citizen and the individual
To ensure
Those needs and rights are within the existing agenda.
No, there is no need to create any new devices.
To meet the needs of a disabled person or not, that is the question for the state.
They can and must be committed to performing.
I advise him first to return and refer back to the relevant authorities at the government level, if possible.
Because it's within my national scope and it should be within this scope.
They mentioned the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but many countries have signed it without complying.
And here we have a caller's question: Why are there no laws?
It is a fact that we are in a human society where there are many mistakes and much that is correct.
Certainly, many agreements and definitely many treaties contain no literal commitment.
Or ideal commitment from many countries that have acceded to many such as CEDAW and others.
But there are violations and breaches, and we know it.
But the question of adopting and organizing a convention
First, we will strive to ensure at least awareness.
This awareness starts at the top of this pyramid with decision-makers.
Officials then gradually develop until it reaches the society as a whole.
As a matter of our commitment to reporting and submitting these reports to the United Nations.
The issue of knowledge, understanding, and a high degree of consciousness.
The reports I worked on as a correspondent at the United Nations were...
Yes, from what I saw and observed, there is interest.
It has a comparative advantage over the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
For I give advice, encourage, and call out.
It is also important for people with disabilities to be...
And we will hear what Ali Obeid Al-Sanari, President of the Qatar Association for the Deaf, will say.
Mr. Nagi Saghrina will be speaking about it. Welcome, Mr. Nagi and Mr. Ali as well.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
With me is Mr. Ali Obeid Al-Sanara, Chairman of the Board of Directors at the Qatar Cultural and Social Center for the Deaf.
led by Her Excellency Sheikhha Hessa
Former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
As deaf people from Qatar
And the President, like Sheikhessa Hessa, has a long history.
The international agreement you are referring to now is indeed
Great benefit for all people with disabilities around the world.
And especially the Arab world.
And I wish as a deaf person
He is implementing this international agreement in these countries.
That will serve people with special needs very importantly.
Indeed, to have someone who can activate this agreement in all countries.
Obaid Al-Sanari, President of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute
Let's stop.
Here we continue the discussion after a short break. Stay with us.
Share and express your opinions on important issues in economics, politics, sports, and a variety of other topics.
SMS service through Al Jazeera Live
Welcome, viewers, we welcome you once again and also our guest for this episode, Sheikhah Hessa Khalifa Al Thani.
Disability International Support Fund
Disability and the obligation of all countries to provide funding. What is your opinion on this proposal?
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Fund.
Unfortunately, those contributions are very weak.
Regulatory Compliance Monitoring Mission
For six years, there was no moral support.
Just from China and Austria
And I would like to thank this country for its support.
The main supporter of the country is my Qatar.
Who established the office, through which we were able to implement many activities and projects, praise be to God.
Yes, this lack of support indicates what.
I mean like what we raised at the beginning and this point is always raised.
Terms of Ordinary People
The care of people with disabilities or disabled individuals is called "Disability Care" or "Special Needs Care."
This means that there is a realistic, genuine, and serious commitment.
In all circumstances, in all categories
People with disabilities, refugees, children, and homeless women
All this we will actually perhaps reach to some degree what is called
Equal opportunities, participation, and equality
And in these voices that are always demanding and never disappoint or get tired.
In the Islamic and Arab regions, why not reserve a part? Sorry.
For the benefit of these programs and projects.
As presented by him, and I extend my sincere thanks from this pulpit.
Islamic Development Bank
Within the allocated budget
Non-compliance with what you told me regarding the payment of financial dues.
Funds to assist people with disabilities - do they only include developing countries and Arab states or what?
Even developed countries do not provide.
I mean, the person before me, the Swede, yes.
As some European Union countries
And certainly in many countries, especially in the Arab region, perhaps did not
So that he knows about the existence of this special course.
In my case, I mean what happened.
In Sweden and China
In the Arab region, unfortunately, there were many promises, but unfortunately there was only one state.
Here I'll speak about the Arab region, though.
We have more calls with Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar. Welcome, Hamad.
Peace be upon you
And you too
Hello Dr. Shaikha Hessa
Close to ten
We noticed that this girl has a psychological disability.
What is your role towards a girl who suffers like her?
With her colleagues
Sometimes, even if we preserve
What is your role towards the sons of Qatari girls?
"Many thanks to Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar and Karawan Behjat from Kuwait. Welcome!"
As they say, Sheikhah Hessa
Why leave our oil in obscurity?
Those with special needs can be categorized.
And we can help them.
We have massive financial components.
We can break down the psychological barrier between us and them.
By reviving individual morale
And spend it on this noble cause.
This if we are truly believers.
Gratitude and appreciation to Sheikhah Hessa for all her efforts and everything she did during her tenure as Special Rapporteur.
With our gratitude and appreciation to her and thank you to the State of Qatar for all it has done for people of determination.
Many thanks, Aisha Mohammed from Qatar.
Peace be upon you, Professor Wasila.
Peace be upon you too.
And to your noble guest
Her Highness Sheikhah Hessa
My question is about prevention.
As they say, prevention is better than cure.
At another level of disability, regardless of wars and traffic accidents
The genetic level may result from families, and it is consanguineous marriage.
I thought it was a large percentage.
Leading to disability
Thank you very much, dear flag bearer from Tunisia. Now I return to our guest.
The first caller was Hamad Al-Marri, and he was wondering.
Where does a mentally disabled but psychologically sound girl go?
And where should he go?
In every country
Surely there are services that provide all types of disability in the State of Qatar.
For these disabilities, specifically mental disabilities as we said, or any psychological health disabilities.
Schools
Before, it was
Or I don't mean the private education in the Ministry of Education, which is now the Supreme Council.
The noble standard-bearer from Tunisia pointed to something truly important.
Scientific papers and more
From disability organizations' programs only, but even within campaigns.
Programs for women
All this led to many campaigns and programs for reproductive health.
I was speaking about this aspect.
Adopts healthy strategies
Based on awareness.
Satisfying the desire to show the danger of marrying relatives.
and genetic factors
I think it was implemented in the State of Qatar.
Habits and traditions, but they take time for sure.
Especially in tribal societies
But over time, there will be a response to it, but it is essential that there be some kind of legal commitment.
Yes, Karwan Behjat asked and suggested allocating one percent of the budget of Arab states.
To help the disabled, let me first
Yes, there is a statistical estimate carried out by the World Health Organization on the world as a whole.
Around forty million people are disabled.
Half of them are women.
But these numbers multiply.
As in a study in South Africa where they observed and proved
Certainly, the statistics that emerged from the war in Iraq and the war in Gaza.
For every person killed, three people are disabled.
And since the Arab region has become the undisputed conflict zone
Even the suggestion made by Crown Bejt
One percent won't be enough.
To assist people with disabilities in the Arab region
The issue of percentages of people with disabilities or other marginalised groups.
Frankly and without exaggeration, I don't think she fits in.
Those who need to address their problems and needs.
He emphasized that people with disabilities are the most neglected.
Conducted by governments in general do not count the disabled.
True, and these are linked to the culture of the society and the community, sometimes with constraints.
When the census is taken by
Concerned departments
There is a disabled person in the house.
There was only one question asked: Is there a disabled person or not?
The section relevant to this topic and through the concerned individuals therein.
We worked together to prepare the form.
We recommended more details.
First, specify the gender of the disabled person - male or female.
And did he get help or not?
In fact, even if the numbers are correct, we didn't reach an accurate conclusion.
Care and attention must also be advanced, Fatima Al-Dosari is with us from Qatar. Welcome, Fatima.
Peace be upon you too.
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a disabled child.
And I thank His Highness, our country's ruler, Sheikh Hamad.
And his wife, Sheikh Moza, to accept them this category.
I am very proud to receive all this care and attention.
For her important role
Latifa Al-Messaferi Hello
Because they represent significant disturbances in society without education, without treatment.
Thank you very much, Latifa Al-Messaferi from Qatar is with us now, Nasim.
Abdulkareem is from Jordan. Hello, Naseem.
Keep going, Karim, we can hear you.
Peace be upon you too.
Please, I frankly have an intervention.
First, I am a sound specialist and have been working in the State of Qatar for about four years.
We had a month for raising awareness about speech and hearing disorders.
We were holding conferences, lectures, and awareness sessions for the hearing impaired.
Now I want to talk about Jordan. I've lived there for almost three years now.
Frankly, it provides new and good services.
Frankly, it offers new services, whether material, immaterial, or moral.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education, resources
Ministry of Education in public schools
And our private institutions
They receive good support.
"Is there a direct question, Taff? It's just due to time constraints, I apologize."
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, the UAE, and Jordan, the services are wonderful, and I think they are excellent.
Can you comment on viewers' questions?
A person working in this field.
Relevant to the subject.
I will also return to the issue of the agreement.
What is required once it obtains ratifications and accedes to it.
As a duty of the state or these organizations
Because it depends on the issue of the rights of these people, regardless of
And frankly, what
Things to do during that period for disabled people and why.
And now he wishes that it would happen.
Of course I hope.
I hope this research or survey will be measured and that more high-quality research will be provided in this field.
It also became clear to me from this experience.
Six years of experience
And cooperation among Arab states as well.
They also have a role, not just a matter of their rights, they should get their rights.
Sheikhessa Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Disability, thank you.
We now have the introduction from the league and the Al Kass channel, Lana is on the line, good morning Lana.
I am also pleased to welcome the distinguished captain in Umm Salal, Captain Ali Qasim.
Hello, Ali
Hello %pw
Good morning
I want to open the floor for congratulations. Everyone can congratulate frankly, Lana please.
I had a five-hour open studio and a two-hour one the day before.
I extend my congratulations to the State of Qatar, the land, the government, and the citizens, for they deserve these international achievements.
Perhaps it will give me the opportunity to congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
And his heir apparent, Sheikh Tamim
Yes, certainly, Lana. You are in the field of sports and are an expert in this area, with extensive knowledge of these lines and the sports industry.
Because even our file
And as a competitor, we deserve the sixth difference in votes between us and the United States, fourteen votes for Qatar and eight for the United States.
That's because our file is rich, comprehensive, and supported by many ambassadors, well-backed, for example, by the stadiums.
Perhaps some people were afraid, perhaps there were some %pw, like the United States.
And there could be countries ready; they don't need to provide stadiums, and prepare some projects specifically for this event.
Because they are already ready.
But they were concerned about this point.
Captain Ali, as athletes, I think this is a very significant achievement for sports people.
It will affect the economic, political, and health sectors, I think.
But you, as athletes
What does this achievement mean to you?
Of course, it's a great achievement especially for us, even you saw how the non-athletic people were so happy.
If God wills, Ali, tell me about the moment of announcing the victory.
I had just left the training session and we were listening to the radio station.
We were waiting for the announcement, my friend and I.
I'm driving and listening to the radio.
The moment they announced that Qatar and...
You and I, we screamed, and of course the skylight was open.
My friend stuck his body on top of the car's roof.
We were screaming, everyone was waiting for us, we set the alarms and started our own celebration.
We started celebrating from the beginning.
Alhamdulillah, it was a very special day. I think all the channels focused on this event to a large extent.
Lana, of course you were involved in this event.
Especially sports channels
How did they celebrate this event and what was their reaction?
Many media outlets and channels from around the world were there.
He became a leading teacher, very prominent on the map, gained fame in Qatar.
Sure, Ali, the presence of the player in the team is very important.
And I suppose it's a responsibility that should be taken seriously.
What's your opinion on this particular point?
Okay Ali, do they indicate the required attributes to join the league?
Now there are more upcoming sports events.
And we must prepare a strong generation.
Well-studied football with fundamental principles and tactical schemes.
So what are the rules and foundation that the player should excel in?
And I believe that professionalism includes everything from
Intense, continuous training and organization
All these are basic things that help him focus all his efforts on games or training.
I think every stage has a unique advantage.
It has distinct feelings and taste.
Talk shows and sports programs, which do you prefer, where do you feel more at home?
Wonderful
It helps you keep your body healthy and learn how to maintain your health through exercise, which is the important part.
Even if everyone is watching football matches, you will automatically love them when you enter the stadium.
Do people confine media workers to one side?
What's holding you back in one part?
An open field, not just a football pitch.
Everything is sport, but sport is wonderful.
Ali, there are also other very important topics that we love to discuss.
You wished you could go back ten years in age to reach two thousand and twenty-two.
Oh, you wished you hadn't.
Of course, now everyone dreams of that, especially since it's the World Cup, now any player
Anyone who just watches a World Cup match will be happy, what if he were playing in the World Cup.
I hope they meet the expectations, and this is their chance.
What do you want to tell Captain Ali, as one of the professional players, what do you want to say to them from the bottom of your heart?
We love being with you.
As I just said, I'm currently on vacation, but
Her return to the leagues after a twelve-year absence from the Gulf Cup championship.
You had a beautiful comment from Qatar TV and beautiful memories.
Insha'Allah, Qatar's channel will become like a university that graduates a large group of media personalities.
Our Dorina is brave and I hope he wins many different awards.
We're talking about an important point regarding Umm Salal Club.
How are things there? How are you? I hope you're doing well.
Of course, Alhamdulillah, frankly
Yesterday, of course, at the studio, we interviewed many players.
For I think some of the young men who were watching us believe that you
Required
It is a very common thing in the Qatari league for players to move to other clubs.
I thought I had a good chance in Umm Salal, *as an offer*.
I was able to secure a spot in the Asian Cup with the team, praise be to God.
And my situation is very good with the team.
How can we make sports a social issue?
And outside Qatar, how do we engage women, children, and youth in sports?
It connects everything, everything complements sport.
Women play a role in all fields of sport.
And more broadly, every individual, whether young or adult in this society, feels the importance of sport.
About eleven or twelve years, until we reach this event, enough.
We have more new generations.
The generation is growing up, but we need to raise a generation that learns sports from a young age.
We get Aspire, Aspire is an effective building.
Essential for the new athletic generation
We just need to be firm and keep moving forward.
And football in particular.
How can we attract the audience to participate in all the various club competition matches?
Frankly, the lack of popularity is a problem for us in the Qatari league.
But the problem is attendance, and the Qatar Football Association still hasn't found a way to attract fans.
What method should we use to attract them to attend those football matches?
It depends on the person themselves; some people don't like attending university.
The media plays a crucial role, in any case, in the public's abstention.
And now they use a ticket or collect points here.
No, no, the Qatar Football Association has a plan and many steps to attract audiences.
Some clubs have ways to attract the audience, like Al-Rayyan. Al-Rayyan is a popular club and doesn't need to attract the audience.
Some clubs, some club administrations organize some activities and events.
For viewers, to motivate them, I think those are the only ways.
Players, I mean the new generation.
To love what they do and believe in their abilities, and as you said, they need not only financial support, but more importantly, resource support.
Many thanks for this wonderful conversation, God willing.
So, we want to hear the final word on Qatar's win to host the year two thousand and twenty two, Lana please.
I want to reiterate that Qatar has always been supportive, and
I hope, Commander Ali, a final word you want to say in this interview.
Congratulations and continuous excellence, I wish it for you.
Thank you, Captain Ali, I wish you success in your sporting progress and in your life. May God bless you.
And I love sports more.
The episode will be about young talents.
Some young people argue that these songs are popular nowadays; nevertheless, they have a great deep history.
A group of young people singing Arabic or English words.
Today we'll discuss this with a group of rap enthusiasts.
Here we'll get to know them better through the direct interview we'll have with them.
Welcome to our program, dear viewers, wherever you are.
For years, a new type of song has dominated the Arab and Gulf scene.
I'm from the West, specifically America, which is rap.
Before we start talking about rap music,
Boldly using any word without any reservation.
Anyone can rap.
For writing words,
Almost all rappers write their own lyrics.
So, we will learn all these many and important details from two people who have immersed themselves in this field.
They formed a nice band.
Yousef Al-Naemi and Salman Abdullah, good morning Yousef.
Hello with us, good morning Salman.
Good morning, hello.
I am very happy to have you with us through this program.
And nature through the subject of rap singing.
Yusuf, how did you get into this?
We discover that rap did not exist in Qatar.
In better ways.
Speaking on behalf of the citizen
Including joy, sadness, and political topics.
Yes, I can say that rap,
And these words, I think they are like an artist painting a picture and a poet writing a poem.
The singer can sing and the musician can play any instrument.
Do you think there is acceptance from Qatari society, from Gulf society, for this type of speech?
2010
Do you feel that people like buying CDs for rap music?
A group of ages.
In families and among many people, there are more listeners than before.
There was something like a website.
How many of you are on this band so far?
This means you can all say words, write poetry, and perform in the style of rap.
As they say, one sings, the rapper,
He's the one who sometimes plays, write the words.
Ah, okay!
I ask to hear and tell him I recorded this song.
Okay, all these songs that you've produced, Salman, Yusuf, anyone from the same band.
I didn't think you'd put it on a CD and release it to the market.
But you know if someone is alone, it means they handle all the album's work and release it to the market, which is difficult due to commercial records and procedures.
Okay, why didn't you think about that? You're twenty-five years old and you're always looking for a single hand to clap for you.
There must be two of you, God willing, twenty-five hands, may God preserve you, each one of you like young men and brothers.
You make a CD, and you can market this CD through more than one website.
You have Facebook, YouTube, and also local newspapers.
I believe it contains thirteen songs.
Registration is not like these days.
A bit old, but clear.
It has low quality, not like now, but it's clear.
Made about fifty CDs.
In rap, I can't say we weren't, because there are young people who might have known this art ten years ago.
Not by the strength of the recording and I think the distribution during this time, now is different.
Especially since there is diversity in music, a wide range of techno music genres now.
These young people and artists are creating a collection of wonderful songs.
Also, we want to talk about the parties you've attended.
See, the party we attended in Doha was one.
It was organized by Al Sadd Club and they were very cooperative.
We'll wait and see the audience.
Indeed, we were overwhelmed; we did not expect that great number.
We were also surprised that there were more families present.
More than the youth
The organization was excellent.
We were a bit relieved because it was our first time in Doha.
We didn't expect this many attendees.
The audience interaction was amazing.
It took a long time, so there were many songs.
Okay, let's hear something, or words that you've composed, that the audience, especially the youth, love.
Let's hear a few words, to show the audience.
Can we hear it directly?
Take your time.
Sound mind
The problem is that it's random.
Let's listen.
I don't know.
Here in the Doha Morning Program
One of the fun things is to come to the program in the morning.
Salman is an expert, this is his fifth year practicing rap.
Even if people don't like it.
They have no idea about it.
The words are random.
Damn, the songs you sang, stay with me give me some of the lyrics before
See, not all songs are random, or what they call in English "freestyle".
They are in sync.
But when we sing, some words are chosen carefully.
Thank you, let's see.
We say, good morning my country, good morning health program.
We are live on television, for the audience.
To see what they will serve one by one, two one.
Together from Doha's morning
The beautiful song I just heard
I insisted that the youth distribute it everywhere and online.
I really appreciate that, when will you release it?
Teamwork
Everyone writes themselves.
It's what will make it easy for him to do it.
Everyone writes.
Accept, I think that every artist, whether a painter or a poet, always...
He can also write it out of love for sports.
Love for the country
And I'm sure you participated in the National Day.
Through beautiful songs, Qatari youth are represented.
Waiting for Doha to shine to welcome the Asian Cup, and there will be a celebration on the Corniche.
Celebrate this event.
We're broadcasting these clips live.
"Welcome to the Asian Cup, Doha"
From Doha Airport until now
Let's watch this live footage together.
Reception, audience, our children, students
The Asian Cup arrived at Doha airport this morning to continue.
Preparations to host the massive continental event
Let's go back to our guests, Youssef and Salman, who are happy to be with us.
They're an Arabic Gulf rap group, right?
Can we call it that way?
Now, frankly, we
They're throwing a party, but it's not confirmed.
But you are working on a party that will, God willing, announce Youssef.
Insha'Allah, but this is not confirmed, we are still beginners.
You are still at the beginning of your journey. I wish you good luck, and be assured that our program will support you with all its heart.
Salman's violin, where are you all gathering, twenty-five people.
Where do you meet, and how do you connect all the ideas together?
Sure, there are shared songs.
There's no need for someone like Salman or Youssef, or any of you, to sing a whole song.
There must be cooperation among you all.
Frankly, it's difficult to gather the twenty-five in one place.
I start by contacting Youssef and the other guys and ask them to gather in one place.
Consider the song and the lyrics.
And there's another way.
I'm doing my part.
And continue.
So he records and sends them back to me.
And explore other experiences
Collect some records by famous artists.
Do you benefit from their experience and methods?
Confirmation, we are always
Artists who have been doing this for years and have experience in the field.
We listen to them, learn techniques, and try to come up with a unique style.
Because if we did the same thing, with the same tone, and the same words,
We're not producing anything new, we want to do something that...
We benefit from them a little.
Yes, there is also a large group of Gulf youth, in the Gulf.
In a primitive way, let's see the report together, benefit from it, and enjoy it. Let's watch it together.
These talents that some people possess are mysterious.
Using very primitive tools.
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah Al-Daili
This is one hundred and fifty kilometers.
I am from the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
He is considered to have good experience and ability.
From the discovery of shallow groundwater sites
From a depth of more than one hundred meters
You know that drilling wells is very expensive.
Determine the appropriate site for drilling a well, but with experience, it can be...
Discover, or locate
Groundwater sites
Since ancient times
Our fathers and grandfathers
They consulted experts to locate the wells.
You dig.
Abu Ibrahim Groundwater Exploration Techniques
No modern techniques
Or soil analysis in laboratories
He relies on God's grace in his work.
And its sewers are underground.
Pomegranate seeds
Pomegranate branches or fig branches
Now, the process of watercourse detection is being applied scientifically.
To conclude, this is the end of the broadcast.
Go again.
Go back
Alright, from here, we start marking.
And here, the stream ends.
He needs a great deal of experience and patience.
So we can determine the sensitivity of the motion.
I went to more than one place.
Ninety-five percent of success.
Of course, in this way and using copper bars.
And there is no precise scientific explanation for that.
This method
What is truly amazing is the success rate of those practicing this primitive profession.
Over ninety-five percent
In the search for shallow groundwater reservoirs
Glory to God, who taught man what he did not know. This report is from Saudi Arabia.
He has his own band and more than one CD.
Whether online or by phone
Sometimes there are rivalries between Gulf countries, such as Qatar vs. Bahrain and Qatar vs. Kuwait.
They produce a stronger song for a stronger theme.
Addressing an issue, among others, there are many matters.
I see him as a role model.
The will of God
And at the same time, we want to
Broadcast a wide range of songs
"What we were able to do" or "What we could do" (depending on context)
From time to time, let's connect with you.
To get the latest news about the band
But let's make sure of the band's name.
It's Rapers.
Let's go back to our guests at the corniche and the beautiful weather.
We are live with you through this direct link.
Wherever you are in Cornwall, catch the Asian Cup.
We are proud of them and their wonderful arts.
Addresses various social and psychological youth issues
But he only has two with us in the studio.
I'm sure they'll represent the rest.
Yusuf and Salman, welcome again.
Sometimes subscriptions expire.
We tried to reach the company, but no one answered.
As a team, you need to improve yourself, people in
Facebook and YouTube
and similar sites
Band name
You'll find us at the top of the search results.
Organize and work together on this great production.
You're curating and matching images to songs, are these personal photos?
Or you can download it from YouTube and websites that contain videos, and you can continue.
Some people have done it before.
In many songs
The obstacles you face, such as the lack of a company to sponsor you, no website.
You really need a place where you can all gather as a team.
What are your wishes that you want to fulfill and achieve?
"Who took care of us"
Organize an album for us.
I hope it becomes official.
Because they spent five years.
As I wish, no more.
Yes, we've shared some things, some series.
We hope it improves.
And there is someone who supports us and stays with us.
Ah, Salman, we also want to know your wishes.
My only demand is to produce a music video.
We wish you success.
We hope that all your songs become famous in the Middle East.
This is a very beautiful and popular art.
And bears a message, as I just said.
My best wishes to you, I hope for your every success.
Welcome the group, and our best wishes for your success.
Here we conclude with the song they produced especially for the program.
This is the KDD DJMR Doha program.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Jim, Mrs. Bobo with SKT One Hot to Body.
We say, good morning my country, good morning health program.
We are live on television, for the audience.
Don't forget, the program airs at 9:30. Everyone must watch.
To see what they will serve one by one, two one.
Together from Doha's morning
Produced by Hasan Naama, Presented by Shaima Al-Hamadi
Director Nasser Al-Maliki, and guests Rapri Qatar, of course.
It can be repeated again and used at home.
Like a shopping cart or a shopping trolley.
I'm shopping at the supermarket.
When you put any item, or anything you want to buy in
A large screen will display the components of this item.
That was Magdi's idea and it was feasible.
Just a software patch, a scanner in the cart that detects the item.
And made shopping easy for the buyer.
He can get all the details on the screen.
I suppose it raises health awareness.
When the device is with you or in the cart.
Ingredients
Any warnings, side effects
Full details
Or ambition, for example there are a number of projects, about four or five.
Dealing with traffic issues.
It addresses traffic congestion and other issues such as the parking problem, and it was very creative and very good.
Insha'Allah, Center for Children's Culture
Sir Abdullah, let's talk about the various activities that will be held in the coming days.
Yes, there are surprises too, but we'll discuss them briefly.
Ideas, I don't know if you want me to mention some of the projects presented or
For example, for underground transportation, the great idea is
Once a man left his house, he found an elevator.
And they met at one point.
I assume that all viewers are enjoying the images displayed now.
Children's Creations
Okay, think of it like an ATM.
For a woman, for example, I have a card.
I include it and say I need a shirt.
For example, some shops, or if I've lost things at home, like my key.
The one that's lost, for example, the office key.
We have a fundamental goal set by Her Highness Sheikh Moza.
Her Highness
At an early age, this is of great importance in project design.
Three hundred identified children
Let's also speak and address.
Yes, she was the one who hosted the closing ceremony.
To showcase their programs, we really need to open the doors to interested children.
And after that, they can start.
We need them to be there and support us, that's our priority.
These programs and activities serve that grand idea.
The diverse and varied skills of children
Self-development
Okay, do you have any collaboration with youth clubs in Qatar?
There are also science clubs in Qatar.
Of course, all our programs are built on the exchange of ideas.
This is his entire professional network.
With other community service institutions specialized in enhancing these talents
Involvement of all concerned institutions
Photography Society
The Innovation Center for Girls, and the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers also played a very important role.
Yes, they played a significant role in interpreting Qatar's vision.
And training children on it.
Engaging and encouraging children, with each program relying on institutional partnerships.
According to the head of projects and establishments
And what changes it?
Being here in Katara gives us momentum, strength, and support.
And faster.
We are now, in collaboration with Katara, preparing for some projects that will be ready for launch within the next two months.
Of course, there is cooperation in many programs.
Especially when it comes to reading.
Chairperson of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
And we are implementing it, especially since we are in the preparation stage.
Building a promising future for all children, the next generation, and youth
What is your final word you want to say to fathers and sons watching us now who are interested in joining the center?
More than we offer them now.
Sometimes our children come up with ideas that we shouldn't underestimate.
We must take their ideas into account, no matter what.
Because when we take it seriously, it will develop, at least we will encourage the child to think.
It is important to provide care and attention to the child.
And spiritually as well, our problem is that most parents
Support him.
And encourage him, so we encourage parents.
Paying more attention to children's imagination, today's children are the assets of the future.
Take us on a tour of the exhibition and we saw their projects.
We lived the dream.
Dreams and thoughts were from a vivid imagination.
And dreams become reality; many of them have achieved it and made it real.
Praise be to God, we wish our children who were there success.
Our hearts are with you.
The will of God
Of different ages and genders
Up to seventy projects
It is considered very pioneering and worthy of implementation.
For more discussion on this national exhibition.
And the culture center for children as well.
Sir Abdullah, speak to us briefly about the exhibition.
There are many things, for sure. Isn't there anything you can do about it?
Children introduced a new style of expressing nationalism and loyalty to their country.
He was under the auspices of the Minister of Education.
On the tour of the exhibition
You'll grow until thirty.
We started training children to envision Qatar 2030 across all its three themes.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, environmental development
First, to know the situation of Qatar in the year three hundred and thirty.
Then, to start thinking about
Creative ideas, and how to be creative.
I suppose they have broad minds.
But why should we help him?
I suppose their minds will grow more and more.
Sir, you launched the exhibition under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation, Reality or the Homeland of Tomorrow."
The slogan says "Dreams of the Generation"
It will be part of Qatar's future, Qatar's tomorrow.
We felt that when we were walking with the children, when the child says to the minister,
I want you to open my project, I invite you to visit my project for the year thirty and twenty.
A child thinking about twenty years ahead.
They express their love for their countries in the field they are interested in.
There should be some activities, events, and competitions.
One of them won the Stars of Science prize.
As there were the winners of the first prize from the League of Arab States.
Confirmation, all the children.
On the sidelines, there were various performances on a specific schedule.
To display the projects they have done
In a vast existence, a uniquely remarkable presence.
Stars of Science
Some of the winners in the projects that participated in the exhibition.
Who won one of the major prizes?
Innovative or creative forest or reserve
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
The colorful ball is also one of the children's dreams and Qatar's vision for the future.
An idea for thirty and twenty.
How can a child contribute with a creative idea for 2030?
The main idea is that there is suspicion about the ball.
The referee gives a colored card.
For example, the referee can see the ball's movements.
Or the field is changed by this electronic slide.
This is proven in the ball.
In creative ideas, of course, the main idea, some people may ask.
And projects
We always say, we've reached this stage.
Developing skills and broadening their horizons
Give them an idea of how to express nationalism through these projects.
Giving them confidence in how to present the project, engage with the audience, and explain its idea.
In a field he loves, attached to something he loves, all of this is an achievement.
Offer support, we thank him for it.
Which is now in the development stage.
Also the public, the committee, and some officials supported the projects.
First, no, it was the second, because this girl
Pipes, channels for the audience to attend underground, and the way viewers enter need arrangements.
A very large forest reserve
When the visitor can stroll around and watch the animals and reptiles.
There are also sensors attached to some animals to monitor their condition.
There is also the marine environment, the way in is also creative.
One of the reasons they gave was the vast and detailed imagination.
All this qualified them for victory.
There is someone talking about an underwater tourist city.
Butterfly City
A forest on Earth.
A large number of tourism ideas
Very fun
Perhaps this is what their minds need, at this time, perhaps in thirty and twenty.
In the future, it will be achieved.
Three projects.
Approved by the Science Club, they said these are the projects we need to work on.
In a project, it's about excess water from air conditioning.
Let's see the Arab newspaper.
The article says, "Qatar University celebrates graduation."
The presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al-Mahmoud
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Secretary-General of the Supreme Education Council
And Dr. Shaikha Bint Abdullah Al-Maysan, President
A new record for the university indeed.
Qatar University and University of Calgary
There's also excellent news about our students.
This is an academic achievement, and we wish them success, God willing, in all specialties.
He is considered one of the young actors who are making a strong entry into the Qatari drama scene.
How long, also classify and colored threads.
Actor Abdelhamid Charshani is considered one of the actors who made themselves.
If it wasn't convincing,
He will choose to be involved in activities taking place within Qatar.
Currently, actor Abdelhamid Sharshani is participating in the series Killer Feelings and Classifications Part Two.
We're happy to have him as our guest this morning.
So we can talk to him about his participation in these two works and about his experience in general.
Hello, welcome and goodnight.
We are happy to host you on the Doha Morning program. This is the first time I meet you and your first time on Doha Morning.
With the people who work hard for the program.
And you, Ms. Lisa.
Welcome aboard. Before we start the conversation,
Okay, let's see.
I am a responsible man and an executive manager.
And I enforce the laws.
The only thing I can tell you is,
Give me the bisht.
Listen, why are you asking me?
Go and ask them, if anyone agrees that you don't come back in the bisht.
Of course I have another question to start with, but since we've seen this part of the series, it follows from the first part.
He pointed out that Khalid ibn al-Walid...
Some historians associate the famous poet Amr ibn Kulthum with the city of Mart.
A lot of things and information related to that city in Saudi Arabia.
For more information, we will help you watch this excellent report by our colleague Abdulrahman Marshid.
Let's see it together.
Certainly, it is the testimony of people who know nothing about rewards or inclinations.
And as an affirmation of the history of this city or that city.
As we see from its remains and hear from its narrators and poets.
Their classical and modern works, thus, add an important new chapter to the city's history.
The city of Marrat is one of the cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Historically, it is an ancient city founded in the pre-Islamic era.
There has been a debate among historians about how to name it?
Some believe it was named after the famous poet Amr ibn al-Qays al-Kindi.
And the valley named after him.
Its creation date is unknown.
In the pre-Islamic era.
The most famous thing in the city of Marath is Mount Komit, upon which many proverbs have been built.
Because it's in the city and close by.
Stop. These are historical places.
This view is considered one of the tourist attractions in Saudi Arabia.
The municipality of Marrat made a great effort in creating
A garden on this mountain
And seating areas for citizens and everyone in the kingdom.
It is named after the Prophet's companion Khalid ibn al-Walid (may Allah be pleased with him).
To fight the apostates and Musaylimah the liar.
One of her works is Shu'ayb Kumayt.
This is a place where water from streams gathers and is stored for a long time.
It was one of the most important water sources in the past.
One of her works is also the Al-Dahi Heritage House.
Marat is a city with a history dating back to pre-Islamic times.
He was famous for his poets who were influenced.
With its beauty, its ruins and the famous Mount Comete.
Abdulrahman Al-Marshed for the Doha Morning Program,
Marat City, north of Riyadh.
We're back to our dear guests.
I hope you will let us know and inform the viewers about those methods and techniques.
Initially, you stated that our infrastructure is very private.
We open a page for him and he is registered through a specific record in our system.
Email guardian.
This report contains the extent of increased attention, faster typing, faster reading, and overall deviation.
The guard gets a full report.
Alright, this report will be added to the student's record.
For his son's internet record.
And he sees the progress of his son.
He can see his grades and his attention with teachers.
So we can intelligently enjoy the beauty of this clever girl.
So that we can bring most of the children in the center and we send them our warm greetings.
I entered this center with a professor there.
To assess her intelligence and the level she has reached since joining the center.
Of course, this year.
He focuses on one task after Ramadan.
But of course this is a work that always comes at the expense of other works.
Some people watch TV only during Ramadan.
He sits awake watching TV while people turn the holy months into a TV spectacle.
Reduce, reduce, reduce the chain, reduce, let them do one job every two years, is that better?
Of course.
I hope they like me in Ramadan.
But I would like to send you all my best regards.
And certainly,
And also with plays.
From drama to fashion.
A fashion show was held at Katara Cultural Village.
Of course, we're still with you with great love and loyalty.
And develop the children's abilities and skills more.
Unlike the various schools in this generous country.
We have a template and we spoke with a guest we had before.
Now we have Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Abdelsalam. Welcome and good morning.
How are you, Oumnia?
I am a decorator.
Which grade are you in now?
Professor Ibrahim, to start, could you introduce us to the course offered by the center?
An example of this is Omnia.
Here we will try the technique or method that Ms. Nesma is talking about.
Do you feel there's a difference in his mind?
Do you feel that these skills and techniques,
These things will be changed regarding his mental skills, or even his educational level will be changed.
Scientific methods
Including initially testing the child with an international test called the TONI test before starting anything in the program.
I'm starting the second part of Tony's test as well.
We can measure the student's level or the change in the student's level through it.
Now a test or something similar will be conducted.
Oumnia will be counted and will respond immediately live on air.
Of course, she knows nothing about the questions.
We tricked them with that thing.
Of course, I have another question to start with,
We would like to ask you about your participation in the second part this year.
What is your contribution, can you tell us about it?
Of course, after we presented the series, we classified the first part.
Alhamdulillah, I've been lucky with several roles.
Mr. Ghanem,
Distribute roles with the executive director Ashraf Shahate alongside Mr.
This is an opportunity from Tara for artistic production.
For the youth.
Mr. Ghanem nominated me this year for
Of course, each episode is different.
In this episode, I'll be playing different characters.
On the contrary, it's a wonderful experience. In this work, we have...
One of Kuwait's pyramids, Mr. Saad Al-Faraj.
We have actors from Bahrain, Abdullah Malik, Ali Al Ghareer.
Like Ali Mirza, we have
You also have a group of young actors like Abdullah Adham.
Yes, among the young actors, we have Abdullah Al-Essam.
This happened a year ago, and last year we did two works a year.
Perhaps that's why I asked you before going on air. You've been representing since 1997,
But you couldn't achieve anything, or your ambition in acting.
Praise be to Allah for everything.
Did you study acting, or was it just a hobby?
No, it's just a hobby.
I took acting as a talent. The actor Abdulaziz Jassem built me up in my early days.
He is one of the actors who considers me his son.
If you need anything, call me.
We were in all of his shows.
We worked hard and thank God.
Now, without Tara, a very special thank you to Mr. Abdulrahman Al-Sulaiti, a very special thank you to Mr. Abdulrahman.
If you compare us to Kuwait. In Kuwait, there are twelve to sixteen new actors coming every year. Why?
They have it.
Of course, thank her very much for providing many opportunities.
But, let's say,
We're talking about the other series, we have an idea about the genres.
We need to know something about the killer feeling.
And the man, too.
We have a model, we have with us the processor Professor Abdulaziz Al-Muyouf Al-Tamimi.
For this procedure to take place in the air.
And we can see how we can treat the person. Let me first say good morning to Mr. Sabhi bin Hamza, welcome.
Hello, peace be upon you.
So please enter, my lord.
Inshallah
In the name of God
We hold the hand.
We see the nerves.
Like a painting or a message from God Almighty, showing all the organs in your body.
From the inside and its problems
You feel dizzy sometimes.
I have a headache and feel dizzy.
Loosen your grip, loosen it. Let your nerves relax, yes.
Indeed, Sir Abdelaziz, you will discover something specific from his hand that he suffers from a certain disease.
From his left side. His ears, he has a non-serious injury to his middle ear.
"There is pain! What does that mean, Sir Abdulaziz?"
Ear. Do you have a problem with your ear?
Since I was born, since I was little
Do you also have pain here?
It's the sinuses!
Do you have a pain in the nose and a headache here?
I have a headache here.
He has a problem with his sinuses.
It gives him a headache between the eyes.
Weight increases without eating.
Drenthe isn't working well, you feel lazy and sluggish all the time and feel like your body is heavy.
I sleep a lot.
Either oversleeping or laziness always makes you feel heavy.
You always carry an infection in your tonsil.
"See the vibration, you walked the vibration."
He's stressed, and you're walking barefoot, it might be the last time.
Are you from Tunisia?
Wow, you mentioned things about him.
Is this massage also beneficial for children?
The mother's thumb, glorified be God, is similar in size to the palm of a child's hand.
Most children sleep a lot, why?
He doesn't like being carried, but people think he does. He has gas in his stomach, bless his heart.
By the time the mother puts her thumb, she extends her thumb.
In the palm of the child's hand
The hands are parallel and the child is parallel to them.
Let's see it, so every mother can learn this move.
It's the start of the pressure like this. Right and left, and right and left.
This is about the child, about, about, about the child and he is beautiful.
Okay, regarding discoveries, do you have specific discoveries particularly for women?
As we said, in every house, there are ninety percent women, God bless them.
First thing, the first warning from ceramic and flat floors.
When we walk barefoot on ceramic, we can walk barefoot, but walking on uneven ground is dangerous.
Walk barefoot! The proof is when ceramics are used in homes, health problems have increased.
Because it's cold and flat.
When there was carpet, there were problems, they suffered from asthma.
Zayd.
Women should be keen to focus on walking barefoot on the grass.
This is the foot and the posterior malleolus, the malleolus.
From here, this foot and now under the stomach.
This is the first discovery, the second discovery is the way to facilitate delivery.
Just focus with me for a bit.
In the seventh or ninth month of her pregnancy.
Usually, only from being in the delivery month.
That means, they don't come on the eighth, the eighth is dangerous, and the most dangerous thing is walking barefoot.
A pregnant woman should be careful about walking barefoot.
If she had been on time,
I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan, "And shake towards you the trunk of the palm tree, it will let fall fresh ripe dates upon you."
We know that Mary, peace be upon her, we know that her provision comes to her.
I even debated scholars who told me: "Why don't you change the interpretation of Ibn Kathir?"
I told them, "I give you the idea that God placed in these sciences and inspired me with it."
Waving the palm tree trunk towards you, when you shake a palm tree, what does it look like?
He is sharp as nails or spikes.
When you shake the palm tree, you command the wombs, which are the area of the wombs, here in the middle.
They are the intestines. They give orders to facilitate childbirth and help the fetus get into position.
Adjusting the position of the fetal head to bring it into a normal alignment.
Glory to God, this is one of the benefits of this fruit.
And he takes the hand and begins to relax it.
Some consider it a practice, while others recognize it as a science.
Therefore, they are afraid to tell you, and you don't trust them.
Yes. Sir Abdulaziz, your discoveries are important.
But I want to ask you one last question because time has flown by so quickly.
If someone wants to contact you, is there a specific email address or should they contact you directly?
Okay, the mobile number is available at the control room. If anyone wants to contact Mr. Abdulaziz, they can call us after the program.
Of course on Qatar TV numbers, so he can call us and take this number.
I was created to serve people only.
If we endorse this creed, God will bless your work and guide the people.
I have sins like other people and I've done everything you can imagine. I'm an ordinary person.
Well, we wish for more good.
We always think of good.
Our subscribers, I hope you enjoyed this segment on reflexology and hand massage.
And also through the foot.
Let's see a live demonstration on air, showing how to detect the diseases this person has.
And what he suffers from. I hope we can benefit from you, and if anyone wants to contact him, they can read more about him online.
The way it is implemented depends on whether it is in the coming days or years, or whether it involves more schools.
Good morning
How do you rate this experience?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
The fact that obesity in Gulf countries has become a big problem.
So we feared that Qatar would be the fifth country with them.
That's the program, frankly. It happened that she was the first lady in New York.
I visited Doha, and they have a program for that.
They presented it to us, we kissed it and said, "No problem."
Our students alongside students from New York, Spain, and England,
Therefore, we can notice the level of our students in Qatar among the world, and this is something we want in the future.
Because we encourage students to eat fruit.
And he stops exercising.
Of course, the fifth week is family meal with your family.
Kill two birds with one stone.
In the sixth week, he tells us what he has gained from this experience. Praise be to God, we are at the end today.
We are happy with the students.
Did you know they were three independent schools, for boys Abu Obeida,
Raquia Independent Girls' School
And with high spirits.
The family was more knowledgeable, and their brothers were enthusiastic at home and started eating this food just like them.
A mobile culture emerged among students, who then carried this culture back home to their families.
He is a spirit and tells them, "Give me this or teach me this."
The training staff or whoever provided this information to the students,
How did you choose him and how was the student contacted? Who made the contact?
Yes, there were many authorities who helped us, God bless them.
Our brothers at the diet center teach them about healthy eating, of course.
And learn from Lady A'isha Al-Tamimi the etiquette of eating.
How they arrange themselves, how they prioritize!
To learn about cooking, sports, or to educate about the value of healthy foods.
It was in the form of separate lessons, curricula, or
How are these ideas conveyed to the students?
In various ways, some within the school,
We organized a day at the beginning of the program in the Aspire zone, gathering all the male and female students.
These matters do not concern a specific person, but we are all responsible, responsible because they are our children.
How these students behave at first!
I initially said the results were satisfactory.
Is the presence of three or specific grades in those schools sufficient?
Now, when an experiment starts in the world, it doesn't start on a large scale.
It starts from a reasonable range where all the features are; boys, girls, independent, and private.
Since it is not suitable in our culture, environment, and family circumstances, such as what they accept for their children and what they don't.
They basically want to participate in it, and I'm being honest with you, it's very important.
The thirteen- or twelve-year-old student, this is the right time for him to know his health.
This is a tragedy for many people who want others to be compassionate, but they imagine it to be impossible.
Some actors we see in the movies with a small body, they say it's impossible, no!
We talked in detail, but there are many weeks we couldn't cover.
And through the morning of Doha, we can remind them of that.
And fruits that contain vitamin B that you can get from fruits and vegetables.
The servant should know the benefits of fruits and should know that if he eats them, his health will improve, so he will be in high spirits.
As for fruits, they went to the supermarket and picked out their fruits.
Alright, that's a point.
This is diversity and naturally they compete, each school was creative with its different ideas for its teachers.
Spirit of competition
We give them guidelines and everyone should be creative.
Do the teachers train the students, or do they have special staff for that?
We trained them, we trained them.
But teachers were adding, for example, some schools like Abu Obeida said they would make Saturday for student activities.
This is a day outside of school hours, they decide and rely on it, they said at Rania's school that they
They said they would have a healthy cooking day for the girls, but we didn't require the boys to cook healthily for themselves; the girls were moreIBIBIBIB
I also want to thank Miyah Al-Reean for providing free water to schools, Miyah Al-Reean in this regard.
Of course, water is healthier because it is needed to cleanse his body of all these toxic substances that enter his body daily through water.
We said the third week.
This means that his body is moving.
He might be playing soccer or basketball and he doesn't know that it's the game I love.
True, true, exactly, and some of them might want another game, maybe they don't like team games.
Hello, live with us.
Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Jaber, founder and managing director of the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Community, welcome to our program.
While we naturally try to focus as much as possible on important topics.
We would like to introduce and present to our dear audience what is multiple sclerosis?
Because this name might be unfamiliar to us as well,
The number of women was greater than the number of men.
All the treatments available now are preventive treatments.
The white cells that are supposed to protect us start to...
He kills us with his neural blows.
Make it easier for the audience, it's like a wire.
Covered by a layer called myelin, let's say it's a nylon layer.
Of course, it usually causes dizziness and double vision, a duality in sight.
It also causes problems in the digestive system, respiratory system.
In the worst cases, it leads to madness, quadriplegia, or paraplegia.
Of course, the treatments.
The most important functions of the body are those that will be most severely affected.
Or one of these diseases is a condition called multiple sclerosis.
Some theories say that it is transmitted by a virus.
It's a non-epidemic disease.
What is passed on to children?
Some people consider it a disease depending on the region.
The equator, for instance, was excluded from these diseases.
Currently, we have some cases of this disease on the equator.
This disease still has no cure because its cause is unknown.
So far, scientists are unable to know the cause of the disease, until they can find a cure for it.
The opposite is now the case.
They are trying to avoid the impact of the disease itself on the human body.
In other words, it looks like the work is being done from behind.
We might be a little afraid to say that this disease comes suddenly.
Is there a specific group, a group that you feel this illness has spread within a specific group?
Internationally, it has been ranked between twenty and forty.
Now the international community for the same disease has reduced the number from twenty to fifteen.
Because it's starting to affect young people up to the age of forty.
But man is not free from it.
Of course, as a society, we are open to alternative medicine and Prophetic medicine.
Yes, through the community, Multiple Sclerosis Society Qatar.
Why do we have this society?
There was a large group, so I thought about having an association for this topic.
Of course, I'll generate random numbers for you.
In Kuwait, he says there are sixteen thousand cases.
A thousand cases
The rest of the Gulf countries range between one hundred and three hundred.
When I discovered it five or six years ago,
My number was sixty or forty-six.
Are there any symptoms indicating that the patient is actually suffering from these diseases?
We are not asserting that this is a virus, that's why we don't want to subscribe to any particular theory, that's the
The second point is how do I know if I have it or not.
This is very difficult.
I am perplexed, oh Lord Abdulaziz! I am trying to discover a specific point.
