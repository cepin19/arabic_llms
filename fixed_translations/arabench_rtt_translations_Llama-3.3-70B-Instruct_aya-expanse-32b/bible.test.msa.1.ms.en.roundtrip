Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar Farquharrly, Jesus called a little child to him. He ordered the child to stand among them.
Jesus said, "What I tell you is the truth: You must change and become like little children, or you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me.
But what if one of these little ones who believe in me were to be led into sin? If so, it would be better for that person to have a large millstone hung around their neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.
Alas for the world because of what leads people into sin. Such things must come, but woe to those who cause them.
"If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into the eternal fire of hell with two hands and two feet."
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The Parable of the Lost Sheep
"See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you, their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven."
(No
What do you see? Suppose a man has 100 sheep, and one of them goes astray. Won't he leave the 99 on the hills and go look for the one that went astray?
What I am about to tell you is the truth. If that one sheep is found, there is more joy in heaven over it than over the ninety-nine that did not wander off.
So it is with your Father in heaven. He does not want any of these little ones to be lost. When someone sins against you
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother back.
But what if he does not listen to you? Then take one or two others along with you. For the Scripture says, "On the evidence of two or three witnesses a matter shall be confirmed" (Deuteronomy 19:15).
But what if he refuses to listen to the witnesses? Then tell the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church? Then treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. What you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
"Whatever you ask in my name, I will give it to you, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it."
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am with them." The servant who had no mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to collect from his servants all that was owed to him.
As the king began to do so, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought to him.
The man was unable to pay. So his master issued an order. The man, his wife, his children, and all that he had were to be sold to pay off his debt.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll pay everything."
The lady felt sorry for him, so she forgave him what he owed her and set him free.
But later, that slave went out and found one of the other slaves who owed him a little money. He grabbed him and began to choke him. "Pay me what you owe me," he said.
The other servant fell on his knees. "Give me time," he begged. "I will repay you."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
The other servants saw what happened. It disturbed them greatly. They went and told their master everything that had occurred.
Then the lord called the first servant. He said, "You wicked servant! I forgave you all that you owed me because you pleaded with me.
"Was it not proper for you to show mercy to a servant as I showed mercy to you?"
In anger, his master handed him over to the jailers. He will be punished until he pays back everything he owes.
So will my Father in heaven do also unto you, if ye do not forgive your brother from your hearts.
Isa knows about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. Their lips are there.
Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that the Creator made them at the beginning, male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.
They asked, "Why did Moses command a man to give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.
This is what I tell you: Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. A man must not divorce his wife unless she has been unfaithful to him.
The students said to him, "If this is the case between husband and wife, it is better for one not to marry."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who are able to live without marriage can accept it.
Some men cannot have children because they were born that way. Some were made that way by others. Others have made themselves that way for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept living this way should do so." Small children were brought to Jesus.
Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on the children and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he departed from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
"Why do you ask me about good?" answered Jesus. "There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter the kingdom, obey the commandments."
"Which one?" the man asked. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness.
Honor your father and your mother. (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) And love your neighbor as yourself. (Leviticus 19:18)
"I have obeyed all these commandments," said the young man. "What more is required of me?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all you have, give the money to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sorrowful, for he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "What I am about to tell you is true. It is hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven.
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered him, "We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?"
"What I am about to tell you is the truth," Jesus said to them. "When all things are renewed, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then those of you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, and you will judge the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will also inherit eternal life.
But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
I explained to them that they would get the regular pay for a day's work. Then I sent them to my vineyard.
Around nine o'clock in the morning, he went out again. He saw the others standing in the market square doing nothing.
He said to them, "Go you also into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you."
So they went. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock and did the same thing.
Around five o'clock he went out and found others standing around the place. He asked them, 'Why have you been standing here all day doing nothing?'
"Because no one hired us," they answered. "He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'"
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, "Call the workers and give them their pay. Begin with the last ones hired and go on to the first."
The hired workers arrived around five o'clock. Each received the usual day's wage.
So when those who were hired first came, they thought they would be paid more; but each of them also received a denarius.
When they received it, they started complaining about the owner.
They said, "These people who were hired last only worked for one hour. You paid them the same as you paid us. We did most of the work and were under the hot sun all day."
The king answered one of them. "My friend," he said, "I am dealing with you fairly. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to give those I hired last the same wage I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do as I please with my own money? Do you feel cheated because I freely gave to others?
"But many who are last will be first, and many who are first will be last." Jesus speaks again of his upcoming death.
Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. As they traveled, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak with them.
"We will go to Jerusalem," he said. "The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and they will condemn him to death.
"Then he will be delivered to the Gentiles. They will mock him, spit on him, and scourge him. They will crucify him on a cross. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks Jesus for a favor.
The mother of Zebedes' sons came to Jesus with her sons. She knelt before him and asked him for something.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Grant that one of my sons may sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom. You promised that one would sit at your right hand and the other at your left."
"You do not know what you are asking," Jesus told them. "Can you drink the cup of suffering that I am about to drink?" "We can," they answered.
Jesus said to them, "You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten pupils heard about it. They were angry with the two brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them."
Do not be like this, but whoever wishes to be great among you, let him be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first among you must be your servant.
Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom to open the eyes of many. Two blind men receive their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, followed by a large crowd.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by, so they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood and called out to them, "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
"Our Lord," they said, "we wish to see."
Jesus felt a deep respect for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately, they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me."
So if anyone tells you, 'Go away, for the Lord needs him,' go at once and send him to the master.
This happened so that what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled. And he said,
Say to the daughters of Zion, "Behold, your King is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
The disciples went and did what Jesus commanded them.
They brought the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and Jesus sat on the clothes.
A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people walked before him, and some followed him. And they all shouted: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and the people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleanses the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area and began to drive out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you have made it a 'den of robbers.' (Jeremiah 7:11)"
A blind man and those with disabilities came to him at the mosque, and he healed them there.
The chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that he was doing. They also saw the children in the temple area shouting: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," answered Jesus. "Have you never read,'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus went out from among the people and left the city, going to Bethany. He spent the night there. In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry. He saw a fig tree by the roadside and went to it, but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And immediately the fig tree withered.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road, and went to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And at once the fig tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?" they asked.
Jesus answered, "What I tell you is the truth. You must believe and not doubt. Then you can do what was done to the fig tree. You can say to this mountain, 'Go and throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." - A question about Jesus' authority.
Jesus entered the temple courts and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
Where did the reign of John come from? Was it from heaven? Or did it come from people? They spoke to each other about it. They said, "If we say 'from heaven,' he will ask, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say 'of people'? We are afraid of people, for everyone thinks that John was a prophet.
So they said to Jesus, "We do not know." Jesus answered, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. The story of the two sons.
What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."
"I won't do it," the son replied. But then he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing to him. The son answered, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
Which of the two sons did what his father wanted? They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live. You did not believe in him. But the tax collectors and the sinners did. You saw this. But even after that, you did not repent of your sins and believe in him. The parable of the tenants.
Listen to another story. A man who owned some land planted a vineyard. He put a fence around it. He dug a hole to press the grapes in. He also built a watchtower. He rented the vineyard to some farmers. Then he went on a journey.
When the time of the harvest drew near, he sent his servant to the tenants. He said to the servants, "Go and gather my share of the fruit."
But the tenants seized his slaves. They punched one of them. They killed another. They threw a stone at the third to kill him.
Then the man sent other slaves to the tenants, more than he had sent the first time. And the tenants treated these slaves in the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them, saying, "They will take care of my son."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the heir; let's kill him, and then everything will be ours."
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
When will the owner of the vineyard return, and what will he do to the tenants?
"Those wicked men will be destroyed," they answered. "Then the vineyard will be let out to others. They will give the owner his share of the produce at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
Here is what I say to you: The kingdom of God will be taken from you, and given to a people who will bear its fruit.
Anyone who falls on that stone will be broken into pieces. But the stone will crush anyone who falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables. They knew he was speaking about them.
So they sought a way to seize him, but they feared the crowd, for they perceived that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Feast Story
Jesus told them more parables. He said:
This is like the kingdom of heaven. A king prepared a wedding feast for his son.
He sent his servant to those who had been invited to the dinner. The servant said to them, "Come." But they refused.
Then he sent out other slaves, saying, "Tell those who are invited, 'I have prepared my feast, my oxen and fattened cattle are killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.'
But people didn't pay attention. One went to his field, and another to his work.
The rest held his slaves. They treated them badly and then killed them.
The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come.'
Go to the street corners. Invite to dinner anyone you can find.
So the servants went out into the streets. They gathered all the people they could find, good and bad alike. Soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king came to greet the guest. He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
He asked him, "My friend, how did you get in here without your wedding clothes?" The man couldn't think of anything to say.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet, and cast him out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out and plotted to entrap Jesus in his words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You don't let anyone influence you, and you don't care about anyone's status.
Tell us then, what do you see? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their plans. He said, "You hypocrites! Why are you trying to test me?"
Show me the coin with which they pay the jizya." They brought him a dirham of silver.
He asked them, "Whose is this picture? And whose are these words?"
"Caesar," they answered. Then he said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and walked away. Marriage is when the dead rise.
On that very day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people rise from the dead.
"Master," they said, "Moses wrote this for us: 'If a man dies and has no son, his brother shall marry his wife, and they shall have a son who shall bear his brother's name.'
We were seven brothers. The eldest got married and passed away. He had no children, so he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened with the second and third brother, and even the seventh brother experienced the same thing.
Finally, the woman died.
Well, now, when the dead rise, who will be her husband? All seven were married to her.
Jesus answered, "You are wrong, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God.
When the dead rise, they will not marry. Especially their parents will not give them in marriage. They will be like angels in heaven.
What about the resurrection of the dead? Haven't you read what God has told you?
He said, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the crowd heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. The most important commandment.
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees had been unable to answer Jesus. So the Pharisees gathered together.
One of them was a lawyer, so he tested Jesus with a question.
"Teacher," he asked, "what is the most important commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' (Deuteronomy 6:5)"
This is the first and most important of the commandments.
"You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
All things written in the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments. Who is the son of Christ?
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he? "The son of David," they answered.
He said to them, "Why then does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." (Psalm 110:1)
How then can David call him Lord?
No one could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
Jesus judges the Pharisees and the scribes.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and his disciples.
"The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat," he said.
So you must obey them. Do everything they command you. But do not do as they do. For they do not practice what they preach.
They tie heavy loads and place them on people's shoulders. But they themselves do not want to move them with a finger.
Everything they do, they do to be seen by people. On their foreheads and arms they wear small boxes containing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the lapels of their coats very long.
They love to sit in the places of honor at feasts, and they also love to have the highest seats in the synagogues.
They love to be greeted in their markets. They love it when people call them "Lord."
But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
"You are not to be called 'teacher,' for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers and sisters."
The most important person among you will be your servant.
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, and you hinder those who are trying to enter.
(No
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are."
Oh, how good are you, blind guides, who say, "Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated to fulfill his oath."
You are blind and mentally deficient! What is more important? Is it gold? Or the temple that makes gold sacred?
You also say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift that is on it, he is bound by his oath.'
O blind one! What is greater? Is it the gift? Or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
So whoever swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it.
And whoever swears in the temple of God, swears by His name and by Him who dwells in it.
And he who swears by the sky, swears by the throne of Allah and He who is upon it.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.
You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and self-indulgence.
O you blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean.
This is you. From the outside, you seem to be doing the right thing. But inside, you're filled with what's wrong. You pretend to be what you're not.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you say, "If we had been alive in the time of those who came before us, we would not have done as they did, and we would not have killed the prophets."
"So that you may bear witness against yourselves that you are indeed the children of those who killed the prophets."
Complete the sins that those before you have started!
O ye who cherish venomous thoughts! How can you escape the punishment of Hell?
For I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and chase them from city to city.
So you will pay the price for all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the altar and the sanctuary.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. All of this will happen to those who are alive now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.
Look, your house is empty.
I say to you, you shall not see me until you say: 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' (Psalm 118:26)
End marks
Jesus came out of the tomb. His disciples followed him and wanted to draw his attention to the tomb's structures.
Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There his disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Be on your guard! Beware of false prophets.
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will deceive many.
You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. Do not be afraid. Those things must happen. But the end is not yet.
Nations will fight each other. Kingdoms will fight each other. The inhabitants will starve. There will be earthquakes in many places.
All these are the beginning of the birth pangs.
Then they will hand you over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.
At that time, many will turn away from their faith. Some will hate each other. Some will hand over their fellow believers to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise. They will corrupt many people.
Because of the evil, love will grow cold in most people.
But he who endures to the end will be saved.
This gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world. It will be a testimony to all nations. Then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of 'the abomination that desolates' (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). A time will come when you see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof should go down to their house to get anything.
No one in the field should go back to pick up their coat.
Oh, the fear of what those days will be like for pregnant women! Oh, the fear of what they will be like for nursing mothers!
Ask not to have to flee in winter or on Saturday.
There will be terrible suffering in those days. It will be worse than anything else since the beginning of the world until now. And there will be nothing like it again.
If time were not divided, no one would live, but because of God's chosen people, it will be divided.
At that time, someone will say to you, "Look! The Christ is here!" or "He is there!" Do not believe it.
False Christs and false prophets will arise. They will show great signs and wonders. They will try to deceive the chosen people of God, if possible.
See, I told you before.
If anyone tells you, "He is still in the wilderness," do not go out there. Or if anyone says, "He is in the house," do not believe him.
The lightning that flashes from the east is seen in the west, so will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Gulls will gather wherever there is a dead body.
Immediately after the terrible suffering of those days, "the sun will be darkened. The moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky. The heavenly bodies will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with great power and glory.
He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call. They will gather His elect from the four corners of the earth. They will bring them from one end of heaven to the other.
Take heed from the fig tree. When its branches become tender and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
In the same vein, when you see all those things happening, you know the end is near. It's just around the corner.
What I am telling you is the truth. The people who are living at that time will not die until all these things have happened.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. No one knows about that day or hour.
No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah, so will it be when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were getting married. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They were doing all those things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing about what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Two men will be in the field. One will be taken and the other left.
Two women will be grinding at the mill, one will be taken and the other left.
"So strive as in a race to attain forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden whose width is like the width of the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah and His messengers. That is the grace of Allah, which He bestows upon whom He wills. And Allah is the Possessor of immense grace."
You must understand something. Suppose the homeowner knew at what time of night the thief would come. Then he would have been on the lookout. He wouldn't have let his house be broken into.
Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Suppose a master puts one of his servants in charge of the other servants in his house. The servant's job is to provide them with food at the right time. The master wants a faithful and wise servant for this.
That would be good for the servant if the master found him working at his task when the master returned.
What I am telling you is the truth. The master will put that servant in charge of all he has.
But suppose this servant is wicked. Suppose he says to himself, 'My master is staying away a long time.'
So he begins by striking other servants. And he eats and drinks with those who drink heavily.
The master of that slave will come on a day when the slave is not expecting him, and he will return at an hour the slave does not know.
Then the master will cut it into pieces. He will send it to the place where the pretenders go. There people will weep and have their teeth pulled.
The Parable of the Ten Virgins
This is how the kingdom of heaven will be at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were foolish. Five were wise.
The foolish ones took their lamps but did not bring olive oil with them.
The wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. So all the bridesmaids fell asleep from exhaustion.
At midnight, someone shouted: "The bridegroom! Come out to meet him!"
Then all the bridesmaids woke up and trimmed their lamps.
The fools said to the wise: "Give us some of your oil, for our lamp is going out."
"No," they said. "There may not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves."
So they went to buy oil. But as they were going, the bridegroom arrived. The bridesmaids who were ready with him entered the wedding feast. Then the door was shut.
Then the other bridesmaids came too. "Sir! Sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
But he replied, "What I am about to tell you is true. I do not know you."
So wait; for you do not know the day or the hour when the bridegroom will come. Three servants - a parable.
Again, it is like a kingdom of heaven. A man was going on a journey, and he called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
He gave $10,000 to one. He gave $4,000 to another. And he gave $2,000 to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could handle. Then he set out on his journey.
The servant who received $10,000 went immediately and put his money to work. He gained another $10,000.
He who had $4,000 earned an additional $4,000.
But the man who received $2000 went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money there.
After a long time, the master of those servants returned. He wanted to gather all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 brought another $10,000. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I've made another $10,000."
His master said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!"
The man who had $4,000 also came. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $4,000. Look, I've made another $4,000."
His master said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!"
Then came the man who had received two thousand dollars. He said, "Sir, I knew you were a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed.
So I was afraid, and I went and hid your gold in the ground. Here is what is yours.
His master said, "You wicked and lazy servant! Did you not know that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter?"
Well, you should have deposited my money in the bank. If you had done that, I would have received it upon my return with interest.
Then his master commanded the other servants, 'Take the two thousand dollars from him and give it to the one who has twenty thousand dollars.'
To those who have, more will be given. They will have more than enough. But what about those who have nothing? Even what they have will be taken from them.
"Throw this worthless slave out into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." - Sheep and goats
Truly, the Son of Man is going to come in his full glory. And all the angels will be with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne.
All the nations will be gathered before him. He will separate the people into two groups, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on His right hand, 'Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.'
I was hungry, and you gave me food. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you invited me.
I needed clothes. You gave them to me. I was sick. You took care of me. I was in prison. You visited me.
Then the righteous will answer Him, saying: "Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink?"
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you? When did we see you lacking clothes and clothe you?
When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?
The King will say, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.'
Then he will say to those on his left, “Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.”
I was hungry, but you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty, but you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger, and you did not take me in. I was naked, and you did not clothe me. I was sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.
They will also say, "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and not feed you? When did we see you a stranger or naked and not clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and not visit you?"
He will say: "What I am telling you is the truth; whatever you did not do for one of these least ones, you did not do for me."
Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but those who have done good will receive eternal life.
Plan to kill Jesus
Jesus finished saying all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They plotted to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.
But not during the feast, they said. People might cause trouble. A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon, a leper, in Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume. She poured it on his head as he was reclining at the table.
When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. "Why this waste?" they asked.
Perfume can be sold at a high price. The money can be given to poor people.
Jesus was aware of this. So he said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good thing for me."
You will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.
I poured perfume over my body to prepare for burial.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. What I have done will be proclaimed in every place where this good news is preached throughout the world. It will be told in remembrance of her." Judas' agreement to hand over Jesus.
One of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
He asked, "What will you give me if I hand Jesus over to you?" So they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
This was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?"
He replied, "Go to the town to a certain man. Tell him, 'The teacher says, 'My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'"
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve.
And while they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me into the hands of my enemies."
The disciples became very sad. One by one, they began to say to him, "Not I, Lord, is it?"
Jesus said, "The one who dips his hand with me in the dish will betray me.
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. Woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.
Judas, who would betray him, asked, "Surely not me, Lord?" Jesus replied, "Yes, it is you."
And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "All of you drink from it."
This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
This is what I am telling you. From now on, I will not drink wine with you until the day I drink it with you in my Father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus says Peter will fall.
Jesus said to them, "This night all of you will fall away on account of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered' (Zechariah 13:7)."
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.
Peter answered, "All others may forsake you, but I never will."
"What I am telling you is the truth," Jesus answered. "This very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times that you know me."
But Peter said, "Even if I must die with you, I will never say I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same. Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
He took Peter and the sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
He went a little farther. Then he fell on his face and prayed, "Abba, Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Could you not watch with me for one hour?" he asked Peter.
"Draw near and pray. Then you will not fall into sin when tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
Jesus went away a second time and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned. Again, he found them sleeping. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. And a third time he prayed the same thing.
Then he returned to the disciples and found them sleeping. "Are you still sleeping?" he asked them. "The hour is near. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Rise! Let us go! Behold, he is at hand who will betray me to them. Jesus is arrested.
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. He was accompanied by a large mob armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was about to betray Jesus, had agreed with them on a signal. "The one I will kiss is he," he said. "Seize him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men stepped forward. They seized Jesus and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back into its sheath," Jesus said to him. "All who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He would instantly send an army of over 70,000 angels.
But how then will the scriptures be fulfilled? They say it must be so.
At that time Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I leading a bandit raid against you?" he asked, "Have you brought swords and clubs to arrest me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me."
But all this has happened that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left Jesus and fled. Jesus was taken to the Sanhedrin.
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
Not far from them, Peter followed Jesus. He went as far as the courtyard of the high priest, where he entered and sat with the guards to see the outcome.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus in order to put him to death.
But they found no evidence, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses stepped up.
They said, "This man claimed, 'I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Do you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Yes," Jesus answered, "it is as you say. But I tell you all, in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty. You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! We do not need any more witnesses. You have heard the blasphemy with your own ears."
"What do you think?" "He must die!" was their answer.
Then they spat in his face. They struck him with their hands. Others slapped him.
They said, "Tell us, Christ, who struck you?" Peter says he does not know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant came to him. "You were also with Jesus of Galilee," she said.
But before them all, Peter said that he was not. "I do not know what you are talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate that leads to the courtyard. There another woman saw him. She said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Then he said again that it was not so. He swore by the right hand, "I do not know the man!"
A little later, those who stood by came up to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them; your speech gives you away."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early morning. All the chief priests and the elders of the people decided to put Jesus to death.
They bound him and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned to death, felt remorse and sorrow for what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
"I have sinned," he said. "You have delivered an innocent man." "What good does that do?" they replied. "That's your problem."
So Judas threw the money into the temple and went away. Then he went and hanged himself.
The chief priests took the money. They said, "It is not lawful to put this money into the treasury, for it is blood money, the price of a man."
They decided to use the money to buy a pottery field. People from other countries will be buried there.
That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
Then were fulfilled the words of Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;
"They used the money to buy a potter's field, as the Lord commanded me" (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus was brought to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus answered.
But when the chief priests and elders brought charges against him, he did not answer.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear the accusation they bring against you?"
But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge. The governor was really pleased.
It was the governor's custom at the festival to release one prisoner whom the people had chosen.
At that time, they had a famous prisoner named Barabbas.
So when the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered before him, he asked them, "Which one do you want me to release to you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"
Pilate learned that the leaders were jealous. He knew that was the reason they had handed Jesus over to him.
Now when Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him this message, "Have nothing to do with that righteous Man; for last night I suffered greatly in a dream because of Him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
"Which of the two do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
So Pilate said, "What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere. In fact, the crowd was beginning to become restless. So he took water and washed his hands in front of them. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "You are responsible!"
Everyone answered, "We and our children will bear the guilt for his death."
Pilate released Barabbas. But he scourged Jesus. Then he handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus to the palace, which was called the Praetorium. All the other soldiers gathered around him.
They stripped him and put a purple robe on him.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!”
They spit on him. They hit him on the head with a stick repeatedly.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. Then they dressed him in his own clothes. Then they led him away to be crucified. Jesus was crucified.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon. They forced him to carry the cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha, which means the place of the skull.
There they mixed wine with bitter spices, and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They sat and watched him there.
Above his head they placed the written charge: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
Two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by shouted at Jesus, mocking him. They shook their heads.
He said, "So you are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
In the same way, the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders mocked him.
"He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
"Believe in God. May God deliver him now, if he really is His son."
In the same way, the robbers who were crucified with Jesus were mocking him. The death of Jesus.
From noon until three, the whole earth was covered in darkness.
Around the third hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who stood there, when they heard Jesus, said, "He is calling Elijah."
Immediately someone ran and got a sponge. They filled it with wine and mixed wine vinegar, put it on a reed, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Leave him alone. Why didn't Elijah come to save him?"
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook. The rocks split.
The graves were opened, and many of the righteous dead were raised to life.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had risen from the dead, they entered the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and those guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and all that had happened, were terrified. They cried out, "Certainly this was the Son of God!"
Not far away, many women were waiting. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for him.
Mary Magdalene was among them. And Mary the mother of James and Joseph was also there. And the mother of the sons of Zebedee. Jesus is buried.
As evening approached, a rich man from Jericho named Joseph came along. He had become a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Yusuf took the body and wrapped it in a clean cotton cloth.
She placed it in his new tomb, which had been hewn out of the rock. He rolled a large stone across the entrance to the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The tomb guards.
The next day was the day after the day of preparation. And the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
"Sir," they said, "we remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
They are to guard the tomb until the third day, otherwise his disciples may go there and steal the body, and then claim to people that he has been raised from the dead. This last lie would be worse than the first one.
"Take a guard," said Pilate. "Go. Make the tomb secure as best you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting the guard.
Jesus rises from the dead.
The Sabbath was over. It was dawn on Sunday. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
There was a strong earthquake. An angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so frightened of him that they trembled and became like dead men.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid; I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
Not here! He has risen, just as he said he would! Come and see the place where he was lying.
Go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' That is what I have told you.
The women left the tomb quickly, frightened but filled with joy. They ran to tell the disciples.
Suddenly Jesus met them and said, "Greetings!" They came up to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me." The guards reported this to the chief priests.
And as the women were on their way, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they made a plan. They gave the soldiers a large amount of money.
They said to the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears this report, we'll please him. This will keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' final commands to his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some of them were doubtful.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago the prophet Isaiah wrote, "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
A voice proclaims in the wilderness: "Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight his paths" (Isaiah 40:3)
And John came, preaching in the wilderness and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." And he was preaching baptism for the remission of sins.
All the people from the countryside of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
This is what John the Baptist proclaimed: "After me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." The Tender Jesus and His Temptation.
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus was coming up out of the water. At that moment, he saw the heavens opening and the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice spoke to him from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
Jesus spent forty days in the wilderness, where he was tempted by the devil. The wild animals did not harm him. Angels attended to him. Jesus chooses his first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee. He proclaimed the good news of God.
"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the good news!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Come. Follow me, said Jesus. "I will make you fishers of men."
So they immediately left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further, and there he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat mending their nets.
Immediately he called them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him. Jesus drove out a demon.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, he went into the synagogue and began to teach.
The people were amazed at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.
At that moment, a man cried out in their temple. He was under the control of an evil spirit. He said,
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—you are the Holy One of God!
"Be silent!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit convulsed the man violently, and after throwing him into convulsions, left him exhausted.
All the people were amazed, so they asked one another, "What is this? A new teaching! And with great authority! He even commands unclean spirits, and they obey him."
News about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. Immediately they went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother was lying in bed. She had a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her, took her hand, and helped her up. Her fever was gone, and she began to serve them.
That evening, after sunset, they brought to Jesus all who were sick and all who were possessed by demons.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them, suffering from various diseases. He cast out many demons, but he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a solitary place.
It was very early in the morning, and darkness still covered everything. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where He could be alone. He prayed there.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted: "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus said, "Let us go somewhere else. I want to go to the nearby towns, because I must preach there also. For this purpose I have come."
So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. Jesus healed a man with leprosy.
A man with leprosy came to Jesus. Kneeling down, he asked Jesus, "If you choose, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep compassion. He reached out and touched the man. "I am willing to do it," he said. "Be clean."
Immediately the disease left his body. He was healed.
Jesus was sent immediately. And he pronounced a very severe warning.
"Don't tell anyone about this," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices prescribed by Moses. This will be a testimony to the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely, and to spread the news so widely that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He remained outside in deserted places, and people were coming to him from every quarter.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
A few days later, Jesus again entered Capernaum. When the people heard that he had returned home, they gathered to see him.
A large crowd gathered, leaving no room, not even outside the door. And Jesus preached the word to them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not get to Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, letting the man down, put him in front of Jesus.
Jesus saw their faith, and he said to the man, "Child, your sins are forgiven."
Some law teachers were sitting there. They were thinking,
Why is this man talking like this? He's saying something very evil! Only God can forgive sins!
Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that they were contemplating this in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Rise, take up your bed and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who couldn't walk.
"I tell you," he said, "rise. Take your pallet and go to your house."
The man got up and took his mat. Then he walked away, and everyone watched in amazement. All the people were astonished and praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus calls Levi.
Once again Jesus went out beside the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd followed him. He began to teach them.
As Jesus walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
After that, Jesus was eating dinner at Levi's house. There were many tax collectors and "sinners" eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that followed Jesus.
Some of the lawyers who were Pharisees were there. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and his group of tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus asks about fasting.
The disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples fast, but yours do not. Why not?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? They cannot fast as long as they have the bridegroom with them.
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People do not sew a patch of new cloth onto old clothes. If they did, the new piece would slip away from the old one. This would make the tear worse.
"People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wine will burst the skins. Then both the wine and the skins will be destroyed. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins." Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, Jesus was walking through the grainfields with his disciples. The disciples began to pick some of the heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. Why do your disciples do it?"
He replied, "Have you never read what David did? He and his men were hungry; they needed food.
That was when Abiathar was high priest. David went into the house of God and ate the hallowed bread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it. And he also gave some to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.
Healing on Saturday
Again Jesus entered the synagogue. There was a man there with a withered hand.
Some of the Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They watched him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man with the withered hand, "Stand up in front of everyone," he said.
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save a life or destroy one?" But they did not answer.
Jesus looked at them with anger. He was very angry because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored whole as the other.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, wanting to kill him. The crowds followed Jesus.
Jesus went with his disciples to the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd from Galilee followed him.
The people heard about all that Jesus was doing. And many came to him, from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, from beyond the Jordan, and from the region of Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. This would keep the people from crowding around him.
Jesus raised many people, so the sick came forward to touch him.
When the people who were possessed by evil spirits saw him, they fell down before him. And the spirits cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them to tell no one who he was. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up a mountain and called certain people to him, and they came.
He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach.
They will have authority to cast out demons.
So Jesus gave the twelve apostles. Simon was one of them. Jesus gave him the name Peter.
James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John were given the name Boanerges by Jesus. Boanerges means Sons of Thunder.
There were also Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests and said, "What will you give me if I hand him over to you?" They paid him thirty pieces of silver. From then on Judas watched for an
Jesus entered a house. The crowds gathered again. It was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about it. So they went to take charge of his affairs. They said, "He's out of his mind."
There were some teachers of the law. They came down from Jerusalem. They said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons!"
So Jesus called them and said to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?
If the kingdom fights itself, it cannot stand.
If the family is divided, it cannot stand.
