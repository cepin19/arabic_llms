ShapeAL Jesus' family
ALSO, this is the record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.

Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah is the father of Manasseh. Manasseh is the father of Amon. Amon is the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time when the Jews were taken captive to Babylon.
After this, the genealogy continues. Begat Kenaniah, who begat Shaltiiel. Shaltiiel begat Zerubbabel.
Zechariah was the father of Abijah. Abijah was the father of Eliakim. Eliakim was the father of Azor.
Azure was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Achimaath. Achimaath was the father of Aliud.
Elieud was the father of Eleazar. Eleazar was the father of Matthan. Matthan was the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Messiah. Jesus the Messiah was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Youssef, was a good man. He didn't want to make her feel ashamed in public. He is planning to divorce her amicably.
But while he was thinking about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
She will bear a son. You shall name him Jesus. This is because he will save his people from their sins.
All this happened so that what our Lord said would happen, could happen. He said it through the prophet,
The virgin will give birth to a son. She will name him Emmanuel, which means "God with us."
Joseph awoke. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary as his wife.
But he did not do so even after she had given birth to a son. And Joseph called his name Jesus.
Wise men visit Jesus.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened when Herod was king of Judea. After Jesus' birth, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Who is the child born to be king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was very angry. All the people of Jerusalem were also perturbed.
So Herod summoned the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judea," they said. "This is what the prophet wrote." He said,
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times."
Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
Let them go to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Get precise information about the child. As soon as you find him, give me a report. Then we will go and worship him too."
After the wise men heard the word from the king, they went on their way. The star they had seen in the east went before them. It stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by another road. The family of Jesus flees to Egypt.
Joseph had a dream. An angel of the Lord appeared to him in the dream. "Get up!" the angel said. "Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return. Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph arose. During the night, he departed for Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained there until the death of King Herod, to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I have called my son." (Hosea 11:1)
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. He became very angry. He issued orders concerning Bethlehem and the surrounding area. All boys two years old and under were to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
Therefore, the words of the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled, who said:
A voice was heard in Ramah, a voice of weeping and great mourning. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more. The return of Jesus' family to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who were trying to kill the child are dead."
So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.
But when he heard that Archelaus reigned in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he departed for the region of Galilee instead.
He lived in a city called Nazareth. Thus was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophets about Jesus: "He shall be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent from your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke, saying, "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John was wearing clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was gruel and wild honey.
People came out to meet him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from the region around the Jordan.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham even from these stones.
The trumpet is at the base of the trees. Every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down. You will throw it into the fire.
I baptize you with water, calling you to turn from your sins. But after me will come one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather his wheat into the barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire." Jesus was baptized.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?"
Then Jesus answered, "Let it be so for now. It is right for us to fulfill all righteousness. This is part of God's holy plan." And John agreed.
From the time Jesus sneezed, he rose from the water. At that moment, the individual named was opened. Jesus saw the Spirit of God descending upon him like a dove.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love. I am very pleased with him."
Isa Laboratory
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert. There, the devil tempted him.
After 40 days and 40 nights of fasting, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
Then Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
Therefore, if you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written: "He will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully. They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone." (Psalm 91:11-12)
Then Jesus answered and said to him, "It is also written, 'You shall not test the Lord your God.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
If you kneel before me and worship me, he said, I will grant you all that.
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil departed from Jesus. Angels came and ministered to him. Jesus began to preach.
John went to prison. When Jesus heard about it, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and made His home in Capernaum by the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
Therefore, what the prophet Isaiah said came to pass. He said,
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the non-Jewish people live! Land along the Mediterranean Sea! Territories east of the Jordan River!
"The people walking in darkness will see a great light. For those living in a land of deep darkness, a light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1,2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Come. Follow me, said Jesus. "I will make you fishers of men.
Immediately they cleared their windows and followed him.
Walking along, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called out to them.
Immediately, they left the child and her father and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus went throughout all the region of Galilee. There He taught in their synagogues. He preached the gospel of the kingdom of God. He healed every disease and every infirmity among the people.
The news spread throughout all the region of Syria. People brought to Him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases. Some were suffering intense agony, others were possessed by demons, some were convulsing, and others were paralyzed. Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, from the region known as the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Jericho. Others came from the region across the Jordan River.
Isa gives blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds. He went up a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he started teaching them. He said,
"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them."
He who grieves is fortunate. He will be consoled.
The blessed ones who have no pride. They are the ones who will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who are hungry and thirsty for righteousness, for they will be filled.
The deceased who show mercy. They are the ones who show mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for what is right. The kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
Blessed are you when people mock you and persecute you because of me. You are also blessed when they speak lies against you because of me.
Even though they were joyful and happy, their reward in Paradise is great. Similarly, people who were prophets long ago are also rewarded. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But what if salt loses its taste? How can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything. It will be thrown out. People will walk on it.
You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.
People don't give a lightbulb and put it under the plate. Instead, they put it on the base. Then it gives light to everyone in the house.
"Let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven." - Jesus gives the full meaning of the law.
"You do not think that I have come to abolish what is written in the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to abolish these things but to fulfill them."
What I will tell you is the truth. Heaven and earth will disappear before a small letter disappears from the Scripture. Not even the slightest stroke of a pen will disappear from the Scripture until everything is fulfilled.
"Not even the least important command will be broken. And you must not teach people to break them. If you do, you will be called the least important person in the Kingdom of Heaven. Instead, practice and teach these commands. You will be called important in the Kingdom of Heaven."
Here's what we tell you. You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will surely not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder.
I had heard what was said to those who were alive before. They were told, "Do not kill. (Exodus 20:13) Anyone who kills will be punished.
But this is what I tell you: Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Again, whoever says to his brother, 'Raka,' will be liable to the council. But whoever says, 'You fool,' will be liable to hellfire.
Suppose you are presenting an offering at the altar and you remember that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift at the altar and go first to be reconciled with your brother; then come and present your gift.
Don't be afraid of anyone who has a dispute with you and takes you to court. Settle matters quickly. Try to resolve the issue with them while you're still on good terms. If not, they might take you to court. The judge might refer you to a mediator. The mediator might refer you to an officer, and you could be sentenced and imprisoned.
What I'm going to tell you is the truth. You're not getting out until you pay the full fine! Bastards.
We've all heard it written: "Do not commit adultery" (Exodus 20:14)
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
If your right hand brings you sin, cut it off and throw it from you. Your hand is one part of your body; it is better to lose it than to have your whole body go into hell. Divorce.
"If a man divorces his wife, he must give her a written notice of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But this is what I say to you: Anyone who divorces his wife causes her to commit adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. A man may divorce his wife only if she has been unfaithful to him. Faithfully.
Once again, you have heard what was said long ago to your ancestors. It was said to them, 'Do not break the covenant that you made with the Lord. Keep the oath that you swore to him.'
But this is what I'm telling you. Never thirst for such a promise again. Don't thirst for the skies of paradise. This is God's throne.
Do not do it to the earth's sky. This is the throne of God's feet. Do not do it to the sky of Jerusalem. This is the city of the great King.
And don't swear by your head. You can't make even a single hair white or black.
Keep your yes a yes and your no a no. Anything beyond that is from the evil one. Be gentle with people.
I had heard it said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth' (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this is what we tell you. Do not fight against an evil person. "If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to him as well.
Suppose someone takes you to court to recover your shirt. Let him take his coat as well.
Suppose someone forces you to walk one mile. Walk two miles with him.
Give to him who asks of you. Do not refuse him who would borrow from you. Love your enemy.
I had heard it said, 'Love your neighbor. (Leviticus 19:18) Hate your enemy.
But that's what we're telling you. Love your enemy. Pray for those who harm you.
"So you must be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect. He makes his sun rise on both the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust."
If you love those who love you, what will you gain? Even tax collectors do that.
If you only greet your own people, what more are you doing than others? Even wicked people do that.
Be perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect.
Giving to those in need
Be careful not to do acts of righteousness in front of people. Don't do them to show off. If you do them this way, your Father in heaven will not let you have your reward.
Where you give to the needy, do not blow a trumpet before you. Do not be like those who devise their charity in the synagogues and in the streets, to be seen by men. They have their reward in full.
Don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing when you give to those in need.
Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. Your Father sees in secret; he will judge what you have done. Prayer
They never read, they are not like those who deceive themselves into thinking they are holy. They love to stand and read in churches and on street corners. They love to be seen by people. What I am telling you is the truth. They have received their full reward.
"Wherever you are, go to your room. Lock the door and pray to your Father in secret. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret."
Don't speak much when you pray, for this is something people who don't believe do. They think He will hear them because they speak a lot.
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need even before you ask him.
"Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Come, O King. Let what you will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.
Give us our daily bread today.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us.
Deliver us from evil.
Forgive people when they sin against you. If you do that, your Father in heaven will forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses. Matthew 6:15 (ESV)
"When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others that they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full."
But when you go without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
Then people won't know that you are fasting. Only your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will know. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret. Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where mice and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Beware, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
Your heart is where your treasures are.
The eye is like a lantern for the body. Let your eyes be lamps. Thus your whole body will be filled with light.
But imagine if your eyes were defective. Then your whole body would be filled with darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. They will either hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
We tell you, do not worry. Do not worry about your life, what you eat or drink, or what you wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds in the sky. They don't sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren't you much more valuable than they?
Can't you add one hour to your life by worrying?
Why worry about clothes? Look at how the wildflowers grow. They don't work or wear clothes.
But that is what I am saying to you. Not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these flowers.
If God clothes the wild grass so beautifully, will He not clothe you even better? The wild grass is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire. You have so little faith!
No problem. Don't say, "What are we going to eat?" or "What are we going to drink?" or "What are we going to wear?"
Many people without a religion follow all this. Your Father in heaven knows you need it.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
No problem for tomorrow. Tomorrow will carry its own worries. Each day has its own problems.
Be fair when you judge people.
Don't judge people. When you stop judging, you will be judged no more.
We judge you by the same standard by which you judge others. We measure you by the same measure by which you measure others.
You notice a speck of dust in your friend's eye, but you don't notice the plank in your own eye.
How do you tell your friend, 'Let me get a splinter out of your eye'? How do you say this when there's a piece of wood in your eye?
You hypocrite! First, remove the wooden beam from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
He asked, and here you are being delayed. Look, and here you find it. Knock, and here they open the door for you.
Everyone who asks will receive. He who seeks will find. The door will be opened to him who knocks.
Suppose your son asks for bread. Who among you would give him a stone?
"Or would you ask a fish, 'Who among you will give him a live one?'"
Even if you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
In all things, do to others what you would want them to do to you. This is what is written in the Law and the Prophets. The great gate and the small gate.
Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction and hell. Many are those who walk on this path.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life. Few people find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
"We can tell what they are by what they do. Do people pick grapes from thorns or figs from thistles?"
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit. And a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can tell a tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'
"From now on, I'll tell them plainly: 'I didn't know you. Get away from me, you are the ones who do evil!' The wise builders and the fools."
"But whoever hears my words and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
The rain falls. The water rises. The winds blow and beat against that house. But it does not fall. It is built on the rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
The rain is falling. The water is rising. The winds are blowing and striking that house. And it collapses with a loud crash.
Jesus finished speaking all these things. The crowds were amazed at his teaching.
He spoke as if he had authority. He didn't speak like the Sharia professors.
Jesus heals a man with leprosy.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man who was suffering from a skin disease came and knelt down before Jesus, saying, "Lord, if you choose to make me clean, you can do so."
Jesus reached out and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do it." "Be clean." Immediately the man was cured of his disease.
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." A Roman officer with faith.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and asked for help.
"My Lord," he said, "My servant is confined to his bed and cannot move. He is enduring great suffering."
Jesus said, "This I will do and heal them."
The commander answered, "Sir, I am not worthy for you to come to my house. But speak a word, and my servant will be healed.
I myself am a man in authority. I have soldiers who obey my commands. I say to this one, "Go," and he goes. I say to another, "Come," and he comes. I say to my servant, "Do this," and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who were following him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.
We tell you that many will come from east and west and take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
But those who think they are coming from the kingdom will be driven out into the darkness. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman officer, "Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would." And his servant was healed at that very hour. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to wait on him.
When evening came, many who were under the power of the devil were brought to Jesus. He drove out the spirits with a word, and healed all the sick.
He did this to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had spoken: "He took our infirmities and bore our diseases" (Isaiah 53:4). Following Jesus demands sacrifice.
Jesus saw the crowd around him, so he gave orders to his disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then a scribe came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Then Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
Another student said to him, "Sir, first give me my father's inheritance."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into the boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly a fierce storm came upon the lake. The waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The students went and got him. They said, "Sir! We're done! We're going to drown!"
He said, "Your faith is very small! Why are you afraid?" Then Jesus got up and commanded the winds and the waves to stop. It became completely calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!" Jesus healed two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived at the other side of the lake in the region of Gadara. He encountered two men possessed by demons, who came out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass by.
"Son of God, what do you want from us?" they asked. "I have come here because it is time for us to be tormented?"
Not far away, large herds of pigs were eating.
The demons asked Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go," and the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
Those who were raising pigs fled. They entered the city and told everything. They told the people what would happen to the men who were being controlled by the jinn.
Then a whole city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
Jesus got into a boat, sailed to the other side of the lake, and came to his hometown.
A few men brought him a paralytic man lying on a mat. He was sitting on a couch. Jesus saw that they had faith. So he said to the man, "Do not be afraid, my child. Your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the lawyers said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said, "Why do you have such evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Which is better to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or should we say "Stand up and sit down"?
"We want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the man who was paralyzed, "Get up, take your mat, and go home."
A man stood up and walked to his house.
When the audience saw the gift, they were filled with wonder. They praised God for giving such power to men at that hour. Jesus chooses when.
As Jesus passed by, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him. And Matthew got up and followed him.
And after that, Jesus was eating dinner at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and His disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard that. He said, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick."
Go and learn what this means, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to follow me." Jesus was asked about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came and said to Jesus, "We and the Pharisees fast. Why do your disciples not fast?"
Then Jesus said to them, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
People don't sew a new tarboosh onto old clothes. The new will pull away from the old. That will only aggravate the wounds.
People don't pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wineskins will burst. The wine will run out, and the old wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins. That way, everything is safe. A dead daughter and a wounded woman.
And behold, a ruler came and worshiped him, saying, "My daughter has just died. Come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Then Jesus rose and went along with him. So did his disciples.
At that moment, a woman came up to Jesus from behind and touched the edge of his garment, for she had been suffering from a discharge of blood for twelve years.
She said to herself, "All I have to do is touch his garment, and I will be healed."
When Jesus turned and saw her, he said, "Daughter, your faith is great. Do not lose hope." And instantly, the woman was healed.
When Jesus entered the house of the Lord, he saw those who played the flute there. And he saw the great multitude that beat the drums.
He said, "Go away. The girl is not dead. She's sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd was driven out, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
The news about what Jesus did spread throughout the whole region. Jesus healed two blind men.
As Jesus was leaving, two blind men followed him, shouting, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus came to the region of the Jordan, two blind men followed him. He asked them, "What do you want me to do for you?" "Lord," they answered, "we want to see."
Then he touched their eyes. He said, "May it be easy for you, as you have believed."
They kept watching again. Jesus gave them a strong warning: "Make sure no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it everywhere in that region.
And as they were coming out, another man who was possessed by a demon was brought to Jesus. The demon had made him unable to speak.
When the devil was cast out, the man spoke. The crowd was amazed. They said, "We have never seen anything like this in Israel."
But the Persians said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of demons." And others said, "He casts out demons by a little help."
Jesus went through all the towns and villages. He taught in their synagogues, proclaimed the good news of the kingdom, and healed every disease and illness.
When he saw the masses, he felt a deep anxiety within them. They were content and miserable, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
Ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers into his harvest field.
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him. He gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. First, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
After that come Philip and Bartholomew, and also Thomas and Matthew. James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus are also coming.
The last two are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas will be the one to hand Jesus over to his enemies later.
Jesus sent out these twelve with the following instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles, and do not enter any town of the Samaritans.
Choose instead of that, go to the people of Israel. They are like sheep that have been scattered.
As you go, preach this message: 'The kingdom of heaven is near.'
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse those who have leprosy. Drive out demons. You received without paying, give without being paid.
Do not take gold or silver or copper in your belt.
Don't take a bag for the trip. Don't take extra clothes, pants, or a cane. The worker will be provided with what he needs.
When you enter a country or a village, look for someone who can read to you. Stay in this person's house until you leave.
As you enter the house, greet those who live in it.
If they welcome you into their home, greet them with peace. Otherwise, do not greet them with peace.
People may welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave their house or country.
What I will tell you is the truth. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
Fear! Men are leading you to the local courts. They are flogging you in their churches.
You will judge kings and princes because of me. You will be witnesses for them and for those who are not Jewish.
But when they arrest you, don't worry about what you're going to say or how you're going to say it. At that time, the right words will be put in your mouth.
It is not you who will speak. It is your father's spirit that will speak through you.
Brothers handing over brothers to be killed. Fathers handing over their sons. Sons rising up against their fathers and killing them.
Everyone will love you because of me. But the one who lasts will be the winner.
Where people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I'm going to tell you is the truth. Do not go to the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.
A student does not surpass his teacher. A servant does not surpass his master.
It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and enough for the servant to be like his master. If the master of the house is called Beelzebul, what will they call those who live in his house?
It's not a problem to fear your enemy. Everything hidden will come to the surface. Everything hidden will be revealed.
What's said in the house, say it in the daytime. What's whispered in the ear, shout it from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Do you think you can fool two pigeons with one stone? Not one of them will fall to the ground without your father knowing.
He even counts every hair on your head!
Don't be afraid. You're more important than many people.
What shall I say to those who declare in the presence of men that they know me? I will also declare in the presence of my Father in heaven that I know him.
But who among you will stand before people and say, 'I don't know him'? I don't even know my Father in heaven.
Don't think I came to bring peace to the earth. I didn't come to bring peace. I came to bring a sword.
"Sons will rise against their fathers. Daughters will refuse to obey their mothers. Daughters-in-law will be against their husbands' mothers.
A man's enemies are the members of his own household. (Micah 7:6)
Whoever loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
"And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
"For whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."
One who greets you greets me. And one who greets me greets the one who sent me.
Assume that someone welcomes a prophet as a prophet. That person will receive the reward of the prophet. And assume that someone welcomes a divine person as a divine person. That person will receive the reward of the divine person.
Suppose someone were to give even a cup of cold water to one of my followers. I tell you the truth, they will certainly be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus had finished teaching his twelve disciples. Then he went to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?"
Jesus answered, "Go back to John. Tell him what you hear and see.
Blind people see. Lame people walk. Those with skin diseases are cleansed. Deaf people hear. Dead people rise to life. And the good news is preached to the poor.
"Blessed are those who do not forsake their religion because of me."
As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
"But didn't you go out to see? A man in a fine suit? No, the people in fine suits are in the palaces of kings."
"Where did you see that? A prophet? Yes, I said a prophet, and more than one."
That's what is written in the Holy Book. It says: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you" (Malachi 3:1).
What I'm going to tell you is the truth. No one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born. But the least person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power, and the violent take it by force.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you're ready to accept him, John is Elijah who was supposed to come.
He who has ears, let him hear.
Who do we borrow from the people of today? They are like children sitting in the ditches and telling others. They say,
We played the flute for you, but you didn't dance. We sang a lament, but you didn't mourn.
Wherever John went, he neither ate nor drank as you do. And the people said, 'He has a demon.'
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they said, "Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and 'sinners.' Those who act wisely prove that wisdom is right." Cities that do not turn away from sin.
Jesus began to speak against the cities where he had performed many miracles. The people there had not repented of their sins. So he said,
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
"What have you to do with me, Capernaum? Will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will go down to the place of the dead. For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today."
"But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you." "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."
At that time Jesus said, "Yes, Father, I praise you; you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children."
Yes, Dad. This is something old.
My father gave me everything. The father is the only one who knows the son. And the only ones who know the father are the son and the son who chooses to redeem them.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Be my servants and learn from me. I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
My service is easy, and my burden is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, Jesus went through the grainfields. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
Then Jesus answered, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his men were hungry?"
So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the sacred bread, which was only allowed to be eaten by the priests.
Don't you read the law? It says that every Sabbath the priests in the temple must serve on that day. Yet they are not guilty.
We're telling you that what's more important than the temple is here.
The Bible says, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) You don't know the meaning of those words. If you did, you wouldn't judge those who are innocent.
The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
Walking away, Jesus entered their synagogue.
A man with a withered and paralyzed hand was there. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They asked, "Does the law permit healing on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
A man is more important than sheep! This law allows us to do good on Saturday.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and it was restored, just as new, like the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.
Jesus knew all the plans of the Pharisees. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to tell anyone who he was.
That's how what the prophet Isaiah said would happen is coming true. He said,
Here is my servant. I have chosen him. He is the one I love. I am very comfortable with him. I will place my spirit upon him. He will proclaim to the peoples that everything will be alright.
He won't argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
He won't break a broken stick. He won't extinguish a flickering flame. He will fix everything.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Belshazzar
A man possessed by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Afterward, the man was able to speak and see.
All the people were amazed and asked, "Is this not the son of David?"
The Pharisees heard this and said, "This man drives out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
When Jesus knew their thoughts, he said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand."
If the devil casts out devils, he is fighting against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by whose power do your people cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.
But when I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Don't you think about this? How can you enter the house of a strong man and take his kingdom without stopping him? You must first bind him. Then you can plunder his house.
He who is not with me is against me. He who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them.
Here is something for you. Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either now or in the days to come."
A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
You are a nest of vicious vipers! How can those who are evil say anything good? Your mouths reveal what is in your hearts.
A good man speaks good things. This comes from the goodness within him. A wicked man speaks wicked things. This comes from the evil within him.
But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.
"By your words you control or do not control." "The Sign of Jonah"
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, "Teacher, we want to see a miracle from you."
He said, "The evil and treacherous people ask for a sign. But they will only be given the sign of Jonah the prophet."
Greece was in the belly of a huge fish for three days and three nights. Something like that will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the tomb.
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with the people who live now, and will prove them guilty. She came from far away to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And now, one greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man? It wanders through the dry lands, seeking a place to rest. But it finds none.
Then he says, 'I will return to the house I left.' When he gets there, he finds the house empty. The house has been cleaned and put in order.
Then the spirit of evil goes and takes with it seven other spirits more evil than itself. They enter and dwell there. This man will be worse off than before. This is what will happen to the evil people of today." Mother of Isa and her brothers
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
A voice said to him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you."
Then Jesus answered and said to him, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus gestured to his students. He said, "This is my mother! These are my brothers!
Ali works for what my father wanted in heaven, whether it's his friend, sister, or mother.
The Farmer's Tale
On the same day, Jesus left the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
Large crowds gathered around him. He entered a boat and sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
Then he said many things to them in parables, saying, "A farmer went out to sow his seed.
He scattered the seeds on the ground. Some of them fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rises, the plants are scorched. They wither because they have no roots.
A seed of evil remained in the thorn. The thorn grew and constricted the plant.
And the rest of the seeds fell on good soil. They produced a crop 100, 60, or 30 times more than was planted.
He who has ears, let him hear.
The students came to him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
He said, "To you it has been given to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been granted."
Anyone who has knowledge of this kind will be given more. Indeed, they will have plenty. If anyone does not have knowledge of this kind, even the little they have will be taken from them.
That's why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They wait, but they don't really see. They hear, but they don't really listen or understand.
In them are fulfilled the words of the prophet Isaiah, who said, "You will indeed hear, but you will not understand. With your eyes you will see, but not perceive."
"The hearts of these people have become callous. They do not listen with their ears. They close their eyes. Otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn to the Lord, and he would heal them." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
But congratulations to your eyes for seeing. And congratulations to your ears for hearing.
What I will tell you is the truth. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see. But they didn't see it. They wanted to hear what you hear. But they didn't hear it.
Listen! Here is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People heard the message about the kingdom but did not understand it. Then the evil one came and stole what had been sown in their hearts. These people are like seed sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are the ones who heard the message and immediately received it with joy.
But they have no roots. They will wither away at the first sign of trouble or persecution because of the message.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. They are the ones who heard the message. But then their worries in life and the false promises of wealth choked it. They prevented it from bearing fruit.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. They heard the message and understood it. They produced a crop 100, 60, or 30 times more than what the farmer planted. - The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowd another parable. "It is like the kingdom of heaven," he said, "A man sowed good seed in his field.
But when everyone was sleeping, the enemy came. The enemy sowed weeds among the wheat and left.
Wheat began to spread and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The money's owner came to him. They said, 'Sir, didn't you visit Zain's love in your place? How did the thorns come?'
"He did this," he said. The servants asked, "Shall we go and uproot the nevash?"
"No," said the owner. "My role is to bring cannabis, I might bring wheat with it.
Let them grow together until the time of harvest. At that time, I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: "First, gather the weeds. Tie them in bundles to be burned. Then, gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn." — Stories of the Mustard Seed and Yeast
Jesus told the crowd another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A person took the seed and planted it in a field.
It is the smallest of all your seeds, but when it grows up, it becomes the largest of all the plants in the garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and nest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast," he said. "A woman mixed it into a large amount of flour. The yeast worked its way through all the dough."
Isa spoke those words to the entire audience with stories. He didn't speak to them without telling a story.
For the word of the prophet became a reality. He said, "Here I open my mouth and tell stories. I will speak of things hidden since the creation of the world" (Psalm 78:2). Jesus explains the parable of the weeds.
After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He said, "It is the Son of Man who sows the good seed.
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of time. And the workers are the angels.
Nuclei are attracted and burned in the fire. That's how they will be on the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove from his kingdom everything that causes sin and all those who do evil.
They will throw them into the burning furnace, where people will wail and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Those who have ears must listen. Stories of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. He was very happy. So he went and sold everything he had and bought that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of a fine pearl.
One found a pearl of great value. He went and sold all he had and bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea. It gathered every kind of fish.
Wherever they filled, the fishermen pulled them to the shore. Then they sat and distributed the fish to the families. But they threw away the bad fish.
This is the Day of Judgment. The angels are coming. They will separate those who did good from those who did evil.
The wicked will be thrown into the blazing furnace, where they will weep and gnash their teeth.
"Did you understand all that?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure both new things and old." A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home.
Isa finished those stories. Then he left.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? Where did he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
Isn't he the son of the blacksmith? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? Then where did he get all these men from?
They never liked him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home."
He only performed a few miracles there because they had no faith.
John the Baptist's head severed
In those days Herod the tetrarch heard the report about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod had arrested John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was the wife of Herod's brother Philip.
Jonas said to Herod, "It is not just in the sight of God for you to possess her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he was afraid of the people, because they considered John a prophet.
At Herod's birthday feast, Herodias' daughter danced for Herod and his guests. Herod was delighted.
He promised her with his right hand that he would give her whatever she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very annoyed. However, he thought about his promise and his dinner guests. So he told one of his men to fulfill her requests.
Herod cut off John's head in prison.
They placed the food on large plates and handed them to the girl. Then they placed it in her mother's hand.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Afterward they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a quiet place. The crowds heard about this. They followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus came to the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep compassion for them. He healed their sick.
As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Then Jesus said, "They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat."
"We have five loaves of bread and two fish," they said.
Let them come here to me, he said.
Then Jesus commanded the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples of Jesus gathered twelve baskets of the remaining fragments.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. The women and children all ate. Jesus walked on water.
Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd.
After sending them away, he went to a mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was alone.
The boat was already far from the shore. They were rowing against the current because the wind was blowing against them.
Early in the morning, Jesus went out to his disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and got very scared. "He's like a ghost," they said. And they were terrified.
Immediately Jesus called out to them: "Take heart! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Lord, are you?" Peter asked. "If you are, tell me to come to you on the water."
"Come," Jesus said. So Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!"
Immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him. "O you of little faith," He said, "why did you doubt?"
When they embarked on the sea, the wind died down.
After that, Abudu Isa lived in the boat. They said, "You are truly the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and landed at Gennesaret.
The men who lived there had known Jesus. So they sent a message to all the surrounding countryside. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
People ask him to allow the sick to touch the hem of his garment, and all who touched him were healed.
What kind of people are "najis"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,
Why don't your students listen to what the elders say? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Then Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey God's command? Do you prefer to follow your own teachings?"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said, "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20αντίαντίαντίαν
But you allow people to tell their parents, 'Any help you may have received from us is a gift dedicated to God.'
They don't need to honor their parents with the gift. You make God's word worthless to follow your teachings.
O hypocrites! Jesus was right when he prophesied about you. He said,
These people honor me without saying it. But their hearts are far from me.
"Their revered teachers are a mere breath of wind. They only teach human laws." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus said to the crowd, "Listen and understand.
What goes into your mouth does not defile you; what comes out of your mouth is what defiles you.
Then the disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Then Jesus answered, "In my Father's house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you?
Leave them alone. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind person leads another blind person, they will both fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Don't you understand yet?" Jesus asked them.
Won't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it exits the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. So do theft, bearing false witness, and spreading lies about others.
These are the things that make you unclean. But eating without washing your hands does not make you unclean. "The faith of a woman from Cana."
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Sidon and Tyre.
A Canaanite woman, who lived near Sidon and Tyre, came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly."
Jesus said nothing. His disciples came to him. They asked, "Master, rebuke her, for she is following us shouting."
Then Jesus answered, "I am sent only to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep."
Then the woman fell on her knees before him. "Oh God! Help me!" she said.
He said: "It's not fair that we take our children's bread and give it to the dogs."
"Yes, sir," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus fed the four thousand.
Jesus went away from there. He walked beside the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain and sat down.
Large crowds came to him. He brought the blind, those who could not walk, the disabled, those who could not speak, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. Those who had no disability became whole. Those who could not walk were walking. Those who were blind could see. So the people praised God of Israel.
After that, Jesus called his disciples and said to them, "I have great compassion on this crowd. They have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they will collapse on the way home."
His disciples spoke to him: "We have nothing here," they said. "Where will we get enough bread for this great crowd?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they replied, "and a few small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit on the ground.
The seven took the loaves and the fish and gave thanks. Then they broke them and gave them to the disciples. And the disciples distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Afterwards, the disciples gathered seven baskets of the remaining fragments.
The number of men who ate was 4000. The women and children also ate.
After Jesus sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went towards Macedonia.
Jesus is asked for a miraculous sign.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to choose Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He said: "In the evening, you look at the sky. You say: 'There will be nice weather. The sky is red."
In the morning you say, 'Today will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy.' You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you are unable to understand the signs of what is happening now.
"A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of Jonah." Then he left them and went away. The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees
The students crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring bread.
"Be afraid," Jesus told them. "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students talked about this among themselves. They said, "Praise be to God, he says that because we didn't bring bread."
He understood what they were saying. At that moment, he told them, "Your faith is small! What are you talking about among yourselves rather than with me?"
I don't understand. Don't you remember the five loaves for five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered?
Don't you remember the seven loaves that fed the four thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets full of pieces you gathered?
How is it that you don't understand? I'm not talking about bread. But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
After understanding, the disciples realized that Jesus was not warning them about the leaven of bread, but rather about the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter declares that Jesus is the Messiah.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They said, "Some say John the Baptist. Others say Elijah. Still others say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
"And you? He asked. "Who do you think I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
This is what I say to you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus speaks about his upcoming death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples what would happen to him. He said to them, "I am going to Jerusalem, where I will be betrayed by one of you. There I will be handed over to the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers Hungary Hungary Hungary Hungary Hungary Hungary
Peter took Jesus by the side and began to rebuke him. "No, Lord!" he said. "This shall never happen to you!"
Then Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
If he wants to change his life, Hadi will lose it. But if he loses his life for me, Hadi will find it.
What good is it for a person to gain the whole world, and yet lose their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
The Son of Man is going to come in all his glory, accompanied by his angels. Then he will reward each one according to their deeds.
What I'm going to tell you is the truth. Some of you standing here will see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom before you die.
When Jesus changed in appearance.
After six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
There, before them, his appearance was transformed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became white as light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, let us make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And while Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him."
When the disciples heard this, they were very afraid. They fell face down on the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. "Get up," he said. "Don't be afraid."
Nor those who see none other than our Lord Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. On the way down, Jesus told them what to do. "Don't tell anyone what you saw," he said. "Wait until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
Students asked him, "Why did my religious teacher say Elijah must come first?"
Then Jesus replied, "Yes, Elijah will come and restore all things.
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him. They did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
After the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about Judas the betrayer, Jesus healed a boy who had a demon.
When they had come near the crowd, a man knelt before Jesus.
"My Lord," he said, "Have mercy on my son. He is fiercely agitated and suffers greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
I brought him your demands, but they couldn't cure him.
"You brood of vipers! How long shall I bear with you? How long shall I put up with you? Let the dead bury their own dead." (Jesus responded)
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"
He said, "Because your faith is so small. What I am telling you is the truth. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move Zh Zh Zh Zh Zh Zh Zh
(No
They came together to Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men."
"They are going to kill him. On the third day he will rise from the dead." Then the disciples were filled with deep sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. There, the tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, it is," he replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Who do the kings of the earth collect taxes and duties from? From their sons or from others?"
"It is not right," said Peter. Then Jesus told him, "It is not necessary for the children to pay."
But we don't want to joke with them. So go to the lake and leave your son for fishing. Take the first fish you find. Open its mouth. There you will find the eye you need exactly. Take it and give it to them on my account Farquhar Farquhar
