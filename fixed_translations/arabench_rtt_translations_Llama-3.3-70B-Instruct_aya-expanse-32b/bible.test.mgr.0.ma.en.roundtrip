Jesus called a little child to him and had the child stand among them.
Jesus said, "What I am telling you is the truth. You must change and become like a little child. If you do not, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

I was beaten by a small child just like that in my name.
But what if someone led one of these young believers to the wind? If he did that, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.

If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or foot than to be thrown into hell with two hands and two feet. In hell, the fire burns forever.
If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The parable of the lost sheep
Don't get angry with any of these children. That's what I'm telling you. Their angels in heaven can go at any time to find my father in heaven.
(No
What do you call it? A man has 100 sheep, and one of them runs away. Wouldn't he leave the 99 sheep in the mountains and go look for the one that ran away?
What I'm telling you is the truth. If he finds that sheep, he'll be happier with it than with 99 others that aren't there.
It's the same with your father in heaven. He doesn't want any of these little ones to be lost. Whenever someone sins against you
If your brother has a fault, go to him. Tell him what he has done wrong. Keep it between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won him over.
But why doesn't Noah listen to you? Take along one or two others. The book says, "By the testimony of two or three witnesses every word may be established" (Deuteronomy 19:15).
But why didn't Noah also listen to the witnesses? He told the community. And why didn't Noah also listen to the community? They didn't treat him like a brother. They treated him like a non-believer or a disbeliever.
I'll tell you the truth. What worries you on earth will worry you in heaven. What is revealed on earth will be revealed in heaven.
Again, here is what I want to tell you. If two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them." - The merciless servant.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.
The king of heaven, like a king, wanted to collect money from everyone who worshiped him.
As the king began to do so, they brought a man who owed him millions of dollars.
A man couldn't pay his debts. So his creditor issued an order. His leg, his wife, his children, and all he had were sold to pay off what he owed.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll pay everything back."
My lord felt sorry for him. He forgave him what he owed and let him go.
But then the servant left and found one of my servants who owed him a lot of dollars. He beat him and started choking him. "Give me my money back," he said.
The second servant fell to his knees. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll make it right."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
The servants saw what happened. They were very sad. They didn't tell their master everything that happened.
After that, the man called his servant. "Servant of the wicked one," he said. "I have forgiven all that you owed me because you prayed for me."
Why can't you be a better friend to him like I've been to you?
In anger, his master delivered him to the jailers. He will be tortured until he repays everything he owes.
It is he who will reach out to you, all of you, Heavenly Father, until you forgive your brothers and sisters from the heart.
Isa knows about divorce.
From that time on Jesus began to preach, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near." He left Galilee and went to the region of Judea across the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. Their lips are there.
There were two Frenchmen who came to test him. They asked: "Does God's law allow a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?"
"Have you not read that the Creator made them male and female from the beginning?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "This is the reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are still two, not one. In this matter, a man has no right to separate what God has joined.
They asked: "Why did Moses command a man to divorce his wife by giving her a written notice and then sending her away?"
"It's strange to me," Lisa said, "Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because you were hard-hearted. But that wasn't the original plan."
This is what I want to tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman is committing adultery. A man doesn't marry another woman unless his wife is no longer faithful to him.
The students said to him, "If that is the case between husband and wife, it is better not to marry."
"Strange answer," he replied, "Not everyone can accept the idea of celibacy. Only those who have received help in their lives to live without marriage can accept it.
Many men are unable to father children because they were born that way. Some people have even chosen to live that way. Others have chosen to live that way in order to serve the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept living that way, let them do so. Small children were brought to Jesus.
People brought their young children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the apostles told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them. For to such belongs the kingdom of heaven."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he went from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came up to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
How do you ask me what is good? Jesus replied, "No one is good except God alone. If you wish to enter the kingdom, obey the commandments."
"Which?" asked the man. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness.
'Honor your father and mother.' (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' (Leviticus 19:18)
"I've said all these slogans," the young man said. "Who's left for me to do?"
When Jesus said, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell everything you have. Give the money to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sad. He was very rich.
Dima Issa said to his students, "What I'm telling you is the truth. It is difficult for rich people to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."
The students woke up when they heard this, they were very confused. They asked, "Where will the money come from?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
He retorted, "We'll leave everything to you! What prize will we get?"
"This is what I want to tell you," Jesus said to them. "When everyone is seated, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then, those who follow me will sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left homes or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The king of heaven, like a human, has land. He went out early in the morning to hire people to work in his vineyard.
Before giving them their daily wages, he made them work in his vineyard.
Around 9 a.m., Tani went out. He saw some people standing in the market doing nothing.
He told them, "Those are my vines and I will give them their due."
They left. "He went out again at noon and at three, and took the same thing.
Around five in the evening, he went out and found some other guys sitting around. He asked them, "Why have you been sitting here all day long without doing anything?"
"Because they won't listen to us," they said. He told them, "Those ones go and join them in my vineyard."
And when the night came, the master of the vineyard said to the foreman, "Pay the workers and give them their wages. Begin with the last, and then go to the first."
The workers who came in around five o'clock were paid their regular daily wage.
I didn't go to them until they had already closed, I was hoping they would take more. But each one of them received their usual daily wage.
From the moment he arrived, they started envying him for his wealth.
These people who came later only worked for an hour, they said. They get paid the same as us. We did most of the work and were under the hot sun all day.
The owner has only one answer. He said, "My friend," "Let's arbitrate. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wages?"
Take your money and go. I want to give those who brought them to their last breath the same reward I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Didn't you feel like you betrayed me because you took them without asking?
"So the last will be first, and the first will be last. For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done." (This is a quote from Jesus, speaking about his upcoming death and return.)
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to talk with them.
"We are going up to Jerusalem," he said, "and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death
"They are doing this to him because he hasn't denied being the Messiah. People are mocking him, spitting on him, and striking him. They are nailing him to the cross. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks Jesus for a favor.
The mother of Zebedee's sons was there, with her sons. She went up to Jesus, knelt down, and asked him for something.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "I have been promised that one of my sons will sit at your right hand in your kingdom. I have been promised that the other will sit at your left."
"You do not know what you are asking," Jesus said to them. "Are you able to drink the cup I am about to drink?" "We are able," they answered.
Jesus said to them, "You will drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten disciples heard about this. They began to be indignant with the two brothers.
Jesus gathered them. He said, "Introduce me to the heads of state. They are the ones who rule over their people. Their top officials surround them.
Don't be like that. Instead, whoever among you wants to be great must be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.
Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom to set many people free. Two blind men regained their sight.
Jesus and his disciples left Jericho. A large crowd followed him.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by, and they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. He told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted at the top of their voices, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood up and called to them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked them.
"Sir," they said, "we want to see him."
Jesus gave them deep concern. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. When you reach it, you will find a donkey tied there, with a colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If someone tells you something, tell them that the Lord needs them. The homeowner will send them right away.
This is happening so that what was said in the video about the prophet is fulfilled. It says,
Say to the city of Zion, "See, your king comes to you, humble and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
The disciples went and did what Jesus told them to do.
They brought the donkey and the colt. They laid their cloaks on them. Then Jesus sat on the cloaks.
A large group left their blankets on the road. Others broke tree branches and left them on the road.
Some people went before him, and some followed after. All shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalms 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
And when Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole world was turned upside down. People asked, "Who is that?"
The crowds said, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus was driven out of the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area. He began to drive out all who were selling and buying there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and also the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you have made it a 'den of robbers.' (Jeremiah 7:11)"
People who were not discovered and who had no health came to Jesus in the temple. He healed them there.
The chief priests and the elders of the law saw the miracles he did. They also saw children in the temple court shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were indignant.
"How do you hear the children saying those things?" they asked. "Yes," replied Jesus. "Haven't you read in the Scriptures?" It says, "You have given them to be children who will praise you" (Psalm 8:2).
After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and came to the region of Bethsaida. As he was getting into the boat, a man called out to him, "Teacher, my son is lying at home paralyzed; could you help him?" Jesus said to him, "Bring him here." Then a man came to him, testing him, and said, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
In the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Lila. He was hungry.
He saw a lettuce tree by the side of the road. He walked up to it and found nothing growing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, "You will appear, by the grace of God." At that moment, the tree withered in an instant.
"Have the students realized this? They're in for a surprise. 'How did the pomegranate tree dry up so quickly?' they asked."
Jesus replied, "What I am telling you is the truth. You must believe and not doubt. Then you will do what was done to the fig tree. You will say to this mountain, 'Go and throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done.
"If he is pious, you will find what you want when you pray." Jesus' authority is questionable.
Jesus entered the temple courts. While he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Then Jesus answered, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where does this washing come from, O Hanna? Is it from her or from humans?" They spoke to each other about him. They said, "If we say it is from her, he will ask, 'Then why did we not believe her?'"
But what do we call "human"? Afraid of people. Everyone believes that what has passed was a prophet.
Then they said to Jesus, "We don't know." Jesus said to them, "By what authority then do I do these things? I will ask you one question, and if you tell Me the answer, I will tell you by what authority I do these things. The baptism of John, where did it come from? From heaven or from men?" The story of the two daughters.
What shall we call this thing? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."
"No, I'm not going," the boy replied. But then he changed his mind and went.
After the father left, his sons went to the other side. He told them the same thing. Their response was, "Yes, sir." But they didn't move.
Which of the two daughters did not do as her father wanted? They said to him, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God before you."
John came to show you the right way to live. And you didn't believe him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. I saw that. And even after that, you didn't turn from your sins and didn't believe him. The story of the tenants.
He heard another story. A man had a piece of land where he planted a vineyard. He built a wall around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a watchtower. He leased the vineyard to some farmers and then went away on a journey.
When the time of harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the vineyard. He said to his servants, "Gather my share of the fruit."
But the tenants seized his servants. They punched one of them. They killed another. They threw stones at the third to kill him.
Later, I sold the man other servants for rent. I sold more than I did in the first batch. The rent increased in the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them. He said, "They are going to respect my son."
But the shepherds saw the boys coming. They said to each other, "This is the one who will take all the property of the Lord. Come, let's kill him. Then everything will be ours."
They took him out of the ring. Then they killed him.
What's Malik going to do with the money from the rent when those tenants come?
"He will ruin these wicked people," they said. "Then he will lease the vineyard to other tenants. They will give him his share of the produce at the proper time."
Jesus said to them, "It is written, 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.' This was the Lord's doing; it is marvelous in our eyes." (Psalms 118:22,23)
That which I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear in the ear, preach on the housetops. For there is nothing hid, which shall not be made manifest; nor anything secret, that shall not be known and come to light.
Whatever falls on this stone will be broken to pieces. But the stone will strike whatever falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables. They knew He was speaking about them.
They sought a way to arrest him, but they feared the crowd. People believed that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Tale
Jesus told them more stories. He said,
This is what the Kingdom of Heaven is like. A king prepared a wedding feast for his son.
He invited his servants to dinner. He told them to come. But they refused.
Then he wanted to send his servants. He told them, "Tell those who are invited that I have prepared my feast. I have slaughtered the oxen and fattened the fowls. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding supper."
But people aren't just sitting around. One is going to his field. Another is going to his project.
The rest, take their servants. Treat them rudely and kill them afterward.
The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed the murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come.
Go to the road corners. Invite to dinner anyone you can find.
The servants went out into the streets. They gathered all the people they found, good and bad. They filled the wedding hall with invitations.
The king entered to greet the guests. He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding attire.
"Hey, my friend, how did you get in here without a wedding invitation?" The man couldn't find anything.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet. Take him outside and throw him into the darkness. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth."
Many are called, few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They plotted to entangle Jesus in his words.
"They took their followers with them. They took the Al-Haruriyyah with them. 'Teacher,' they said, 'we know that you are a man of tradition. You teach the path of God with sincerity. You don't take from anyone who says [something]. You don't take from anyone who does [something]. You are not impressed by anyone important."
Tell us, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their wicked plans. He said, "You hypocrites! Why are you trying to test me?"
Let me see the money that people work with to make the decision. He brought him a silver dirham.
He asked them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words are these?"
"Caesar," they said. And he replied, "Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, and unto God what is God's."
When they hear this, they will be amazed. That's right, they left him and went away. Marriage is like the raising of the dead.
That same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question, testing him. They did not believe that people rise from the dead.
"The teacher," they said, "This is what Moses told us. If a man dies without children, his brother must marry his wife. He must father children to carry on his brother's name.
We had seven brothers. The first one got married and passed away. He had no children, so he left his wife to his brother.
What happened to his second and third brothers also happened to his seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
Now that they're both dead, whose husband will he be? Both of theirs were married to her.
Jesus replied, "You are wrong, because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.
They will die without getting married. And their parents won't let them get married. They will be like angels in paradise.
What kind of people are they who don't get up (for prayer)? Haven't you read what the Lord has told you?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob" (Exodus 3:6). He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
And what did the group think of this? They really liked it. For the most important thing.
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus. Then the Pharisees gathered together.
One of them was a scholar of Islamic law. He tested Jesus with a question.
The teacher asked, "What is more important in the law?"
When Jesus was asked, " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' (Deuteronomy 6:5)"
This is the first and most important principle.
"Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
Everything written in the Sharia and the prophets is based on these two things. Who is the Messiah?
The Pharisees were assembled. Jesus asked them,
What do they say about the Messiah? Whose son is he? "The son of David," they say.
He said to them, "How then did David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
"Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet." (Psalm 110:1)
How could his son be David's, if David named him "Lord"?
No one came to answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any questions.
Jesus judges the Pharisees and the religious scholars.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his students.
"The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat," he said.
I'm not going to follow them. I won't do everything they say. Or do anything like what they do. They don't do what they say.
They tie heavy loads and place them on others' shoulders. But they themselves have no desire to move a single finger to lift them.
Everyone does whatever they can to be found by people. They wear small bags on their foreheads and around their necks, in which they put verses of the Quran. They make the bags very wide. And they make the slits in their caftans very long.
They like to read in the place of honor in the clinics. They also like to take the most important seats in the synagogue.
They are called "Kihouaw" and "Kihitou" in the valleys. They are called "Lord" by the people.
But you're not going to call him "Rabbi". You have one master, and you are all brothers.
"Do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, who is in heaven."
They don't call you "teacher." You have one teacher, and it's Christ.
The most important among you will be your servant.
He who raises his head will fall. He who falls will rise.
You blind guides, you Pharisees! You hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; you yourselves do not enter, nor do you let those who would enter go in.
(No
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.
"This will be a torment for you, you blind darlings! You say, 'It's nothing for one to swear by the mere mention of the temple, but when one swears by the gold of the temple, they are bound to fulfill the oath.'"
You are my uncle and stupid! What's more important? Is it gold? Or is it the structure that makes gold sacred?
You can also say, "If someone swears by the altar, it's nothing. But if they swear by the name of the gift that is on the altar, they must fulfill their oath."
Oh my finger! What's more important? This gift? Or this sacrifice that doesn't even compare to the gift?
"To whom God has made a promise, he has made it to him and to his descendants whose name is called upon the altar."
And whoever swears by the Temple, swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and Him who sits upon it.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.
You are like a blind guide! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.
How will it be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dishes, but inside you are full of greed. You only want to rest yourselves.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside will be clean also.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean.
That's the same with you. From the outside, it seems like you're doing the right thing. But inside, you're full of doubt. You're just going through the motions.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you say, 'If we had been in the days of those who lived before us, we would not have done what they did. We would not have been accomplices in the killing of the prophets.'
You were witnesses against yourselves. You admitted that you were the children of those who killed the prophets.
Let the sins that began before us continue!
You are the embodiment of toxic life! How will you escape hell?
I sent you prophets, wise men, and teachers. You will kill some of them. You will crucify some of them. Others you will scourge in your churches. You will chase them from city to city.
You will be accountable for the blood of all the righteous people who have been spilled on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah. It was between the temple and the altar that they killed him.
What I'm telling you is the truth. All of this is going to happen to those who are living now.
"Village! Village! You used to kill the prophets and throw stones to kill those who didn't sell you. I often wanted to gather my people. I wanted to be like a hen gathering her chicks under her wing. But you didn't listen to me!"
Look, your house is empty.
We tell you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord" (Psalms 118:26)
Signs of the End Times
Jesus came out of the temple. He was walking away when his disciples came up to him and pointed out the temple buildings.
"How do you see all that?" asked Jesus. "What I'm going to tell you is true. Not one stone will be left standing on another. Every stone will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There his disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus said, "Wake up! Be afraid that no one deceives you.
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will deceive many.
You will hear about wars. You will hear people talking about the wars to come. Don't be afraid. This has to happen. But the end is not here yet.
A nation will rise against a nation, a kingdom against a kingdom. People will be in anguish. There will be earthquakes in many places.
All this is the beginning of the newborn's pains.
After that, those people will hand you over to those who will harm you and kill you. All nations will hate you because of me.
At that time, they will take a long time to return to their religion. They will hate each other. They will deliver each other to their enemy.
Many false prophets will arise. They will deceive many people.
As the aggression increases, most people's love will cool down.
But whoever persists to the end will be saved.
This is the good news of the kingdom. It will be preached throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations. Then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination that causes desolation" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). The day will come when you see it standing in the holy place. The reader will understand this.
After that, those who remain in my efforts flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof is going down to their house to get anything.
No one in the field is going to go back and get their kite.
How bad off they are these days for those who forget! How bad off they are for those who breastfeed their children!
Pray you won't need to flee winter or Saturday.
There will be a terrible suffering on that day. There will be a shortage of everything from the beginning of the world until now. And there will be nothing like it again.
If we don't cut the period, no one will live. But because of God's chosen people, it will be shortened.
At that time, someone will say to you, "Look! Here is the Christ!" or, "There he is!" Do not believe it.
False Christians and false prophets will appear. They will perform great signs and wonders. They will try to deceive the people of God if possible.
See, I told you before.
If someone tells you "far in the desert," don't go there. And if they say "far in the house," don't believe it.
"A light will flash for me from the east, visible in the west. That will happen when the Son of Man comes."
Gulls gather wherever there is a dead body.
After those miserable days, "the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.
He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
Learn lessons from the lime tree. When its trunk becomes soft and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
In the same way, when you see all this happening, you know the end is near. It's at the door.
What I'm telling you is the truth. The people who lived in that time will remain until they understand all of this.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. No one knows the day or the hour.
I don't know when that day or hour will be. Not even the angels in heaven know, nor the Son, but only the Father.
It was the same in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people ate and drank. They married. They gave their daughters in marriage. They did all these things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing of what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. That's how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
Two men will be in the field. One will take it and the other will leave it.
Two women are going to make horns with their hands. One will be taken and one will remain.
Keep an eye on you. You never know what day the Lord will come.
Understand this. Imagine the homeowner knows exactly when the thief will come at night. He can stay alert. He can prevent the thief from breaking into his house.
You also shall be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
The master appointed one of his servants as the head over the rest of the servants in his house. The servant's job was to give them their food at the proper time. The master wanted an honest and wise servant for this task.
It will be good for the servant if the master finds him doing his job when he returns.
What I'm telling you is the truth. My master is going to leave this servant in charge of everything he has.
But it's a pity if the servant is bad. He thinks to himself, 'Our master will be absent for a long time.'
A bad person starts beating others. And a bad person eats and drinks with those who drink a lot.
Surely, Allah will bring Aboud a day he does not expect. He will return at an hour unknown to Aboud.
They will cut the man into pieces. They will send him to the land where imposters go. There, people will cry and gnash their teeth.
"A Tale of Ten Brides"
This is how the Kingdom of Heaven was like at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them are stupid. Five of them are sensible.
The fools took their lamp, but they didn't bring olive oil with them.
"Instead, take the oil in the jars for the lamps."
The groom hasn't come for a long time. So the servants have all left and gone.
At midnight the man cried out, "Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!
After all the brides got up and placed their lamps ready.
The fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil. Our lamp is going out."
"No," they said. "There might not be enough for all of us. Go to the oil sellers. They will buy for you."
They went to buy oil. While they were on their way, the groom arrived. The brides who were ready went in with him to the wedding dinner. Then they closed the door.
Afterwards, the rest of the companions came. They said, "My master! My master!" "Open the door for us!"
But he said, "I'm not going to tell you what's right. I don't know you."
Keep your eyes open. You have no idea which day or hour the groom will come. Three servants' story.
Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who was going on a journey. He called his servants and entrusted his possessions to them.
He gave $10,000 to one. He gave $4,000 to another. And he gave $2,000 to the third. The man gave each servant the amount of money he thought they could handle. And then he went on his way.
The servant who had saved $10,000 went into business and made money. He earned an additional $10,000.
He who has $4000 earns $4000 more.
But the man who had stolen $2000 went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid the money in it.
After a long time, the master of that gang returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who was given $10,000 brought another $10,000. He said, "Sir, you gave me $10,000. Look, I've made an extra $10,000."
My master said to me, "You have served well, a faithful and trustworthy slave! You were trustworthy in a few things. I will set you over much. Come and share in your master's joy."
The man who had $4000 came. He said, "Sir, you entrusted me with $4000. Look, I've made an additional $4000."
My master said to me, "You have served well, a faithful and trustworthy slave! You have been trustworthy in a few things. I will set you over much. Come and share in your master's joy!"
Then came the man who had received $2000. He said to him, "Sir, I know you are a harsh man. I reap where I did not sow. I gather crops where I did not plant seeds.
We were afraid. I went out and buried your 2000 dollars in the ground. Look, this is what I have against you.
Sir, "You are the servant of the foolish. Don't you know where I don't plant, I don't reap? Don't you know where I don't sow the seed, I don't gather the harvest?"
Stay alert, you should have taken my money to the bank. When I return, I'll get it with interest.
After my master ordered the other servants, "Take the $2000 from him. Give it to the one who has $20,000."
Everyone who has will be given more. They will have more than enough. And why don't those who don't have? Even those who have will have it taken away from them.
Get this useless servant out of here. Over there in the corner, people are going to cry and gnash their teeth. Sheep and goats.
The Son of Man is going to come in all his glory. All the angels will come with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne in the sky.
All the nations will be gathered before Him. He will separate people into two groups. He will be like the shepherd who separates the sheep from the goats.
He will make the sheep go to his right and the goats to his left.
"That's it, the king on his right will say to them: 'My father, he gave you the world. Give and take what is yours. This is the kingdom that he left for you since the beginning of time."
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in.
I was in need of kindness. And you gave it to me. I was sick. And you helped me. I was in prison. And you came to visit me.
After these people who did good, they will be answered. 'My Lord' will ask them, 'When did we see you hungry and give you food? When did we see you thirsty and give you drink?'
Did we see you as a stranger and accept you? Did we see you needing clothes and give them to you?
Did we see you sick or in prison and come to visit you?
The king will answer, "Whatever I tell you is true. Whatever you have done for one of these least brothers of mine, you have done for me."
Then he will say to those on his left, "You are accursed! Depart from me, you cursed ones, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels.
I was hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I was thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not invite me to your home. I was in need of clothes. But you did not give me anything. I was sick and in prison. But you did not take care of me.
They will answer, "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and not help you? When did we see you a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison and not help you?"
He will answer, "Whatever I tell you is true. Whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.
After that, they will go to be tormented forever. But those who did what is right will receive eternal life.
The plan to kill Jesus
Jesus finished all that he said. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
After that, he met with the chief priests and the elders of the people. They gathered at the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest.
God devised a plan to bring Jesus many truths, they were aware of the murder.
But not during the feast, they said. "The people may make trouble." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon, who had leprosy.
A man came to visit Issa with a closed jar of very expensive incense. The incense spilled over his head as he sat at the table.
When they saw the two of them together, they got angry. "What's this scandal?" they asked.
Goodness has been sold for a high price. Money can be given to poor people.
Jesus knew this. In this context, he told them, "Why are you afraid of this woman? I did a good thing."
You will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.
Anoint me with aromatic oils, a shroud upon my body for the burial.
This is what we will tell you is the truth. What she did will be proclaimed everywhere, and it will be preached throughout the world in her memory. "Judas agreed to hand over Jesus."
One of the thirteen went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He said, "Who will give me thirty pieces of silver if I hand over Jesus to you?" And so they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to the authorities. Evening came.
It was the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
He said, "Go to the city to a certain man. Tell him, 'The priest said, "My time is near. I will celebrate Passover in that house with my disciples."'
No, what the prophet did was what Jesus commanded them to do. Prepare the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was at the table with the twelve.
And as they were sitting, he said to them, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
The students became very sad. One by one, they started speaking to him, "Not me, sir, is it?"
Jesus said, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me.
The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of sinners, as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.
It was Judas who was going to betray him. He said, "Not me, Lord, is it?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
And while they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
After taking the cup, he thanked God and handed it to them. He said, "Everyone will have a turn with it."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
This is what I tell you. From now on, I don't want to drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my Father's kingdom.
After they sang a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said to Peter, "Today you will deny me three times."
Jesus said to them, "This very night, all of you will fall by the sword. For it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)
But after we rise from the dead, we will go to Galilee before you.
Peter replied, "Everyone else might leave for your sake. But I won't do it."
"I'm going to tell you something true," Jesus replied. "It's going to happen tonight. Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times that you don't know me."
Peter said, "I will die with you. Even if I have to deny you, I will not say I don't know you." All the disciples said the same thing. Jesus prayed in Gethsemane.
After Jesus took his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, he said to them, "Wait here until I go and pray."
Peter and the sons of Zebedee were with him. He began to be sorrowful and very troubled.
Tell them, "My spirit is very troubled. I see myself near death. Stay here. Fast with me."
He walked a little further. Then he fell face first to the ground. He prayed, "Father, if possible, take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet, not my will but yours be done."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Couldn't you keep watch with me for one hour?" asked Peter.
See and connect. Don't be tempted by sin when you are accountable. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Jesus went away again. He prayed and said, "Father, can this cup be taken away? But if it must be, let it be as you want."
He came back. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
He left them and walked away. For the third time, he did the same thing.
Then he returned to his disciples. He said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look! The hour is near. The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of sinners.
"Come on! Let's go! He's coming to hand me over to them!" Jesus accepted.
And while he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was going to betray Jesus, gave them a sign. "The one I will kiss is the man," he said. "Seize him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
"Strange, he answered, 'My friend, he did what I came for.' Then the men advanced. They took Issa and arrested him."
At that moment, one of Jesus' followers reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
"Leave the sword in its place," said Lysa. "Everyone who takes up the sword will perish by the sword.
What now? Can't we ask Dad for help? He'll send an army of more than 70,000 angels.
But how will the Bible be fulfilled? They say it has to happen that way.
At that time Jesus said to the crowd, "Would you have come out with swords and clubs to arrest me if I had not been teaching in public? Day after day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me.
But all this happened so that the words of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was arrested and taken to the Sanhedrin.
Those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas, the high priest. The scribes and the elders assembled there.
Not far away, Peter followed Jesus. He went to the high priest's courtyard. He went in and sat down with the guards to see what would happen.
The religious leaders and the Sanhedrin were all looking for a way to use it against Jesus. They wanted to kill him.
But they found no evidence, even though many false witnesses were present. Finally, two more witnesses came forward.
They said, "This man claims, 'I can destroy what is sacred to God. I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Will you answer nothing? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
Yes. It is as you say, Jesus replied. But I tell you all this: In the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty and coming on the clouds of heaven.
After the rabbi's words, the crowd grew silent. He said, "He said something very evil about God! Why do we need more witnesses? You all heard the evil thing he said."
"What are you doing?" "Don't let him die!" they said.
They hit him in the face. They strike him with their tails. Even the donkeys slap him.
They said, "Tell us, Christ, who was it that passed by you?" Peter said, "I do not know Jesus."
Peter was sitting in the crowd. A servant came to him. "You were with Jesus of Galilee," she said.
But before them all, Peter said, "I don't know what you are talking about."
Then he went out by the door leading to the house. There he saw him again. She said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He said, "No, it's not him." He swore, "I don't know the man!"
A little later, the people who had been following went up to Peter. "You aren't one of them, are you?" they said. "You talk like you are."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man!" And the rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early morning. All the chief priests and the elders of the people decided to put Jesus to death.
Tie him up and take him with you. Then take him to the governor's palace.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death and felt deep regret and shame for his actions. He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priest and the elders.
"It's not my fault," he said. "I didn't do anything wrong." "Then what should we do?" they asked. "That's your problem," he replied.
Judas betrayed Jesus for thirty pieces of silver, then hung himself.
The senior pastors raised the money. They said, "It's not right to put that money in the temple's fund. This is blood money. That money was paid for a man's death."
They decided to use the money to buy the pottery field. People from other countries will be buried here.
That's why they'll call it the Field of Blood from this day forward.
After the words of the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled, he said, "They gave me thirty pieces of silver as my wages, the price that the Israelites had agreed upon."
"I paid them the thirty pieces of silver, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus was brought to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" "It is as you say," Jesus replied.
But when the heads of the priests and elders asked him, he did not answer.
After Pilate asked: "Don't you listen to what they say about you?"
Jesus did not speak even a single word. The governor was very astonished.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people chose whom they wanted.
At that time, they had a famous prisoner named Barabbas.
"Which one do you want me to release to you," asked Pilate, "the Canadian, Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"
The chief priests were envious of Jesus' leadership. They knew that was the reason they took Jesus.
And Pilate's wife sent him a message while he was sitting on the judge's seat, saying, "Have nothing to do with that man, for I have suffered many things in a dream because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
Which of the two do you want me to release? asked the governor. Barabbas, they answered.
"What have you to do with Jesus of Nazareth?" asked Pilate. They all answered, "Crucify him!"
"What? What did he do?" asked Pilate. But they cried out all the more, "Crucify him!"
Belat saw that he wasn't going to get anywhere. The crowd started to get angry. In this context, he took water and washed his hands in front of them. "It's not me who's going to be responsible for this man's death," he said. "You are accountable for it!"
Everyone answered, "We and our children are innocent of his sin in his death."
Pilate released Barabbas, but he had Jesus flogged. Then he handed Jesus over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus to the palace, which was called the Praetorium. The rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They took his clothes and dressed him in purple robes.
After they had tortured him and sewn his wounds to make a crown, they placed it on his head. They put a reed in his right hand. Then they made their way before him, mocking him. "Honor him! What is this Jew?" they said.
They spat on him. They hit him on the head with the stick again and again.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They clothed him in his own garments again. Then they led him away to be crucified. Jesus was crucified on the cross.
As they led him out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon, and they forced him to carry Jesus' cross.
Java is named after a place called Golgotha. The word Golgotha means the place of the skull.
There were those who mixed wine with bitter spices and gave it to Jacob to drink. After he tasted it, he refused to drink it.
And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots.
They sat down and found him there.
Above his head they placed the written charge against him: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
Two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who went before him voted for Issa and mocked him. They shook their heads.
He said, "That one will destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him.
"It's all over now," they said. "But he couldn't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Why doesn't he come down from the cross now? Then we will believe in him."
He trusted in God. May God help him now if He wills. He is the one who said, "I am the son of God."
In the grammar itself are thieves. Those who were crucified with Jesus mocked him. Jesus dies.
From noon until three in the afternoon, the whole land was covered in darkness.
Around the third hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Psalm 22:1)
And some who were standing there heard Jesus crying out, "He is calling Elijah."
Immediately, one of them ran and brought a horn. He filled it with sour milk and placed it on a stick. He brought it near to Jesus to drink.
Those who remained said, "Let's get rid of him. See if Elijah will come and save him."
After Jesus cried out with a loud voice, he died.
At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split.
Graves were opened. Many bodies of the holy people who had died returned to life.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus was raised to life, they went to the holy city, where they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and those who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and everything that happened. They were very afraid. They said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
Not far away, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to serve him.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary the mother of James and Joseph was there too. As was the mother of Zebed's sons. Jesus is buried.
One night, a rich man from Arimathea came. His name was Joseph, and he was a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Yusuf took the body and wrapped it in pure cotton cloth.
He left it in a new tomb he had hewn out of the rock. He rolled a large stone in front of the entrance to the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The tomb guards.
The next day was the day after the day of preparation. They went to the chief priests and the Pharisees.
"My lord," they said, "We remembered something that that liar said while he was still alive. He said, 'After three days, I will be alive again.'"
"Make sure this is done: seal the tomb until the third day. If you don't, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that Jesus has been raised from the dead. This would be a worse lie than the first one."
"Take two guards with you," replied Belat. "Go, guard the tomb as best you can."
They went and secured the tomb. They placed a seal on the stone and posted guards on duty.
Jesus rises from the dead.
Saturday was over. Dawn was breaking on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
It was a powerful earthquake. The angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body was as bright as lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guard was so scared of him that they trembled and froze like dead men.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
He's gone! Just as he said he would! Come see the spot where he was sitting.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.
So the women hurried away from the tomb. They were afraid, yet filled with joy. They hurried to tell the disciples.
Suddenly, Jesus met them. "Peace be upon you," he said. They came to him, took hold of his hands and worshiped him.
Traitor why, go and tell my brothers to go to Gazala, they will find me there. The guards are looking for the high priest.
Contrary to what the women had expected, some of the servants entered the city. They told the muftis everything that had happened.
Wherever the heads of the priests met with the elders, they came up with a plan. They gave the soldiers outside a lot of money.
Tell the soldiers, "We think you should say, 'His students came at night. They stole his body while I was sleeping.'
If the governor hears this news, we're done for. That's going to get you into trouble.
The soldier took the money and did as he was ordered. This story has spread among the Jews to this day. The last commands of Jesus to his disciples.
After that, eleven disciples went to Galilee. They went to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
Wherever they saw him, they worshiped him. But they still had doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
I am going to go and work for the teachers from all nations. Wash them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
May they obey everything I have commanded you. And know that I am with you always, to the end of the age.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago the prophet Isaiah wrote, "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
"A voice cries out: 'In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.' " (Isaiah 40:3)
And John came. He baptized people in the desert. He also preached that they should be baptized and return to their sins. After that, God forgave them.
All the people from the Judean countryside went out to him. All the people from Jerusalem went out as well. When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wears robes made of camel hair. He has a leather belt around his waist. He eats locusts and wild honey.
"After me will come one who is mightier than I, so strong that I am not worthy even to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
"I will baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus was baptized and tested.
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus was coming up out of the water. Suddenly he saw the heavens opening, and he saw the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice spoke to him from heaven. It said, "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
Let the Holy Spirit lead me to Jesus in the desert.
He was in the desert for 40 days. There, the devil tempted him. Wild animals did not hurt Jesus. Angels tended to him. Jesus chose his first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee. He preached the good news of God.
"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the good news!"
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Come. Follow me, said Jesus. "I will make you fishers of men.
They were of pure intent, so they left her and followed him.
After Jesus had walked a little further, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat, mending their nets.
Immediately he called them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men. Then they followed Jesus. Jesus cast out the evil spirit.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, he went into the synagogue and began to teach.
People were surprised by his teaching. He taught them as if he had authority. He didn't speak like the religious teachers.
At that moment, a man in their midst cried out. He was under evil's control. He said,
What are you doing with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to burn us? I know you. You are the saint of God!
"Be quiet!" Jesus said firmly. "Get out of here!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it exited him with a loud noise.
Everyone was amazed. So they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching! And with great authority! He even commands evil spirits, and they obey him."
News about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. They went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's wife found her in the bed. She had a fever. They told Issa about her.
He went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. The drunkenness left her. Then she started serving them.
That night after the sun had set, people brought to Jesus all who were sick and possessed by demons.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They had all kinds of diseases. And he cast out many demons. But he did not give them permission to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus was praying in a solitary place.
It was very early in the morning, and darkness still covered everything. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. He prayed there.
Simon and his friends are walking to catch up with Jesus.
When they found him, they called him and said, "Everyone is asking for you."
"It's strange, I reply, 'Let's go to other countries. I want to go to nearby cities. I even want to live there. That's what I've been aiming for.'"
He traveled throughout all the regions of Galilee. He preached in their synagogues. He also cast out demons. Jesus healed a man who had leprosy.
A man who had a skin disease came to Jesus. On his knees he asked Jesus, "If you are willing to give me cleanliness, you can do it."
Jesus was filled with deep anxiety. He reached out and touched the man. "I am willing to do it," he said. "Be clean."
His illness immediately appeared. May God heal him.
Jesus let him go immediately. He gave him a strong warning.
"Don't tell anyone about this," he said. "Go and confess to the priest. Perform the rituals commanded by Moses. That will be a witness to the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to speak freely. He broadcast the news to everyone. So Jesus could no longer enter a city openly. He remained outside in isolated places. But people still came to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
Again, after a time, Jesus came to Capernaum. And it was noised that he was in the house.
The people were so numerous that there was no room for them. Not even outside the door. Jesus came and spoke to them in a word.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who couldn't walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after removing the tiles, they lowered the man on a stretcher.
Jesus saw their faith. So he said to the man, "My child, your sins are forgiven."
Some Sharia teachers were sitting there. They were thinking,
What's this man going to say? He's saying something good and evil! Only God can forgive sins!
Jesus immediately knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "I have forgiven your sins"? Or to say to him, "Rise, take your mat and walk"?
"He said to them, 'This is why you don't believe. For surely, the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.' Then Jesus spoke to the man who couldn't walk."
He said to me, "Get up. Take your mat and go home."
A man stood up and took his mat. Afterward, he passed by, and everyone saw him. Everyone was amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this before." Jesus chose Louis.
Once again Jesus went out beside the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.
He was sitting at the tax collector's booth. Levi saw Jesus passing by. "Follow me," Jesus said to him. Levi got up and followed him.
After that, Jesus was eating in the house of Levi. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large group that was following Jesus.
There were some teachers of the law who were Pharisees. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard that. In this context, he told them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus took up the fast.
The disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came to Jesus and asked him, "Why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, but yours do not?"
It's strange that two donkeys of the green donkeys aren't eating while he is with them? Since he is with them, they don't eat.
But the time will come when the groom will take them away. On that day, they will leave without eating.
People don't sew a new patch on old clothes. If they do this, the new patch will tear away from the old one. This will cause the garment to tear further.
"People don't put new wine in old skins. If they do, the new wine will burst the old skins. Then both the wine and the skins will be destroyed. No, they put new wine in new skins." Jesus is Lord of the
One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of wheat, rubbing them in their hands to eat the kernels.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! Why are your disciples doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"
He said, "What did I do to deserve this, David? You and your men were hungry. You needed bread."
It was at the time when Abiathar was high priest. David entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it. David also gave some to his men.
Dima Issa said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
"Therefore the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."
Healing on Saturday
Again Jesus entered the synagogue. There was a man there with a withered and paralyzed hand.
There were some Pharisees who were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man with the weak and crooked hand. "Stand up in front of everyone," he said to him.
After Jesus asked them, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save lives or destroy them?" No one answered.
Jesus looked around at them in anger. He was very angry because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored, as good as new.
After this, the Pharisees went out and began plotting with the Herodians. They were planning to kill Jesus. Large crowds followed Jesus.
Jesus went out to the region of Galilee with his disciples, and a large crowd from Galilee followed him.
People heard about everything Jesus had done, and they came to him in large numbers. They came from Judea, Jerusalem, and Idumaea. They came from the regions east of the Jordan River, and from the area around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Issa gave his students a small boat to use. That will keep people from crawling over him.
Jesus healed many people. Whoever was sick would pay anything to be touched by him.
And those who had evil spirits fell down before him, crying out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone who he was. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up a mountain. He called certain people to come to him, and they came.
He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, to be with him, and to send them out to preach.
They will have the authority to cast out demons.
Jesus appointed twelve apostles. Simon was one of them. Jesus gave him the name Peter.
James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John were given the name "Boanerges" by Jesus, which means "Sons of Thunder."
There were Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus. And there were Thaddeus and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was one of them too. He was the one who was going to hand Jesus over to his enemies later. Jesus and Beelzebub.
Jesus entered a house. Another crowd gathered. It was so large that Jesus and His disciples could not eat.
The D family heard about it. So they went to get him. They said, "He left his head there."
There were some teachers of the law who came from Jerusalem. They said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons."
"How can a devil cast out a devil?"
If the kingdom wages war against itself, it cannot stand.
If the family is divided, it cannot stand.
