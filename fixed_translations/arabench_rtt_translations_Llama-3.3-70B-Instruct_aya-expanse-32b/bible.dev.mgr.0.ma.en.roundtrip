After that, the family line is as follows: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zerrubbabel is the father of Abiud. Abiud is the father of Eliakim. Eliakim is the father of Azor.
I visit Abu Saduk. Saduk is the father of Akeem. Akeem is the father of Aliud.
Eliahod was the father of Eliezer. Eliezer was the father of Matthan. Matthan was the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who was called the Christ.
There were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. There were fourteen generations from David until the deportation to Babylon. And there were fourteen generations from the deportation to Babylon until the Messiah, Jesus Christ, was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Joseph, her husband, was a righteous man. He didn't want to make her feel ashamed in public. That's why he divorced her quietly.
But while Joseph was thinking about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
She will give birth to a son. Name him Isa, for he will save his people from their sins.
All this happened so that what the Lord said would come to pass. He had said it through the prophet.
The virgin will give birth to a son. She will call him Immanuel, which means "God with us."
Joseph was righteous. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took Mary as his wife.
What happened between them remained a secret even when their son became a daughter. Joseph named her Jesus.
The teachers visited Isa.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened when Herod was king of Judea. After Jesus' birth, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They asked: "Who is the child who is born to become king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east. We have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was very angry. Everyone in Jerusalem was also terrified.
Then Herod called together all the chief priests and the teachers of the law in the land and asked them where the Messiah was to be born.
They said, "In Bethlehem of Judea," "This is what the prophet wrote. He said,
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times."
After Herod, the Magi were secretly called. They learned exactly where the star had appeared.
He sent them to Bethlehem. He said to them, "Go! Search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, bring me a report. Then I will go and worship him myself, for I am the true king."
After the wise men had heard the king, they went on their way. The star they had seen in the east went before them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
Wherever they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and offered him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by another road. The flight of Jesus' family into Egypt.
Joseph had a dream in which an angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph arose. During the night, he departed for Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They stayed there until the death of King Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, "Out of Egypt I called my son" (Hosea 11:1).
Herod understood that the wise men had deceived him. He became very angry. He ordered concerning Bethlehem and the surrounding area. All the boys two years old and under were to be killed. This was in accordance with the time when the wise men had seen the star.
In this way, the words of the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He had said,
A voice was heard in Ramah, a voice of weeping and great mourning. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more. The return of Jesus' family to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead."
Joseph arose, took the child and his mother Mary, and returned to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee.
Here he lived in a city called Nazareth. Thus was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophets about Jesus. They said, "He shall be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent of your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the one the prophet Isaiah spoke about others. He said, "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John was wearing clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People came out to meet him from Jerusalem and all the region of Judea and all the region around the Jordan.
And they confessed their sins, and were baptized of him in Jordan.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Bear fruit that proves your repentance from your sins.
What you say to me to do, I can tell you: "Abraham is our father." I say to you, God can raise up children for Abraham even from these stones.
The horn is at the base of the tree. Every tree that does not bear fruit will be cut down. It will be thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, calling you to repent of your sins. But after me will come one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He has a winnowing fan in his hand to clean the chaff from his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but he will burn the chaff in a fire that cannot be quenched. Thirst for Jesus.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan. He was baptized by John in the water.
But John tried to prevent him. He said to Jesus, "We need to be baptized by you. Why have you come to us?"
"It is strange," Jesus replied, "but let it be so for now. This is the right thing to do. It is God's holy will." John agreed.
Wherever Jesus sneezed, water came out. At that moment, the sky opened. Jesus saw the Spirit of God descending on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Isa is tested.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert. There, the devil tempted him.
After 40 days and 40 nights of fasting, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
"Man does not live by bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God." (Deuteronomy 8:3)
After the devil had led Jesus to the holy city, he made him stand on the highest point of the temple.
When he said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here, for it is written, 'He will give his angels charge over you, to guard you,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone'" (Psalms 91:11-12).
"Why do you test the Lord your God?" Jesus said to them, "It is written, 'You shall not test the Lord your God.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
If you kneel before me and worship me, he said, "I will give you all of this."
Jesus said to him, "Away with you, Satan! for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve." (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus, and behold, angels came to Him and were ministering to Him. Jesus began to preach.
John was in prison. When he heard about Jesus, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and made His home in Capernaum by the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
Therefore, what the prophet Isaiah said came to pass. He said,
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the non-Jewish people live! Land along the Mediterranean Sea! Territories east of the Jordan River!
"The people walking in darkness will see a great light. Those living in a dark land will experience a shining light." (Isaiah 9:1,2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand." Jesus chose the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers. They were called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake. They were fishermen.
Come. Follow me, said Jesus. "I will make you fishers of men.
They were of pure intent, so they left her and followed him.
After that, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus called them to come with him.
Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus heals the sick.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom. And he healed every disease and every affliction among the people.
The news spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from great pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were paralyzed, and others could not move. Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, from the region known as the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Jericho. Others came from the region across the Jordan River.
Isa gives blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds. So he went up a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said,
"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
The blessed ones who mourn will be comforted.
Congratulations to those without honor. They will take the land.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
The blessed ones who improve will be improved for them.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for doing what is right. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Congratulations to you when people laugh at you and humiliate you because of me. You gain blessings even when they speak about you with all kinds of falsehood because of me.
Be happy and cheerful. Your reward in Heaven is great. Likewise, people harmed the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by people.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
Also, people don't light a lamp and put it under a bushel basket. They put it on a lampstand. Then it gives light to everyone in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others. They will see the good you do. And they will glorify your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the whole meaning to the law.
I didn't come here to undo what I wrote in the Torah or in the Qur'an. I didn't come to do that. Rather, I came to give full meaning to what was written.
What I will tell you is true. The sky and the earth will disappear before a small letter disappears from the Scripture. Not even a tiny dot from a pen will disappear from the Scripture until everything is fulfilled.
"Not even the least of these commands will disappear until its purpose is achieved. And don't teach people to disregard them. Otherwise, you will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
This is what I tell you: You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If not, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder.
I had heard what was said to those who came before us. It was said to them, "You shall not kill" (Exodus 20:13). Whoever kills will be judged.
But this is what I tell you: Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Again, whoever says to his brother, 'Raka,' will be liable to the council. But whoever says, 'You fool,' will be liable to hellfire.
Don't bring anything to the party. And remember that your brother has something against you.
Leave your offering in front of the altar. Go and be reconciled with your brother first, and then come and present your offering.
A man has a complaint against you and is taking you to court. Hurry up and settle the matter. Deal with it now on the way. If you don't, he will hand you over to the judge. The judge will hand you over to the executioner. And they will throw you in prison.
Just know that what I'm going to tell you is the truth. You're not getting out until you pay your last penny! Adultery.
I have heard the words, "You shall not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
If your right hand brings you torment, cut it off and throw it away. Your hands are just one part of your body. Better to lose them than have your whole body go to hell. Divorce.
"If a man divorces his wife, he must give her a written notice of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But this is what I say to you: Anyone who divorces his wife causes her to commit adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. A man may divorce his wife only if she has been unfaithful to him. Faithfully.
Once again, I know what has been said to your people from long ago. It was said to them, "Do not break your promises to God. Keep the oaths you have sworn to Him."
But this is what I say to you: Never make a promise like that. Don't make them in the name of heaven. That is God's throne.
You shall not compare them to the dust of the earth. That is the coffin of the feet of God's people. You shall not compare them to the dust of Jerusalem. That is the city of the mighty King.
And don't take an oath by your head. You can't make even a single white or black hair.
Keep your yes a yes, and your no a no. Anything more than this comes from the evil one. Be kind to people.
I had heard the saying "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth" (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this is what I say to you: Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to him as well.
Get someone to sue you so they can take your shirt. Let them take your shirts with them.
If someone does you a favor, do them two.
Give to the one who speaks to you. Don't turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. Love your enemy.
I had heard the saying "Love your neighbor. (Leviticus 19:18) Hate your enemy.
But this is what I say to you: Love your enemies. Pray for those who persecute you.
"From now on, you will be your Father's children in heaven." "He makes the sun rise on both the evil and the good, and sends rain to the righteous and the unrighteous."
If being in love with someone who shakes you up is a prize, what award will you get? Even tax collectors do that.
If you are formally greeting your people with a special title, what do you do that others don't? Even those who don't believe in God do that.
Be perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect.
Giving to those in need
Be afraid of doing good deeds publicly, just to be seen by people. Don't do good deeds to be noticed by others. If you do this, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
As you give to those in need, don't sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do, for they play the saint in the synagogues and on the streets. They receive their reward in full. What I'm telling you is the truth.
When you give to those in need, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
After your gifts, they will be hidden. Your father will let you receive the gift. He sees what you do with its disappearance. Prayer.
You were reading, not like that one who holds his head up as if he's a saint. They love to stand and pray in the synagogue and on street corners. They want to be seen by people. What I'm telling you is the truth. They came dressed in their finest clothes.
Whoever you are reading, go to your room. Lock the door and read to your father who hasn't seen. He will reward you. Your father sees what you will do secretly.
When you pray, don't talk too much like those who are not sincere. They think they are heard because they speak a lot.
Don't be like them. Your dad knows what you want even before you ask him.
"This is how you shall pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom will come. You have chosen to receive on earth what is happening in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who have sinned against us.
Let's avoid fire when we're in trouble. Let's avoid the devil.
Forgive people when they sin against you. If you do, your Father in heaven will forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their offenses, your Father will not forgive your offenses.
When you go to eat, don't make your face look sad like those who pretend to be holy. They make their faces look very sad. They want to show people they are fasting. What I'm telling you is the truth. They've gone through their entire punishment.
But when you go without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
Some people who are kind and wise will know that you are fasting. Only your father, who hasn't been seen, will know. He will understand you. Your father sees everything that happens without being noticed. Hide the treasure in the sky.
I don't hide anything, not even from you in this world. Rodents and rust can ruin them. Thieves can break in and steal them.
They have left a treasure for you in Paradise. Here there are no insects or rust to destroy it. Here there are no thieves to attack and take it.
Your heart is where your treasures are.
The eye is like a lighthouse for the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be filled with light.
But woe to you if your eyes are dim. That will darken your whole body. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. They will hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
"Do not worry about these things, do not be anxious. Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink, or about your body, what you will wear. Is life not more than food, and the body more than clothes?"
Look at the birds in the sky. They don't sow or reap crops. They don't store grain in barns. Yet your Father in heaven feeds them. Aren't you worth much more than they are?
Can you add one hour to your life with a wink?
Do clothes matter to you? Look how wildflowers grow. They don't work or wear clothes.
But this is what I say to you: not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these flowers.
If God clothes the wild grass so beautifully, will He not also clothe you? The wild grass is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire. You have very little faith!
No need to worry. You don't say, "What am I going to eat?" or "What am I going to drink?" or "What am I going to wear?"
People who aren't God's are chasing after all this. Your Father in heaven knows you need them.
But the most important thing is the Kingdom of God. Do for me what you want to do. After that, everything will be added to you.
Don't worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has its own troubles.
Be fair when you judge people.
Don't judge others. Then they won't judge you.
You will judge yourself by your own standards, and you will measure yourself by the standards of others.
You're counting the sand grains in your friend's eye, but you're ignoring the wooden plank in your own.
How do you tell your friend, 'Let me get a splinter out of your eye'? How do you say this when there's a piece of wood in your eye?
You hypocrite! First, remove the plank from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye.
Don't give Hadi to the dogs. Don't throw Olak Exec to the cats. If you do that, they can go for it. Then they can make money for you. Ask, search, read.
Ask, and you shall receive. Seek, and you shall find. Knock, and the door shall be opened unto you.
Everyone who asks receives. He who seeks will find. The door will open for him who knocks.
"Be careful that your children do not ask you for bread. Who among you would give them a stone?"
Or do you think he was asking for a fish? Which one of you would give him a snake?
It's okay if you're poor, you still know how to give your children nice gifts. What about your father in heaven, he will give beautiful gifts to those who ask!
In everything, treat others as you would want them to treat you. This is written in the scriptures and in the prophets, the great and the small.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to death and hell. Many people go by this road.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life. Only a few people find it. A tree and its fruit.
Fear the false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
"You know a tree by its fruit. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes? Do they gather figs from thistles?"
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit. But a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Everyone knows a tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'
I'm going to tell them clearly, "I didn't know you. Here, take this money, you're the one who brought the trouble!" The wise builders and the fools.
I was that, everyone who hears my words and applies them is like a wise man. He built his house on the rock.
Winter has come. The water has risen. The wind blew and hit that house. But it didn't fall. It's built on rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
Winter has come. The water has risen. The wind blew and hit that house. And it blew and fell with a loud crash.
Isa finished saying all this. The people remained astonished at his teachings.
He spoke as if he had the right. He didn't speak like my teacher from the school.
Jesus heals a man with leprosy.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man who had a skin disease came and knelt down before Jesus, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" Immediately the man was cured of his disease.
"I don't know anyone. Follow me to the priest. Bring the gift that Moses commanded. It will be a testimony to them." A Roman centurion had faith.
When Jesus came to the place of rest, a Roman officer met him. He asked Jesus for help.
"My lord," he said, "Your servant is sitting in his house and cannot move. He has great pain."
Isa said, "I will go and heal him."
The leader replied, "Sir, I am not worthy for you to come to my house. But speak the word, and my servant will be healed.
I myself am a man in authority. I have soldiers to obey my orders. We say to one "Go" and he goes. We say to another "Come" and he comes. We say to a servant "Do this" and he does it.
If Jesus heard this, he would be astonished. He told those who followed him, "What I am telling you is the truth. In Israel, I have not found even one person whose faith is as strong as this.
He told you that many will come from the east and the west. They will take their seats at the feast in the Kingdom of Heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
But those who think they are coming from the kingdom will be thrown out, in the mud. There they will cry and pull out their teeth.
Jesus said to the Roman commander, "Go! It will be as you believed. And his servant was healed at the ninth hour. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched his hand, and the fever left him. He got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
"Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed." (Isaiah 53:4-5) Dearly beloved, let us follow Jesus.
Jesus saw the large crowd gathering around him, so he gave orders to his disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then the teacher of the law came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
The last merchant said to him, "My lord, let me go and bury my father first."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." The calm of Jesus in the storm.
Jesus got into the boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly a frightening storm came upon the lake. The waves were crashing against the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The students shouted to the teacher, "Sir! Save us! We're going to drown!"
He said, "Your faith is small! Why are you afraid?" Then Jesus got up and commanded the winds and the waves to stop. It became completely calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "Who is this man? Even the winds and waves obey him!" Jesus healed two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived at the other side of the sea in the region of the Gadarenes. He found two men possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.
"Son of God, what do you want from us?" they asked. "Have you come to punish us before our time?"
Not far away, a large group of decorative lamps are hanging.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us to the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go," and the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and was drowned.
Those who were raising pigs fled. They entered the country and told everything. Tell the people what you are doing with the men who were controlling them with jinn.
Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they urged him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
Jesus got into the boat, crossed to the other side of the lake, and came to his town.
Some men brought him a paralytic, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Some of the religious teachers thought to themselves, "This man is saying something very bad!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Which will be easier to say, "I've forgiven you"? Or to say, "Get up and go"?
"Let us know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralytic, "Get up, take your mat, and go home."
A man stood up and walked to his house.
And I see people, filled with wonder. Praise God for giving authority to the likes of men. Jesus chose whom He willed.
As Jesus passed by, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him. Matthew got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and lawbreakers?"
Isa heard that. And he said, "Those who are not sick do not need a doctor. It is the sick who need him.
Go and learn what this means, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to follow me." Jesus was asked about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came and said to Jesus, "We and the Pharisees fast. Why do your disciples not fast?"
Then Jesus said to them, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
People don't sew a new patch on old clothes. The new patch will stand out from the old. That will only aggravate the wounds.
People don't put new wine in old skins. If they do that, the skins will burst. The wine will run out and the skins will be ruined. No, people put new wine in new skins. That way, both will be preserved. A dead daughter and a wounded woman.
And while Jesus was still speaking, the ruler came and knelt before him, pleading, "My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus got up and went with him. So did his disciples.
At that moment, a woman came up to Jesus from behind. She was suffering from a disease that caused her to bleed continuously for twelve years. She touched the edge of his garment.
She thought to herself, "All I have to do is touch his clothes, and I'll be healed."
When Jesus turned and saw her, he said, "Dear woman, do not lose hope. Your faith has healed you." And at that very moment, the woman was healed.
As soon as Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the lyre players there. He also saw the dining crowd.
He said, "Go there. The girl is not dead. She's sleeping." But they mocked him.
After the group left, Isa entered. He grabbed a girl by the hand, and she got up.
News about what Jesus had done spread throughout the region. Jesus healed two blind men.
Jesus went on from there, and two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, two blind men came to him. They asked him, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" "Yes, Lord," they answered.
After that, I covered their eyes. I said, "This is just what will happen to you as you have believed."
They became suspicious again. Jesus warned them a lot, "Be careful, no one should know about this."
But they went out and proclaimed the news. They talked about it everywhere in that region.
And when they were alone, he asked them who they thought he was. They said, "Some say John the Baptist; othe
When the devil was cast out, the man spoke. The crowd was amazed. They said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
But the Persians said, "It is the spirit of evil, with the authority of the prince of evil spirits, that is working in them."
Jesus went to every city and village. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the good news of the kingdom. And he healed every disease and affliction.
When he saw the crowds, he felt deep compassion for them, for they were like sheep without a shepherd, helpless and lost.
Jesus then said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
So they asked the master to send workers to his grandfather.
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him. He gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. First, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
Next are Philip and Bartholomew, also Thomas and Matthew, the tax collectors. The other two are James, son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus.
The last two are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas is the one who will later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve with these orders: "Do not go to any Gentile or enter any town of the Samaritans.
Without a shepherd, the people of Israel are like sheep that have lost their way.
As you go, give this hair to 'the queen of the jury.'
My treatment is what is sick. Bring back to life those who are dead. Leave those with skin diseases 'clean' again. Drive out the devil. I received without buying, I gave without selling.
Take no gold, silver, or copper with you in your belt.
He didn't take a bag for the trip. He didn't take extra clothes, pants, or a cane. The worker is given what he needs.
Whenever you enter a country or a village, look for someone who is willing to host you. Stay in that person's house until you leave.
As you enter the house, greet those who live in it.
If you're welcome home, give her congratulations. Otherwise, don't give congratulations.
There may be people who won't welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, walk on the sand above your feet when you leave that house or town.
Beware, I will not tell you the truth. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
Beware! They will hand you over to the local judiciary. They will flog you in their court.
You will be prepared for the governor and for the kings because of me. You will be witnesses to them and to those who do not believe.
But when they corner you, don't worry about what you're going to say or how you're going to say it. At that moment, you'll find the right words to say.
It won't be you who is speaking. Your father's spirit will speak through you.
Sisters will hand over their brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their sons. Sons will rise up against their parents and leave them to be murdered.
Everyone is going to hate you because of me. But whoever remains standing until the end will be rewarded.
Whenever people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I'm about to tell you is the truth. I don't want you to leave the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.
A student improves his teacher. A servant improves his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for the servant to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebul, what do the others who live there expect?
Don't fear your enemy. Everything hidden will come to light. Everything concealed will be revealed.
What we tell you at night, say it in the daytime. What is told to your ear, shout it from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Aren't there two small birds sold for a dirham? Not one of them will fall to the ground without your father's permission.
He even counts every hair on your head!
Don't be afraid. You're worth more than seven birds.
What makes him say in front of people that he knows me? I will say in front of my father in heaven that he knows me.
But what can one do when people say they don't know me? I will say before my Father in heaven that they don't know Him.
Don't say I came to bring peace on earth. I didn't come to bring peace. I came to bring the sword.
"Sons will be opposed to their fathers. Daughters will have no obedience towards their sons. Women will be against their daughters-in-law."
"The men who were pursuing that man were members of his own family." (Micah 7:6)
Everyone who loves their father or mother more than me doesn't bother me. Everyone who loves their son or daughter more than me doesn't bother me.
"And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
If anyone finds his life, he will lose it, and if anyone loses his life because of me, he will find it.
"Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me."
"Whoever receives a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet's reward. And whoever receives a righteous man as a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward."
A man gave even a glass of cold water to the little one who follows me. What he will say to you is right. He will be greatly rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus had finished teaching his twelve disciples. Then he went to preach and teach in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he wanted to send his disciples to him.
Jesus asked him, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?"
Isa replied, "Go to John. Tell him what you hear and see.
People who are not seeing are receiving sight. People who cannot walk are walking. Those with skin diseases are being healed. Deaf people are hearing. Dead people are rising to life. And the poor are receiving good news.
Congratulations to those who didn't give their lives to God because of me.
As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
"No, what will you see? A man wearing sweets? No. People wearing sweets are celebrating in the palaces of kings."
What did you go to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, more than a prophet.
It is he who is written about in the Holy Book. It says, "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you" (Malachi 3:1).
"I tell you the truth, among those born of women, no one is greater than John the Baptist. Yet even the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
From that time on, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful men are seizing it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you're ready to accept him, John is the Elijah who was supposed to come.
He who has ears, let him hear.
What kind of people are they? They're like children sitting in a market and shouting to others. They say,
We played the flute for you. But you didn't dance. We sang a funeral song for you. But you didn't get sad.
"But when John came, he neither ate nor drank, and they said, 'He has a demon.'"
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they said, "Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and 'sinners.' Those who act wisely prove that wisdom is right." Cities that do not turn away from sin.
Jesus began to say, "Woe to you, cities where most of my miracles were done, for if the deeds of repentance had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had been performed in Tyre and Sidon which were performed in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
But I say to you, on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No! You will be brought down to the realm of the dead. For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until now.
"But this is something I will tell you. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sodom than for you." Rest for all returnees.
At that time, Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. This is what you wanted.
My father gave me everything. Father knows the son and whoever the son knows, father knows, and whatever the son wants to keep secret, father knows.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
"Become my disciples and learn from me. I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls."
My service is easy, and my burden is light.
Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath.
On Saturday, Jesus and his disciples went through the fields of grain. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pluck and eat the heads of grain.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath. They are plucking grain and eating it!"
Jesus answered, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his men were hungry?
He entered the House of God. He and his men ate the sacred bread. Only priests were allowed to eat it.
Haven't you read the sharīʻa? It says that every Saturday, the priests of the sanctuary serve in the sanctuary on that day. But they are not considered sinners.
We're telling you that what's more important than the temple is here.
The Bible says, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) You cannot understand the meaning of these words. If you understood them, you would not accuse the innocent.
The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
After that, Jesus entered the synagogue.
A man with a withered and paralyzed hand was there. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. That's why they asked, "Does the law allow us to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "What would you do if one of your sheep fell into a pit on the Sabbath? Wouldn't you take it and lift it out?"
A man is worth more than sheep! This law allows us to do good on Saturday.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other hand.
But the chief priests plotted how to kill Jesus. God's chosen one.
Jesus knew all the plans of the Pharisees. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to tell anyone who he was.
This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah. He says,
Here are my servants. I chose him. He is the one I love. I have great satisfaction in him. I will place my soul upon him. He will proclaim to the peoples that everything will be made right.
He won't argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
He's not going to break a bent branch. He's not going to extinguish a flickering flame. He's going to fix everything.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
A man possessed by a demon was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man was able to speak and see.
All the people were amazed. They asked, "Is this the Son of David?"
The Pharisees heard this and said, "This man drives out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil casts out devils, he is fighting against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
"Let's drive out the devil with the power of Beelzebul. What kind of power does your mixture have to drive him out? That's what they will say about you."
But when I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, that is the proof that the kingdom of God has come to you.
First, think about this. How are you going to enter the house of a strong man and take something that belongs to him? You must first tie him up. After that, you can loot his house.
He who is not with me is against me. He who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them.
Here's something we want to tell you. Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be placed under mercy. But speaking out against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whatever blasphemy is spoken against the Son of Man will be forgiven him. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
You are a nest of poisonous vipers! How can you say that your spiteful hearts utter sweet words? Your mouths say everything that is in your hearts.
A good man does good. This comes from the good that is to come. A bad man does evil. This comes from the evil that is to come.
But this is what I tell you. On the Day of Judgment, people will be accountable for every idle word they have spoken.
"By your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned." - The lesson of Jonah's miracle.
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, "Teacher, we want to see a miracle from you."
He said, "The evil people and those who do not believe ask for a sign. But only the sign of Jonah the prophet will be given to them.
Greece was in the belly of a huge fish for three days and three nights. Something like that is going to happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the tomb.
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with those who live now. And she will prove that they are guilty. She came from very far away to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And now there is one greater than Solomon here.
What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man? It wanders in dry places, taking the place where one should rest. And there you find it.
He said, "I'll return to the house I left." He went back and found the house empty. The house was cleaned and filled with order.
After the spirit of evil goes and takes with it seven more evil spirits than itself, they enter and dwell there. The man's condition becomes better than before. That is how it will be with today's evil people. - Mother of Isa and her brothers
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers were standing outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone told me, "Your mother and siblings are outside. They're asking for you."
"Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?" Jesus asked, amazed.
Jesus pointed to his disciples. He said, "Here is my mother! Here are my brothers!
Anyone who does what they want in heaven is my friend, brother, or mother.
The Farmer's Tale
The same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
Large crowds gathered around him. He entered a boat. He sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things in parables, saying, "A farmer went out to sow his seed.
The man scattered the seeds and hit them on the ground. Some of them fell on the road. The birds came and ate them.
A lot of seed fell on rocky ground, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly, because the clay was not deep.
Once the sun rose, the plants were scorched. They withered because they had no roots.
The remaining seeds fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plants.
The remaining seeds fell on good soil. They yielded a crop 100, 60, or 30 times what they had sown.
He who has ears, let him hear.
The students came to him. They asked him, "Why do you use stories when you speak to people?"
He said, "I have given you the opportunity to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. I have not given it to those outside."
Anyone who has this kind of knowledge will be set free more. Honestly, he will have a lot. If he doesn't have anyone with this kind of knowledge, even the little he has will be taken from him.
That's what makes me use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They're looking, but not really. They're listening, but they're not understanding."
In them the words of the prophet Isaiah are being fulfilled: "You will indeed hear, but you will not understand; you will indeed see, but you will not comprehend."
"The heart of this people has become hardened; they hardly hear with their ears, they have closed their eyes, so that they may not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn to me and be healed." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
But congratulations to your eyes because they see. And congratulations to your ears because they hear.
What I am telling you is the truth. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you are seeing, but they didn't see it. They wanted to hear what you are hearing, but they didn't hear it.
Listen! That's the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then comes the devil and snatches it away, lest it should grow and bear fruit in their hearts. These people are like the seed that falls on the path.
Others are like the seed that fell on the rocky ground. They are the ones who hear the message and accept it with joy at once.
But they have no roots. They remain only for a short period. They quickly abandon their faith when problems or trials arise because of the message.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. They are the ones who heard the message. But afterwards, the worries of life and the deceitful promises of wealth choked them. They fail to bear fruit.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. These are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop 100, 60, or 30 times more than what the farmer planted. - The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowd another parable. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
But while everything was growing, an enemy came. An enemy who sowed weeds around among the wheat, and then left.
The wheat began to grow and produce grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The owner's servants came to him. They said, 'Sir, did you sow good seed in your field? Where did the weeds come from?'
"He did this," they said. "The servants asked, 'Do you want us to go and search through the garbage?"
"No," said the owner. "Now you're pulling up the weeds, you might pull up the wheat with them."
Let them grow together until the day of harvest. Then I will tell the reapers, 'First gather the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned, then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.' "Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast
Jesus told the crowd another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A person took the seed and planted it in a field.
It is the smallest of all your seeds, but when it grows up, it becomes the largest of all the plants in the garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and nest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast," he said. "A woman took some and mixed it into a large amount of flour until all the dough had risen."
Jesus spoke these things to the people in parables. He did not speak to them without a parable.
This is how the words spoken by the prophet are fulfilled. He said, "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things from the foundation of the world" (Psalm 78:2). Jesus explains the parable of the weeds.
After Jesus had sent the multitudes away, he went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the tares in the field."
He said, "It is the Son of Man who sows the good seed.
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who live in the kingdom. The weeds represent the people who live with the evil one.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of time. And the workers are the angels.
The sheep is frightened and burns in the fire. That is how it will be on the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers.
They're going to throw them into the fiery clay, where people will weep and gnash their teeth.
That which God has revealed will shine like the sun in His kingdom. He who has ears to hear, let him hear. Tales of hidden treasure and the pearl.
The king of heaven, like Treasure, was hidden in a field. When a man found her, he hid her again. He was very happy. He went away and sold everything he had. And he bought her field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of a fine pearl.
"He found one of great price. That was not to sell all that he had and buy it. And he bought that pearl." - The Parable of the Pearl
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered fish of every kind.
It was full, the white whale went ashore. Then they sat down and gathered the last whale in the shallows. But they left the last whale to fall.
That's how the Day of Judgment will be. The angels will come. They will separate those who did good from those who did evil.
They will throw the evil-doers into the furnace of fire. There, the evil-doers will weep and gnash their teeth.
"How do you understand all this?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they replied.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure both new and old." A prophet without honor.
Isa finished telling these stories. Then he left from there.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? Where did he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
Is that the father of the carpenter? Is his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Don't I have all his sisters? Where did this man get all this from?
They didn't like him at all. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, among his relatives and in his own home."
There are few miracles there because we don't know faith.
John the Baptist's head was cut off.
In those days Herod the tetrarch heard the report about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod had arrested John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was the wife of Herod's brother Philip.
John said to Herod, "It is not right for you to have her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he was afraid of the people, because they considered John a prophet.
At Herod's birthday feast, Herodias' daughter danced for Herod and his guests. Herod was delighted.
He swore to give her everything she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very annoyed. However, he was concerned about his promise to his guests for dinner. So he told one of his men to fulfill their requests.
Herod cut off John's head in prison.
They brought a big pot of soup and gave it to the girl. Then she carried it to her mother.
John's disciples came, took his body, and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a quiet place. The crowds heard about this. They followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus came down from the mountain, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep compassion for them. He healed their sick.
It was almost evening when the disciples came to him. "We have nothing," they said. "The day is almost over, and everyone has gone away. Send the people to the villages to buy food for themselves."
Jesus replied, "They don't need to go away. You give them something to eat."
"We only have five bags of bread and two fish," they said.
Let them come here to me, he said.
After Jesus made the people sit down, he took the five loaves and the two fish. He looked up and gave thanks to God. He broke the loaves into pieces and gave them to the disciples. Then the disciples gave them to the people.
Everyone ate and was satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of the fragments.
The number of men who ate was around 5,000. The women and children ate as well. Jesus walked on water.
Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other side, to Bethsaida. And after he had dismissed the crowd, he took ship and went to them; and Jesus was with them in the boat.
After he drove them away, he went to the mountain alone to pray. When the disaster struck, he was the only one there.
The boat was already far from land. It was being tossed by the waves because the wind was blowing against it.
In the morning, Jesus went out to the countryside. He walked by the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were very afraid. "This is a demon," they said, and cried out in terror.
Immediately Jesus called out to them: "Take heart! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Lord, are you?" Peter asked. "If it is you, command me to come to you on the water."
"Come," Jesus said. Then Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
Immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him. "O you of little faith," He said, "why did you doubt?"
When they went up to the village, the wind stopped.
After those in the boat worshiped Jesus, they said, "Truly you are the Son of God."
They went around the lake to Gennesaret.
The men who lived there knew Jesus. So they sent a message to all the surrounding countryside. The people brought all their sick to Jesus.
He made the sick person touch even the hem of his garment. And those who touched him were healed.
What are these people "mad" about?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,
Why don't your students respect what the elders tell them? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Isa replied: "But aren't you obeying God's command? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said, "He who curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
But you allow people to say to their parents, "Whatever help we have given you is a gift dedicated to God."
They need to honor their parents with their gift. Give them the word of God so they can follow your teachings.
You are the hypocrites! Jesus was right when he prophesied about you. He said,
These people respect me for what I say. But their hearts are far from me.
"I am weary of their pretense, for they teach man's doctrine." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
What goes into your mouth doesn't make you thirsty. It's what comes out of your mouth that makes you thirsty.
Then his disciples came to him. They asked, "How did you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
"It is a strange answer, 'There are plants that my father did not plant in heaven. They will uproot them from the wall."
Leave them alone. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind person leads another blind person, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you understand now?" asked Jesus.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it exits the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. Also murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. And theft, false witness, and much lying to people.
This is what makes you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands doesn't make you "unclean." "The faith of a woman from Cana."
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
"From Canaan a woman came to him, living near Sidon and Tyre. She cried out, 'Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon. She is severely afflicted.'"
Jesus said nothing. Then his disciples came to him and said, "Let her go. She will continue to follow us."
Then Jesus answered, "I am sent only to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep."
After that, I, Jewel, fell to my knees before him. "Master! Help me!" I said.
He said: "It's not fair that we take our children's bread and give it to their dogs."
"Yes, sir," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' tables."
Jesus answered, "Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted." And her daughter was healed at that very moment. Jesus then gave food to four thousand people.
Jesus went away from there. He walked beside the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain and sat down.
Many people came to him. They brought blind people, people who could not walk, disabled people, people who could not speak, and many others. They left them at his feet, and he healed them.
People were amazed. Those who didn't speak started talking. The sick were healed. Those who couldn't read started going to school. The blind began to see. That's how the people praised the God of Israel.
Always Jesus invited his disciples to give. He said, "I feel the need of these people. They have been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they will collapse on the way home."
His disciples spoke with him. "There is nothing," they said. "From where will we bring enough bread for this large crowd?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."
Isa told the group to sit on the ground.
The lion took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks. Then he shook them and left them for the students. And the students left them for the people.
Each of them ate and was satisfied. Afterwards, the Prophet had seven extra pieces removed.
The number of men who ate was 4000. Women and children ate as well.
After Jesus had gone out to the people, he got into the boat. He went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus is asked for a miraculous sign.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He said: "In the evening, you look at the sky. You say: 'There will be nice weather. The sky is red."
In the morning you say, 'The day will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy.' You know what you see in the sky. But you can't understand the signs of what's happening now.
A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign! And no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And he left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
The students crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring bread.
"Be careful," Jesus said to them, "of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students talked among themselves about this. They said, "Why did he say that? Why did he say it? Because we didn't bring bread."
He knew what they were saying. So he said to them, "Your faith is too small! Why are you arguing with each other instead of sharing the bread you have?"
Don't you remember? Don't you remember the five loaves for 5000? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces you brought?
Don't you remember the seven loaves for 4000? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces you brought?
How don't you understand? I was telling you to go and buy bread. But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
After this, the disciples understood that Jesus was not speaking to them about leavened bread. He was speaking to them about what the Pharisees and Sadducees taught. Peter said that Jesus was the Messiah.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They said, "Some people say he is Elijah. Others say he is Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
"What's wrong with you?" he asked. "Why did you tell me that?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
This is what I say to you: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
After Jesus had instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah, Jesus spoke about his upcoming death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples how he would have to go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law. He would be killed, and on the third day he would be raised to life.
Peter gave him a yes with his head and began to mutter. "Oh no, sir!" he said. "This never happens to you!"
Then Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
After Jesus spoke to his disciples, he said to them, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself. He must take up his cross and follow me."
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for me, he will find it.
What good is it for a person to gain the whole world, and yet lose their soul? What would they trade for their soul?
The Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory. His angels will come with him, and he will reward each person according to what they have done.
What I'm going to tell you is the truth. Some of you standing here will die before you see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
When Jesus changed his appearance.
After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John, his brother, and led them up to a high mountain by themselves.
Before them, his appearance changed. His chest shone like the sun. His garment became white as light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, let us make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And while Peter was still speaking, a good wind carried their words. A voice from the wind said, "This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
When they woke up to this, they were very afraid. They fell to the ground on their faces.
But Jesus came and touched them. "Get up," he said. "Don't be afraid."
And they saw it ascending, and it went up into heaven, and it was seen no more; and they looked steadfastly into heaven as it went up.
They descended from the mountain. On the way down, Jesus told them what to do. "Don't tell anyone what you have seen," he said. "Wait until the Son of Man rises from the dead."
The students asked him, "Why do those who teach Sharia say that the Mahdi will come first?"
Strange, Jesus said: "Yes, Elijah is coming to restore all things.
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
After the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist's death, Jesus healed a boy who had a demon.
And when they came near the community, the man who was called Jesus stopped, and knelt down on his knees before them.
"My lord," he said, "have mercy on my son. He is very stubborn and very careless. He regularly falls into the fire or into the water.
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.
"You people are unbelievers and evildoers!" Jesus said. "What is this that remains with me? What is this that I should bear you? Bring the boy here to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"
He said, "Why do you have so little faith? Let me tell you the truth. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
(No
A crowd came to Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be handed over into the hands of people."
He will be killed. On the third day, he will rise from the dead. After that, the disciples will be filled with deep sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples reached Capernaum. When they arrived, the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and asked, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
Yes, it was as Peter entered the house that Jesus spoke up. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "From whom do the kings of the earth collect duties and taxes? From their own children or from others?"
"From the other people, give less to Peter," Jesus said. "No, they don't have to pay less," Peter replied.
But we didn't want to upset them. Go to the lake and leave your fishing rod. Take the first fish you find. Open its mouth. You'll find the knot that's waiting for you. Take it and give it to them on my behalf and yours.
