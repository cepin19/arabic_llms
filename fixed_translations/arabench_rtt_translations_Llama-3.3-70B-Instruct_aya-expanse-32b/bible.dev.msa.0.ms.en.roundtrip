Hezekiah is the father of Manasseh. Manasseh is the father of Amon. Amon is the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were forced to go into exile in Babylon.
Then the family line continued. Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zerrubbabel is the father of Abiud. Abiud is the father of Eliakim. Eliakim is the father of Azor.
Azure is the father of Zadok. Zadok is the father of Achim. Achim is the father of Aliyud.
Eliezer was the father of Eleazar. Eleazar was the father of Matthan. Matthan was the father of Jacob.
Jacob is the father of Joseph. Joseph is the husband of Mary. Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the deportation to Babylon, and fourteen generations from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah. Jesus Christ was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Youssef, was a pious man. He didn't want to humiliate her in public. So, he planned to divorce her quietly.
But while Joseph was considering this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through the prophet.
The virgin will bear a child. She will give birth to a son, and he will be called Emmanuel. Emmanuel means "God with us."
Joseph woke up. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary into his home as his wife.
But he did not sleep with her until she gave birth to a son. And Joseph named him Jesus.
The seven kings visit Jesus.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This was during the time when Herod was king of Judea. After the birth of Jesus, magi from the East came to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
So Herod summoned the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judea," they said. "This is what the prophet wrote. He said,
"And you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times."
Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Search carefully for the child. When you find him, bring me a report. Then I too can go and worship him."
After the wise men had listened to the king, they went on their way. The star they had seen in the east went ahead of them. Finally, it stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were overwhelmed with joy.
The magi went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their homeland by another route. The flight of Jesus' family into Egypt.
When the Magi had departed, Joseph had a dream. In the dream an angel of the Lord appeared to him. "Get up," the angel said, "take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph arose during the night, and departed into Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus were fulfilled the words of the Lord spoken by the prophet: "I will bring my son out of Egypt" (Hosea 11:1).
Herod felt that the Magi had deceived him. So he was very angry. He issued orders concerning Bethlehem and the surrounding area. All the children two years old and under had to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the Magi had seen the star.
In this way, the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He said:
A voice was heard in Ramah, a voice of weeping and great mourning. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more. (Jeremiah 31:15) The return of Jesus' family to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead."
So Joseph got up and took the child and his mother, Mary, and went to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee.
There he lived in a city called Nazareth. So what the prophets said about Jesus came true. They said, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent from your sins! For the kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke, saying, "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from the whole region of the Jordan.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Bear fruit that shows you have repented of your sins.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
The saw is already placed at the base of the trees. All trees that do not produce good fruit will be cut down. They will be thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, calling you to repent of your sins. But after me will come one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
His claw is in his hand to clean the chaff from his threshing floor. And he will gather his wheat into the barn, but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire." Jesus was baptized.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?"
Jesus replied, "Let it be so for now. It is right for us to do this, for it fulfills all righteousness." And John consented.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus is tempted.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, where he was tempted by the devil.
After forty days and forty nights of fasting, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.' " (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the highest point of the temple.
"When he said to him, 'If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you.' On their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'" (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered and said to him, "It is written, 'You shall not test the Lord your God.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil brought Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"When his Lord said to him, 'Submit,' he said, 'I have submitted to the Lord of the worlds.' He said, 'If you worship Me and prostrate to Me, I will give you all this.'"
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil departed out of Jesus. And, behold, angels came and ministered unto him. Jesus began to preach.
John had been imprisoned. When Jesus heard of it, he withdrew to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and went to live in Capernaum, which is by the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
In this way, what the prophet Isaiah said was fulfilled. He said,
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the non-Jewish people live! The land along the Mediterranean Sea! The region east of the Jordan River!
The people who now live in darkness will see a great light. They live now in a very dark land. But a light will shine upon them. (Isaiah 9:1, 2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two men, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Come. Follow me, said Jesus. "I will make you fishers of men."
So they immediately left their nets and followed him.
As they went on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus called out to them.
Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus walked throughout Galilee. There He taught in their synagogues, preached the gospel of the kingdom, and healed every disease and every affliction among the people.
News about him spread all over Syria. People brought all those who were sick, suffering from various diseases. Some were in great pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were convulsing violently. Others were completely paralyzed. Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, from the region known as the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Jericho. Others came from the region across the Jordan River.
Isa gives blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds, so he went up on the mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are those who renounce pride. They will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are those whose hearts are pure, for they will see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for doing good. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Blessed are you when people revile you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Blessed are you when they persecute you because of me.
Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for your reward in heaven is great. Likewise, people persecuted the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its taste, with what can it be seasoned? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.
No one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.
Likewise, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the full meaning to the law.
"Do not think that I have come to abolish what is written in the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish these things but to fulfill them."
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Heaven and earth will pass away before even the smallest letter or stroke of the law passes away. Not the smallest part of the law will pass away until all things are accomplished.
Do not break even the least of these commandments. And do not teach others to break them. For if you do, you will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But if you practice and teach these commandments, you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
This is what I say to you: You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will surely not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder.
You have heard what was said to those of ancient times, "You shall not murder" (Exodus 20:13), and whoever murders will be subject to judgment.
But this is what I tell you: Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Again, whoever says to his brother, 'Raca,' will be liable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You fool,' will be liable to the fire of hell.
Suppose you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift before the altar and go first to be reconciled with your brother; then come and offer your gift.
Suppose someone has a claim against you and takes you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do it while you're still on your way with him. If you don't, he may hand you over to the judge. The judge may hand you over to the officer. And you might be thrown into prison.
What I'm about to tell you is the truth. You won't get out until you pay the last penny! Adultery
You have heard that it was said, "Do not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
"If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell."
If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. (Divorce)
It is written: "When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a written notice of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But that is what I am saying to you: Whoever divorces his wife causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. It is not permissible for a man to divorce his wife unless she is unfaithful to him. Oaths.
Again, you have heard what was said to your ancestors long ago: 'Do not break the covenant that you made with the Lord. Keep the oaths you swore to him.'
But this is what I tell you: Never make a promise like that. Don't make it under any circumstances. Don't make it in the name of heaven. That is God's throne.
Do not make it in the name of the Earth. It is the footstool of God's feet. Do not make it in the name of Jerusalem. It is the city of the great King.
And do not swear by your heads, for you cannot make a single hair white or black.
Let your yes be yes, and your no, no. Anything beyond this is from the evil one. Be kind to others.
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this is what I tell you: Do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to them as well.
Suppose someone sues you for your shirt, let him have your coat as well.
Suppose someone forces you to walk one mile. I'll walk two miles with him.
Give to him who asks of you. Do not turn away him who would borrow from you. Love your enemies.
You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor (Leviticus 19:18) and hate your enemy.'
But this is what I tell you: Love your enemies. Pray for those who harm you.
"Then you will be sons of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."
"If you only love those who love you, what reward do you get? Even the tax collectors do the same."
If you only greet your relatives, what are you better than others? For the wicked people do the same.
Be perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect.
Distributing aid to the needy
Be careful not to do your good deeds in front of people. Don't do them to be seen by others. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
When you give to the needy, do not announce it with a trumpet, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, so that they may be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Then it will be revealed to you. Your Father will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer.
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by people. I tell you the truth, they have already received their reward.
When you pray, go into your room, close your door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. He who sees in secret will reward you.
When you pray, do not babble as the hypocrites do, for they think that they will be heard because of their many words.
Do not be like them; your Father knows what you desire even before you ask Him.
"This is how you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us.
Deliver us from sin when we are tempted. Save us from evil.
Forgive people when they sin against you. If you do, your Father in heaven will forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their offenses, neither will your Father forgive you your offenses. —Matthew 6:15 (New International Version)
"When you fast, do not put on a gloomy face as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others that they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full."
But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face.
"Then no one will see your fasting, except your Father who is unseen, and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you." "Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven."
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your heart is where your treasures are.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
But suppose your eyes are bad. Then your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one and love the other. Or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
"Why are you concerned about clothes? Look at how the wild flowers grow. They do not work or spin clothes."
But that is what I tell you. Not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.
"If God makes the wild grass beautiful, will He not do the same for you? Yet the grass is here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow. Oh, you have so little faith!"
So do not worry, saying, 'What will we eat?' or 'What will we drink?' or 'What will we wear?'
Hypocritical people run after all those things. Your Father in heaven knows that you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
"Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."
Be fair when you judge others.
Judge not others, lest you be judged.
You will be judged in the same way you judge others. You will be measured in the same way you measure others.
You look at the speck of dust in your friend's eye, but you don't notice the log in your own eye.
How do you tell your friend: 'Let me remove the splinter from your eye'? How can you say that when there's a piece of wood in your own eye?
You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, inquire.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks will receive. He who seeks will find. The door will be opened to him who knocks.
Suppose your son asks for bread. Who among you would give him a stone?
Or suppose he asks for a fish, which of you will give him a snake?
"If you, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!"
In all things, do to others what you would want them to do to you. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The great and small gate.
Enter the kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to death and hell. Many go in this way.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life. Only a few people find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
"A tree is known by its fruit. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?"
So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit. And a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
A tree is known by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'
Then I will say to them plainly, 'I never knew you. Depart from me, you who do lawlessness!' The wise builders and the foolish.
Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
The rain pours down. The water rises. The winds blow and beat against that house. But it does not fall. It is built on the rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
The rain pours down. The water rises. The winds blow and strike that house. And it crashes with a loud fall.
Jesus ended by saying all these things. The crowds were amazed by his teaching.
He taught as one having authority, and not as their scribes.
Jesus heals a man with leprosy.
Jesus came down from the mountain, and great crowds followed him.
A man with leprosy came and knelt before Jesus, saying, "Lord, if you choose to, you can make me clean."
Jesus stretched out his hand and touched the man, saying, "I do want to; be made clean." Immediately the man was made clean from his leprosy.
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." A Roman officer with faith.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded for his help.
"Oh Lord," he said, "my servant is lying at home, paralyzed and unable to move. He is suffering greatly."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The captain answered, "Sir, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof, but just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
I myself am a man in authority. I have soldiers who obey my commands. I say to this one, "Go," and he goes. I say to that one, "Come," and he comes. I say to my servant, "Do this," and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly, I tell you, with no one in Israel have I found such faith."
I tell you, many will come from east and west and take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
But those who think they belong to the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman officer, "Go! Let it be done just as you believed." And his servant was healed at that very hour. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus wiped her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He did it to make what the prophet Isaiah said come true. He said, "He took on himself the pain that should have been ours. He took on himself the sicknesses that should have been ours." (Isaiah 53:4) Following Jesus involves a cost.
Jesus saw the crowd around him. So he instructed his disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then a scribe came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
One of his followers said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into the boat, and his disciples followed him.
Suddenly a fierce storm arose on the lake. The waves beat against the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The pupils went and woke him up. They said, "Lord! Save us! We are perishing!"
He answered, "How little faith you have! Why are you so afraid?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.
The philosophers were amazed and asked, "Who is this man, even the winds and waves obey him?" Jesus healed two men possessed by demons.
And Jesus came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gadarenes. And when he had come out of the boat, there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no one could bind him any more, not even with chains.
"Son of God, what do you want with us?" they cried. "Have you come to torment us before our time?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was grazing.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the unclean spirits came out of the men and entered into the swine. And the herd of swine ran violently down the steep place into the lake, and were drowned in the water.
Those who were tending the pigs fled. They went into the town and told everyone everything. They told the people what had happened to the men who had been possessed by the demons.
Then the whole city came out to meet him, and when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
Jesus got into the boat, crossed over, and came to his own city.
Some men came, carrying a paralytic on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the lawyers said to themselves, "This man is speaking blasphemy!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking, and said to them, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Get up and walk"?
"I want you to know," he said, "that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he turned to the man who couldn't walk. "Get up," he said, "take your mat and go home."
The man stood up and went home.
When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe. They praised God for giving such authority to men. Jesus chooses when.
And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he said to him. And Matthew rose and followed him.
Afterward Jesus went to dine at the house of Matthew. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and His disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said, "Those who are well do not need a doctor, but those who are sick do."
Go and learn what it means, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice' (Hosea 6:6). I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners. They ask Jesus about fasting.
Today is one of the days that John's disciples came. They said to Jesus, "We and the Pharisees fast often. Why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
People don't sew a patch of new cloth onto old clothes. The new piece will tear away from the old one. That will make the tear worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wineskins will burst. The wine will run out, and the wineskins will be ruined. No, everyone pours new wine into new wineskins. Then both are preserved. A dead girl and a suffering woman.
And while Jesus was still speaking, a synagogue leader came and fell at his feet, pleading with him to come to his house, because his daughter had just died.
Jesus got up and followed him, and so did his disciples.
At that moment, a woman came up behind Jesus. She was suffering from a disease that caused her to bleed. It had lasted for 12 years. She touched the edge of his clothes.
I thought, "All I need to do is touch his clothes, and I will be healed.
Jesus turned and looked at her. "Daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you. Go in peace." And the woman was healed at that very moment.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the noisy crowd.
He said, "Go. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd had been led outside, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
The news about what Jesus had done spread throughout that whole region. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus passed by, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" "Yes, Lord," they answered.
Then he wiped their eyes and said, "Your faith has healed you."
They were able to see again. And Jesus sternly warned them, "Make sure that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it all over that area.
And when they had come out, another man who was mute and possessed by an evil spirit was brought to Jesus.
When the demon was cast out, the man spoke. And the crowd was amazed, saying, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
But the Persians said, "The devil is defeated concerning the realm of the devils." There are few workers.
Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every affliction.
When he saw the crowds, he had deep compassion for them, for they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
Ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers into his harvest field.
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples together and gave them authority to cast out evil spirits and heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. First, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
Then come Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. Two others are James son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus.
The last two are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas is the one who will later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out these twelve with the following instructions. "Do not go to the Gentiles," he said. "Do not enter any town of the Samaritans.
But go to the house of Israel. They are like lost sheep.
As you go, preach this message: 'The kingdom of heaven is near.'
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse those who have leprosy. Drive out demons. You received without pay, give without pay.
Take no gold or silver or copper in your belts.
Don't take a bag for the trip. Don't take extra clothes, sandals, or a cane. The worker should be given what he needs.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone who wants to host you. Stay in that person's house until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet those who live there.
If that house loves you, bless it with safety. If it doesn't love you, don't bless it.
Perhaps some people will not welcome you or listen to your words. If they do not, shake the dust off your feet as you leave that house or town.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
Beware! They will deliver you to the local courts. They will whip you in their churches.
You will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, and will bear witness to them and to the Gentiles.
But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given the right words.
You will not be the speaker. Your father's spirit will speak through you.
Brothers will hand over brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their children. Children will rise up against their parents and put them to death.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am about to tell you is the truth. You will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
The student is not better than his teacher. The servant is not better than his master.
It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and enough for the servant to be like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, what can those who live in his house expect?
So do not be afraid of your enemies. For there is nothing hidden that will not be made manifest, and nothing secret that will not be known.
What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light. What is whispered in your ear, shout from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father's care.
He even counts every hair on your head!
So do not fear, for you are more precious than many sparrows.
What about someone who says in front of others that he knows me? I will also say in front of my Father in heaven that he knows me.
But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my Father in heaven that he doesn't know me.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
You have come to turn "sons against their fathers, and daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law, and daughters against their mothers."
A man's foes are members of his own household. (Micah 7:6)
"Whoever loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."
And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
"Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it."
Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.
"If anyone accepts a prophet as a prophet, he will receive a prophet's reward. And if anyone accepts a righteous person as a righteous person, he will receive a righteous person's reward."
Suppose someone were to give even a cup of cold water to one of my followers. I tell you the truth, they will certainly be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus finished teaching his twelve disciples. Then he went to teach and preach in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked him, "Are you the one who has come, or should we wait for another?"
Jesus said, "Go to John and tell him what you hear and see.
The blind receive their sight. The lame walk. Those who have leprosy are cleansed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised. The poor have good news preached to them.
Blessed is he who does not falter in his faith because of me.
As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? No, those who wear soft clothing are in the houses of kings.
Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
He is the one who is written about in the book. He says, "I will send my messenger ahead of you. He will prepare your way before you" (Malachi 3:1).
What I am about to tell you is the truth. No one born of woman is greater than John the Baptist. Yet even the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power, and forceful people lay hold of it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you are willing to accept it, it is John the Baptist who is the Elijah that was to come.
"Let those with ears hear."
What do people display today? They are like children sitting in the markets, calling out to each other. They say,
We played the flute for you, but you did not dance. We sang the death anthem for you, but you did not grieve.
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do, and people say, 'He is a demon-possessed man.'
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they say, "Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and 'sinners.' Wisdom is justified by her deeds." Those cities where the deeds were not done are the ones that do not repent of sin.
Jesus began to speak against the cities where he had performed most of his miracles. Since the people there did not repent of their sins, he said:
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you this: It will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
"And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to the depths of hell. For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today."
"But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you." "Rest for all the weary."
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. This is what you wanted.
My Father has given me all things. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
"Be My servants and learn from Me, for I am Full of Compassion and Humility. You will find comfort for yourselves."
The service is easy for me, and my burden is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, Jesus was going through the grainfields. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this. They said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do that on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and his men?
So he entered the house of God, and he and his men ate the sacred bread, which was only allowed for the priests to eat.
Haven't you read the Law? It says how the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are guiltless.
I say to you, there is one who is greater than the temple.
The Bible says, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) You do not know what those words mean. If you knew, you would not accuse the innocent.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
Following from that place, Jesus entered their temple.
A man with a withered and crooked hand was there. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. So they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
"Man is more valuable than sheep! Therefore, the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath."
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and it became whole, just like the other hand.
But the Persians went out and plotted how to kill Jesus, the chosen servant of God.
Jesus knew what the Pharisees were planning. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to tell who he was.
This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah, who said,
This is my friend, whom I have sought. He is the one I love. I am content with him. I will lay down my life for him. He will tell the nations that everything will be restored.
He will not argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
He won't break a bent branch. He won't extinguish a flickering flame. He'll fix everything.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Belshazzar.
A man possessed by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed the man. Then the man was able to speak and see.
All the people were amazed, and said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man drives out demons only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.
When the devil casts out the devil, he fights against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul, so by whose power do your people cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or consider this. How can you enter a strong man's house and take his possessions? You must first tie him up. Then you can plunder his house.
He who is not with me is against me. And he who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them.
Here is what I say to you: Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. Such a person will not be forgiven, either now or in the days to come."
"If you make the tree good, its fruit will be good; and if you make the tree bad, its fruit will be bad. The tree is known by its fruit."
"O brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."
A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him. A bad man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him.
But this is what I tell you: On the Day of Judgment, people will have to account for every idle word they have spoken.
"By your words you will be condemned or acquitted." The sign of Jonah, the miracle.
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, "Teacher, we want to see a miracle from you."
He answered, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign! But no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
Jonah was in the belly of a huge fish for three days and three nights. Something like this will happen to the Son of Man. He will live three days and three nights in the grave.
The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man? It passes through dry places, looking for a place to rest. But it finds none.
Then he says: 'I will return to the house I left.' When he arrives there, he finds the house empty. The house has been cleaned and put in order.
Then the unclean spirit goes out of the man, and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation." - Jesus and his brothers
While Jesus was speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak with him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you."
Then Jesus, answering, said to them, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples. He said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!
Whoever does what my Father in heaven wants is my brother or sister or mother.
The Farmer's Tale
On that very day, Jesus left the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. So he got into a boat. He sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things by means of stories, saying, "A farmer went out to sow his seed.
The seeds were scattered on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, the plants were scorched. They withered because they had no roots.
Some of the seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked the plants.
But other seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop, a hundred and sixty and thirty times what was sown.
"Let those with ears hear."
The students came to him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
He answered, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.
Anyone who has that kind of knowledge will be given more. In fact, they will have too much. If no one has that kind of knowledge, even the little they have will be taken away.
That's why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look but they don't really see. They hear but they don't really listen or understand.
In them is fulfilled the word of the prophet Isaiah, who said, "You will indeed hear, but you will not understand. You will indeed see, but you will not know what you are seeing.
"The hearts of these people have become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes, so that they may not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their hearts, nor repent and be healed." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, but they did not see it. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they did not hear it.
Listen! Here is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom and do not understand it. Then the evil one comes. He steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed sown on the path.
As for others, they accepted the seed that fell on the rock. These are the ones who, when they hear the word, accept it with joy, but they have no root in themselves and only believe for a while.
But they have no roots; therefore they endure only for a short time. They quickly fall away from the faith when affliction or persecution comes because of the message.
Still other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil. They sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. Other seeds fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, and they did not bear fruit.
But others fell on good soil. They are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop 100, 60, or 30 times more than what was planted. - The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowd another story: "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy sowed weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat started to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The owner's servants came to him. They said, "Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?"
"An enemy did this," he said. The servants asked, "Do you want us to go and pull the weeds?"
"No," the owner replied, "while you are weeding, you might pull up the wheat with the weeds."
Let both grow together until the harvest, and at that time I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: 'First gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat. Bring it into my barn.' " Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast
Jesus told the crowds another parable, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a person took and planted in a field."
It is the smallest of all your seeds, but when it grows, it is the largest of all the plants in the garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and nest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour. The yeast worked through all the dough."
Jesus spoke to the crowd in parables, and he did not say anything to them without using a parable.
The words of the prophet were fulfilled. He said, "I will open my mouth and utter dark sayings; I will proclaim what was hidden since the creation of the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the parable of the weeds.
Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the day of judgment. And the workers are the angels.
Weeds are uprooted and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove from his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.
They will be cast into the blazing fire. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Those who have ears must hear. Stories of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and went and sold all that he had and bought that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found one that was very valuable. So he went and sold everything he had. And he bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the lake. It caught all kinds of fish.
When it was full, the fishermen pulled it to shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets. But they threw away the bad fish.
Thus it will be on the Day of Judgment. The angels will come. They will separate those who did evil from those who did good.
The wicked will be cast into the fiery furnace. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus ended these parables. Then he left.
He came to the town of Nazareth, where he had been brought up. There he began to teach in their synagogue. And they were astonished. "Where did this man get this wisdom? Where did he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And his brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? Where did this man get all these things?
They were not at all pleased with him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, and among his own relatives and in his own home."
He performed only a few miracles there because they had no faith.
John the Baptist's head severed
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard reports about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
Herod wanted to kill him, but he feared the people, for they regarded John as a prophet.
On Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced for Herod and his guests. Herod was delighted.
He swore to her with his right hand that he would give her what she asked for.
Her mother said what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very suspicious. But he thought about his promise and his dinner guests. So he told one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod ordered John's head to be cut off in prison.
His head was brought on a large platter and given to the girl, who then took it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a quiet place. The crowds heard about it. They followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus landed on the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep compassion for them. He healed their sick.
As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus answered, "They need not depart; feed them yourselves."
"We have fifty loaves of bread and two fish," they answered.
"Bring them here to me," he said.
Then Jesus commanded the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. And the disciples picked up twelve baskets of the broken pieces that were left over.
The number of men who ate was about 5,000. The women and children also ate. Jesus walked on water.
Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida.
After sending them away, he went up on a mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
The ship was already far from land. It was being battered by the waves because the wind was blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were terrified. "It's a ghost!" they said, and cried out in fear.
Immediately Jesus called out to them: "Take heart, it is I. Do not be afraid."
"Master, are you?" Peter asked. "If it is you, command me to come to you on the water."
"Come," said Jesus. So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!"
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
When they boarded the boat, the winds calmed.
Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, and said, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and reached Gnesert.
The men who had been living there knew Jesus, so they sent a message to all the surrounding districts. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
They asked him to allow those who were sick to touch only the edge of his clothes, and everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "unclean"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,
Why don't your students obey what the elders teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the command of God? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said, "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
But you have made it seem desirable to them that they should say to their parents, "If you were to give us anything, it would be a charity and a good deed."
They do not have to honor their parents with their gifts. You nullify the word of God by your tradition.
O hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you, saying,
These people honor me with their words, but their hearts are far from me.
"Their worship is meaningless to me. They teach man-made rules, rules of mere humans." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
What goes into your mouth does not defile you; what comes out of your mouth is what defiles you.
Then his disciples came to him, and asked him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are plants that my Father has not planted in heaven. They will be uprooted.
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind leaders. If a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you not yet understand?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes into the stomach, and then it comes out of the body.
But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person.
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. So do theft, bearing false witness, and spreading lies about others.
These are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands doesn't make you "unclean." "The faith of a woman from Cana."
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman, who lived near Tyre and Sidon, came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely oppressed by a demon."
Jesus said not a word. His disciples came to him and asked, "Send her away, for she is crying after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman fell on her knees before him. "Oh God! Help me," she said.
He answered, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
"Yes, sir," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' tables."
Then Jesus answered and said, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus went away from there. He walked along the shore of Lake Galilee. Then he went up a mountain and sat down.
A great multitude came to him. They brought the blind, the lame, the maimed, the mute, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. The disabled became healthy. Those who could not walk were walking. The blind were seeing. So the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have great compassion on this crowd. They have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way home."
His disciples answered him, "There is nothing here but five loaves and two fish." They said, "What good is that for such a large crowd?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and some small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit on the ground.
The lion took the seven loaves and the fish, and gave thanks. Then he broke them and gave them to his disciples, and his disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Afterwards, Jesus' disciples gathered seven baskets of the remaining fragments.
The number of men who ate was 4000. The women and children also ate.
After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus is asked to show a miracle.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, and asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He replied, "In the evening you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red."
In the morning you say, 'Today will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy.' You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign! But no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. And he left them and went away. The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The pupils crossed to the other side of the lake. They had forgotten to bring bread.
"Make them," said Jesus. "Look at the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils spoke about this among themselves. They said, "He's saying this because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. So he said to them, "Your faith is small! Why do you talk among yourselves about having no bread?"
Do you still understand? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Do you not remember how many baskets full you gathered?
Do you not remember the seven loaves for the four thousand? How many baskets full of pieces did you gather?
How can you not understand? I was not talking to you about bread. But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not warning them about the leaven of bread, but about the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter said, "You are the Christ."
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
This is what I tell you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus speaks of his upcoming death.
From that time Jesus began to explain to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised up on the third day.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This shall never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Whoever wants to follow me must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me.
"If he wants to save his life, he will lose it; but if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it."
What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
Truly, the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory, with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.
What I am telling you is the truth. Some of you standing here will not die before you see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Jesus' appearance changes.
Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
There, before them, his appearance was transformed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became white as light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to him, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
When the disciple heard this, they were terrified and fell to the ground with their faces down.
But Jesus came and touched them, saying, "Arise, do not be afraid."
When they raised their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. And as they were going down, Jesus instructed them, saying, "Tell no one what you have seen." He said to them, "Wait until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The disciples asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus answered, "It is true, Elijah is coming to restore all things."
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy who had a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man ran up to Jesus, fell on his knees before him,
"Oh Lord," he said, "have mercy on my son. He trembles severely and suffers greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.
"You people are unbelievers and evil," Jesus said, "How much longer must I stay with you? How much longer must I put up with you? Bring the boy to me here."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why could we not cast it out?"
He said, "Because your faith is so small. What I am telling you is the truth. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."

They came together in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him, and on the third day he will rise again." The disciples were deeply saddened. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. There, the tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
Yes, he does, answered Peter. When Jesus entered the house, he spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Who collects taxes from the kings of the earth? Do they collect them from their sons or from others?"
"From others," Peter answered. "Then the children do not have to pay," Jesus said to him.
But we don't want to anger them. Go to the lake and cast your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. There you will find the knot you need exactly. Take it and give it to them for your tax and mine.
