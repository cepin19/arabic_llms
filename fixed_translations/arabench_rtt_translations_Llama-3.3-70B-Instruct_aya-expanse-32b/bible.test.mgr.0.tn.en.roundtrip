environmental khoa is the most important person in the kingdom?
khoaese days, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus called a little child to him and had the child stand among them.
Jesus said, "I am telling you the truth. You must change and become like a little child. If you do not do this, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
khoahever remains humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
"Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me."
But who would lead one of these little ones who believe in me into sin? If anyone did, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.
khoa unto the world because of offenses; for it is necessary that offenses come, but woe to that man through whom the offense comes!
If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or foot than to be thrown into hell with two hands and two feet. In hell, the fire burns forever.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The parable of the lost sheep
Don't despise any of these little ones. That's what I'm telling you. Their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.
(No
What do you think happened? Consider a man who had a hundred hives and one of them flew away. Wouldn't he leave the ninety-nine hives on the mountains and go look for the one that flew away?
I should tell you the truth. If he finds that sheep, he will be happier than the 99 that are flying away.
It's the same with your Father in heaven. He doesn't want any of these little ones to be lost. Whenever someone sins against you
If your brother sins against you, go to him and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.
But what if he doesn't listen to you? You will take one or two others with you. The Bible says, 'Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I am telling you is the truth. What you close on earth will be closed in heaven. What you open on earth will be opened in heaven.
Again, I tell you, whatever two of you on earth agree about, my Father in heaven will do for you.
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am with them." The servant who has no mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Then Jesus said, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
As the king began to do so, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought to him.
A man couldn't pay his debts. We understood his situation. The man, his wife, his children, and all he owned had to be sold to pay off his debts.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he begged on bended knee. "Everything will be restored here."
His Lord bestowed His mercy upon him. He forgave him for what remained and let him go.
But then the slave went out and found one of the slaves who owed him a little over a dollar. He struck him and began to choke him, saying, 'Pay me what you owe!'
The second boy fell to his knees. "Give me time," he begged. "I'll repeat it to you."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
The other servants saw what happened. It scared them a lot. They went and told their master everything that happened.
After the Master had called him "Gollum," he said, "You are a wicked creature, Gollum. I forgive you all that you owed me, for you prayed for me."
I haven't tortured a slave as much as I've tortured you.
So his master was angry, and delivered him to the jailers. He shall be punished until he pays back everything he owed.
This is how my Father in heaven will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
Isa knows about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. He saw them there.
Some Pharisees came to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Then Jesus answered, "Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator made them male and female? (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and they become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two, but one. Therefore, a man should not separate what God has joined.
They asked, "Why did Moses command a man to give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Then Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But from the beginning it was not so.
Here's what we tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man may divorce his wife only if she is unfaithful to him.
The students said to him, "If that is the case between husband and wife, it is better not to marry."
Then Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of celibacy. Only those who are given the ability to live without marriage can accept it.
Some men are unable to father children because they were born that way. Some have acquired this condition through the actions of others. Others have chosen it to serve the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept living this way truly does so." Small children are presented to Jesus.
People brought their little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them. For to such belongs the kingdom of heaven."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he went from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came up to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
"Which is the good one?" asked Isa. "There is only one good. If you want to enter the kingdom, obey the commandments."
"Which one?" the man asked. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness.
Honor your father and your mother (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and "Love your neighbor as yourself" (Leviticus 19:18)
"I've defied all of their orders," the young man said. "Who else do I need to disobey?"
Then Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all you have, give the money to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
And the young man went away sad. He was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "What I am about to tell you is true. It is hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven.
"The more I tell you, it is difficult for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. But it is even harder for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God."
When the disciples heard this, they were amazed. They asked, "Who then can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "For mortals, this is impossible, but with God, all things are possible."
Peter replied, "Let's take everything you have! What's the prize we'll get?"
"What I'm going to tell you is the truth," Jesus told them. "When new things happen, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then those who followed me will sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who was the owner of a field. He went out early in the morning to hire laborers to work in his vineyard.
And he agreed to pay them the usual wage for a full day's work. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
At 9 a.m., Tani went out. He saw other people standing in the market doing nothing.
He told them, "You go too and work in my vineyard. I will give you your wages."
They left. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock and did the same thing.
Around five o'clock he went out and found others standing around him. He asked them, "Why have you been standing here all day doing nothing?"
"Why didn't we set a limit?" they said. He told them, "Go ahead and take as much as you want from my vineyard."
When evening came, the master of the vineyard said to the foreman, "Call the workers and give them their pay. Begin with the last and go on to the first."
The workers who were hired around five o'clock came. Each one received the usual daily wage.
So when those who were hired first came, they thought they would receive more. But each of them also received the usual daily wage.
As soon as they received it, they started criticizing the owner.
Those people you hired only worked for one hour, they said. You paid them the same as you paid us. We did most of the work and were under the hot sun all day.
The owner answered one of them. He said, "My friend," "I am fair with you. Didn't you agree to work for a regular daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to give the others who came later the same pay I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my money? Did you feel deceived because we gave it to someone who isn't easily accessible?
"So those who are last will be first, and those who are first will be last." Jesus speaks again of his death.
Jesus wanted to go to Gethsemane. On the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak with them.
"We are going to Mount Calvary," he said. "The Son of Man will be surrendered into the hands of the religious leaders and the law experts. They will sentence him to death."
"After that, they hand him over to the Jews. The people mock him and strike him. They crucify him on the cross. On the third day, he rises from the dead!" A mother asks Jesus for a favor.
The mother of Zebedee's sons approached Jesus. Her sons accompanied her. She fell at his knees and asked him for a favor.
"Which one do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "He promised me that one of your sons will sit at your right hand in your kingdom. He promised me that the other will sit at your left."
"You don't know what you're asking," Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the cup I am about to drink?" They answered, "We can."
Jesus said to them, "You will drink from my cup, but it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or left; that place belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten students heard about this. They want to be angry with the two brothers.
Jesus gathered them together and said, "You know the rulers of the Gentiles, for they rule over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them.
Do not be like that. On the contrary, anyone who wants to be important among you must be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first must be a slave to you.
Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom to set many free. Two blind men receive their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed him.
Sitting by the roadside were two blind men. They heard that Jesus was passing by, so they cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood up and called to them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
"Our Lord," they said, "we wish to see."
Jesus felt deep compassion for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,
He told them, "Go to the village ahead of you. As soon as you arrive, you will find a donkey tied up. Take its reins and bring it to me."
If anyone says something to you, tell them that the Lord needs them. The owner will send the money right away.
This happened so that what the Prophet said would come true. He said,
Say to the city of Zion, "Wait, your king is coming to you. He is humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
The students went and did what Jesus told them to do.
They brought the donkey and the colt. They laid their cloaks on them. Then Jesus sat on the cloaks.
A large group spread their cloaks on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people went before him, and some followed after. Each one was saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered the mountain, the whole city returned. The people asked, "Who is that?"
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleansed the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area. He began to drive out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers. He also overturned the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you have made it a 'den of robbers.' (Jeremiah 7:11)"
Blind people and those who were not well came to Jesus at the temple. He healed them there.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple area, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw this, they were indignant.
"What are these children saying?" they asked. "Yes," Isa answered. "Don't you read in the Scriptures? 'From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus went out from among the people and left the city, going to Bethany. He spent the night there. In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry. He saw a fig tree by the roadside and went to it, but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And immediately the fig tree withered.
Early in the morning, Jesus returned to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He walked to it but found nothing on it except leaves. He said to it, "I am not seeking fruit from you again," and immediately the tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?" they asked.
Then Jesus answered and said to them, "What I tell you is the truth. You must have faith and not doubt. Then you can do what was done to the fig tree. You can say to this mountain, 'Go and throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done."
"If you believe, you will wait for what you love when you pray." Jesus' authority is honored.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you this authority?"
Then Jesus answered and said, "I will ask you one question; if you answer Me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? From heaven or from men?" They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say "of people"? We are afraid of people. All people believe that John was a prophet.
So they said to Jesus, "We do not know." Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. The Parable of the Two Sons"
What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the sons and said to them, 'Sons, go work today in the vineyard.'
"Don't count on it," the boy said. But then he changed his mind and left.
After that, the father went to his second son. He told him the same thing. The son replied, "Yes, Father." But he didn't go either.
Which of the two sons did what his father wanted? They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live. But you did not believe him. Yet the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. I have seen this. And even then you did not repent of your sins and did not believe him. The parable of the tenants.
Listen to another story. A man had a piece of land where he planted a vineyard. He built a wall around it. He dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. He leased the vineyard to some farmers and then went to a distant country.
When the time for the harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the vineyard. He said to his servants, "Gather the fruits that are due to me."
But the tenants held on to his servants. They beat one of them. They killed the second one. They threw a stone at the third one to kill him.
After that, I sent other men to rent out again. I sold more than I did the first time. I rented them out in the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants saw the boy coming. They said to each other, "This is the one who will take all the owner's property when he comes. Let's kill him. After that, everything will be ours."
They seized him and drove him out of the vineyard. Then they killed him.
Where is the owner of generosity? What does he do for the tenants?
"He will destroy these wicked people," they said. "Then He will lease the vineyard to other vinedressers, who will give Him his share of the produce at the harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
This is what we say to you: The kingdom of God is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in their field. It is the smallest of all seeds, but once it is sown, it grows up and becomes the largest of all garden plants. It puts out large branches, and the birds of the sky nest in its shade.
Anyone who falls on that stone will be broken. But the stone will crush anyone who falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' stories. They knew he was talking about them.
So they began to think about how to observe him. But they were afraid of the crowds. The people believed that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Tale
Jesus told them more stories. He said,
Here is something like the kingdom of heaven. A king attended his son's wedding feast.
He sent his servant to those who had been invited to the banquet. The servant said to them, "Come." But they refused.
Then he sent other servants. He said, "Tell those who have been invited: 'I have prepared my dinner. I have slaughtered my fattened calf and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.'"
But people didn't pay attention to him. One was going to his field. Another was going to his work.
The rest they took as slaves. They treated them badly and then killed them.
The king was very angry. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come.
Go to the road junctions. Invite for dinner anyone you can find.
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad. Soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to see the guests. He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding attire.
"Hey, man, how did you enter here without wedding gifts?" The man couldn't say a word.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet. Cast him out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Many are called, few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They plotted to entrap Jesus in His words.
"You sent your disciples to him. You sent the Herodians along with them. 'Teacher,' they said, 'we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by others, no matter who they are.
What do you think? Should we pay taxes to Caesar or not?
But Jesus knew their wicked plans. He said, "You hypocrites! Why are you trying to test me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay their taxes." He was given silver coins.
He asked them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words?"
"Caesar," they said. And he replied, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed. They dismissed it and went away. The wedding when the dead rise.
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They did not believe that people rise from the dead.
"The teacher said, 'This is what Moses commanded us: When a man dies and leaves no sons, his brother shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother, so that his brother's name may not be blotted out.'"
We were seven brothers. The first one got married and passed away. He had no children, so he left his wife to his brother.
What happened to my second brother and my third brother happened even to my seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
Well, when the dead return, who will be his wife? The answer is that all seven were married to her.
Jesus replied, "You are wrong, because you do not know the Scriptures, and you do not know the power of God.
They die without getting married. And their parents don't get married either. And they will be like angels in paradise.
What should we do with the dead who rise? Didn't you read what God said to you?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob" (Exodus 3:6). He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the crowd heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, so they gathered together.
One of them was a scholar of Islamic law. He tested Jesus with a question.
"The teacher asked, 'Which verse of the law is the most important?'"
Then Jesus answered, " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Love him with all your mind.' " (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important of the commandments.
"You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"Everything written in the Law and the Prophets is based on these two commandments." "Whose son is the Messiah?"
The Pharisees were assembled. Jesus asked them,
What is your opinion about Christ? Whose son is he? "The son of David," they say.
He said to them, "How then did David call him 'Lord'?" The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. And David said,
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." (Psalm 110:1)
So how does David call him "Lord" while he is his son?
No one could get a word out of him. From that day on, no one dared to ask him another question.
Jesus pronounces judgment on the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and his disciples.
"The scribes and Pharisees sit on Moses' seat," he said.
You must obey them. Do everything they tell you to do. But don't do what they do. They don't practice what they preach.
They tie heavy loads and place them on people's shoulders. But they themselves don't want to lift a finger to move them.
Everything they do, they do to be seen by others. On their foreheads and arms, they wear a small bag containing verses from the Bible. They make the bag very wide. And they make long decorations on their clothes.
They all want to sit in the place of honor at the dinner. They want to have the most important seat in the synagogue.
They like to be greeted in the streets. They like it when people call them 'Lord'.
But you're not called "Lord". You have one Master, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
It's not right to call you "teachers." You have one Teacher, and that is Christ.
The most important among you is your servant.
He who raises his head will be brought down, and he who is brought down will be raised up.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock the door of the kingdom of heaven in the faces of men; you yourselves do not enter, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.
(No
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.
Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated to fulfill it.'
You are my uncle and stupid! What's more important? Is it gold? Or is it the structure that sanctifies gold?
You say, "If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing. But if anyone swears by the gift on the altar, he is bound by his oath."
Oh, my finger! What's more important? The gift? Or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
For everyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
And whoever swears by the temple, swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and Him who sits on it.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.
Oh blind fools! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
What sorrow awaits you, teachers of religious law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You clean the outside of cups and dishes, but inside you are full of greed. You want only the best for yourselves.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate. Then the outside also will be clean.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean.
That's how you are. From the outside, you seem to be right. But inside, you're full of garbage. You don't reveal your true self.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And they say, 'If we had been living in the days of those who came before us, we would not have followed their deeds, nor would we have been accomplices in the killing of the prophets.'
"So you bear witness against yourselves. You admit that you are the children of those who killed the prophets."
Keep on committing the sins that those before you started!
You're a nest of venomous worms! How will you escape hell?
For I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and chase them from city to city.
For you are paying the price for the blood of all the righteous that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
What I'm going to tell you is the truth. All of this is going to happen to those who are alive now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
See your house is empty.
We tell you, do not see us again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord" (Psalm 118:26)
Signs of the End Times
Jesus went out of the temple. He had gone a little way when his disciples came to him, and wanted to draw his attention to the buildings of the temple.
"What are those things even?" asked Jesus. "I'm going to tell you the truth. Not one stone here will be left on another. Every stone will fall."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There his disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Wait! Be careful that no one deceives you.
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will deceive many.
You're going to hear about wars. You're going to hear people talking about upcoming wars. Don't worry. This has to happen. But the end is not here yet.
Nation against nation. Kingdom against kingdom. People will be hungry. There will be earthquakes in many places.
All this is the beginning of labor pains.
Then they will hand you over to be persecuted, and you will be killed. All nations will hate you because of me.
In those days, many will turn away from their faith. Some will hate each other. Some will betray each other to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise. They will deceive many people.
Why is evil increasing, while most people's love is growing cold?
But those who endure to the end will be saved.
These are good news for the queen, they will be rejoiced throughout the world. It will be a testimony to all nations. Then will come the end.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination that causes desolation" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). The day will come when you see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
After the state's efforts, they flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof descends to his house to get something.
No one in the field goes back to take their coat.
How terrifying it is for pregnant women in those days! How terrifying it is for nursing mothers!
Pray you don't need to flee in winter or on Saturday.
There will be great suffering in those days, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, and never will be again.
If time were not shortened, no one would survive. But for the sake of God's chosen people, it will be shortened.
In those days, some people will say to you, "Look, the Messiah is here" or "There he is." Do not believe them.
False Christians and false prophets will appear. They will perform great miracles and signs. They will try to deceive the chosen people of God, if possible.
See, I told you before.
If someone tells you, "He is in the wilderness far away," do not go there. Or if someone says, "He is deep within the house," do not believe it.
"Lightning comes from the east and is seen in the west. So will it be when the Son of Man comes."
Gulls gather wherever there's a dead body.
After the terrible suffering of those days, "the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
In those days the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.
He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His chosen people from the four corners of the earth. They will bring them from one end of heaven to the other.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. As soon as its branches become tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
In the same way, when you see all this happening, you know the end is near. It's by the door.
What I'm going to tell you is the truth. People who live in that time won't die until they experience all of this.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. No one knows the day or the hour.
I do not know when that day or hour is, not even the angels in heaven know, nor the Son, but only the Father.
Consider how it was in the days of Noah. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people ate and drank. They got married. They gave their daughters in marriage. They did all these things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing about what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. That's how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
Two men will be in the field. One will take and the other will stay.
Two women are grinding some mint. One takes and one leaves.
"So wait, for you do not know what day your Lord will come."
You don't understand anything. It's like if the homeowner knew where the thief was coming from at night. That's how the guard was. He didn't let his house be broken into.
"You also, be ready; for the Son of man comes at an hour when you do not expect him."
Suppose a master set one of his servants in charge of the others in his house. The servant's job is to give them their food at the proper time. The master wants a faithful and wise servant for this.
A sweet path for the servant if the master finds him serving when he returns.
I should tell you the truth. My master came to put this servant in charge of everything in the kingdom.
But suppose this servant is wicked. Suppose he says to himself, 'My master is delayed.'
Suppose he starts beating the other servants. And suppose he eats and drinks with those who drink too much.
Surely, My Lord will grant freedom to that slave on a day when he will be of no use to him. He will come at an hour unknown to the slave.
After him, they will kill him piece by piece. They will send him to the place where the imposters go. There, people will cry and pull out their teeth.
"A Tale of Ten Brides"
Here is what the kingdom of heaven will be like at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them are stupid. Five of them are intelligent.
The foolish ones took their lamps, but they did not take olive oil with them.
Those who had wisdom took the oil in their jars along with the lamp.
The groom hasn't come for a long time. So all the brides cried and fell asleep.
In the middle of the night, a voice cried: "The bridegroom! Come out to meet him!"
After all the brides got up and placed their lamps in preparation.
The fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil. Our lamp is going out."
"No," they said. "There might not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to the oil seller. Buy some for yourselves."
So they went to buy oil. But while they were on the way, the bridegroom arrived. He went in with the bride, and the door was locked.
After that, the old spinsters came. They said, "Sir! Sir!" "Open the door for us!"
But he said, "What I'm going to tell you is the truth. I don't know you."
Stay seated on the wind. You don't know the day or the hour the groom will come. The story of three servants.
Once again, this is something like the parable of the rich fool. A man went on a journey. He called his servants and entrusted his possessions to them.
He gave $10,000 to one. He gave $4,000 to another. And he gave $2,000 to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could handle. Then he went on his journey.
The servant who had received $10,000 immediately went and invested his money. He made an additional $10,000.
He who has $4000 earns $4000 more.
But the man who had received $2000 went away and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his mistress's money there.
After a long time, the master of that gang returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 brought another $10,000. He said, 'Sir, you gave me $10,000. Look, I've made an extra $10,000.'
Sido said to him, "You did well, a faithful and honest servant! You were honest for a little while, that's what I applaud you for. Come and drink with your master, Farhou!"
The man who had $4000 got it. He said 'Sir' and told me to take $4000. See, I took an extra $4000.
Sido said to him, "You did well, a faithful and honest servant! You were honest for a little while, that's what I applaud you for. Come and drink with your master, Farhou!"
Then came the man who was owed $2000. He said, "Sir, I knew you were a harsh man. You reap where you did not sow. You gather crops where you did not scatter seed.
We were afraid. I went out and hid your 2000 dirhams in the ground. Look, this is yours.
Sido said to him, "O Abdi Sher, do you know where I will be reaped if I do not sow? Do you know where I will be gathered if I do not sow?"
Be careful, you were about to take my money to the bank. When I returned, I got it back with interest.
Then his master commanded the other servants, 'Take the two thousand dollars from him and give it to the one who has twenty thousand dollars.'
"Whoever has will be given more. They will have more than enough. What about those who have nothing? Even those who have will have some taken from them."
Leave that worthless slave outside. Out there in the dark, people are going to cry and gnash their teeth.' Sheep and goats
The Son of Man is coming in all his glory. All the angels will be with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne.
All the nations will be gathered before him. He will separate the people into two groups, like a shepherd separating the sheep from the goats.
He will take the sheep to his right and the goats to his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Father, bless you. Come and take what is yours. It is the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in.
When I needed clothes, you gave them to me. I was sick, and you healed me. I was in prison, and you came to visit me.
After those people who did good deeds, the 'Lord' will ask them, "When did we see you hungry and give you food? When did we see you thirsty and give you drink?"
Where did we see you as a stranger and invite you? Where did we see you in need of clothes and dress you?
Did we ever see you sick or in prison and come to visit you?
The king replied, "What I'm going to tell you is the truth. Whatever you've done for one of my younger brothers, you've done for me.
Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.'
I was hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I was thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not take me in. I was in need of clothes. But you did not give me anything. I was sick and in prison. But you did not visit me.
They will also answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, and not help you? When did we see you a stranger, or needing clothes, or sick, or in prison, and not help you?'
He's going to say, "What I'm about to tell you is the truth. Whatever you didn't do for one of these least brothers of mine, you didn't do for me."
After that, they will go to suffer forever. But those who did the right thing will have eternal life.
The plan to kill Jesus
Jesus finished speaking all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
After that, he met with the chief priests and the elders of the people. They gathered at Caiaphas' palace, the high priest.
They devised a plan to capture Isa by tricking him. They wanted to kill him.
But not during the feast, they said. The people might cause trouble. A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon, who had leprosy.
Marajat gave Issa a sealed bottle of expensive, enhanced musk. She poured the musk over his head while he was sitting at the table.
When the students saw the gift, they got angry. "Why this gift?" they asked.
The perfume could have been sold for a high price. The money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus knew about this. He said to them, "Why do you trouble this woman? She has done a good work for me."
You will always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.
A scent fell upon my body, preparing me for the grave.
"What I'm telling you is the truth. What I've done is spoken wherever it's spoken, this good experience throughout the world. It's spoken of in its mention." Judas agreed to hand over Jesus.
One of the thirteen went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He asked, "Who is it that betrayed me? To whom did you give Jesus?" They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that hour, Judas sought an opportunity to betray Jesus to them. The Last Supper.
It was the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
He said, "Go to the town to a certain man, and say to him, 'The teacher says, "My time is near. I want to keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'""
The disciples did as Jesus commanded them. They prepared the Passover meal.
When evening came, Jesus was at the table with the twelve.
While they were eating, he said, "What I am leaving with you is the truth: one of you will hand me over to my enemy."
The students started crying a lot. One by one, they began saying, "Not me, God, is it?"
Then Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me.
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to him who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.
It was Judas who betrayed him. He said, "Not me, Lord, is it?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
And they continued eating. Jesus took the bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them. He said, "Each of you drink from it."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.
Here is something to give you. From now on, I don't want to drink with you again until the day we drink together in my Father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus says Peter will deny him.
Jesus said to them, "This night, every one of you will fall away because of me. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered' (Zechariah 13:7).
But after we rise from the dead, I will go before you into Galilee.
Peter replied, "Everyone might leave you, but I will never abandon you."
"What I'm going to tell you is the truth," Jesus replied. "This is going to happen tonight. Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times that you don't know me."
But Peter said, "Even if we have to die with you, we will not deny you." The other disciples said the same. Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
Then Peter and the two sons of Zebedee followed him. They began to mourn and weep.
He then said to them, "My spirit is very deceived. I feel that I am near death. Stay here. Watch with me."
He walked a little farther. Then he fell on his face to the ground. He prayed, "Abba, Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
He went to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Can't you keep watch with me for an hour?" asked Peter.
See and connect. You won't fall into sin when you converse. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Jesus went away again. He prayed and said, "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; but if you say to me, 'Go,' I will go."
He came back. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. For the third time he prayed the same thing.
Then he went back to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near. The Son of Man is about to be handed over to the sinners.
"Come on! Let's go! The one who is going to hand them over to me is coming!" Jesus was arrested.
And while Jesus was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve. He was accompanied by a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was going to hand Jesus over to them, had agreed on a signal with them. "Whomever I kiss is the one," he said. "Seize him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Then Jesus said, "Friend, do what you came to do." So the men came forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus told him. "All who take the sword will perish by the sword.
"Don't you think we shouldn't rely on my father? He will immediately raise an army of over 70,000 angels."
But how then are the sacred books certain? They say that it must happen this way.
At that time Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I leading an armed force against you?" he asked them. "Do you have to come out with swords and clubs to arrest me? Every day I was among you in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me."
But all this has happened that the words of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left Jesus and fled. Jesus was taken to the Sanhedrin.
Those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
Not far away, Peter followed Jesus. He went as far as the courtyard of the high priest, where he entered and sat down with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for some way to bring charges against Jesus, so that they could put him to death.
But they found no evidence, even though there were many false witnesses before. Finally, other witnesses came forward.
They said, "This man claimed, 'I can destroy the temple of God. I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Will you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
Yes. It is as you say, Jesus replied. But I tell you all, in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty. You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven.
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy with your own ears."
"How are you?" they asked. "He who must die, must die," they said.
Then they spat in his face. They struck him with their hands. Others slapped him.
They said, "Tell us, Christ, who hit you?" Peter said he did not know Jesus.
Peter was sitting outside the house. A servant came to him. "You were also with Jesus of Galilee," she said.
But before all of them, Peter said he wasn't. "I don't know what they're saying," he said.
He walked out the door to the courtyard. There, he saw him again. She told the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He said no. "I don't know the man," he swore.
A short while later, those who had been standing there went to Peter. "You have no choice but to be one of them," they said. "How did you speak? How did you deceive?"
So Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
After Peter denied Jesus three times, Jesus said to him, "Always remember, 'Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.' Peter went outside, weeping bitterly and laughing hysterically.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early morning. All the chief priests and the elders of the people decided to put Jesus to death.
They bound him and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt deep shame and regret for what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priest and the elders.
"I cheated," he said. "I handed in a cured leg." "So what?" they replied. "That's your problem."
So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
The spiritual priests lifted up the money. They said, "It's not legal to add this money to the temple's fund. This is blood money. Those people took this money at the expense of a man's death."
So they decided to use the money to buy a pottery field. People from other countries would come to visit it.
Thus it was named the Field of Blood to this day.
Then the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He said, "They paid thirty pieces of silver, the price set for him by the people of Israel.
"They paid me thirty pieces of silver, as the Lord commanded me" (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus was presented to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" "It is as you say," Jesus replied.
But when the chief priests and elders brought charges against him, he did not reply.
Then Pilate asked him, "What? Are you hearing that they are bringing these charges against you?"
But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge. This truly shocked the governor.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people chose whom they wanted.
At that time they had a famous prisoner named Barabbas.
When the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were envious. He knew that this was the reason they had delivered Jesus to him.
While he was sitting on the judge's chair, his wife sent him a message. She said, "Don't deal with that man. He is innocent. I suffered a lot in today's dream because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
Which of the two do you want me to release? asked the governor. Barabbas, they answered.
"What have we to do with Christ? Let him be crucified!" said Pilate. All answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done?" asked Pilate. But they cried out all the more, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere. In fact, the crowd was becoming angry. So he took water and washed his hands in front of them. "I am not responsible for this man's death," he said. "You are!"
Everyone answered, "We and our children will accept the guilt for his death."
Pilate released Barabbas, but he had Jesus scourged. Then he handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus to the palace, which was called the Praetorium. All the rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They took off his clothes and put a purple robe on him.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a reed in his right hand. And they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
They attacked him. They hit him on the head with the stick again and again.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him. Jesus was crucified on the cross.
As they led him out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon, and they forced him to carry Jesus' cross.
Java is named after a place called Golgotha. The word Golgotha means the place of the skull.
There were those who mixed wine with bitter spices and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
And they did not crucify him, but they plotted [to kill him]. They disputed [among themselves] at the cross, dividing up his garments among them by casting lots.
They sat down and found him there.
Above his head they placed the inscription that read, "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
Two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by shouted insults at Jesus and mocked him. They shook their heads.
He said, "So you are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
In the very temple of the priesthood, the teachers of the law, and the elders, they mocked him.
"Let him save himself," they said. "He is the king of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He trusted in God. Would that God might save him now if he is pleased with him. He said, "I am the Son of God."
In the very grammar, the thieves who were crucified with Jesus mocked him. Jesus died.
From noon until three in the afternoon, the whole land was covered in darkness.
Around the third hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who were standing here heard Jesus shouting. They said, "He is calling for Elijah."
Immediately one of them went and got a sponge. He filled it with sour wine, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The rest said, "Leave him alone, let's see if anyone comes to save him."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook. The rock was split.
The graves were opened. Many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised and became alive.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus rose to life, they entered the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman leader and those who thought Jesus was just a man saw the earthquake and everything that happened. They were afraid. They said, "Truly he was the Son of God!"
Not far away, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to serve him.
Mary Magdalene was there. Mary the mother of James and Joseph was there too. As was the mother of Zebed's sons. Jesus is buried.
As evening approached, a rich man from Jericho named Joseph came along. He had become a disciple of Jesus.
And walked to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate commanded that it be given to him.
Yusuf took the body and wrapped it in a clean cotton shirt.
He placed her in his new tomb that had been hewn out of the rock. He rolled a large stone in front of the entrance to the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The tomb guards.
The following day was the day after the day of preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
"Sir," they said, "we remember something that liar said when he was alive. He said, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
Keep giving the order to secure the tomb until the third day. If you don't do this, his disciples might come and take the body. Then they will tell people that Jesus has risen from the dead. This will be the last lie, even greater than the first one.
"Take two guards with you," Pilate replied. "Go. Make sure the tomb is secure as best you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.
Jesus rises from the dead.
It was Saturday evening. It was dawn on Sunday. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
It was a powerful earthquake. The angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so frightened of him that they trembled and became like dead men.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
He's here! He did it, just as he said he would! Come and see the spot where he was bartering.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.
So the women hurried away from the tomb. They were afraid, yet filled with joy. They ran to tell the disciples.
Suddenly, Jesus met them. "Peace be upon you," he said. They came to him, seized his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." The guards reported this to the chief priests.
And while the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened.
And the chief priests and all the elders made a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money,
They told the soldiers, "We love it when you say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears this report, we'll get him to work. He'll keep you out of trouble.
The high priest took the money and did as he was instructed. This story has spread everywhere among the Jews to this day. The last commands of Jesus to his disciples.
After that, the eleven disciples went to Galilee. They went to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they worshiped him. Yet some still had doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Truly you must go and teach all nations. Baptize them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
"May they obey everything I have commanded you. And you are sure that I am always with you, to the end of time."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
"I will send my messenger before you, who will prepare your way" (Malachi 3:1).
A voice in the desert says, "Clear the way for the Lord. Make straight paths for him."
And John came. He baptized people in the desert. He also preached that people should be baptized and repent of their sins. Then God would forgive them.
All the people from the Judean countryside went out to him. All the people from Jerusalem went out as well. When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
Here is what John was preaching: "After me comes one who is mightier than I, so strong that I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus was baptized and tested.
In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
Jesus was coming up from the water. At that moment, the sky was opening. He saw the Holy Spirit descending on him in the form of a dove.
A voice spoke to him from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
He was in the desert for 40 days. There, the devil tempted him. Wild animals did not hurt Jesus. Angels tended to him. Jesus chose his first disciples.
After they imprisoned John, Jesus went to Galilee. He preached the good news of God's kingdom.
"The time has come," he said. "The Kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the Good News!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake. They were fishermen.
Come. Follow me, said Jesus. "I will make you fishers of men.
Immediately they cleared their windows and followed him.
After Jesus had walked a little further, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat, mending their nets.
Immediately he called them. They left their father Zebedee in the boats with the hired workers. Then they followed Jesus. Jesus cast out the evil spirit.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, he went into the synagogue and began to teach.
People were amazed by his teaching. He taught them as if he had authority. He did not speak like the religious scholars.
At that moment, a man in their midst, who was under the control of an evil spirit, cried out,
Who are you and I am Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to burn us? I know who you are. You are the Saint of God!
"Be silent!" Jesus said firmly. "Come out of him!"
The spirit of evil shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a loud cry.
Everyone was amazed. They asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching with such authority! Even the evil spirits obey him!"
News about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. They went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon Peter was sleeping on a bed. He had a fever. They told Jesus about this.
She's fine now. Take her hand and help her up. The fever has left her. Then she started serving them.
Always in the evening, after the sun had set, the people brought all their sick to Jesus. They even brought those who were possessed by demons.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They had all kinds of diseases, and he cast out many demons. But he would not let the demons speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus often withdrew to solitary places and prayed.
It was very early in the morning, and darkness still covered everything. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Then Jesus said, "Let's go somewhere else. I want to go to the nearby towns. I must preach there too. That's why I came."
So he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. Jesus heals a man with leprosy.
A man who had a skin disease came to Jesus. On his knees he asked Jesus, "If you want to, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep anxiety. He reached out and touched the man. "I am willing to do it," he said. "Be clean."
Immediately, his illness left him. He recovered.
Jesus let him go immediately. He gave him a strong warning.
"Don't tell him that," he said. "Go and see the priest. Offer the sacrifices prescribed by Moses. This will be a testimony to the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to speak immediately. He spread the news to everyone. Therefore, Jesus could not enter a city openly. He remained outside in desolate places. But people still came to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
Two days later, Jesus went back to Capernaum, and the news spread quickly that he was home.
The people were so numerous that there was no remaining space, not even outside the door. And Jesus came and spoke to them in parables.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who couldn't walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after removing some tiles, they lowered the man on a mat.
Jesus saw their faith. So he said to the man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Some Sharia teachers were sitting here. They were thinking,
What does it mean when he talks like that? He's saying something good and evil! Only God forgives sins!
Immediately Jesus knew in His spirit that they were contemplating this in their hearts, and He said to them, "Why are you thinking about these things in your hearts?
What's better to tell this man, "I've forgiven you" or "Get up, take your stuff, and leave"?
"We want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who couldn't walk.
He told me, "Get up. Take your things and go home."

One Sabbath Jesus was walking through grainfields with his disciples. They began to pick some heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do such things on the Sabbath. Why do your disciples do it?"
He said, "I didn't read about what David did. He and his men were coming. They needed bread.

Some of the Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.

Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save a life or kill?" But no one answered.

A family heard about his need. So they went to take care of him. They said, "He's crazy."
