Does the chapter talk about the choice in the kingdom of heaven?
And when they had come to the place, he said to them, "Pray that
He gave Jesus to one of the newborn and stood him in the middle of them.
"I'll tell you the truth: unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven." Mark 10:15
And whoever humbles himself like this young man, he is the chosen one in the kingdom of heaven.
And whoever welcomed a child in this way, my name welcomes him.
And the one who fell in the dunes was one of these small ones who believed in me, so that's why he tied a big millstone around his neck and was thrown into the sea.
Oh, woe to the people of the world for the things that cause them to sin! They will inevitably fall into these things, but woe to those who cause them to do so!
Otherwise, your hand or your leg will throw you into the pit, cut them and throw them at you, so that you may enter eternal life with one hand or one leg, and not have two hands or two legs and be thrown into eternal health. When
Otherwise your eye will plunge you into the abyss, take it out and throw it at you, so that later you may enter life with one eye, and not have two eyes and be cast into the fire of hell. Matthew 5:29 The lost sheep
When you make a small change, we say to you: "Their angels are in the heavens, always with those in the heavens."
"Man has come so that he may save the people who need it." # 18.11 This verse is not found in many of the old manuscripts.
What do you think? Unless someone has a hundred sheep and one of them is lost, and what would you do if you didn't find the lost sheep and went to the mountains and looked for it?
I'm telling you the truth: except for meeting him, he was more happy with the good news and the 90% than you could imagine.
"Hey, you guys, up in the sky, don't even want one of these little ones to get damaged." The one who was cursed
"Except for your brother's debt, your right, go to him and dispute with him, except between you and him, unless he listens to you, you will have won your brother, look"
Otherwise, he won't hear, you have one or two with you so that every word is confirmed by two or three witnesses.
Otherwise, he won't listen to them, tell the people of the church, or he won't listen, consider him like someone who worships idols or someone who doesn't pay taxes.
I tell you the truth: whoever has committed sin is a slave to sin. 16:19; John 20:23
And I say to you again: unless two of you agree on earth as to what they should ask for, it will be granted to them by My Lord, whatever it may be.
Wherever you gather two or three in my name, there I am in their midst." The example of the slave who does not forgive
And Peter drew near to Jesus and said, "Lord, how many times shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?" Luke
And the Pharisee said to him, "Why, Jesus, do you go seven times, but seventy times seven times?"
On this, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wants to settle accounts with his slaves.
And I started to account with them, they brought me one of them with a debt of millions of dirhams of silver.
And if he did not have enough money to pay it back, the master of the house should sell him, his wife, his children, and everything he owns to pay the debt he owes.
The slave prostrated before him and said: "Be patient, my lord, and I will repay you for all that is due to you."
His master took pity on him, divorced him, and allowed him to keep the debt.
And when the slave left, he found one of the slaves who had given him 100 dirhams in silver, and he grabbed him and hung him and said: Return to me what you asked for!
His friend fell at his feet, asking him: "Be patient and we will return you what is due to you."
But he didn't pay, so he was thrown into prison until he repaid the debt he owed.
And when they saw their slaves doing something, they were very sad and went to tell their master about what had happened.
His master said to him: "This slave of mine is not good! You allowed me to do all this because you wanted me to, and I did it."
Why didn't I show mercy to your servant like I showed mercy to you?
The lady worries, and the groom is concerned that he will be imprisoned and fined for what he owes.
"The way to heaven is going to lead you, but only if you give it from your heart."
Chapter 9: Jesus teaches about divorce
And when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.
And many people followed him and he healed them.
And the Pharisees came to him and tested him, saying, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
He answers them and says: "Did you not read in the book of Allah that Allah created a man from the Bedouins as a male and a female?"
Waghl: This is why the man is not happy and is not united with his wife, and they are not one unit.
"And two will remain, but only one will be left. And what God has joined, no man can separate."
The Pharisees said to him, "Why did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?" (Matthew)
Jesus answered them, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning."
Rani ngulilkom: Lli tluq martah ila xi sibab min ghayr al-fasad watazwwab bi ghayriha, rah kayfasad." Matthew 5:32; 1 Corinthians 7:10,11
"My students told me, 'If this is the man's condition with women, it's better for him not to get married at all.'"
Jesus answered them, "Not everyone can accept this statement, but only those whom God has enabled to accept it."
Where there are people born from the belly, they are not able to get married, and there are those who are sent back like this. And there are those who do not get married before the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can understand this understands it." Jesus blesses the little children.
People brought small children for him to lay his hands on them and pray with them, and they argued with the children about who brought them.
But Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven."
He laid his hands on them and walked away. The young man who was wearing the clothes.
A young man came to him and said, "Teacher, what good work can we do to have eternal life?"
Jesus replied, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. If you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."
He asked him, "What are the commandments?" Jesus replied, "You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness,
"Tell your father and mother, and ask the one who is close to you how to tie your head."
The young man said to him, "I followed all these instructions, what else do I need to do?"
Jesus replied, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
But when the young man heard this, he walked away sadly, as he was very embarrassed by his clothes.
"Jesus said to his disciples, 'I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of heaven unless they are born again of water and the Spirit.'"
And we add to you: entering the camels from Ain Leïba is easier than entering those who wear the kingdom of Allah!"
The students were amazed when they heard this and said, "On this account, who can escape?"
Jesus saw them and said to them, "People can't do this, but God can do everything."
Peter replied, "We left everything and followed you, what will be our reward?"
And Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, when the Son of Man sits on his throne in heaven's glory, you will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
And whoever allows, neither his father nor his brother, nor his brothers, nor his father, nor his mother, nor his children, nor his land, before my name, he will be given back what he allowed a hundred times, and the eternal life with Allah.
Many of the Haddocks who were the last will be the first, and many of the first will be the last.” Matthew 20:16; Luke 13:30
Chapter twenty: the metal of the servants in the vineyard of the grapes
"The kingdom of heaven is like a man who had a vineyard, he went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard."
And he gave them a dinar for the day and prepared their graves for his paradise.
Jawā'ah al-Tasawud came out in the morning and found other servants standing in the market without any service.
He says to them: Go until we reach our paradise, and I will give you what you deserve.
Mushā'u. Wa kharaja tani jawā'h at-tanāsh d al-nahār, wa 'awad kharaja fat-thalāthati d al-nahār, wa zād khadā'a kharin.
And he went out again at five in the evening, and he found other servants standing and he said to them: Why are you standing here all day without doing anything?
They replied: "Because we have not served him at all." And I told them: "Yes, go until we reach our paradise."
And when evening came, he called the master of the garden to his agent: "Call all the servants and give them their freedom, and start from the last ones until you reach the two."
Hadoc came at 5 pm and took one dinar from each of them.
And the two came, and they were told that they would be paid more, but they were only given one dinar each.
And when they were done, they started to fight over the king's son.
Wakilolo: Hadok al-khareerin khadamu ghayr sa'ah wada'atihim fil-khassa ma'ana huna al-li baqina khadamin al-nahara kamila fil-shams.
He replied to the king's son, one of them, and said to him: I have not cheated you, my friend, did you agree with me on one dinar?
Ewa, take your right and go your way! And this is what came at the end, I wanted to give it to you.
"And don't I have the right to spend my money as I wish? Or are you jealous because I'm generous?"
And Jesus said, "The last shall be first, and the first shall be last." Matthew 19:30; Mark 10:31; Luke 13:30 Jesus foretells for the third time of his death and resurrection.
And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took his twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,
"We are going to Jerusalem, and someone is going to hand over the Son of Man to the chief priests and the scribes of the law, and they will condemn him to death."
And they will deliver him to those who do not know God, who mock him, strike him, and crucify him, and on the third day he will rise from the dead." Then James and John asked Jesus to grant them their sons this favor.
Zabdi's mother and her children went to Jesus, and they bowed down to him and asked him to do something for them.
"What do you want?" she asked him. He told her, "I want you to put my son on your right hand and the other on your left in your kingdom."
Jesus replied, "You don't know what you're asking for, can you drink the cup of suffering that I am going to drink?" They said to him, "We can."
I told them: "Yes, Kassi will drink it, but the glass on my right and left side is not for me to give, as it will only be given to those who found it for them."
And when the ten disciples heard this, they were very concerned about Jacob and his brother John.
Jesus said to them, "You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. But it is not so among you. Rather, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave— just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." Luke
And all this we do not want to be your information. But whoever wants to be great among you, let him be your servant. Whenever
And whoever wants to be a leader among you, should especially serve your Lord.
"And the son of man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many." Jesus healed two blind men.
And as they were going out from Jericho, a great multitude of people followed Jesus.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they began to cry out, "Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!"
And they would threaten the people to keep quiet, adding more and saying, "Mercy upon us, O son of David!"
And Jesus stood still, and said, Call ye him.
They replied, "We want our eyes to be beautiful, sir!"
And Jesus looked upon them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. And they looked upon him, and he saw them, and they followed him.
Chapter 21 Jesus enters Jerusalem
And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives,
I told them: "Go to the roundabout in front of you, behind you there is a tied donkey with a cart, untie them and bring them to me."
Otherwise, if you tell me something, tell me: "The Lord needs them, and He will give them to you."
And all this happened so that the words of the Prophet who said:
"To the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your king comes to you, humble and riding on a donkey, and a colt, the foal of a donkey.'"
And the disciples were amazed at the boldness and power of the words that Jesus commanded them.
The donkey and the foal were brought, and they laid their garments on them, and Jesus sat on them.
A large group of people spread their belongings on the road, and others cut down tree branches and spread them on the road.
And the crowds who went before Jesus and those who followed him, from Kephar Kama and Kephar Humrah, said, "Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"
And when I entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in turmoil, and they began to ask, "Who is this?"
The people's groups answered them, "This is Jesus the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus was walking through the markets and bazaars of the House of God.
Jesus entered the house of God and overturned the tables of those who were selling and buying there, and overturned the tables of those who were exchanging money and the chairs of those who were selling doves.
I said to them, "You write in the book of Allah that my house will be called the house of prayer, but we have turned it into a house of swords!"
And he came to him in the house of God, people who were blind and lame, and he healed them.
But the leaders, the men of religion and the scholars of the law were worried when they saw the miracles that Jesus performed, and when they heard the children saying in the house of God: "Glory to the Son of David!"
And they said to him, "Why do you hear what they say?" And Jesus answered them, "Oh, how long have you not read what God says: From the mouth of the little children and those who are nursed, you have brought forth praise?"
And after they left, he went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there. Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
And in the morning, when he was returning to the city, he was very hungry.
He saw a vineyard on the side of the road, walked towards it and found nothing but the vines. Jesus said to him, "The harvest will not last forever!" And at that moment, the vineyard began to bear fruit.
And when they saw the boy doing that, they were amazed and said, "How did the vine become so crooked?"
Jesus answered them, "I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' it will be done. Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours."
"Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe and you will receive it." Who gave authority to Jesus?
And when Jesus came to the house of God, where he knew, the leaders of the clergy and the elders of the people came to him and said to him: "What is your authority to manage this? And who gave it to you?"
Jesus answered them and said to them, "I also want to ask you one question, and unless you answer me on it, I will tell you by what authority I do these things:
"Where did John's baptism come from? Is it from God or from man?" They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Why then did you not believe him?' But if we say, 'From man,' all the people will stone us, because they are convinced that John was a prophet."
Otherwise, we'll get it from the people, we're afraid of the people that they will think John is a prophet."
They answered Jesus and said to him, "We do not know." And he said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Aash dzahr lekum fowahed al-rajal kanaw 'indhu jowj d al-walad, wamashi 'ind al-lol w-qaal lahu: Sir 'awladi w-khadam al-yawm f al-jannat d al-'inb d-dayali."
His son replied and said to him: I didn't want to. But in the end he regretted it and left.
The boy went to the other boy and said to him as he had said to the first, and he replied, saying: "Oh, my lord! But he didn't go."
"Eiwa shkon fahad djawj li dar Murad baha?" They replied, "The wolves." Jesus said to them, "I will tell you the truth: those who are without sin and corrupt will precede you to the Kingdom of God."
Later, John 21:32 refers to John the Baptist. You came to follow the path of truth and did not believe in him, but you believed in the tax collectors and the corrupt. And even after seeing this, you did not repent and did not believe in him." Luke 3:12; 7:29,30 The metaphor of the vine and the branches
"Listen to another metal: this man had a land, he planted a vineyard, built a wall around it, dug a press and built a tower, and he left for a while."
And when the time came to harvest the grapes, he sent his slaves to the vineyard to collect the harvest.
Wanadjou al-Junainaina, Qabto al-'Abid, and Daraboo 'Ahad, Qatlu 'Ahad Akhar, and Rajamu 'Ahad Akhar bi al-Hajar.
Wa'a'oud Sa'ifat 'Ubayd khayrin kutr min al-lulin, wa-daru lahum al-janayinah kayfa daru lil-khayrin.
And then he said to them, "My son is coming, and they will respect him."
But when they saw the Jnainines, the son of Muljannan said to them: "This is the one who is going to take the throne! By Allah, we will kill him and take his throne!"
They dragged him out and killed him in the garden of the vineyard.
"Eiwa, except for Ja Moul Jnan d'l'Ennib, what specifically makes you think he's going to the Djebel Jennaïne?"
They replied, "Those wicked ones will have a bad end, and they will not give the grapes of paradise to other sinners who will give the harvest at that time."
And Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone. This is the Lord's doing; it is marvelous in our eyes'?"
Here's what I can tell you: God's kingdom will take from your hands and give to the people who give the yield of it.
Behind the one who fell on this room, his limbs will be crushed, and the one on whom the room fell will be crushed."
And when he heard the chief priests and the scribes, he spoke to them, saying, "What is it that you are trying to do to me?"
They began to wonder how to get him to listen, but they were afraid of the people's groups that would think he was a prophet.
Chapter 20: The Metal Dragon of the Wedding Procession
And Jesus spoke to the people again about the kingdom, saying:
"He likened the kingdom of heaven to a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son."
The slaves' overseer gives them a look at the available items, but they don't want to come.
Wa'a'oud Sa'eesat 'Ubayd kharin waqal lahum: "Qulou lilmura'idina: Rani wajid al-'urs wa dabbat al-baqar wa al-'ajul as-sama' wa kul shay' raha muwjid, 'iwa aj'oo lal-'urs!"
But they didn't treat her, some of them went out to the field for her, and some of them went to buy and sell.
Two other people from the crowd were dragged by his slaves, tortured and killed.
The king and his army officers were worried, and they lost the battle and burned their city.
He says to his slaves: The wedding is here, but those we offered it to don't deserve it.
Eiwa Siro Daba lafen kitalgao al-taraqatan wa-waddu 'ala kullu wahid laqithu li-al-`irsa.
The slaves went out into the streets and gathered everyone they found, neither the beautiful people nor the wretched, and even the old woman of the wedding house was treated to hospitality.
And the king entered to see the guest, and he saw that the man was not wearing the wedding clothes.
He said to me: Why did you come here with your friends and we're not wearing wedding clothes? The man fell silent as he had nothing to say.
The king says to the servants: "Take him by his hands and feet and throw him into the darkness outside. That's where the crying and the gnashing of teeth will be."
"There are many who offer, but those who choose are few." The salvation of the tax is for the Caesar.
The Pharisees' spokesman said to them, "Let us see if Jesus will do a miracle on the Sabbath so that we can accuse him of breaking the Sabbath."
They took their children to the Herodians and said to him, "Sir, we know that you are a truthful man and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth, and you do not care about appearances, for you do not look at a man as he is.
"Ewa, tell us what's on your face? Is it okay to pay the tax to Caesar or not?"
Jesus knew their prohibitions and said to them, "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?
"Give me the money so I can pay the tax!" He gave me a dinar.
And he asked them, "Whose is this picture and these writings in these coins?"
They said to him, "It's Caesar's!" He said to them, "What belongs to Caesar, give to Caesar, and what belongs to God, give to God!"
And when they heard it, they were amazed, and left and went away. The question is about the matter of the dead.
Your day came to Jesus two of the Sadducees who denied that the dead would be raised, and asked him: the works
"My Lord, Gal Moussa: unless a man dies and leaves no sons, his brother should marry his wife so that he can have children with Sita, his brother's wife."
We had seven brothers, one of whom got married and died, and when he had children, he left his wife to his brother so that he could marry her.
He did it again for the second, third, and seventh times.
And then after they all died, the woman died too.
Ewa, who among these seven was the man of this woman on the day I sent her? Because they were all her men."
Jesus answered and said to them, "You are mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God."
Where I sent them, people did not get married and they will not get married, but they will be like angels in heaven.
As for the matter of the dead, did you not read the words of God to you when He said:
Am I the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living."
And when the people heard this speech, they were amazed at his teaching. The great commandment
And the Pharisees heard the news that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, and they gathered with their own people.
One of them, a lawyer, tested him to trap him in his words, and he said, "Teacher, what should I do to inherit eternal life?"
"Oh my lord, what is the great commandment in the law?"
Jesus replied and said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind."
Hadi is the great testament and the Loli.
And the second commandment is the same: you want what is close to you, how you want your head.
And on this two commandments the whole law and the prophets hang. Luke 10:25-28 Christ and the Prophet David
And the Pharisees were gathered together, and the scribes of the people came to him out of every town.
"What did the scribes say about Christ? Who was his father?" They answered, "David's son!"
He says to them: "Yes, how did David receive the revelation of the Spirit of God? He cried to Him when God said:
God said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."
"Ewa illa Dawood kayiyt l-Masih Rabbi, kifays ghidkun l-Masih wlih?"
And no one even responded to him with a single word, nor did anyone from that day on ask him any other questions.
Chapter 23: Jesus advises his disciples to beware of the religious leaders and Pharisees.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
"The scholars of the Sharia and the Pharisees are the ones who have the right to interpret the law of Moses."
Eewa ɣaɛ lli kɛɛwluh lekum, diru byih wata'bohu, madda tdiraws f'aayilhum ḥayt madda kɛɛdiraws dakki lli kɛɛwlu.
To tie bundles of tales and difficulties on the shoulders of people, but they do not move even a finger to shake them with them.
Otherwise, they do something to make people see them, and to expand their gangs on their chests and foreheads, and to lengthen their guns.
And Kibgayo will be in the chosen places for the parties, and the places for the lululem in the prayer houses.
And people greet Qibghio in the street and say to him: "Sir."
But we do what you want us to do: O my lord, since you are all brothers and have one master.
And what do you call anyone in this world, when you have one father, the Father in heaven.
And do not let anyone give you anything: you have one teacher, the Christ.
And the greatest among you shall be your servant. Whenever
Wherever it is that he is lifted up, there he will be humbled. Luke 14:11; 18:14
But woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the door to the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.
But woe to you, scholars of the law and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you eat the houses of widows and as a pretext recite long prayers. Therefore, you will receive a more severe punishment than others. # 23.14 This verse is not found in many of the old manuscripts.
Oh, how welcome are the scholars of the law and the Pharisees, the hypocrites! Why do you go through land and sea to bring back one Jew, and when I call him a Jew, you bring him back, he deserves hell more than you do, twice!
Welcome, dear officials! Say that the one who swore by the house of God is not acceptable, but the one who swore by the gold of the house of God will fulfill his oath.
Ahad al-hamak wal-ameen! Amana Hasan, al-dhahab illa Bayt Allah al-kird al-dhahab muqadas?
And they said again: the oath sworn by the slaughterhouse is not acceptable, but the one who swore by the gift above it, especially fulfills his oath.
Oh, the blind ones! Why is it good? The slaughter, or the slaughterer who makes the slaughter sacred?
Where the one who swore by the slaughterhouse would swear by it and by the whole thing above it.
And whoever swears by the House of Allah, swears by it and by Allah who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by heaven, swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it. Matthew 5:34
O welcome, you scholars of the law and hypocritical Pharisees! You feast on mint, cumin, and camomile, but you neglect the important things in the law, which are justice, mercy, and faith. It was for you to manage these things without leaving matters to others.
Oh, you high officials! You interpret the law as you please, but you make a mess of the sentences.
O woe to you, the scholars of law and the Pharisees, the hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside you are full of greed and self-indulgence.
Ahad al-Faris al-Ami! Nqayf fil-lul al-kas wal-tabasil min laddahil, bash julayyoon nqayif hatta min bara.
O woe to you, the scholars of law and the Pharisees, the hypocrites! We are like the graves that are beautiful on the outside but inside they are filled with the dead and all manner of filth.
And until we are done, we write to the people from outside who are seeking God, but from within you are filled with hypocrisy and sin.
O woe to you, scholars of the law and hypocritical Pharisees! You write the graves of the prophets and adorn the gardens of the righteous.
And they said: If we had lived in the time of our ancestors, we would have all participated in the battle of the prophets.
And you will bear witness on your heads that you are the sons of Hud who killed the prophets.
Ewa, we must continue what our grandparents started.

On that day, they will be divided into three groups: the prophets, the judges, and the scholars of the law. Some of them will be killed, some will be imprisoned, and some will be beaten in your prayer houses and chased from city to city.
Let the punishment fall upon you for every pure blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of Abel who was awaiting God's mercy to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, who was killed between the holy place and the altar.

"Jerusalem, Jerusalem! You who kill the prophets and stone the messengers to you. How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing."
And here is your house, which will remain in ruins for you.
Hani Kangol says: "You won't see me from now on until you say: 'Congratulations on what's coming in the name of the Lord.'"
Chapter 24 Jesus prophesies that God's house will be destroyed
And Jesus went out and departed to the house of God, and his disciples came to him so that he might show them the house of God.
And Jesus said to them, "Have you seen all this? Truly, I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down." Signs of the end of the age
And as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered them, "Let anyone who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her."
Where many people came and took my name and said: I am the Messiah! And many people were mistaken.
After you hear about the war and the news of the war, and when you have to leave! All this is inevitable, but this will not be the end of time.
Where people will attack people, and a kingdom will attack a kingdom, and hunger will come, and many places will be hit by earthquakes.
But all this is nothing compared to the Bedouin of pain.
The clock will hand you over to the one who is going to run you over and kill you. And the people of the world will not call you by my name. When

Chapter 26: The Jews of Kitchawro ordered Jesus to be killed.
And when Jesus had finished all these words, he said to his disciples,
"As you know, Easter is not two days from now, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the people to be crucified."
Spending your time, gather the leaders of the clergy and the sheikhs of the people at the house of Caiaphas, the leader of the clergy.
And they conferred among themselves that they should entice Jesus with a question, and kill him.
But they said, "We can't do this during the holiday, or the people will get out of control." The woman who was blowing the wind on Jesus
And Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper.
A woman with a very expensive perfume was near him, and she would splash it on his head when he was sitting at the food table. Look.
And when they saw their children doing this, they were not pleased and said: "Why this waste?"
"Where this perfume could be sold at a high price, and its price would be distributed among the poor."
And when Jesus knew that their hearts were troubled, he said to them, "Why are you troubled? What do you think about the things that they say to you?"
Where poverty is always with you, but I will not always be with you.
They are the sisters of this smell on my data, because their sisters should find me for the dead.

Wasting your time, one of the foolish disciples you called Judas Iscariot, went to the leaders of the clergy.
I said to them, "What will you give me if I surrender to you?" They agreed to give me thirty pieces of silver.
And from that time Judas began to look for a way to betray Jesus. The Passover meal with the disciples
And on the day of the unleavened bread festival, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?"
And he answered them, saying, "Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples."' "
And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
And when it was almost evening, Jesus went out to a mountain by himself to pray.
They said to them, "We tell you the truth: one of you is going to betray me."
The students were very sad and each of them began to ask, "What have I done, my lord?"
He answers them and says: "Whoever wants to help me with the washing, that's the one who is going to deliver me!"
The path of the human being is as written in the book of God, but woe to the man who does not deliver the human being, it was good for him that he was not born."
He asked Judas, who had agreed to betray him: "What am I, my lord?" Jesus replied, "You said it." The Lord's Supper
And when they had eaten, Jesus took the bread and gave thanks and broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
And after God, the cup, and thanks to God, and their gifts: "Drink from it all of you,"
This is my blood, the blood of the covenant that was shed for the forgiveness of many sins.
And I say to you: from today on, we will not drink this grape juice again until the day we drink it with you again in the kingdom of Ba.
And after that, praise God and go out walking to the Mount of Olives. Jesus predicts that Peter will deny him.
And Jesus said to them, "This very night you will all fall away from me, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'"
But after I followed from death, I preceded you to Galilee." Mattai
Peter replied to him and said, "And why does everyone complain about you? I have never doubted you!"
And he said to him, "Truly, I say to you, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."
And Peter answered, "If we must die with you, we will not deny you!" And this is what all the disciples said to him. Jesus prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane.
Fadaak al-waqt jaa 'Isa maa t-talamid diyalih li wahid al-jannat samaytuh Gethsemane, wa-ghali lahum: "Galsu huna wa-manna nashru du'a tam!"
And after that, Peter and the sons of Zebedee, James and John, were with him, and he began to feel sorrow and great distress.
He says to them: "I am very sad, even to death, they stayed here and kept me company!"
After a while, he bowed and started to pray, saying, "Oh! It's possible after this ordeal, but not as I wanted, but as I wanted it to be."
And then he went back to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?
"Seroo va solee baash ma tahtoo-oosh faltas-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-
He walked for the second time and prayed and said: "Oh! Unless this ordeal could not have gone far from us without us tasting it, yes, it would only be your will."
He returned and found them drowsy, as sleep had overcome them.
He left them and walked again, and prayed for the third time and repeated the same words.
Then he went to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? The hour is approaching, and the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of sinners."
Noodjoo nomchiou! Hadaak lili gissalmani jay”. Yesouu kichd
And while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived with a large crowd of people armed with swords and clubs. The chief priests and the elders of the people sent them.
And the one who handed it over was given a sign and told them: "The man you are accusing is this one, take him!"
And he brought him to Jesus. And when he was at Jesus, he said, "Peace to you, sir!" And he kissed him.
He said to Jesus, "Why did you come to my friend?" They approached Jesus and dragged him away.
One of the guards who were with Jesus reached for his sword, struck the high priest's servant, and cut off his ear.
And Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place. For all who take up the sword will perish by the sword."
What do you think, am I not able to cry now on Ba and dismantle more than ten bands of the army of the angels?
"But how can the words in the book of God, which say that this is a special thing, be true?"
And Jesus said to the crowd at the hour of his passion: "Why have you come out with swords and clubs to capture me like a bandit? Every day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But all this has taken place, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Luke
But all this has to happen so that the things written by the prophets may be fulfilled." At that very moment, the disciples were overcome with fear and fled. Jesus was taken before the Jewish court.
But the officers who had Jesus in charge took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had gathered.
Peter followed him from a distance to the house of the religious leader, and he entered and sat with the servants to see what was going on.
And the chief priests and the elders of the people conspired to have false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death.
But they didn't find anything, and a lot of false witnesses came. And then two of the witnesses came forward.
They say, "This man said, 'We can't build the house of God and then die, can we?'" John
The head of the clergy and Jesus's soul are saying: "And what are you going to respond even to something about this that these men are testifying against you?"
But Jesus remained silent, and the religious leader asked him, "I have come to you in the name of the living God, tell me, who is the Christ, the Son of God?"
Jesus replied, "You have said it! But I will tell you this: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty and coming on the clouds of heaven!"
I want to tell you something, said the head of the clergy, and he said, "This is infidelity! We have nothing to do with the witnesses, we have heard his infidelity."
"Eiwa ash ban lekum?" They replied, "He deserves to die!"
They slapped his face and beat him, and a couple of them slapped him.
"Galilee: 'Yahweh predicted to us that the Messiah, who is it that struck you?'" Peter knocks Jesus
Peter was sitting outside, and the servant came to him and said, "You were also with Jesus the Galilean!"
We said to all of them who were present: "I don't know what happened to me!"
And then, he walked to the door of the house and saw another servant and said to them who were there: "This one was also with Jesus of Nazareth!"
Peter denied it again and swore, "I don't know the man!"
And after a while, those who were standing came and said to Peter, "Surely one of them must be you, for you are a Galilean!"
Bada Kile'en wa Kihlef wa Kikhol: "Ana Gha' Ma Kena'raf Hadd Rajul!" And after a while, Furoj woke up.
Peter thought about the words Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." He went out and wept bitterly.
Chapter Twenty-Seven
And in the morning, the leaders of the clergy and all the elders of the people agreed with Jesus that he should be killed.
They bound and beat him, and then handed him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor. Judas Iscariot then hanged himself.
And when he saw that Judas, who betrayed him, was there, he was deeply grieved and said to the chief priests and the officers of the temple and the elders, "Take these, all of you, and carry them to the price of the blood of the Son of Man." For they were willing to accept it. And he took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the temple and departed and went and hanged himself.
I told them: "I went to the bathroom because I had to pee." They told me: "That's our business, take care of yourself."
Juda threw the silver into the house of God, and then he went and hung his head.
And the heads of the religious men said to the silver workers: "It is permissible to give it to the house of God, for it is the price of a man's blood."
They agreed to buy the Fekhari farm and turn it into a park for the Berbers.
And to this day, people still call this land "Faddan al-Fadda" or "the land of blood."

And in this dream, I saw a Pharisee, as the Lord had instructed me." Jesus before the governor Pilate
And Jesus stood before the governor who spoke to him and said, "What is this? You are the king of the Jews?" And Jesus answered him, "You have said it."
And the leaders, the men of religion and the sheikhs, would ask them, but they would not answer them until they needed it.
And Pilate said to him, "Why did you not hear all this that they testify against you?"
And Jesus did not answer him even with one word, and the governor was very surprised at this.
The custom of the ruler was that every Easter, one of the prisoners who people wanted to be released would be released.
They had a rooster at one o'clock, a famous prisoner named Jesus Barabbas.
And when he had gathered the crowd, he asked them, "Which one do you want me to release for you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Where Pilate knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered Jesus to him.
And when Pilate was seated on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that just man, for I have suffered much today in a dream because of him."
But the leaders, the priests and the elders stirred up the crowds to ask Pilate to release Barabbas for them and to crucify Jesus.
Pilate said to them, "Who do you want me to release for you?" They replied, "Barabbas."
Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said to him, "Let him be crucified!"
I asked them, "What is the worst evil?" But they increased their shouts and said, "Crucify him!"
And when Pilate saw that nothing was helping him, but rather the crowd increased, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this man. You see to it!"
The whole people answered him and said: "Don't let his blood be on us and our children!"
And at the sixth hour darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour. And at

And after they had laughed at him, they took the linen cloth away from him, put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him. Jesus was led away to be crucified.
And they were taking him out of the city, they met a man from Kairouan, whom they called Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross of Jesus.

I had a watch with two daggers, one on the right side and the other on the left side.
And the people who were there to mock him were the ones who were mocking their own faces.

And the religious leaders, the scholars of the law, and the sheikhs would even laugh at him and say:
"Other people survived, but he couldn't save his head! Unless he was the King of Israel, he would come down from the cross now and they would save him!"
Yak ho tkol ala Allah! Ewa y'attikh daba illa ba7ah, hadi ho ghal: Ana wlad Allah!
And the swords that you give him, you adorn him like another. The death of Jesus
Darkness fell over the entire country from the end of the day until three in the evening.
And as he was answering the three of them, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
And they heard one of the Haudok who was standing there and said: "He's crying for Elijah,"
One of them went and took the edge of the towel, poured the water, and held it to the head of one of the barbers and made him drink.
They tell others, "Let him be, we'll see what happens, maybe Elijah will come and save him!"
And Jesus spoke again in a loud voice and died.
The raw materials of the House of God are on two, from top to bottom. The earth trembles and cracks the rock.
The graves are decorated and followed by a lot of people who are considered holy and have died.
And they came out of the tombs after they had followed Jesus from the dead, and they entered into the holy city of Jerusalem, and they appeared to many people.
The centurion and the soldiers who were with him, guarding Jesus, when they experienced the earthquake and what took place, became very frightened and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
And many women who followed Jesus from Galilee, who had come to serve him, were standing there, watching from a distance. Luke

In the evening, a man dressed in a robe from Ramah named Yusuf, who was also a disciple of Jesus, came.
This man entered and approached Pontius Pilate, the governor, and asked him to give him Jesus' body. And at that hour, Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
And God gave Joseph a pure cotton shroud.
And he placed it in the new grave that he had dug in the rock, put a large stone on the grave's door and walked away.
Mary Magdalene and Mary of Clopas were standing in front of the tomb. The stone was in front of the tomb.
And tomorrow, after the day that precedes the Sabbath, the chief priests and the Pharisees will gather before Pilate.
"We think, sir, that this liar, if he were alive, would have said that he was sent after three days. When?"
Ewa gave the order for your guard to stay on the grave until the third day, so that his children do not come at night to steal it and tell the people: "He was sent by death!" And this terrible lie would be like a lie of the liar."
Pilate said to them, "You have a guard; go, make it as secure as you know how."

Chapter 22 Jesus Follows from Death
And when the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene and Mary the other came to see the tomb.
On a sudden, a strong earthquake occurred, where the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, came and sat on the stone at the door of the tomb.
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white like snow.
The soldiers trembled with fear and looked like the dead.
But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid! I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
The road we were on here, where he died like he said. Come see the place where he was shot.
"And go with the basket and tell his disciples that he has been taken from death, and if you precede him to the garden, then where you see him. I have told you."
The women came out of the grave, scared and very happy, and went to tell the news to their children.
Jesus meets them secretly and says to them, "Peace be with you!" They draw near to him, clasp his feet and worship him.
And Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell My brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see Me." The guards went and told this to the chief priests, and they, when they heard it, were perplexed.
And the women were going, they sent two of the guards of the tomb to the city and informed the leaders of the men of religion about what was happening there.
And they gathered with the elders and consulted on this, and they bribed the soldiers with a lot of money.
"Tell them: 'The students came at night and stole him, and we were asleep.'"
Otherwise the governor will spread the news, we will convince him and you won't even expect anything bad."
And God gave the soldiers the money and the order, and this news has been passed on to the Jews until today. Jesus charged his disciples
And the disciples, when they had come to the other side, forgot to take bread.
And they did not prostrate to him, but two of them did.
And Jesus came near to them and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth."

The chapter of John the Baptist to find the way to Jesus
This is the Bedouin of the announcement of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As written in the book of the prophet Isaiah:
The voice of Kibrah echoed in the desert and said: "Hani, the Prophet of God is in front of you, he will show you the way."
And John came into the wilderness, baptizing, and preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. And the people came out to him both out of Jerusalem, and all of Judea, and all the region around Jordan, and were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
And all the people from the land of Judea and Jerusalem came out to him, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.

I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." John baptized Jesus.
