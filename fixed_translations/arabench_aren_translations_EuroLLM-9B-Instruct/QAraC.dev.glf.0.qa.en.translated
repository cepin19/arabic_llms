I am saying the words that you do not want to understand, Salah.
Any problems, open your heart, open your mind, open the world around you, open the people around you, what do you do in the world, what do you do
If his brother is older
What wants to develop himself and develop those around him
Ya Saleh, la turkab ra'sak
No, no, no, no, I don't owe you anything.
Walk in the path
Two cut dates pass.
And you are a dead man, Maliyev.
Eat or don't eat.
No, I won't eat.
Humans agreed.
Really, I don't know where he lives.
I wanted with him
This is our chance, by Allah, our policies are old and their models have failed.
Try, try again with him after a while and may God bless you.
These are normal and known things.
The bull, but the one that has no personality
Yes, by God, he is afraid
I am the one who is tired, mother.
The budget is in his hands.
What is this project that he is holding?
A larger government project
Beneath it and what is revealed
I have the right to take
You are in the Ministry of Health and in a second ministry
Call your mother, you forgot.
Yom F Qaraj
I mean, I am
I consider myself a contributor with them
What happens is that nothing comes out unless the project is fine.
And I have nothing.
It means that I am a contributor after
We all take the imposed.
This government project
He understands the boy this way.
I understand him.
Goodness is a treasure.
This is a government project.
And this is your chance.
Like your mother, you are a liar.
Chinese kindness is very much like you
Take your bite and put it in your mouth
Ariel had a secret in his pocket.
I heard his voice in my mind
You know the government's projects.
And one-third suction
Son Salim
Going to Souq Waqif
One lantern eighteen rials
Put it in the budget
And eighty arials each are illiterate
They said we didn't do anything.
I've set up a meeting with him
I seek refuge in Allah from Satan.
Eh, I have a feeling his head started to ache a bit.
I hope so, Lord.
Ahoh is the chairman of the committee and everything is under his control.
The most important thing is not to forget us.
A quarter of you are us.
And we must be together, you know.
And this government project is an opportunity.
Of course, Ali.
And we cannot do without you.
We recommend you, Ali.
And God willing, all those who are part of the project team
This is for sure.
Yesterday, I and my friends were at Insolv.
We are on your side, you.
As members of the project committee, we are confident
Fearing the well-being of the chairman of this committee
They say that he
I congratulate you, Ali.
And reassure the community
Yes, by Allah, O Bu-Fahd.
By Allah, you promised me good, but you didn’t tell me.
Then don't forget, Sa'oet.
No, no
Thank God everything is going well.
Healthy is the same as free from illness
Ava alayk.
I don't know what's going on with the old man
It means
Sure, as long as you are with us, you are a contributor to the project.
But the most important thing is that the issue is between us.
Easy Chinese, live and meat are near you.
I need to eat
Honey and good health
In you is something
If you shave every day, you'll look like that.
We are done.
In this state, we will never finish.
Or any inquiry, say
Yes, we have appointed and cooperated
How do we take our share?
It's unbelievable.
Aschbenktab oop.
Then you see, it's not just us who are taking
Everyone who contributed to the project is asking for their rights
Why not
No fear, Saleh.
We are the ones who set the budget
And the piece of land he bought today and registered in his name.
I met her later
He says he buys them.
You, where are you from, my friend?
I'm connected to you today.
Call your brother's phone, I say.
He said to him, "Good."
Your brother has arrived, so hurry up.
The second earth
The shoes I bought for him yesterday.
They agreed to sell it.
He says, "Call him and tell him to register it in his name if he wants it."
Yebi Ekoosh 'alayha 'abroohuh
And our right
We consider ourselves to be his contributors.
Even if we are not contributors
The largest bite you can take is to go away
You are depriving your brother's right and your mother's right with you.
I don’t need any advice from you.
We are also contributors to the project and we have the right to demand our rights.
Tell her, tell her
Ahoh, it's true, yesterday when I went to Sultan and asked him to leave.
But I didn't let him.
And it is wrong if you do not allocate a budget for the project.
The first stage
You are not inferior to others.
Members of the committee who are with him
Listen to Isolf with them on the phone.
Let's bring in their brothers and their friends
I'm sure this government project is the way forward.
We don't want a fixed amount and we're going to get
Meras Mal.
If my brother Sultan wants to ban meetings with us, he can
Because the committee members
Project budget
But what is needed is
What did you fail to do?
Protect Allah, He will protect you in a good way.
Brother
You don't like it, do you?
They are helping us with the project.
Let me mention some
We distributed the tasks fairly.
You, Saleh
And I am good at laying tiles, bricks, and concrete.
And the rest are electrical and water things that I left for myself.
Hey guys
Determine your share
"By Allah, I am"
I say hours to take a lump sum
And hours I say
Leave it as a percentage
No problem, Saleh is no problem.
Take what you want and the way you want it.
The most important thing is
But we are still here
Eikon f hdhi al-is'baa'
Everyone determines the amount they are willing to risk.
For example, it means
After a day, he found himself.
He wants his mother to give him a thousand more.
Why does this habit mean so much
Otherwise, you will be punished.
I'm with you.
Even after the contributors
Jablaw nabak shaglak ma alikum
You have orphans who are halal.
Or, or, or, or, increase the budget, increase it
Tara al-akila waid mashallah
The most
What is this, this is Abu Mal's money, not your money.
Any Sultan
O Sultan, O my brother
It means that he is considered a contributor.
This is the last name.
Saud Rafijak, this is the most names he has put
Ezid Ezid Ismail says they are all killed
I want to put it in either the percentage group or the lump sum group.
Don't mix it with tararouh.
Aad jam btahtin lah, at-tahtin lah, ya'ni ḥṭi lah ʿashrah filaf.
Ey bas
Even in a note here, two writers
One of the families in our neighborhood
But this is Saud's list, which is longer than Abdulaziz's list.
All of it will be in the first stage budget.
Just as you feel, so it is.
Ahe Bagi Bagi the list that my mother gave me
Every two hours you call and I add people as I see fit.
God bless her long life, haha.
Look into my eyes, Julide.
And the one who gives you will see her as sick, poor, and miserable.
She's back, and she's got nothing.
Oh my God, I'm giving it to you, but this is the last one.
Tell him "Zara'a jbad"
This moment is enough for you.
Jum is enough for me, a job, a house, and a hospital.
Ameh and eighty thousand rials
You are very beautiful, you are being blackmailed
Only one, but it will be expensive.
What God has given you, put her name on the list.
Husaynah Ay Husaynah Bint Ahhal
And you will give it from your pocket
Reassure him and tell him that from the second stage, nothing remains.
180,000
Son of a righteous man, he will ride her with a new saddle.
Tell him to tell me to increase the amount, and after two thousand, I will buy gifts for the girls.
I say 2000
Arial, that's me.
Ayesha Bint Ahliāl
I can fail you with your girlfriends.
No, I don't.
You see, I have a lot of work.
Then I'll talk to you later.
So they increased the ones who eat from the Chinese bowl.

Mother came back
You and your conscience
I am the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And I say, you deserve a million.
They will define the project tomorrow, it will start tomorrow
And we will pay the first installment, inshallah.
We need to know everything
One time payment or installments
This is more than us.
In a stroke of suction, keep them quiet, the committee is waiting for them now.
"Yallah, he said, 'Yallah, Yallah,' he told you to shut up, meaning shut up."
Yes, you're really shy and I can't imagine
If you hear a single sound from you
To cut the year short, cut
Oh, lengthen the gathering
You know, this is a big mess, not just a little thing.
Before it was a gem
Fifty million
What is Junk Oil, Jella Oil, Ahwi?
In the end, you are the president.
We don't want to see your head uncovered.
We rely on the budget
Through your talk about the project, Mr. Saleh, we notice that the project is also vital and important.
And this is what Allah has given you, not just for this generation.
Yes, yes
Tomorrow the project's electronic phase will open.
We thank you for your attendance and congratulate you.
And I welcome
On this occasion
The United Nations
Where is the project's Iudona?
We are in where
We are where?
This is the situation.
You are the one who made the officials go crazy, and the people applauded them.
We were at the official opening of Ashfield
Which means you guys are going to Hajj, which means we are in the project
Who are we in the project?
People of Ararat, you have fallen
And this box, I don't know what they're putting in it.
There is no work in the box.

I saw her in my spirit and she had a big necklace on her.

Walk to the store and you're sitting at home, relaxed.
Why the harm, oh Yabeh, don't let anyone play with your mind, oh Sheikha Manira.

They are afraid for your share and invest it for you
There is a fishy smell in my room
Her brothers give her Ariel from her father's share.
We don't know these things
This is a legal right.
This is a trust issue. You don't trust us.
Mother, how is it
What I liked about my brother Rashid's speech
I go and get the injection that they give me every three months.
This is my real name.
Tell me everything.
You don't trust us.
The inheritance and money issues must be handled with clarity.
And I was not comfortable when my father was there
You are teaching what you do to people
And these are Salim's at the poor thing's.
Who would believe that she is the heir to millions?
Abashed her brothers
Fools destroy the world
But the truth is the truth and this is the law of God
And then it means
We are running the company
We invest in land, real estate, and money
No problems and no head issues
It says that it was heading towards the earth in the sky
But a lot on it

Any previous

This is the story.
She's planning to make up stories for us.

Everything is known
Forty thousand have changed
What hell do they invest their money in?

You're right, my father, you know everything about the Arabs and money, it's not how they do it.

It doesn't matter to you
The khanfarsh is ready.
Yay, yay, inshallah, I'm leaving with safety.
What's up, the chicken is ready, wait for me, and then we'll eat it.
I will finish all the papers for you, inshallah.
Your chance to see your car today
Their manager told me he is traveling.
And Mali created
Even Mali himself moves.
Zein Tarash had a problem.
You are officially considered free.
God bless you
Now I can finally relax.
What a failure, bye bye, Abu Abdulaziz.
Lord, bless me.
There is no work.
You are not bound by it.
I'm so happy for you.
Which human resources
Thank you, thank you, goodbye.

My dear, I can't.
I have a deal with my father to finish it for me.
The flower cried.
Well, bye, mom.
My father is a hard worker.
God be with him now.
He worked a lot and now he's finally resting.
So he can relax.
He said, "Make me a hookah."
I did it and prepared it.
Antarah signed
Fear Allah in this old man, have mercy on him, have mercy on the Sunnis.
It's your turn now.
Tomorrow I will eat it.
The poor guy wants to relax.

Wow, I'm tired.
I don't get tired of them.
I will not tell them.
I was going to do the bank transaction and I was going to do my daily routine.
And I will threaten, and if anyone is late, woe to him.

I won't go to the branch in the market after they tell me there's no guarantee.
God willing, by God, with peace
Feny got a sunstroke.
The sun rises.
I entered my neighbor's house.
The worker recognized me.
She said to me, "I will heal you."
Your witnessing of God will guide you
No, I'm not going to be a fool, Saeed.
Mama, where is my father now?
From the loyeh
This is after what any bank says.
They told him the papers were missing.
Take a taxi.
Mama, we had a meeting with the manager.
The important thing now is how my father is, God willing, I will see him.
Rought ashwi fgni w'ya'r ras
This is what I want to tell you, how much.
Let your father rest.
Poor you, Saeed.
They must adhere to attendance after these reports are written about them and on them.
How are you?
Ayeh, Baba Shaheen.
You can say about me that I am not a liar and not a liar
How does it mean
The first of those years
We are destined for hardship.
Your relatives are real.
We must help them.
And poor people say to me
By God, you have no history.
Nowadays, young people who don't have parents can't complete their transactions.
A job is a job,
In a job that allows you to leave, it means it allows you to go out
May Allah reward you with goodness.

I will do the transaction honestly and my son is happy
The ministry is the one that I thank for the coffee.
Taking her as our country's pride after God, we will help her.
Goodbye
Mama, I'm okay, I'll be back in a letter. BYE
Tra la mb ahsen lak
This is a warning to you.
Because I heard you say the truth, Saeed.
Your father is ill.
I don't owe you anything.
So, your father, if he complains to you
I don't care.
And what he speaks
Behaltou lewoztoh khafa Allah f halrial.
Your screams woke me up and I'm still here, what's going on?
You were a government employee and you know what inventory means.

There is nothing, there is nothing, there is nothing.
A man returned from Barwa and Wahwah was silent.
Our word returns to you
No shame, no fear
You don't blame your father, so don't take a stand against him.
If you like it, that's it.
May Allah reward you with the best for your efforts.
The person who was supposed to call you has called you.

Thank you very much.
Your welcome, my dear.
May Allah bless you.
We decided from the day we are going
We will complete our transactions ourselves.
What a shortcoming, my father. May Allah reward you with the best. Thank God.
But the one who delivers you, oh Yabeh.
Consider it the last one
But I can't do it.
Call me now.
I don't go to the minister, he doesn't go to me.
Don't get the minister upset with you
Don't get upset, you have to go after him, go, go, go, this talk doesn't make sense, this is everything except the minister.
I don't know what to say, I don't want to bother you.
No, don't tell me and don't tell you
Your transaction is complete and ready.
Hey, on your way, and you're going to finish the transaction, my brother, Saeed.
And whoever submits to you, submits to Allah.
I considered it the last transaction to complete it for her
The one you order or the one you like
But your son had to sign this paper.
It means to take it to her tomorrow.
Honestly, I advise you to buy it today.
And if the transaction was not entered for them
You'll wait for me in two months.
No, no, no, let him sign it now.
No, no, no, he doesn't need it.
Call him and let him know in two minutes.
And I will finish it for you
You don't know what it means to be happy.
No, I won't take a leave.
And it is only Morocco that remains.
No, a quarter of them are with him.
Where are you going if someone asks you?
Say, I am with Saeed.
I'm looking at the two of you, you're both finished.

Yay, get rid of your papers yourself

What did you fail to do?
There is no use.
I will leave you.

I don't know where to go.

We're done with these conversations.

Oh my God, my sisters, goodbye, God bless you
It's the prison shower.
I was traveling.
My sister, Shaqolj.

And I, my brother, will talk to Real.

Yes, I didn't tell you
What's up?
And he sat and shouted
I have nothing left for you

This is what I'm saying to you.

Why is the manager, Fensha, poor?
Haram means after all these years, Etiyone today they say to me, Fenshnak
What do you understand, Saleh?
Bassna khrabyat
Give us just one
Order, O Saleh
And you are a person who is always doing these things.
You are amazing, you follow public affairs and you criticize
It's not easy
It just means we crossed each other out.
And you are one of them.
You are not the one I meant.
Goodbye, bye bye.
Brother Saleh
But hopefully, your uncle, Abu Manira, won't know.
I'm going, oh yeah, march on you
Where is Pedri from?
If you ask
Tell him to work.
Quite a fashionable thing, if not.
I asked my mother and she said that Ahoh works.
You don't need it
Mother must go.
This is what I'm doing and what I'm doing now.
Anwar took our daughter and her.

I am giving you a two-week deadline.
But if he works, by Allah, I will not go to him and I will not go to the court and say, "Let him be released."
I love you now
You are like a fly buzzing around your head, but there is nothing there.
Mom, honestly
I want to go out
What's up
I know you want to go.
Your heart craves coffee
You want to solve and disrupt
Oh God, go away and sleep. Oh God.
And this morning, go to work
I hope I will leave in the morning, that is to say.
Mama, I told him, I'm done, I swear, I quit this habit.
Well, by God

We just need to make sure that Jafna Saleh is present at the coffee.
I am at your service.
Eye's eye, just do the job
Because there were people present
You are Nadiya Bas.
I don't waste your time with me
If one dried up at the door, the other would not be able to move.
But the Shariah is not on you.
The glutton is the one who does not stop you at your limit.
My son and my bread, I know you well, well
You are like the one who has the Zagaier.
I'll go or I won't go, I'll say or I won't say, I'll say we're not crazy or I won't say we're not crazy.
This is what I'm saying to you
An interview on the radio
Otherwise, it's okay, but we won't be talking nonsense.
Professor Saleh, you are a man with a very high national sense.
What can we do to help you?
But Shensui returned.
Oh God, forgive us again.
Hello Saleh, how are you?
Jan, don't you worry, we care about you.
No, by Allah.
My brother, I ask you every day to stop saying nonsense.
Brother, you are a brave person, you are not afraid.
And whoever gives you one time, say it.
I, God, bless you, bye.
Call her and tell her that whoever delivers you is not a liar, God.
Oh God, the Real Madrid is at the bottom again, it's only one by one for its sake.
Wow, man.
The important thing now is, long live you.
Regarding the job
The job is the opposite, you deserve it, you are a national and dear to us.
We were calling you to inform you
Jan, God created so many things.
You are right.
Everywhere I go, they tell me there are no vacancies.
Poor things, they want to employ me, but there are no jobs.
And now, how do you and your mother manage the house?
And do not forget after
Four people are with them
God is gracious
Don't be sad, my love.
Keep your hope alive.
I do not stop.
You need to go and find a job for me.
Because my father won't give us any trouble
I am ready to work for you, Manera.
Repentance after saying nonsense
But nonsense
Do you know what's wrong with these days
I told you I am
But God will guide you, Abu Fahd.
What you hear is the speech
I go to tell the minister about the troubles he is causing.
The minister's speech
Of course, he understands it that way.
You are right.
But this is something
What he doesn't talk about
You know the rumor that he's going to take your place and that you're going to be fired.
I am looking for a way to deal with it.
There is no one who feels that I have an opinion on the subject.
Your idea is correct.
My brother, I am thinking of him.
The way Sultan is removed from your path
You have heard about Saleh Saleh but no nonsense
Salam Allah, this is from our neighborhood.
By him, on him
We are deprived of your voice, dear brother Salih.
No, Saleh.
I am one of your biggest followers.
No, it's good, Allah willing, after it's needed.
And God willing, I will try.
He comes back and you hear his voice and you stop.
Boufhad ibn himself asks about you
Say, "O Saleh."
Why did you stop?
And God means a lot of problems and mental and health problems a little
But you want the real thing
You are considered a fighter.
We have heard it a long time ago.
Allah Allah Allah, you asked for it, Saleh.
Once, just for my sake
I want to hear it on the Sanke
Sa'il says, "I'll tell you."
Lala ya jama'ah sa'bah wal-lah wal-lah sa'bah sarrah

The riyal is asking you

Then you told me to look for a job.
This is your chance.
Let the real one hear you and resign from you on the second day, go to the office and ask for the job.
Wow, if you cut me
Yes, I want your best interest.
Do you know how
But we don't want to see people, go home.
La la la, we don't need it anymore.

I'm sure I'll come back last time, of course, I'm cutting it off, but last time.
For example, Shehib means Boo Boo Boo Boo Fahd hears Ayhib hears.
Shally Aynse means that there are many problems and troubles and many are present.
What is it that he keeps hearing, or does he like demonstrations, I don't know what to say.

Work is destroyed, that means
Until you interrupt me.
Why is the employee so quiet?

Why is the employee late?
When the ministry moved to its new location.
Eyeb Cars belongs to his brother
Guys, we're just kidding around.
And when you return to us with your voice, we don't want you to cut us off again.
Anyone who cares about me, the last time
Otherwise, I honestly cut it off.
Mama, didn't you say it's over?
And you are the one who stopped him.
Oh, my daughter.
This is what is called a ridiculous nonsense on the radio.
I usually hear that, but they told me
I doubt that someone in the ministry is the one who leaked the information.
Ey fəzələ, göyün həvəsi varmı?
Frozen air
The minister's aide is prohibited.
I don't care.
My whole time belongs to the ministry. May Allah bless you.
His reputation has lasted for a long time.
Ooo, by God, I said it just for you.
What did you give me from your side
What did you talk to me about?
Abdulrahman Aykoli Ruh Beyshglek
What did you talk to me about?
By God, you are poor, O Saleh.
Yes, you broke my heart.
I am the secretary of Boufhad.
I know the whole story
The group exploited you for a specific goal they wanted.
Unfortunately, they reached him.
And you know what's behind that story
Abdulrahman Ould Freikam
Ahoh who planned all this
Bofahd, it's impossible to worry about you.
One day I did the same thing that happened to Sultan
Madam Shokouh about you
It is impossible for anything to bother you.
The court ruled to release him
I found the solution
We are the best society in the world.
Flawless
We have
We have no flaws at all.
We are comfortable.
Sheni al-Wasatah
Even if someone you know tells you to hold the door.
Because the system
He takes his rights more than a stranger.
We do not rely on strangers.
We have

I'll go and sit you at home
We don't have anything like that.

To tell you
Don't let me lift you in the boat.
I say to my brother Sultan
Why, after I throw it, it breaks and he laughs at it.
This is a small person, a small person who is not as good as you.
This is a person, this is a person
Oi, people.
And if not, people and fair people will throw it away and destroy it.

This is from your good roots, Abu Walid.
May Allah reward you, brother Rashid.
I have heard a lot about you.

But my daughter,
I am ready to do anything so that you can get the most beautiful and cheapest furniture that suits you.
When did the furniture actually become so old?
I need to change it.
I hope so.
Yes, my sister, I killed her for you before.
If you need anything.
Consider me like your sister.
May my eye not be boastful.
Wine rahti habibi.
Yesterday I spoke to him and forgot about Ahawsha.
Lala Habibi, ma'a ba'd at-ta'abbuj.
No more
Yallah, goodbye, call me later.
Honestly, I was talking to her.
But these people are not of our cloth.
The rich, where are we and where are they?
Mama, it's not your fault.
Mother, bless you.
You look at me for a moment and then leave.
And I will give you the signal when you should propose to her for me.
I'm telling you
No, I don't have to.
But I'm saying and I'm saying my wedding speech
Aka ḥṭayt al-ʿašā bi-ṣ-ṣālḥ.
If you want to have dinner
Now let the driver take it to the university, God willing.
And then we agreed that we are people
He has a car of his own.
Soon, God willing
I called her, thanking her.
Aywid Wayyaboon Al-Khair Ayee Na'am
Yes, you are right, my dear Ybeh.
Even if our people don't do that.
And my name is definitely with them.
I'm sure you are.
Yahahi bloh ashhalam masayeb alitadhif alitna 'alaa
I'm so confused right now, my head is spinning from this news, I don't know what to do, I'm lost.
You are the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the
Best of luck, Ali Baba.
The committee today attended
And I came out with the list of names that the smoke is carrying.
My name is with them
The manager's words made me feel like I should call you by your name.
What do you think about it, Ali? What do you think about it?
He needed it and said there was no hope.
The great artist
Your name is considered degrading in the list
Thank you for your hard work, God bless you, Abu Salim.
He returned if you allowed it.
I want to take a picture with you so I can show them to the kids.
Oh, my children, the garden is blooming now.
God bless them to you, God willing.
A picture of an artist is possible.
Under God's command, I surrender to you.
Please, please
Ava alayk Ava alayk Haazir
You and the one you love.
Say a day or two before it is better.
Oh my God, oh my God, Mom, get ready.
Get ready, get ready, what's up
Heal you, Yunet.
I have no objection.
Come here, Mom.
Oh God, give them life
But, my son, it's back
They think we are poor people and that we are in the same situation as them.
You need to be more precise.
Where can I dress up and look fancy?
You've got me in trouble with people.
I've never seen you with jewelry before, it's the first time I've seen you like that.
I'm not really me
Right of Am Ali
Ame Ali is engaged to her son Ali.
You want modest clothes and some jewelry.
She said, "I want them to understand that the most important people are those who are going to do good."
Oh, oh, Subhanallah.
One of them is the "Khadha"
Mashallah, she's my American dream, she's longer and bluer.
Mashallah, I can't help but say that
Her Majesty, God bless you, Her Majesty.
You must prepare yourself afterwards.
Because they say let my father go and meet her father.
Of course, I won't go out in these clothes.
First of all, they have to take my little sister to the hospital.
Anyway, I'm so tired, so tired, so tired of the worst.
Am Walid means I didn't shortchange you, give them a little bit more, a little bit more on them.
AI AI
We must become like them after we are done.
Why didn't his mother go to propose to him?
But that woman
Now I have to go to the real office.
And God will save you just as you are alive.
The rest is up to God to save you
People of good will did not fall short
What they failed, we remained in the past
Quite, I'll take it from you, I'll complete the count.
All eyes on you, Evez.
Ey, Bas, how can I give this to my brother Rashid, or should I give it to Ayode?
Not only that, but look, come first thing.
This must be encrypted.
They don't understand me.
I put the dress back on you, but look
This is Allah who will save you.
The left hand inside the coat.
He threatened me in this way.
Eat the bread from underneath.
God, God
Wow!
Walking, walking, heavy, want to be light, a little
Ya Saeed.
That guy is a millionaire.
What you gave me, God willing, is seconds.
The left has fallen, just like the right, this color
Do you know my friend's girlfriend?
Anyone who lives will heal her
Do you want me to help you?
Tell me, since you are my friend and we don't want to separate.
My brother says he will marry you.
Say that she ran away, don't say anything about her brother and embarrass herself
Empty words are more common these days than the day I told you that Saad wants your right to her father and today it's your brother's right.
They want to take my girlfriend.
I was reading.
Important that you know the relationship between us.
No, they don't know, we are just colleagues.
Save me, God.
You need to know tomorrow.
Why did Walid refuse?
I am screaming
You reject my son, Walid.
The actor is more honorable than you hypocrites.
But you
You will represent them all your life.
Mub adwarikum
Serve the people
You attract people.
They wear acting clothes in life, very much like God and His creation.
The Pashtun character I played on television
I and you
Wear accessories, gold, and jewelry.
I played the role of
You got married.
What is
One walks his girlfriend a lot.
The house with its two doors is very close.
And he does not look to the right or to the left
Bro, remind me of that thing you guys were talking about at the office.
Come with him, boy and girl
Why is he walking like that?
As it says
God help him, Real.
Walk, Sida, don't stop.
Poor, his personal wealth is very little.
You laugh after you're satisfied
Let's make a country dress for her.
La la la, it's not that nice and you're sitting there.
He's like that when you walk and he's standing, he'll stop, stop, stop.
Your request, Khamees, your request.
Asked: "Are you going to the city?"
Come, I want to eat something
Where are you going to sit with me for a while?
My wife changed it.
You will like it that way.
Oh, Oh Khamis
Turn off the TV and if you see a presenter
I'm afraid you're causing me problems.
And by Allah the Great, at work.
I'm sitting, I'm sitting with Salem, my colleague at work.
Hajja
Sattled the line, Yod Yod
I'm calling you now because you're causing me problems at home.
"I mean, you can't let your friend hide unless you're sitting with them, right?"
Yalla Allah, again, again, maybe Allah will help me get the package.
And they'll kick you out after
You are not the first one to be fired.
No, no, no, I can't imagine it.
I love my mother in her grave
My mother advised me to
She said to me, "Don't shoot."
No, I can't, it's impossible.
I'm looking for something.
Lala kh kh kh khalak khalak
You are not at all normal.
I didn't come with you.
Tell me, I want to understand what's going on.
No, mom, I mean I'm not allowed to say this.
Salem, in particular, is considered one of the best young people we have in the area.
So I'll tell you, divorce
He kept saying "get divorced, get divorced, it's okay, it's okay,
No, Thursday, you look like you're going to have a formal meeting.
Let me, let me and the one who will deliver you
Eil yals asolf wa yaha abroohna shhalyilatna
God bless you
The poor have a lame heart
I want to give him the message, it's from the minister's office, it's important.
From God, He gives you, He gives you from Him
Hala Lala Wala Shai Wala Shai
Here it is, I'll give it to him.
Because I have a meeting tomorrow with the women's delegation from Yana.
A women's delegation
Heal you, heal you, we are not sleeping today
Al-Wassal
I am your brother, Khamis.
No, by God, I will talk to you when I am awake, by God.
My friend, what's going on?
They erase my name because they don't want you to take him.
How do I delete your name?
The only one who can strike your name off is the Minister of Happiness.
My brother, this is a meeting at the ministry.
The official statement of the meeting
I need help
Salim Salim Salim
Say the truth
One of those I was arguing with, and you are hiding behind the tank.
Salam Salam, Salam Allah Salam.
And as long as you need Salem.
It says or how
I have to.
I'm not on, O Khmas.
I mean, I'm telling you the truth.
No, I'm not casual anymore.
She complained to me, my friend, that I'm only talking to one person.
Aisha lives back.
And whoever delivers you safely will call.
And the one who gives you to be given in charity.
Ahoh, who told you to call?
You own the job
I don't interfere in what doesn't concern you, or you'll see that I know my job with you.
I complain about you
This is you.
How are you living alone like that, your tongue is so long
Let’s start listening now.
Long live Hassan, he will call Khamees.
Okay, let's discuss the real estate budget first.
Please wait
"I hope I'll find him again."
I say to you, the first thing the women saw was fear.
The Ministry found you, and you are here now.
Oh my god, the group is waiting for you in the voting hall.
I can't stay with the women.
Ya Khamees, martak, ashlan tdri?
I'm afraid you'll call.
By Allah, you doubt me, right? You don't understand, do you?
Eicon Earn and Machile after I return home.
Your wife will only call at this hour.
Of course, you are a large company.
This project that your company is implementing for our ministry
One of the largest projects in the history of the ministry
Hey guys, fix the table, it's shaking
Long live you, this table is not mine.
Please keep my response.
Who is with me
Syrian student
My phone number is 0912345678.
Moment, moment, I'm telling you.
Aww, he passed out because he was afraid to go to their house.
What a brother she has.
He said, "My sister will tell you that if you die, this is what happens to women, not the men who clean the house."
So I submitted a letter to the ministry asking to be transferred from our department.
By the way, he told me that the minister agreed to transfer him, meaning he did what you wanted after all.
My brother, what is this woman?
This is Yunon
I say to him, "O Khamis, talk to whoever you want."
I say to you, I am not awake.
And now what are you going to do? Your wife and children are coming tomorrow.
By God, I don't know what to do.
And you carried out her request, why, after you had already left your house and seen your children.
Because she wants to confirm officially.
Ask her to give you the papers.
This is what I did, I teased her brother, I gave him the paper.
So she can see the minister's signature and be sure
And God willing, if I agree, God willing, tonight we can go back home, God willing.
This is the minister's signature, my sister.
After the confusion
Tomorrow I will work in the new department.
Means from tomorrow office and work other than what was there.
Either way, God will guide you in this department.
Any Allah isalmukh wahdeh tashirah alwazir
Nothing, nothing, that's on your right hand.
Yes, indeed, by the blessings of Allah, peace be upon him.
This cake is ready.
Saad, Abdulqader, and MashaAllah, meaning a big office, yes.
Goodbye
How do you request a transfer
Brother, the whole department is women
Mrs. Yaʿqūb.
And no one can make a second decision other than the minister himself.
You are forced to continue until the minister returns.
Brother, you agreed with your colleagues.
And call them by their real names so your wife won't recognize them.
And I left for the new employee two more rights
The new employee went to the new employee
From one day the minister's office changed the daily allowance with us.
From Sajjāj.
His shape is very clear and on it is an imaginary real man between five harems, his shape is antique.
But they say to his wife, "He is jealous of someone else."
Gare Ammiye
Poor thing, given its condition.
But Awh asked us if his wife calls, we don't talk about him and keep quiet.
Ey Abdulqadir who is with you in the office.
This doesn't bother you, you're just joking around.
My son called to say that his wife wants me to come to the office.
My brother, I'm doing well.
Roh Seida is the first door on the right.
This is the care office.
With the five of the women
Six female employees.
He is present, I confirm that he is continuing.
I don't care about these gestures.
This is the first time I've been angry with you.
I am sweet
Now, may Allah guide you, O Sultan.
We just want to know where we stand.
My brother and I, Saqar, were at the bank yesterday.
Look, from this side, the project
Peace be upon you.
Brother, I have an important meeting at work.
Oh God, go back to the kitchen, hurry up, oh God.
Now I am wearing to go out.
Originally, the kitchen was supposed to be in this place.
We don't have any women, so we don't have to obey the old men.
And if the scorpion is angry, God is enough to ward off the evil of its sting.
This is a necessity for rain. Look, look.
See my uncle
Aisha, who is in charge, call the secretary and tell him to inform the employees.
He tells them that Amnarah postponed today's meeting to tomorrow.
Best, God willing.
They issue these orders
Woe to us if we did not execute
The expected one doesn't know that you are a big official.
And there are connections and responsibilities
Their only concern is service.
In my life, I have never seen people disrespecting women like them.
We are still living in this old time.
Don't go to work today, and don't go to the kitchen, and make the food come.
The services, where are they
The second one was stolen and it took her a week
Even the servants were not spared their insults.
With them, they have the right to fail
God help you.
The bank's previous notes are simple.
The next one
My uncles are something like, you know, they mean
Essentially, a complex of villas with a beautiful view without a garden.
Design the garden now
My sister, before we go, let me get your opinion on this matter.
My dear Fatma, I have to go to work late.
Oh God, please tell me what's going on with you
You say so or I go
Play it at school
The Women's Union Committee has returned
The school chose me to play with them in the team
You are Minon.
Now you tell me you are going to the national team.
Are you thinking of saying the truth about your brothers and uncles, this thing, Ashbisoon, is a lie.
You blame only yourselves.
This is what we warned you about.
I don't say hello to her, but I greet her. I haven't come to you for a long time, oh Yabeh.
E'enboo seneh majoofak
Married him, and then what?
Oh God, what have you given me
One who is neither educated nor has a degree nor knows anything, God will guide you.
No, no, it's not a bad thing that Real Madrid is not educated.
And then this is Khamis Al-Akrab's day.
Stung him, caught him
No, and we only take one at his level.
A scorpion like him
God help you.
What am I doing, Aisha?
The minister traveled and all the transactions are transferred to me.
"And the truthful statement of Mustafa, the director of the resource management, Aminereh Tebik, tomorrow."
But guests from the ministry arrived today.
The program you have
And now I will focus on you, O Aisha.
Mary
Oh God, oh God, oh God, now, oh God
Shaqilja ya Aaisha
This mess came from where else but the Brotherhood.
I don't know what the consequences are
My dear, I need to put compresses on him so that his belly doesn't swell.
We warned her and told her not to tell them.
Jan said to them, "Ekfkhona and ibixona for her."
You'd tell them they hate it
Jan Haltak, he's been bothering her for a long time.
You play football.
Yesterday he broke his neck
Know who to talk to
Scorpion Oud
Halkapr.com
Ey, but my uncle, I didn't hit Sultan who just hit.
Yaa al kalam
I chose economics and political science.
I honestly chose graphics because this specialty is in demand these days.
Architecture
It's your turn
You took your chance.
Greed is not nice and I am your father
Tamer Al-Aqrab
Hit it, break it, break its teeth, remove its beak
He led me to her
I have a written note for you, please.
You go when the missions
And delete the specialization of architecture.
Take your ease.
To confirm
Sultan and Saker, I spoke to them.
They have no objection to you being a security guard.
I'm looking for you
No Khamees, we were born, he deserves it.
Arrange the appointment with them and let us know, God willing.
Your nomination is among the delegation
I appreciate your circumstances.
But give me a chance tomorrow.
I'm telling you the truth.
You are very interested in it.
And your nomination is from above.
He was right.
My brothers, I know them
It is impossible to agree with them.
I am surprised at them.
Their premiums are based on my salary.
I am the one who pays for the house.
No, and I swear after I say go with me
We are not planning to marry her this week.
They will say you
Khamis Al-Ahbal who doesn't even have a secondary school diploma.
Marry him and travel with him
And you know, God knows.
"By Allah, it is forbidden for them to do what they are doing."
If I refuse, they will slaughter me.
Ya ybeh komon mareh qayleh lak
And after I leave.
Tomorrow, tomorrow, God willing.
You don't care if he's a Scorpio or a son of a scorpion
Even if Ayi Ibish is doing well, he is not doing well.
Mabee atzooj Khamis
Wallah, my soul is in the kitchen.
Put them in the living room.
Tonight is the Real Madrid vs Barcelona match.
I hope we don't lose in Valencia.
I am speaking to you from reliable sources.
Dedicated and eager to work
It means you should know what happened now.
We were confused.
Against our will, we continue.
Please sit at your desks.
Thank you for your long life.
Taalam ammar rajj
Pour ici
The Ministry's assistance
May Allah protect it and prolong its existence.
Please, for the love of God, please
Good morning, Minister of Darkness.
Yes, you lived a long life.
I washed the pans.
Pour the coffee for Captain Emad.
And once again, after
We are traveling to China tomorrow and we will play a match there.
Any Captain Naseeb, after I introduce you to my sister Maryam.
What's up, where is my uncle going, he's going to Abil al-Malj.
You are red, you are red
I don't know your elbow from your knee, you want to take a minister.
God willing, you will be safe.
Labee 'ammi.
A soul that has a second self in it
Actor's contacts
I don't believe it. I just talked to Mashael.
Vertical after
It's a shame that Nouf's role doesn't fit Ma'shaal's right
Nawf bint, age 10 years
Mish'al Itrawi means 20s
Why don't you take Mary's role?
It suits her more
The role of the thirty-first year
Let's get rid of this problem that they've put on us in the committee.
This is a problem, I'm sure that I won't be silent.
And he stops us at the unit
It talks to you about art, family values, and meaningful and substantive art. What is it?
This is one of the things that he put on the committee.
The Minister of Ahwah who is problematic for the committee
You, Hamid and I can influence him, but he's stubborn.
No, no, no, it's impossible.
Because there is nothing to prove that it belongs to me or Al-Hamed.
Even if I go to the Ministry of Economy and ask
After he finds my names
Salam Alaykum, the company was registered yesterday in the name of Hamid's wife.
From this side, I don't have it.
Then the committee chairman, not me, will reassure them.
The last decisive word will be mine.
Lala ybeh kol she ta'am hiaak hiaak
Tony spoke to them and agreed with them on everything.
Hello.
Peace be upon you, Hala, Mr. Rashid, please excuse me.
And as you know, you know that the agreement is specifically for the series of rape of the conscience
Wahoh is produced by Lamsaat Essiyassiyat for Arts
A sweet, strange, bold action series
I am with Hamid.
The series' story is really good.
I'm with you, Hamed.
What I liked the most was when the mother took the gun and killed her neighbor.
And she wanted to take the gun, so he took it from her in the car.
Do you know that your son's car was searched by the police yesterday?
Aye, her son is from school.
Wayshout the cartoon breewle
Jan gives him that strong shot and the cartoon flies and enters the door of the room of the stone
I congratulate the surprise
Wow, this is the same scene, this scene, and this cartoon is a room key.
It is a beautiful thing that a local company has advanced to this level of work.
We need to encourage them and take care of them.
Not even my brother Rashid has heard your opinion.
You left a wise brother in it.
With all due respect to your opinions and impressions about this series called "Rape of the Conscience".
And rape of human values
Simple surprises
A man and a half in every episode
The text is for the next episode.
A series written without social awareness
It does not carry a meaningful message that elevates society.
Tears are falling, so the audience must be screaming.
Rashid, if you please.
You said your opinion, so I said my opinion, let Professor Rashid say his opinion.
Wazh from ilseh
I can smell an agreement between you.
I ordered things
There are people who understand this and it's their specialty, and there are people who have no connection to the subject.
I like this series.
I'm afraid we'll get ourselves into trouble.
What is there for you from it
I can't speak English or do anything
I walk my word
Jan gives me the keys and says these are from my mom, Samireh.
I don't know what happened
No, I don't believe it, Nasser.
Ahoh, the new series that I'm going to make is called Jibri.
I know they rape their daughter.
From the abundance of good that comes from behind him.
Of course, the first thing is the beautiful ring in your hand.
I say, how are you
In the name of Hamed's wife who made you lose the ring
Of course, his role was to regulate matters and issues.
It has a rate of five per hundred of the work
Sweet role
Tony, examples of the role that you played in the series of rape of Amani Taeh was very beautiful.
On the idea
What is rape, O Lord?
Any rape of dreams
Why are all the names so similar?
For example, in the past year, most of the series were all about girls.
The series features over eight girls and ten after
Doorj Mozumun
We have a lot of torches here.
Oh oh, luck was on my side after I got confused
Hello Omar
Ey Ma'ali Ma'ali.
My dear Syrian, I have to go to work, don't worry.
Pour a minute and soul
He says it is a necessary and important matter
I have to go home.
I know that Rashid went and met the minister.
He says he stayed with him for half an hour.
He said, "This will get you in trouble."
I say to you, he complained about us, tell me, it's fine.
The thing that happened now is that the minister's office called me and said they were asking for me.
And you are afraid after the minister's approval
The minister I am meeting
The rial will convey its views on the series.
No more
This is true, for as long as you live.
But first, I, Minister Sa'ah, would like to clarify a point, and this is not something I usually do, to speak about a fellow artist with me who is not present.
God bless you, Rashid. Everyone knows about this feature.
He hates everyone around him.
All material interests
But he is a specialist.
But God has saved you, meaning not everyone can do it and replace him in technical matters.
Especially TV works
A series of rapes, God bless you, we are working on it.
A bold, monumental work.
On a Gulf level, God bless you, we will have a media advantage.
And a huge spread
You are of course specialized in this and know more about it than I do.
Hollow condition of the Epizh-Oweh serial
And our name is raised above
But the journalist Abdulhamid wrote, listen, listen, listen
But one of the actors commented, "
The series contains immoral appeals.
He laments the decline in moral and artistic taste in work.
By God, bold words and strong criticism.
They will humiliate your group if journalist Abdulhamid is behind them.
And if their words reach the officials
This is a group of intelligent people who know how to manage themselves.
The tail of a gang
We want to make our own website.
We put all the company's activities in it
The company told me what the name is.
Today I am going to be the media advisor.
The series "Rape of the Conscience" produced by Mercury Artistic Production Company is considered a milestone in the history of Arabic television.
A qualitative leap in Arabic drama
What he carries of noble thought and values
It is a series that aims to develop society
Journalist Abdulhamid himself who has been criticizing them for a long time
A reasonable translation of the given text
How is Abdulhamid accepting himself like this?
Journalist Abdulhamid Wasefah and his forms
Professor Hamed, don't worry.
He said I should be in the series, the series is a hit in the Arab world.
God hears you
Guys, my artistic feeling tells me that our series is a hit.
That's where we don't know where to find him.
This is a man who puts his bag down and leaves.
We started by encouraging
You all are like the things they show in the series, we have never seen them in our lives or heard about them.
The written IBAN from its address
Honestly, all of your authors are crazy.
Any habit that becomes a habit if it doesn't become a habit
Your series is a mess.
You are sharing.
He looked like he was shouting a lot.
We are measuring ourselves on silly TV series.
No one can understand it and catch it from the first time.
In subtle threads and dimensions, it requires focus so that one can understand what this work wants to say.
On the idea of this work, you are a politician.
It is forbidden to show it to people.
Heal you
The one who is with you right now says that MacLean is a liar.
Yesterday in Morocco, I and Ali were at Souk Waqif.
And sitting in a coffee shop
What did you give me from there
No, Naser, you are wrong about the subject. If the minister gets angry, this is a big problem.
During one week, we will all be in our homes.
God and the TV series Adal Adhaal, everyone who watched it said it was a failure.
I heard that Rashed is planning to go to him.
Of course, he will tell him that this series is a failure and a disaster and that it doesn't have any action.
But it's a big problem, guys.
Leave the subject blank
Bjofun Nasser Ashbeeswi
Listen to me, Eli.
From today, I won't post any topic that criticizes the series on my page.
Eli, please
I came to the subject a few days ago, there is no criticism of the work in it, it is a criticism of the work.
Please don't make me angry with you.
Hake on him
But one day I had a chance
If I didn't want to hear such talk, I wouldn't.
But to be honest, I haven't received any messages thanking me for the series.
What what the unparalleled success
Goodbye
Brother Rashed, please allow me
I'll believe you, or I'll believe the newspapers.
Rape of conscience in television works
Your age is a journalist who agrees with him.
Listen to the second newspaper, I'll explain.
After they agree with people, read read on the readers page
My heart stopped.
Even if they tell me
Eyebeh, we are satisfied with you, Minister.
And God, the truth, O Nasser.
Prepare for the rape of the conscience Part 2
No, no, no, but my brother, I don't want this to go over.
First and last series I wrote
I'm done with my job, I'm going to the scrapyard, get out of this job
Part two after this block
And third and fourth
You heal what you want the benefit
Yani is one of the four who are sitting in his place.
This is what we're in.
The magician said
And forward.
We want a word for this agreement.
Praise be to God for the success
On skeptics, enemies of success
I was surprised.
How can a series win an award and another series be poor and unsuccessful?
But these are specialized people.
The awarding of the prizes is certainly a joy, iPhone is something we don't have, we are not iPhone.
Prepare a second part for the series.

Remembering the Rape of the Conscience Part Two
I saw you standing with the minister at the beginning of the ceremony.
After the TV festivals, we agreed, I mean
Heard him say to them, "Get ready, there will be a second part."
The same thing
The dirty ones are taken by banks to be washed and come out clean.
These series are hollow, low, weak, despicable, and trivial.
They enter the Gulf and Arab festivals
To wash them, they are cleaned, given awards, and become high-quality series among people. They are cleaned.
Any reasonable why not reasonable
As long as the same judging committees are the ones producing the series.
Hello.
And upon you be peace and mercy. Praise be to God, you have arrived.
Yes, they are and we have a contract with them, but they want to lower the price.
Come to the office
Are we a small bakery or a pastry shop that sells roti and bread?
We are one of the largest bakery companies in the world.
"You don't even get a dollar."
They want us to cancel the contract or not.
Enough of the contract we signed yesterday
With the European company
Keycab DWB
The thing you see
A large workforce, a workforce that did not happen.
For the first time, a product from a home will be the first product in the world.
This is what I'm saying, I'm not the world's greatest roti baker.
I am saying to you
How did Roti Pitha become popular?
Turn it off or I'll send you to the kitchen to look for a prisoner to cut off his hand, and sometimes you might have your hand cut off.
This roti is a pita bread with sesame seeds.
Eykon ethety jiben ve atred etsek.
10 rotis, 10 pairs of pants

Hospital staff in Jabal al-Nour didn't go to work yesterday.
I know I’m asking you why I didn’t go out last night.
The past or long-lived, the bakers and the pharmacists who are honored with the pharmacy.
A response to the bakers
That's what happened to you just now.
Shamsoi was sitting there screaming at him like that.
I sat with this nonsense, football and no football, and I am ruined for work.
Do you know your son who loves football?
Heal her, that means if the company takes how many employees to entertain them
You have 40 employees in the company, huh, and you have to take care of them.
Hadees One Hadeel consider the main players
Above them, he has four reserves and two administrators, but Shamkhad and Ali have seventeen.
The team's spokesperson is the media spokesperson.
Yesterday I talked about this on these phones.
But I walk the way to develop, although the fans, the audience, consider the most important player on the field and the number 12 player.
Quite lately, he has been very fond of Anton Iraczyn and is very happy.
We are people who have contracts with them.
Now, when Allah said to you, "Father, play football first, I got tired of it."
Your voice and your obedience are heard.
What else is there
Now, he called a few employees and made them play with him, watching them and having fun with them, so he wouldn't get bored.
What's wrong, he doesn't take employees.
Even if some of your quarter need employees, they should all be from the same one, no matter what.
Important bakers
Oh my God, what's wrong with you? You're going to make the important bakers take the bakeries after you become
Second time if I hire employees, I will say
No, no, this transaction should have Hamdi review it.
Hamdi is in the hospital.
Why has no one ever called you by your name?
I finished my work and while I was on my way, I took the Arabian and bought it.
Listen to me, may Allah prolong his life, he is on top of it.
I walked on it
The goalkeeper who plays with us told me that we have not seen anything like this and that we have an important match tonight.
Quayel mentioned that we had a goalkeeper who arrived at the stadium.
Quṭb al-Bās said, "What do you wear, goalkeeper?"
I have never played football or touched a football.
This is a position.
What is it written on
And tomorrow we will look for a job for you to work in, by Allah, no time wasting, no nonsense.
Let me tell you
You are the one who makes me believe in the team and makes me want to change it.
Yes, that's right.
Zein, I hope it's on that ridge, but I'm asking you.
Haram means the team came out and ruined the final match.
No, no, this is the boy's right.
Hashqalet
Zein, congratulations on the win.
Mr. Nasser, congratulations on winning the cup.
We wanted to know how you planned to win
Look, I am the team's leader, mentally, physically, and intellectually, and thank God the coach did not fail.
Inside your hotel
Congratulations to all of you and the party was as promised.
I say, your father looks happy.
I'm afraid he is embarrassed and polite.
Omar Abu Nasser, we want to congratulate you on the great victory of your team, Freak, at the International Bakeries. We wish you success in the future.
The great victory.
God bless you. God bless. God bless. God bless.
A photo without a jacket, moment by moment, hold on a second.
No.
There is a misunderstanding about the burqa.
Without a doubt, your care, great attention, and creative opinions played a big role in this victory.
And the coach's plan
But in the final, he played in a 5-5-3-2 formation.
And as a great athlete, you know that changing the plan confuses the players. However, the bakery team was not confused and presented a great match.
The coach's plan
Bo Naser, as the top athlete in international baking, what advice do you give to players?

And you have been away from football all your life.
And you are the most beautiful.
Because I know football, I can see her in my arms, she is 50 centimeters away from me, which means I am close to her.
Still Abu Nasser hasn't arrived.
No, by Allah, today again he did not come.
In a seminar about sports injuries, he is the platinum sponsor and must be present.
I still haven't seen anything
I saw the building behind the bakery that he was building to be a residence for workers.
Hello, I drowned in the ball.
As we have accustomed our dear viewers before every match, we meet with one of the symbols of sports and have a conversation with him.
This man, whose great ideas the bakery team draws inspiration from.
News from the International Bakery Team We heard that you are conducting a comprehensive development process
I mean, on these desks and on this work.
A trivial amount, which means I'm only getting one million dollars for all my hard work.

Heidi, it was your mistake, not mine, my friend Shaheen.
My mistake.
He healed my mistake, I.
But you told me that the players are needed in the Gulf.
Prices in the Gulf reach unrealistic levels.

Someone will break your head
Stay away, you.
I know how to behave with this coach
Why did the team decline?
The imposed situation that is currently taking place is making the team of the International Bakery Center's coach think about changing the midfield in the match.
Because players do not play in their positions.
And the player Takulamakakolalalalu this is not his natural place he needs to move to the place where he always plays
The coach, Ayeguer, said the truth.

The expected thing that is happening now is that the manager of the team is not present.
And the team's coach
If there is something to look forward to, it is after the match.
Now everyone is sitting and watching, and everyone is sitting and coughing, and the thing is in front of the camera.
The game is rigged. A fourth goal for the success team.
The fourth goal was scored by him, and he is the star of today's match.
This coach is a headstrong person
He said, "I'm sorry, but I don't think you're the right coach for his team."
And you are going after what?
I am watching the match on TV and you are sitting on the bench. What I am saying is so.
Oh, Oulidi, I don't like it. Your soul is not nice.

Yani returned and his tears were on his cheek.
He says, "Mom, Barcelona is back, and he says that he will die in this team, and he respects it a lot."
He does something that hurts her and hurts his feelings.
My mother said, "Go to Barcelona on Saturday," so I told her, "Okay, I'll think about it," and she said, "Let her go, divorce her, I'll find someone else for you."
I say your daughter got divorced because she cursed the Barcelona team.

What's the point, Mom, with someone like this, a complete loser, for a football team?
The hairdresser knew them and told me about the whole story. Mom, don't get involved with him or I'll get into trouble with someone like him.
And you are the one who is ruining the reputation of these hairdressers who have no history.
How do you tell them that I don't agree?

I am a merchant.
No, no, no, but I am
You want advice, you want me to help you, I'm a teacher, so if you want me to help you with something, just let me know.
Thank you, my nephew, thank you
Ey, forgive me, please, I'm on my way.
Come on, uncle.
Or the first time I told you if you want more
Oh God, Fadi, please organize the crowded store, it's messy, I am.
The store is not open on Sundays.
I said you're taking the shop that suits you, by Allah, take it.
I wish
This store where you bought the shoes is a merchant.
In a person named Khalaf Sultan Al-Sai'fi, not your cousin Bu Nasser.
No, there is nothing.
I'm from the Ministry of Economy, I saw his name in a transaction with a friend of mine named Essam, who has his papers.
Women's fashion design
I'm sure
I see the rental contract and his name is written on it.
Heal her, heal her, heal her
Heal her, heal her, heal her. She has a wound.
What's wrong with your sick heart?
My successful project is dry.
I said, "I won't destroy it."
This is an open market for everyone.
Shu Sh Bo Nasser
Shepherd of the Sheikhs
And I will tell you what they say, "You are planning to open a project."
You've attracted me to you
And seek help in fulfilling your needs with secrecy.
So, you and your belongings are in Dahiye.
But what you have achieved is remarkable.
Ye bah hee arzaq, kul eena yah kee rah zakeh
Reach out with your hand.
Ava alaykum, you are the people
No, no, she's still drunk, Abu Saleh.
In Betpebet, put your hand on it.
Open to everyone
You are brothers.
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
A Lebanese designer
I'm sorry, but
Our women are just like the Lebanese.
Madam, he doesn't call you back. No, no, he doesn't. He's in the college in Al-Dohhah.
Yeah, madam, what do you think of this Haida and this lovely piece that they are selling for thirty to forty thousand.
Ei Soo Mitaleh
Your secret that I made last year when the Lebanese carpenter came.
Madam, I will make a cabinet for you, there is no college in it.
You want to succeed
What exactly is it?
Why don't I know
Sure, I'd be
What do you think, brother, should we go somewhere else?
Ava Ava ya Fadi
And they usually play that game at that hour.
It means we lost.
I need to face it
And we return our teeth against their will.
Okay, you pay with you.
What do I pay for the boy
I'm ready to do anything
But what matters is that I don't give up.
The dress you chose came out for 60,000 Egyptian pounds.
Of course, without the ties present in the text.
Haida, a gift from the designer, Meni.
And he put a crystal heart on it, there are only fifty of them in the whole world, this heart is very special.
Of course, we don't have discounts, our prices are known worldwide.
No, of course not, no one wants to do that anyway.
Luh lah lah, Madam Shou, what happened?
We saw, O Saad, we saw
They do this job
Slaughter us, we don't have any customers left
Heidi is a war name or Abu Nasser
We were silent to them.
I must fight them like they fight us and retaliate against them.
Tomorrow I will take a loan from the bank.
And ignite war against them, and I will show you some of them.
Mubayabha al-barr bw nasir
See the ad
See the ad I posted
We have put on two evening dresses with each wedding dress.
He has four four evening dresses with each wedding dress
We put a quarter-page advertisement.
Jovi is halfway through the page
I'm going to light the candle
Do you believe it, Um Nasser?
They have had six days with no single customer in their store.
No, and today at noon, I swear, you won't open it once, you'll seal it.
And if you hear that he is a local model for sale
Bizahbeh bizahbeh
Even they are not able to sit, they sat outside.
Either drink Jaik and go to him.
Ey, Allah ahedaja, ana wain, wain hay mas'ala.
You are someone who is hostile to me for something
This is Allah's way of sending you someone who deliberately directs you to the store in the breeze.
And these are chemical materials.
You are sure that someone left their perfume in the store.
You are the children of my elders, not my younger ones, and you are fighting like children.
Yay, at night, there's a cool breeze in the store, that means it's fair.
I've been waiting for you to smell your perfume.
About the mistake
You have written a pledge to the police on yourself.
No, I don't understand.
I am this time
The device has a hellish plan.
Without anyone holding me back.
No, by Allah, everything is normal.
What is this that has confused me?
I don't know what's going on, God knows, this is the fourth day and not a single customer has come to the store.
The second shop's owners made me reveal their secrets.
What's the doctor's name?
I see the store is empty, no staff or customers.
I don't know, should I have told him magic yesterday
The harem and the girls don't come near the shop much.
What did Amsoi say yesterday about the magic of designer Saad Wahsh's mold?
Not far away, don't rule out anything these days
Magic exists and that's all there is to it.
Zein ahoh, the guy is lying down or sitting now.
Brother, come in, I'm afraid the ceiling might fall.
I lost, Sultan, I lost
I don’t know what else to do.
He is a monster.
Take care, brother. I won't bother you, no matter your age.
I don't know what to do
My darling taught me how to say that his friends gave him money and paid his debts.
The designer who has
A Lebanese man
They told him, they told him.
What, what, what, do you know where he is going?
The stars are there and I'll find them, find them.
Call Real again, he might have a circumstance.
Aye aye, Mr. Ahmed.
Ah, Mr. Ahmed, you've left and left the idiot working for me. I mean, what are we doing or what? I'm just where the extra actors you promised are.
Whorf, it's better for you to call him. I've got a headache from him, so I'll ask Professor Abdullah.
First, don't scream because we are actors and we want to be relaxed and focus on our roles. Second, Real Madrid contacted me more than once, they were very persistent.
Shit, shit, shit, what do you say, Mr. Abdullah, what do you say?
My dear master Abdullah, what am I doing? The idiot is going to finish the scene and save me from myself.
Oh my God, guys, oh my God, sweethearts, what's next, what's next?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, teacher, teacher, teacher, we need to finish, but this camel that's supposed to be in the scene after that, it's not there.
What you want is for no one to criticize you, that's it.
Do your work quietly and without shouting.
And our situation is all screaming from the morning we want to focus
I found a solution for you
You should take care of yourself, Baba. This scene is so important. Hopefully, you will find an actor who can do the role correctly.
Yes, it's working one scene
But this scene is the most important scene in the series.
But you, look at the pictures, sorry.
But if you weren't ready, I'm going to fuck you today.
Above the youth, oh God.
What is a Filipino that works
You know, Boo, Evercash always says he wants someone to recommend a cabaret, but he should be from the cabaret and Qatari.
Sir, we will put a headscarf on him, and he won't be visible.
Alaa, you're right, you want it, but you're just boiling this, this is a respectful production, respect people's feelings, people's intelligence.
You don't put all the weight on Alaa's shoulders and distribute the tasks, you'll be more relaxed.
He gave it to me so I could see if I think like Reem, maybe you remember someone from that group.
Who is it?
Remember Ahmadieh in Aslatolah's quarter named Saud Aknar
Saud Akenar, like others
Saud said, "Quote, quote, quote."
The thief wants you to give him a rich one and I want you to give me a beautiful one.
My love, Aho, is a comparsa in the end, meaning he is a rich and noble one who gives him a comparsa.
But a little makeup, Reem, and wear a coat and a clean dress and a nice car.
God willing, it will work.
Healthcare, how do we get to it?
I am their best home.
Hello.
Said Awaiti
I'm tired of this.
AIE AHO AHO
Yes, thank you, I'm sorry I didn't do it well.
Now, Mom, there's nothing but this jet suit that my father brought me from my trip.
You only have those to wear.
Yeah, I'm really excited about it. It's under my clothes.
The group is waiting for me at the door with a complaint.
Allah Allah, may you be successful, Yobe.
Today they are taking your picture and showing you on TV.
Ey yemeh, he said that I will appear on TV, that I am one of the big ones.
Sit down, you fool.
Come on, Ash, let's do this to you

Translation: Hurry up, they are ugly now
God willing, oh my goodness
No, God willing, God willing, but they will give you a bonus.
God willing, may God guide you.
Oh God, pray for me
I got you a Saudi laptop, Saudi laptop.
Hello.
Peace be upon you and the mercy of God and His blessings.
This is not Abboud, the son of Fatima Abboud.
Hello Hello
Hello, Saud.
This is what makes the scene
Ai, inshallah, inshallah, he'll do a good job, relax and don't worry, so they'll give you a longer role, inshallah.
Say to the mother, "Ashlanha."
This is the first one to be picked up

I was wearing glasses
Sheepishly, the slave.
I don't change, I regret that I nominated you.
The brother we are waiting for to play the role of Abu Abdul Aziz
Ya wasil ya boh, hello, by the way, hello, hello
This is our way out, said the teacher. Gafil, so Gafil.
The most important thing is that you are not afraid of the camera.
Brother, I fear only God.
You just need to sit down and listen to the director's instructions. He will tell you what to do. Inshallah.
My brother, my brother, if you please, will you do one role in the cabaret, one with music, understanding or not understanding?
Come on, boy, come on, boy
I am talking to you.
This is too light, the role wants someone heavy.
Everything is acceptable to some people
Ask me why I went on Hajj.
Yeh, I'm going to take you to the makeup room now and help you with the role.
Flaw, flaw, flaw
Come, please.
We recognized her on her return
But but but you have you have
Jet walah jaabak at-taffal at-taffal
My teacher, the car you want is ready for the scene.
Saud cleans everything by editing
Either hell redo it again and the assistant director will thank you for listening and go to reassure him.

You say these things
I say to you, be patient, be patient, do not rush, I will not leave you, O Abdul Aziz, you are Abdul Aziz, say

Sweet and I know
Come on, brother, clean up your mess.
Binjoof Wakmal Al-Ism Kamel Buwabdelaziz Falh Al-Marzouq Halou
Sweet, keep going and consider
And consider your daughter divorced.
Why should you divorce her?
Your daughter is divorced, she is beautiful, she is beautiful.
Waay halwa kamil w'a't'a'r nafsik ma na'a'z'k
Why don't I tell you about it?
You are like the flower, and God, you are like the flower, and God, protect, God, pray and peace upon the Prophet, upon him be the honey.
Let him clean the dishes.
How come what
O my lord, the owners of the house, you want us to break in and we want the living room. We want to skip the scenes in the living room and then take pictures of the things outside.
How do you mean they don't want
Yes, they want to, they want to, but they delay a bit, they take a different scene, and we'll follow them, God willing.
Leave them, I'll come to you.
Hello.
Peace be upon you.
Good morning, may you live long.
Hello, who are you, boy?
I am, by your long life, Salem Bushousi al-Shua'i al-Shua'i.
And the good and the good Shuaawi are known.
You deserve it.
IdelDag Khoshmi, I'm back after I put on the braces, congratulations.
Come on, my friend, their backs are weak right now.
I would like myself
If someone else had fallen for the joke, they would have burst out laughing.
Would you like to eat?
The mother of the prophet Muhammad
My mom is tired now, I have to go to her as soon as possible.
A moment, you go out in your clothes like that.
What can I say to you, my mother is sick and tired, she says to me.
Listen to me, you can go that way, but when I call you, you come back as soon as possible.
I and Ahoh, we can't hide the location
Translation: "Okay, okay, I'll get in the taxi."
Taxi, if you turn around here and go back a year, I'll look for a taxi again.
You know, this car, we've really made it for the scene.
They say she's still alive.
Yes, by Allah, my brother, enough, please give me some money, my mother is sick, by Allah, give me some money, give me some money.
In the car
I want a chair.
"Deeyayh halaa deeyayh ab3it lak karsi halaa halaa ya sheikh"
I say to you, I say to you
I say to you, my mother is tired, God willing, in the car, I wanted a chair, God bless you.
Where is the driver inside the car?
Oh oh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Skety, and don't touch my belly while you're sitting still.
Peace be upon you.
There is nothing, but your aunt, the mother, has a respiratory problem, oh God.
Let them bring out the bed
Mashy Mashy
And I don't worry at all
Enough of you, Shamsuwi.
Praise be to Allah, O Rashud.
They took our son Rashud
Come with me, Mr. Rashid.
Please deal with him, Mr. Rashid.
I will take the master degree and do what is necessary for it.
This is the one of you who is most knowledgeable.
I want the nurse to check your temperature and see what you are drinking.
Please go ahead, Mr. Rashid.
About you

Ya, mab, you're the first one to take a picture of the sugar baby who's in the hospital and got a Filipino unit.
And who says I am a Rafidha?
But not a single one gave it to me.
Philosophers and no conditions
Unless he has a certificate, unless your mother says so, unless your mother
Brother, I liked the unit in the hospital.
Ya, I didn't give you a look, I'll show you another one.
What can make the heart attached
My brother is a doctor and a lover, believe me, I've dried it out
I want to give this to Dr. Muhammad.

May you live long and healthy, dear grandmother.
You are a professional actor, Saud. Oh God, oh boys, the one after him, oh God.
Wa alaykumus salam, I saw how they applauded and praised you.
Oh God, go back now, change your clothes and wipe off the makeup.
Oh, son of a legitimate father, leave me alone and come and sit with me. I congratulate you first.
Yes, from today my name is Faleh Al Marzouq.
Leave this nonsense and write to Saud.
Saud died
From today on, my name is Faleh Al-Marzouq Al-Buaabdulaziz
God bless you, my love.
One buffet
I did two.
I even heard one of the bride's family members say, "Allah, these people are very refined. I don't think anyone can do what they did at the wedding."
Anzen habibti yalah ma'a al-salamah
They are my mother.
I need to give them something for the occasion.
What's up?
See your brother who is failing us
And he failed, you see, he got caught.
But we'll keep moving.
Let this thing be true so that the servants can eat it.
He wants to make us look like fools.
Say "Zain, what I saw was nice."
This type of free class is for people who
Famous Middle-Aged People
No, we don't want something ordinary, we want something that no one can buy.
Forgiveness, the noble one who does not know you, orders you a long life.

I'm afraid my money won't be enough.
We won't fail, spirit, pull the card

The small hallway and food for the Glorious One
Ferry Jep
The lam al laam al laam said about the wedding of the house of Aseed
Of course, everyone says the same thing.
This is not what scared me.
My dear sister.
I'm just asking for the money.
And it doesn't matter what people say.
He wants to make us look like fools.
But it's not expected that we will get something according to our needs and according to our circumstances.
You know that some people borrow money and sell their houses and cars just to have a fancy wedding and not let people talk about them.
You just get out of the past and enough of the sufficient pocket that you wanted to fail us in it.
You said yourself that the manager was impressed with the Chinese and invited her home.
Zain dam ahl al-`urs said, "You chose the hall and the couch, and you prepared everything, so I'll go to you."
And God willing, we will choose anything
It doesn't mean anything, but I'm saying that the store we went to is very affordable.
This place is where I did the wedding of Buzaid's house yesterday.
One used them before
And by Allah, to be honest, only once.
A bride for a long-lived man, congratulations.
No, no, we don't want anything used.
I love it. We are the first people in the world to use it.
You want to stand out.
Rawani is with you.
Heidi Al Koosh is visiting Qatar for the first time.
Inspired by the information verse, meaning Facebook and Twitter.
Very modern and futuristic.
And the price of this car with equipment is 1,200,000 IRR.
Hala, it's up to you, but not the one with 155,000.
Mama, Mama, this is not enough, our money is not enough, everything is more expensive and better, and it's all expensive.
Everyone does that.
Be quiet and whoever hands you over
What is the answer
What did you like about this?
Heidi Noah's Ark
Two of them are my grandfathers, but Noah's Ark is more expensive than twenty thousand.
No, and what about it, God bless your parents, I say, the Ferrari is really good, honestly.
Be quiet, I don't want to hear about Noah's Ark.
These weddings and their costs, and you know we're considered middle-class people.
It means you have to have 150,000 seats and 150,000 rooms, that's what you booked the Royal Hall for, according to your statement.
We said it was magic, but the appearances are deceiving, and everyone wants to see the second one and everyone wants to do better than the second one did.
The only ones who benefit from the limited demonstrations are the owners of wedding shops.
Those who know that everyone wants to stand out take advantage of us and cut us down.
I know a friend of mine who says his brother has a wedding hall.
The couch cost 2000 riyals.
I don't swear, I don't believe in Allah, Abuha, Iyofik.
Well, you're done, so behave
Like others before you, young people got married and acted accordingly.
Hello, Madam, may you live long.
What's up?
I know you love excellence.
And that's why I'm always busy.
For the first time, Qatar is being designed by the world-renowned artist Peter Salmo.
The formation of the nine planets
From the solar system
With Noah's Ark, something very beautiful emerges.
We will never be the first in Qatar to use the nine planets.
Save me, God.
Ameh and 50,000 and now
Any salvation
God will reassure you
Take care of your eyes
It's a lot of expenses and I'm your brother
Generally, I couldn't manage all eighty of them.
All that I could do was take 60,000 and 20,000 from my brother.
What I failed, what I failed, and God, my brother, Fahd.
Ey Atlem ya Fahd, Ey Atlem, as long as we are, you are proud and you are in the wedding, we are in sixty daheh.
No manifestations, no protests
Of course, you will receive the cards you show.
Oh, God willing, we will start with the cards.
If our wedding turns out to be more beautiful than theirs.
Mama, the cards that the boy is making for the wedding are very good.
Bro, where do you live?
People now travel to countries just to take wedding photos.
Moo Bayt Aminah went to Italy, designed the cards, printed them, and came back. Bayt Amnarah
They went to France, even people who don't have money, and many go to Lebanon, go to Lebanon and bring their cards.
After the country that was going, we wanted to disobey
Why do you want to travel to any country, God willing?
It means that I have a lot of awesome cards.
Yes, it's really expensive, but...
But it's unique and no one else has done it before us.
Zari la maw halwa
I say gold is better, it shines
My friend, as long as he can't afford the wedding expenses.
He essentially puts himself in a situation of risk.
And leave us the pomp and the fuss at the wedding and the losses that are of no use.
And the only ones who benefit from our mental health are these hotels and wedding shops.
There is a poor soul
Let me go and deliver it, it’s forbidden that I don’t find someone to take it.
Welcome to your connection
What's wrong, Nasser?
Brother, the people of the bride will stop with you after the wedding.
But I only did it once.
I mean, you don't necessarily need a huge hotel room.
Our daughter met her in the street and she is not better than her.
This problem everyone is looking at everyone
Who told you that I married?
At least people don't have this problem.
It's all a simple party and expenses are in line with the situation.
Then come on, Real, these days people are having wedding parties on Facebook.
Cheaper and less expensive
You are not married to your country.
Forget about finding me here.
Araweej Ad.
If Abdullah Arweesh's wedding right is to be upheld, or Nuwal's
She looks better than me.
I say my love
Madam Ouldj has an ArweDroid number, give it to me so I can call him.
Well, my dear, you're not short, bye bye.
We were not agreeing, Mom, on the DJ, I'll change my mind
The view from Um Nassor is better than mine.
You forgot who you are and who we are.
Those who are less than us become better than us.
The subject is not that bad, but my brother Saleh is breaking my heart and we don't want to press him.
Waayid kasr khatri
Wow!
Where is the hospital and which hospital?
Mother, something fell on us suddenly.
I heard this and it's going to hit us
He doesn't have a past, so don't complain after everything is ready and people say there won't be a wedding.
He wants us to fail.
The duties of the doctor
If we fail, sister, he wants to cancel the wedding.
And God willing, only good will happen.
Don't burn her heart.
Mom, you are real and you are the one who brings the money.
Soul, soul, wind, her heart
By God, I said this truthfully, and it stopped Joseph's heart.
Do you know why the minister has not yet released Bouyafar?
Think about it, Ecoh Ahoh has been retired for three or four years.
There is nothing that helps me.
No, by Allah, you are not awake.
You understand, I am his boyfriend now.
And leave him to go through the papers and statements until you get the money back.
This is called cooling delay.
Jan, I didn't talk, I don't know why, why do you think you're afraid?
There is nothing in it, and then I will return the amount in the end.
Do you know I'm a she-monkey? Do you know I'm a she-monkey?
The disciplined participant
Uncle, uncle, I tried, but there is no other way.
I gave you and you gave after the audit money
And their condition is not good for God, in the sense that it is not easy, it is not easy.
Translate the following text into English: As quickly as possible, the seed, the seed, the seed.
The whole bean, the whole bean.
Lala inshallah from 7:30 we will be in the hall to receive the guests.
Lala, we weren't even there.
But when my son's wedding happens, it will be the talk of all of Doha.
Surprise
I want to call you, my dear Fatima.
I'm worried about you, my son. They will envy you if you wear that coat tomorrow.
He is a handsome man with a nice beard.
The police are coming.
Oh God, make it good.
Six policemen, you stay here, I'm with you.
Enough of you, O Salah.
Your marriage is over.
Marriage cage, bendash, now prison cage.
And they discovered the papers I had hidden for the loan. Oh my God, they hit me on the head again and arrested me.
And why are you bothering yourself
You hear bigger troubles than this.
Shankul returned.
Respected and devoted employee
The Ministry, in order to do its job, has contracted a company to do the maintenance.
The employee, out of his eagerness for his work, went to inquire about the materials
She met him at 4pm in the afternoon.
It saves the ministry one million and six hundred thousand.
The minister goes to stop him. No, I don't believe this. This is nonsense.
Why didn't I give to charity?
This is Ahoh Saad who has arrived.
Of course, he has all the news
Fire him from his job
Shares in the world where values
I don't tell you to call the manager of his office.
He said that the killer was a demolition worker instead of Osman.
And the one who is not of a dimension
The daughter of the manager of the same company that is presenting the maintenance offer.
And those whom Uthman exposed.
No, no, no, it doesn't make sense.
You are all surprised, Salah.
Actually, the company is for the one who has it.
Who has it
That's what we became
You say that.
This poor employee, Osman Eszenbe, is not on the vertical axis right now.
His fault is that he is an honest and loyal employee.
The manager is now in his office.
Any ta'le'a mas'a'eh
Heal the world
We created strange shapes.
I agree with you, Osman, he doesn't deserve it, but there's nothing we can do about it.
It's forbidden, you have seven children and no passport.
Satir, satir, age of the job, where do I go to get it, where do I go
I saw what happened
The new employee appointed by the minister.
Osman's desk was covered in dust and I kept on Osman, poor thing, he wanted to take his blanket and I stopped him. He said, "Go, I'll throw your blanket to you with the blanket."
Where is it now
Balances have been reversed, Osman.
This is the latest.
God's will and what He wills, He does.
And praise be to Allah.
God is generous, O Othman. God will not leave you. God willing, goodbye.
Maybe your voice isn't normal.
I know, I know, you’re very sensitive
Any work, by God, I'm done with work, I'm done, I'm done
And a chance after I pass on to my mother and go to the grave of the graves
I don't want you to do that, it's too difficult.
Heal you, cry out to me, I am your mother.
I am not shouting, I am asking.
They said it's okay, Abaay, you can ride with your husband, Abu's brother.
The world has changed, where do you live?
Ashdrani yameh
You're not awake.
People have liberated the universe, it has become a small village, where do you live?
But Shaqeel
Stay two hours and enjoy the time, don’t fall behind.
Nazli, hurry up, Allah, stop your whining. I'm watching you. Allah, your blood sugar is fine.
May Allah heal you, O Salih.
You're not normal today.
And I yelled at the worker, and she had no fault.
I swear, it was taken from me, by Allah.
No, no, no, I don't have the same.
So that I can forget the troubles I've gone through.
My dear, there is no need to worry.
Papa, I'm hungry today, I'm upset
Sure, here is the translation: Something that pleases us, long live you.
Thank you, thank you, you did not fall short.
And work hard, diligently, and persistently.
Yes, that's right, my friend.
The most important thing is
The most important thing for me in this ministry
True, long-lived one.
Tell me about the employee who doesn't take bribes.
Anything useful
That's why I need all of you
We have no place here for the righteous, principles, and ballet values.
If I discover one day
I blame no one but myself.
We don't take the right to blame him.
Because of that, I need you to cooperate with me.
Even if you complain
Reach me all the way

Anything you hear, you publish, they call it "mashkalah" we don't want the scandal.

Oof, there is no power or strength except with Allah. I replied to the same old thing.
Come out and tell me, come out and don't sit there puffing on my head, my soul is coming back from the wedding at three in the morning.
But let me rest, this situation is not new.
Your brother is my son.

It means he was playing, playing
Aye, he was playing, I'll tell you, he was playing Qwaty Makyaj and he was playing it

Honestly, I'm noticing Khalid's brother, I don't know how.
But he is very different from his brother Saad.
Everyone is free to act as they please, my friend.
The lines of the speaker are retarded, he doesn't know that there are unisex perfumes.
I say let your husband keep his right
Ey, don't care
Khaled masadik
You're not just like women with your perfumes.
You even use their colors.
Why are you swearing, Khalid?
Ooh, it's true, you don't have a past.
Mama, why don't you show him that he's not doing anything, you're not showing his actions and behaviors.
This time, perfumes for both.

Where is your father? Where is your father?
What do people say
They say their son is a good boy and he left. You want to make a scandal for us.
Wow
What I did yesterday, the boy's immortality is my pride and honor.
Real deal, he's not a jerk at all.
Mali said to me, "This is my sister's brother."
Say: "He traveled, he treated, he studied, he worked, he committed suicide, anything."

Mama, Mama, I'm Mama.
Now your father is Ashbihali with us, no one knows.
What did I mean, Mom?
Cover me, mother, don't say the truth about my father.
My father turns the house upside down on our heads.
Of course, he'll kill you now
Mama, by God, I'm not breaking it with labor.
Zein, mom, why don't we go and glue them together?
Stick it in there, Mom.
Where can we find one like that? I'm asking you, where did your uncle get it from? Get it, get it, as a gift.
By God, I'm afraid for you from him.
Mom, I'm afraid my father will find out.
Knock on the door for me to see a solution to this problem.
Oh God, hurry up and go to your room.
Uncle, Uncle, Uncle, you are my uncle.
My uncle broke the vase, my uncle.
Mama, Walid, he's not coming.
No mom, nothing's wrong with you.
Shard from the house, Mom, I'm scared of my father.
It's forbidden, mother. Fear Allah for the boy.
Mom, this is not God's education. He will guide you.
What should I do now, Mom?
I don't know how to act
I just want to say that I'm worried about him because of the policies on the street.
God will protect him, I hope. I say maybe he'll go to the store or go to the neighbor's house to play with the kids.

I am not afraid, my love.
I am not going to help him with his hand on you.
I was forced to break it.
Come on, Ybeh, come and drink some tea with me and rest in my room.
You look yellow.
God will fix it, God will fix it. Come on, Mom, come on.
Oh, Allah, the Most Gracious.
I'm afraid my father will be angry with me.
But, oh, no, I won't.
I don't interfere in my child's upbringing.
This is my son and I am raising him the way I see fit.
But the boy is trembling, terrified of something other than his father's friend.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
Let me open it
The bag hit the vase by mistake, believe me, he didn't mean to.
You must defend him.
You don't say anything to him for my sake, forgive him this time, the boy breaks my heart from fear.
But where is he? Where is he now? Is he sitting with you for this occasion?
He is absent from us.
There is anything here

No, no, no, I won't say my uncle's truth, I won't say my uncle's truth, I won't say my uncle's truth.
What do you need from me?
I say to him what you hear the words
Oh God, let everyone go and take their book and study.
Alright, put your phone in your pocket, we'll study it, that's it, don't tell the truth about your uncle.
"By Allah, my mother is confused and doesn't know how to act."
I'm afraid if he finds out, it will cause us a problem.
Of course, I will send him to the hospital.

Nuclear power
This accounts for sixty percent of the world's oil reserves.
Saudi Arabia tops the world's reserves at 24 percent
Then Libya, the United States, and Nigeria.
3% for each of them, and the rest of the world shares 15%
And then
And also from production
And perhaps this is one of the secrets and reasons for the rush of the major industrial countries to this region and its countries.
The United States, the world's largest oil energy consumer, is at the top.
However, oil prices are constantly rising.
And it is synchronized with a decline in the role of the US dollar
Al-Lze takes oil pricing as a unit
Where did the price of a barrel reach yesterday
This has led to an increase in the income of producing countries at the same time
To increase inflation in it
Inflation in some of those countries reached 15%.
The most important source of energy in the world
In the prices of life and goods
This was in a direct conversation with the Deputy Prime Minister
Minister of Energy and Industry of Qatar
Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Otaiba
For our viewers who wish to participate, they can contact us on the program's numbers and phones.
Welcome to the Deputy's Hours
I would like to start with you from the unprecedented prices that oil has reached.
To what point can prices go?
Of course, where prices can go is a puzzling question.
Or, what is also called, market force
OPEC is not.
And the producing countries are not.
And the producing countries, the producing countries and OPEC have no relation to the pricing of oil.
Is it just the relationship between the price and the supply and demand?
And even now, the offer and demand do not have a significant impact.
What are the factors if
In other factors in addition to supply and demand.
To investors,
They felt very big pressures and turned to oil and gold or what is called commodity marketing.
Investors lost confidence in the stock markets.
And gold too
We have seen gold rise from $350 in recent years to $970 now.
Or to this day, as I mentioned, about $109.
But all of them are in addition and if they decreased, it was a slight decrease.
May I remind you that in the first quarter of this year
The price of oil is expected to decrease in the second quarter due to low demand.
But we saw the market in a strange and changing position.
In the second quarter and at the beginning of spring, it rises above $100.
But this means that the previous factors that determined the rise in prices for winter and consumption have changed now and there are other factors.
Economic growth
At the same time, we see that oil prices are rising to this extent.
I spoke about the political factors and said that political tensions play a role in this matter.
Iran: Can you expect Falun to resign under the political complexities that
Her and today she has topped most of the American newspapers and the global press, which can affect oil prices.
By the thousand, yes, today, yes
Today we are in the era of globalization and the impact comes quickly.
Unreal factors can affect
And they create a kind of disturbance in the market
Also, a type of political rumor was created.
He said there is no plan, but he did not rule out other fuel options that could also be used for Iran.
The markets always react to the Qatari rial.
Of course, it is not certain that America is at war with Iran.
And I am one of the people who do not see this scenario as meaningful.
Fallon, and there may be something we haven't seen, what will it be like in the future?
But we who work in the energy sector
We see that all these political tensions
In the world's oil supplies
And, on the contrary, there is a very comfortable supply.
What does it mean that there is oil going into storage?
There is never any shortage in oil supplies.
Perhaps ready for the next war
In the light of this reassuring picture that you speak of about the supply and that there are no obstacles in the supply
If President Bush and the United States decided to implement their plan.
This is something else.
Prices are rising to record numbers.
The price of oil may reach
One of the world's oil reserves
You are here today because the Gulf represents the most important
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and other Gulf countries.
They represent more than sixty percent of oil reserves today, so it's a certainty that they will be the ones to take over.
You are today
If a very minor accident occurs.
Therefore, it indicates
That means that if there is any war on Iran, it means that oil prices cannot be guaranteed to any extent they can reach.
God knows, and we may reach today, we have reached without
Wars to 107 and 110 dollars and may jump to 110 and 120 God knows
Today, oil, as I told you, lives under psychological and political tensions.
Tensions between the government and the protesters have escalated.
Only an oil investor.
Or what is called not an investor, of course, real investment no, oh, future purchase or foyer marketing
It is called oil paper
And these are all oil paper matches.
All of its production is approximately 300,000 barrels or less.
These may lead to more purchases and then to more increases
I wish April was April Fool's Day
I hope there is no
Genie is coming to the area and it is said that this is on his main agenda.
My generation is the owner of this project, as many politicians and media people have said.
I didn't know what was in my sister's bag.
I cannot predict what it will mean
Is he going to start a war?
America is in a transitional phase.
And why doesn't the son do something else?
Let's see what happens if we talk about April. April is very close, just a few weeks away, and we will enter April.
And the world may pay
And America is a major consumer state.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the difficult number
You cannot call this number.
Production costs are cheap.
Compared to West African countries, most of which rely on...
The Gulf cannot be controlled by any other country in the world.
We've heard this talk from the West and the United States for years.
Ask for help
To the end and the Caspian Sea War, remember the story and
No matter what these dreams are
When you sit with the Qarbians in a closed circle
You hear them speaking in a different way.
They say so a lot.
About supplies, the importance of the area, and the importance of precautions.
When I asked one of the European officials, I said, "You are strange that you talk to us in the closed chambers of Hajj."
In a way that is not the way you speak in front of others.
Or the media said no, this is for political reasons.
And of course, there is what is called the standard or, I mean, the two-shot butt.
The role that they know that the Gulf countries play
Today, for example, Qatar, Saudi Arabia is important.
The world's largest oil producer and exporter
And entering into
Despite all this
Commander of the Central Fleet
To wage war on Iran
Even if it is a war or an airstrike, as they say.
Food supplies
You are not late, you are karma, God.
I don't agree with you, we are not in
We are not dealing with Westerners.
With America, we deal
Where are the good prices
Regardless of the nationality of this market
Non-renewable energy means.
For between the brackets for the generosity
Arab generosity
Please give me
Monitors say the real price of oil
And the reason for the rise in oil
You are the Gulf, OPEC, and the countries
You are very generous with the Americans, insisting on sticking to their currency.
You said that the price of oil should be sixty dollars.
The real price is compared to the decline of the dollar is sixty to seventy.
Okay, now the price is one hundred.
19.9 because the dollar has fallen by 35%
Now above $100
If we take the ratio and proportion
No one denies that.
One of the main reasons is
Compared to the decline of the dollar
If we take if we take the
If we take this comparison
Oil prices are...
Because the United States of America
Of course, it is in our interest at the present time for the dollar to fall.
Weakness or stagnation in the US economy. The United States cannot make a list for it.
Therefore, what happened in this economic downturn and recession?
You too have become a part of it.
The United States is keeping the interest rates on the dollar.
Why do you insist on linking the price of oil to the dollar?
Let's talk about why the price of oil is tied to the dollar.
The first one is over 100 years old.
The first time the export of the first barrel of oil was started, it was exported from the United States of America.
And it was issued in dollars.
It has been from the beginning of the 20th century to the present day.
Dollars pricing, pricing oil in dollars
Historically, it has become
And for a thousand years the whole world has been interacting and reacting.
And Norway is considered today the third oil-producing country
And its source of oil
Russia is the second largest oil-exporting country
And the production of the North Sea field in Europe
It is priced in dollars, not priced in
Everything changes in the world, there are other sources and information that point to something else than this.
You are the Gulf countries
There are secret agreements between you and the Americans.
And oil became the real cover
Yes, this is true and there is no other
And these agreements
Based on oil remaining as a cover for the dollar in exchange for the United States protecting these systems.
This is not true and there are no secret agreements.
Today let's take the OPEC organization
You have sixty-six percent of the vote, Deputy.
From 13 countries
85 barrels per 40% of OPEC share
There are many large countries in oil production.
Out of OPEC
What are the obstacles that prevent pricing in other currencies?
Look, because the price is in another currency.
Not all adults when they decide.
You are the Saudis and the largest countries in the Gulf
Today, OPEC's share as a whole is...
There are sixty percent.
Even if OPEC hypothetically wanted to do so.
There will be an agreement between all oil-exporting countries to
There is no intention or direction for change.
The attempt was unsuccessful.
But now it is not up to these countries to be able to change the pricing currency.
Unless there is an agreement between
What is the effect of the word "ترد" in this context?
Let me speak now, I mean, the Europeans
Why don't they export their oil?
From the North Sea or Russia and Norway in euros or rubles
Because it is in their interest to have a high, expensive and elevated currency.
No, on the contrary
Here is their loss
One euro imports 1.5 barrels
You are not the losers, you are because your currency has decreased because it is tied to the dollar.
And it is also a very big loss.
The currency link here in the Gulf is a historical one.
You remember that in the 1970s the dollar was the strongest currency in the world.
And now you are connected when you talk about detachment.
This is like marriage, when you get married.
And when you come with divorce, divorce is not easy.
No, here.
And otherwise, you are making a Catholic cross with the dollar.
You should study the costs in a way
To study in a professional manner and teach in a manner that is professional.
And Kuwait also lost twenty-five percent of its currency value in dollars.
Saudi Arabia Bahrain United Arab Emirates Qatar
It may change the price of its currency
The river is about the topic, but that means you don't have the intention to study the topic or think about it.
The study, of course, differs from the statement of the Prime Minister, His Excellency.
The official said that the Qatari currency is less than its real value by 20%.
To be included in this study
There is no direction that you alone have with this topic.
Kuwait has been unique in that it has not taken a single step.
Economists say that it is profitable for countries and their people more than the loss.
But we
And nothing else
The four Gulf states will announce this
All means believer
And I am one of the people who support him personally.
She will support her.
You must be part of this study
By itself, it is a limitation.
Created what created from a state or two or
Until the time of the currency
You won't be able to handle the situation that.
This is of course where specialists will study it.
And they will be the owners
We are not specialists, this is what you want a political decision
Let's wait and not rush. Now, let's see what happens today.
People started to mean
Of course, in a complicit situation
The Deputy's statement means that the inflation rate in Qatar reached 14.6% in 2007 and will increase to 15.1% in the year.
Eat people's salaries and devour people's salaries here, the salaries of the workers here
People living in Qatar have seen their salaries decrease by 33 to 40 percent.
We return to you after a short break to inform you of the size of the salary increases that will take place
Staff in Qatar at least in the coming period, stay with us.
Welcome back to Beyond the Limits, in this episode we are hosting the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy.
Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah, a Qatari industrialist, on the huge price increase
The oil, which returns tens of billions of dollars to the Gulf countries and the producing countries.
For oil, and my question is about the expected increase in employee salaries, but before this increase, I would like to give you some important information.
The UAE has a reserve of 99.8 billion and is producing 2.6 billion.
1 ton and Kuwaiti Times reports that the economic report of the Gulf countries is the largest.
Saudi Arabia's revenues in the year 2008 are expected to be one hundred and ninety billion.
And it was
Last year, 176, this year, 66, expected to be 57.
Kuwait 64 and 54
One twenty-one of oil is not fifty-five billion
From the gas, as other reports say, oh God, no envy, I mean, I don't envy you, oh, the deputy.
Iraq 47 billion
One and a half trillion
The expenditures were one and a half trillion dollars.
The Gulf countries imported 1.5 billion, meaning trillion
$1000 were multiple imports
Investment in the United States is $2 billion.
And nine out of ten billion
There were three hundred in Bahrain.
In 2007, in Oman, it was 6.5, which would increase to 7. In Qatar, it was 10.55, which would increase to 10.10%. In Qatar, it would increase to 101%.
Those living in Qatar are heralding more expensive goods, prices, and life.
Life is being devoured and prices have risen at high rates and more in Qatar.
We feel all sympathy with everyone
The two processors must be identical.
And treatment means aiming to control inflation
It means you will increase salaries by fifty to a hundred percent.
They don’t say you are against the increase in salaries.
This is not correct and in the same way.
The ministers are against raising the salaries
There is a problem and the solution must be the best possible solution.
And it is not a patch solution
Okay, there is a balance between the teeth.
And this is the Lord
The important thing is how to deal with inflation
And here in Qatar in the committee
His Highness the Noble Prince issued an order to form it.
And it puts
Lah wa ta'zeen yaqad 'a qawa'id
Strong to solve the problem and control inflation
The important thing is to control inflation first.
Inflation
Oh, if you don't control it.
Be the happy deputy now
Specialized in market research and published in late February just a few days ago
Between these about entering because
Now you will cause inflation and let inflation eat away at the income of these people.
Many of them are now
Income to other countries
Increase our salaries, then after the inflation, we'll lower them again.
I am referring to the nice talk they say is the parallelism in the subject.
But now
And it is not a temporary treatment.
The problem is increasing in a greater way.
Therefore, here
To attempt to limit inflation from the limit to the limit of inflation
The boredom will always be
Because the increase was huge in the past year in the previous year, it was true.
The point of the language, the point of the language
And they also work with the government, not just the private sector.
The private sector is completely neglected.
So the issue of the increase is also one that must be considered fairly.
I don't know where you got this feedback or where you got this.
We live in Qatar, not in Germany.
I say to you on the contrary today the private sector has started to pay
Most of them
Many Qataris who were working in the government sector have moved to the private sector.
Due to the high salaries
He is facing a problem
I am moving to the private sector because it is vital and dynamic.
And it gives good salaries
We are associated with the so-called market force
Or by market power
They don't come with very high specializations.
Don't come to Qatar because Qatar is the least, I mean, salaries or less, tak tak costs
Or they come with costs.
Okay, with our full understanding.
I do not anticipate events nor do I say that there will be an increase in salaries.
There is no hope, that’s all.
To control this inflation
Let's give each other some time
To control this inflation
And God willing, this is what the report says that Qatar in 2008
I wish to say that I mean to say that
We see that these numbers will decrease.
They sprayed some on the people
It is a process that means we are a professional process
Of course, with professionalism and everything else, but
Inflation
Because spending
The big on different projects
Let me answer some of the questions from the viewers, and I hope each one will be asked directly. Abdelazeer Mohamed from Morocco, your question, brother Abdelazeer.
This matter is based on the fact that the ruling families in the Gulf are...
I do not think that the reason for this is the OPEC agreement.
Secondly, all oil revenues go directly to the ruler.
Then for the ruling family and the rest is spent on development
In the absence of accountability, things will remain as they are.
Peace and mercy of God
Welcome, my brother Ahmed.
My brother, I won't prolong the discussion. I mentioned the brother regarding the ruling systems and the issue of linking the dollar to the riyal or the riyal or the Gulf currencies to the dollar.
America wants to globalize the world under its banner.
The US trade deficit with China has reached $82 billion.
The European Union reached 86 billion dollars with him
This means that all global policy directions are against the dollar.
And we are now paying the consequences of this as Arab countries and oil-producing Gulf countries.
It may end in a confrontation between America
And among the first developed countries of the world, such as China and Russia, and others, the issue may become a problem
Military-only
The explosion of China's bombs, Russia's bombs, Japan's bombs, and even American bombs.
Thank you very much for this explanation and this information.
Your question, Muhammad.
Hello, your question
You can turn down the TV and ask your question.
Your question
But what I see is that the deputy's intention is to not cooperate.
The topic of not being tied to the dollar because the dollar is falling.
He will hopefully fall to the bottom.
He is a good person.
It is not to follow the style of Arab brothers
Thank you, brother Muhammad, thank you, thank you. The last comment from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar is: your question, Ahmed.
God bless you.
Thank you, and you did great on the nice interview.
Increase in salary, God willing, things will get better. We mean what is meant is what.
We are not facing problems with our colleges, not with salaries or anything like that.
Salaries, hopefully things will work out
Take care of your question quickly
If you have any questions, please contact us.
All of them are low-priced, all of them are about the goods, all of them are imported.
From European countries outside
Okay, we have the whole Arab world with factories and workshops.
Thank you, Ahmed, thank you, you wasted my time
Now the issue of high prices is an important issue.
The issue of the Awof with the Gallabh Al-Raghol, stay with the Gallabh, the Deputy's haste
The origin of those who do not have a billion here is defeated.
Here means we are for some brothers, of course.
Those who do not know Qatar
This is not true for the state of Qatar.
Today, whoever comes to Qatar will see what the impressive indicators are.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar?
Top growth indicators in the world
Hezah Sroh, to where does Mazza go, what will you do with her?
What is in the framework of the response to it
He was speaking, meaning the brother from Morocco was speaking in a way that is not true and not real.
The person who does not see far with his eye
If the person who means Aweh comes and sees Qatar, what huge developments will happen there?
In growing significantly, you are indeed asking
And everyone has the right
And you, the people here, will be taken from here.
Really, does it mean that you will import excess MSLA from China?
We won't import, God willing.
The state is built on a plan and on
In optimal independence for these funds that come from oil and gas, and everyone knows that oil and gas will one day end.
To be the State of Qatar
Considered one of the greatest historical achievements in the Arab world.
Today also the for
The focus on the "al-at al"
And it will have an impact.
The big one after oil and gas
It means that Dubai is not a place to get lost in.
Each country, each country, each country has its own specialties.
We in Qatar focused on education
On the LLLL LLLL components
Here is a medical city where people can come to get treatment.
A media city will be established to host
Of course, today is the world. Today, we must build
We build a concept
About the post-oil and gas era
There were fatal mistakes.
Unfortunately, we did not take this opportunity because we were surprised.
And we were not prepared for it, neither humanly, nor technically, nor educationally.
Today, after thirty years, it has changed.
Also the most important thing is
Today here is a vision of what is here.
And vision
And vision
Thank you very much, the Deputy's assistant, and also thank you, our dear viewers.
Thank you for your attention, we hope we have provided you with
The foreign policy of Qatar appears to be unclear to many observers.
So Qatar has special relations.
At the time when Qatar was establishing relations with Israel, it was and still is
Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas
Qatar provided
So, it started
The largest Arab country
This infuriated the Egyptian regime.
Anger in Qatar reached the point of accusing it of conspiring against Egypt.
Qatar was not far from important files
Like Darfur in Sudan, the Houthis in Yemen, and even the Israeli soldier, prisoner.
Qal'at Shalut was extended by the hand of Qatari foreign policy in a way that angered the larger Arab countries.
What is the power that puts you in this position?
Among these achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabor Al Thani
Or write to us via our website www.wwww.aljazirah.net.nz
His Excellency Sheikh, welcome.
On the twenty-second of September, 2007, to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
The visit was a significant turning point in relations between the two countries at least in recent years.
Redraw the border
Wash what is attached
This is what I mentioned.
The newspaper or magazine Al-Hakaz
The one you made with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, through which you reestablished relations and the Saudi ambassador returned.
To Doha
Initially, your introduction was long and you needed many answers without your last question.
I think he carried it.
Especially in the subject of Saudi Arabia
What is flour
Saudi Arabia is an important country for Qatar.
There is between the two countries
I spoke about silencing the island.
I spoke about a coup movement.
I believe these matters have been clarified by both parties.
And we accepted the clarification
In the State of Qatar
Disagreement with Saudi Arabia
It was always confined to a range
Viewpoints
Praise be to Allah, and this is the wisdom of the leaders.
King Abdullah and His Royal Highness the Prince
In the Gulf, to a great extent.
More than a hundred years
The relations have always been bright, honorable and trustworthy.
I want to confine it to a misunderstanding between the two parties.
This subject was resolved and there were no conditions.
In solving any issue
But there was an understanding and a genuine intention from both sides.
To solve this stuck issue
It is not a seasonal relationship, but a strategic one.
We wish for it not to last but to evolve.
Beautiful diplomatic talk
To the Saudi Arabia's withdrawal of its ambassador from Qatar
I am not used to speaking diplomatically, or I would have avoided many problems.
I always said what I believed in.
Saudi Arabia, therefore, is not diplomatic, but faith.
The subject of the island falls under the subject of media.
Between the two parties, many countries have been added to the line
In her belief, she can exploit or take points, earning points at the expense of other countries.
Or on Qatar's account
Or on the account of Saudi Arabia
The Gulf House has resolved the dispute.
It means on the contrary to what was before.
Sujud from a political agreement
No, no, there was no agreement, only a love agreement and an agreement of interest.
However, if anything goes against that, you should ask the island administration if you have built the Al-Ala strategy.
There is a gap between you and Saudi Arabia to avoid what happened before.
The relationship was originally based on a close strategy.
It can be translated to one, two, three, four.
There must be cooperation.
I resolved some of the disputes on this basis.
Between some Arab countries, we are working to resolve other disputes.
Because now if we look at the differences in the Arab world, they are differences in points of view.
When we have an opinion on a specific policy in a particular case in a particular country and another country has a different opinion.
This is two perspectives.
Some observers believed that you were enjoying criticizing Saudi Arabia.
Aimed criticism at her
Have you been exhausted and decided to move in another direction and then headed to a larger country, which is Egypt.
It means the same idea.
Lala, first of all, we don't enjoy it and we're not funny.
"We treat any other party in this manner."
This means the reasons for the dispute with Saudi Arabia have ended.
Between them and me, I know there is an understanding.
Very big and you know we founded it
There will be some kind of model
But Saudi Arabia But But Saudi Arabia
Let me put this under two lines
The Al-Ahram newspaper started to clash with Egypt in the number of April 10 last year.
The official Egyptian newspaper
In a comprehensive investigation, she said that the extensive investigations
In Hezbollah's network, a sabotage plan was revealed.
Egypt aims to participate in which three countries are Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
And Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
A media outlet known for its coverage of the Tamimi family
Qatar is the smallest of the Arab countries
They are conspiring against Egypt
We respect
And a struggle over the years
I'm not saying it to stir up emotions.
Ne, I'll complete what I've started.
We can.
And the Egyptian president ‏وان الرئيس المصري
I am eager
On Arab relations
First point
Gaza issue
As they say, and as we admit
"Qatar is a country"
Its size is small
You can participate in a plan of this kind
Because we suffered from interventions of countries at one time and I will not return this.
Someone who sold information about some countries' interventions in the Qatari issue
Therefore, the policy of His Highness's government
Now that they discovered what they are saying, it means a conspiracy.
Also, I want to say that the house of God will protect Syria and Iran, and they will defend themselves. I will not defend them.
Stability in Egypt
And why does Qatar want to change or intervene in a matter of this kind?
And the pyramids do not speak of love.
Doha said it sought to undermine Egypt's role and its communications with Turkey and the European Union.
Their capacity to host a parallel conference to the Arab Summit is not to steal the spotlight.
And you are using a misleading media outlet, which is Al-Qassir TV.
Ah, etfal.
With Hezbollah
And we are not comfortable with this, you know.
I can tell you, I am confident.
We are the ones
We do not intervene in such circumstances.
This is what has happened to our brothers in Egypt and this is what we are accusing the Egyptian officials of.
The disagreement or sensitivity that exists among some members of the Egyptian government
But some officials have a sensitivity
From where
I agree with you on the subject.
Days of peace and peace, and when we
And before that, it was held in Egypt.
And after that, we had a meeting.
For Israel
We have a disagreement with her.
What do you have in common with Israel?
And now, because the conference and from that day on
Any Islamic conference, any Arab conference, they have a sensitivity
Why this sensitivity
Sit with them and
Let me finish for you
And we always hope for the best.
This sensitivity we discovered
Or three, that is
Gaza Conference that went on
Egypt does not want to hold in Qatar.
Not Arabic
In Qatar and Kuwait, we told them, "Guys."
The Palestinian people marched to beat him
More than two weeks
But we scheduled it before the Kuwait Conference programmer, the conference we were the first to ban.
People are killing and...
And "وب" means procrastination.
The dispute began
No minor state stood in the way of this fight
Of course, I know that some brothers in the government, and this is also an insult to Egypt, not to anyone but Egypt.
When they said that after
Okay, you in the island?
The Israelis were told that before that day, there would be a meeting to stop the fighting before any speech or anything.
What is it
My brother, take the medicine and food during the storm that is hitting our brothers.
The gate is too narrow.
What do trucks enter
Once they tell us that, by God, there is an agreement on the other side and they must find it.
It's not time for us to want to bring about an opening or bring about Hamas.
I don't care about Fatah or Hamas; what matters to us is the 1.5 million and 600 thousand who are being oppressed.
And they have no medicine.
When we started talking about this subject and talking at the Gaza conference
And Qatar's involvement in the issue causes sensitivity in the Egyptian system.
It's not an interference
We didn't discuss how Egypt is dealing with the situation because this is Egypt's own business.
One of the officials said, "We discovered a major conspiracy behind the issue."
Still, he hasn't told us what the conspiracy is.
This official means us.
Egypt says this is a major achievement
Okay, brother, we understand that Egypt is a major Arab country and we always say that Egypt is a major country.
Therefore, we always ask the big countries for many things.
For us, Egypt is...
And you called for a conference too, which was an affront to them.
We invited you to the conference
Ages of Gaza
And our line was unified and our stance was unified.
People suffer in Gaza
"Forbidden means I know that Turkey has entered things through Israel"
I am happy if I see her enter through our brothers in Egypt
We and in us
And if Egypt wins or does a good political job.
This is what we believe is in our interest in Qatar and the interest of the Arab world.
Stability in Egypt is important for us.
If she does a good job, that's important to us.
Let me finish for you. Your question and introduction were a quarter of an hour.
The issue that you have now ruined me but
No, I am them, I am them, I am them now, meaning from anger
None of the Egyptian officials' anger towards you should be a concern.
We are the ones who failed the Doha Summit.
The second thing is that they failed the Doha conference.
King Abdullah had a wise saying that he liked.
I want to make amends
Therefore, some countries prohibit the use of the word "an" in certain situations.
This is what I said to my brother in Saudi Arabia because we are
We do not disagree with Saudi Arabia even on this point.
The edge because it appears in internal forms
Or does any of the officials have it
The most senior officials have B.
One big country with one responsible person and a small country with employees doing these jobs.
It means that there was you.
It's doing any role
Darfur is a part of Egypt's national security and Sudan.
The five major countries have agreed
If any country other than Qatar could, it would
But these sensitivities lead to an increase in the matter because you put your nose in everything and doubt everything about you.
We want to resolve the allergy, we take an anti-allergy medicine, they tell us what the allergy is.
Why is there sensitivity
Some of the brothers are in the government.
Iredon have internal failure
Iredon Ayojehon anzur la yi'i 'inmuharrah fi Ghazzah 'inqilab
It means like what the English say, "Able mean Italian"
Everything is easy.
Receiver of not just instructions, but also analysis.
You know what happened, okay, because
The case must be handled locally.
Don't treat it.
No, by Allah, my priority is my country.
My priority is to first look at the issues that concern my country.
Then I will see if I have enough time.
Considering the issues that concern the Arab nation
And Qatar tried to fix it
And think about every Arab issue you can contribute to our contribution as much as possible
Why is it provocative? Why don't you take it with good intentions?
I can't treat you.
I can express my opinion.
What are you throwing at me?
We, we, we in our opinion
The one that came from his heart
Let me finish for you
When the reconciliation initiative was announced and the presidents met in Kuwait, we were hopeful and I came out to welcome this matter.
In the instructions
Of course, the Egyptian official who boasted about his achievements
In an article in an interview or something, I don't think I'll respond to it.
Because I have a response to every point.
But I am preserving the minimum of relations that bind us and the Arab interests.
Also, a response to the call mentioned by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
But all that I advise is Allah and others
And they try to correct their mistakes, whether internally or externally.
In politics or economics or others, just like we have mistakes in politics and economics, and there is no one who is immune to mistakes.
Because they are in their house in Qatar with these accusations.
You deny Qatar's involvement in anything related to the Hezbollah cell.
This is a funny subject.
To tarnish Egypt's relations and to fail its role and communications with Turkey and the European Union
We are few in number first of all.
If we are able to do this role
This is incorrect.
There are accusations against you personally.
To pay money to the holders of Shalit until Qatar takes Shalit and takes it and increases the Egyptian role in the matter.
He always accuses us of paying money first. We never paid money and never spoke to anyone about paying money.
But this issue
We are An-Nadeed for Egypt, it was solved just as we solved Egypt, and we are still An-Nadeed for it, as the issue between Palestinians was solved.
Ano, Howeh, Mr. Palestinian President will stay until he solves this issue.
We were present and the first to support the State of Qatar
F the authority and the Palestinian institutions remain until the dispute is resolved.
And we said, "Here it is."
At the Arab University, he says no, we passed it because we believe that some people do not want this subject.
But we passed it cleverly.
Does he address his boss?
His Prime Minister
Brother, I don't know about any problem.
From us to them, I don't know.
They decided now in the number of the 10th of April last, the newspaper Al Shorouk was exclusive with the news
The political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a news channel to counter the media mouthpiece known as Al Jazeera Channel and put an end to it.
All of this is temporary and things will end and be put to rest.
But you fear that the island will become a thing of the past.
This means that they are living through political adolescence.
As you surrendered to Saudi Arabia and the Emir of Qatar sat with the King of Saudi Arabia
We did not give in, and they did not give in to us.
We treated them like brothers.
A small state surrendered to the large state of Egypt.
No, Saudi Arabia is important in a point that I will clarify.
Qatar's relations with Saudi Arabia are different
It means, and then we'll talk.
The relationship between Qatar and Egypt
And we rely on them a lot.
Let me be honest with you, is the problem with the connection?
A contradiction in the main policy is a political issue
"I don't think we have a personal disagreement. I told you, we respect the Egyptian people."
If you asked me now to solve the two problems of Gaza and what else.
And this case, it affected us a lot.
We want to address this from a psychological perspective, meaning to resolve these issues.
Published in some newspapers
Minister of Foreign Affairs
In the absence of Prince Saud Al Faisal
We talked about everything.
But it was clear that things had become tense and had not been resolved.
No, no, it was in, in, no, look
It means I can't tell you that our relations with Egypt are good.
They are upset and we owe it to them as brothers.
And we have a rightful grievance against them as younger brothers.
In the Great State, we do not want to compare ourselves to any great state.
Egypt is larger than the tropics.
It's not a matter of life and death, I mean, but that the solution comes from heaven.
We, for our part, if there is someone waiting for a recommendation
Or someone is waiting for a method
Doha
You treat him not like a brother or a friend.
As a major country, yes, we are proud of Egypt as a major country.
But if someone misleads someone else
This means I know that Israel is following us.
And also the previous American policy in the previous administration with me or against me
What I believe is that they want to follow neither Israel nor America in this matter.
And then they mean if we also take their policies, they are also pressured by external parties.
In several cases, I'll let you finish.
We understand and know that there are still instructions coming even to the great state.
The dress moves you in your politics.
We don't have any movement, we don't move anything.
The Qatar Interior Ministry is an internal affair.
And in any field we can help in the Arab world, we will help in it.
What are the sources of power for Al Jazeera Channel and Al Dhafra Base?
You can say this is not strong.
Believing in God and our trust in ourselves
Or, or the vision of His Highness the Prince
I don't want to cause any trouble
Let me finish for you, no, no, we don’t want to start anything
And I don’t want to compete with anyone
They say what they say, Qatar Al-Umm or others.
But we have our own point of view.
We first expelled the Israeli office, we closed it
Glory be to God, they used to say, "We'll sugarcoat the office, we'll sugarcoat the office, they got angry, they left, they used to say to the Americans, "Look at this."
They lined up with those they call the Devil's team
What do they say
For Americans and Europeans, they are our friends and we know how to deal with them.
The intrigue
The efforts made
It means we reached a point where we finally have to decide what to do.
The first is...
What is your vision for solving the problem with Egypt? One or two points.
And based on the fact that Egypt has a great role in the Arab world
We believe it is important to inform you about this.
I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak is keen on this.
But some of the crew
He needs to leave.
The Egyptian public, government, or other entities are preoccupied with trivialities.
And focus on Egyptian and Arab interests
Are there any steps?
We are behind them, not in front of them, because they are a major state.
In the foreseeable future
"By God, I mean I believe that this topic, I mean, I can't imagine how the topic will be."
And I know that there will come a time for the mind
And there comes a time when it is the same from us.
If I were you
Or they have it.
They share significant Arab interests.
We will one day find that this subject
The world is still going to be far away
It means we are using the Egyptian style you have.
If someone extends their hand to us, we extend our arm to them one meter.
The translation of the given text is: Now, His Excellency Sheikh
We never used to run.
We are ready to march to Egypt only on a sound basis.
Stop with Egypt
There are many rumors about the damage to Egyptians working in Qatar due to this issue.
And there are contracts for Egyptians working in jobs either on Fridays or major jobs.
Do you understand this topic first, it is not the nature of Qatar to cancel jobs and cancel
Because these people have nothing to do with what is happening.
This is a market where there is a change in demand, where one is canceled and another comes in.
He was exposed and asked, and in other nationalities, they hid in nationalities that increased
Okay, quick answer.
The office was present
We are worried about the office, so we should leave it now.
We were teased during the days when they were being stubborn about the fact that all our losses in negotiations with Israel were due to this office.
They closed it down. Let them resolve the issue with Netanyahu.
He was a job.
And he was among them, and we usually invite all the ambassadors accredited in any foreign country.
It was not an official invitation to the funeral of Gabriel Chilla.
No, by Allah, we did not honor them before him. When the relations were like what they say, they were good. Now, they are a bit difficult to honor.
There is no reason now to reopen the office during this period.
The office opens if the reasons are eliminated
You are the one who raised me.
It means the size of Egypt.
Egypt imposed this.
Our relations with America are strategic relations. Let me be clear with you.
In some things, and this
What are the most important things
In matters in our region in treating some issues, we were different from the previous administration.
Now we really have great hope in the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe there is great hope in this administration
Road in the West is moving the path of peace, road in the solution of the Palestinian issue
All our friends and this is what we deny
What happens in Iran affects the Gulf and you.
This is a subject that the Iranians decide how to solve their problems.
Between them
In their usual ways, I am sure they will overcome this crisis.
Iran's stability, as mentioned by His Highness the Prince
Important for our region is the Gulf area and we share a common border with Iran.
Of course, we have special relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because we are a state that seeks peace and stability for the region.
And we would intervene whenever a party wanted to change or alter the Doha agreement.
I think Saad Hariri said
Now the strategic conversation between the president is over.
Between the Lebanese groups
To see how
Regarding Yemen, do you have a role or did the Yemenis take a stance against you?
Look first, we are known that we supported the unity when almost the whole Arab world was against the Yemeni unity.
We are a single Arab and Gulf state standing with the Yemeni unity.
The subject of the south, we talked with Yemen and His Highness the Prince sent me twice to meet the President of Yemen.
And it became clear to him that our goal is stability in Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
This agreement was not respected, and I do not want to say that any party did what they did.
But the truth is that it really hurt me.
"That Qatar, which took this stance, is accused of paying money to the Houthis and senior officials."
Yemeni, because we do not interfere in these matters.
And whoever stands with unity does not stand against it.
And for another goal, for the benefit of Yemen, whether political, economic, or otherwise.
This is a subject we have no objection to, but I am really shocked.
Because I went more than ten times during the fighting, His Highness the Prince sent me to Yemen among the Yemenis.
Sadly, this accusation is strange.
The time is up, but briefly, will the problems you have experienced from your efforts to solve problems change your policy in intervening in other Arab problems?
"By Allah, if he hears me, the prince will be right, I see that there is no need."
And he offered us a large sum of money once.
More than five billion dollars at that time means if we invested it, it would have been fifty billion, better than a headache.
But I say it with faith because the time in the Arab world now means
What is allowed in this under these circumstances
Thank you very much, His Excellency the Sheikh
And perhaps even the exceptional with the state of Sheikh Hamad
Because of the agreement in Doha
How did the Dohuk miracle happen
On authorizing the committee and giving it all the support
In the matter of Lebanon after the Israeli incursion in Lebanon
Since there was an Arab consensus
And we went to New York, we were able to make the decision somewhat balanced
And we touched on this in Doha that both parties were keen
We tried as much as possible that we don't listen to it or that it doesn't exist there
Because we knew the committee, we knew
Accept reality and find out what the problem is after we sat with the Lebanese for a long time.
And I believe it is a joint success.
But there was a determination.
I believe that Lebanon's problem is directly reflected in the region's atmosphere.
Whether peaceful or non-peaceful
Lebanon was destined for this location.
So that it is like this.
And unfortunately
External repercussions
I can say that the problem among the Lebanese is even if there is a problem that is not the number one problem.
State of the Nation, I know it may not be too early to talk about the behind-the-scenes, but
What happened, you came here
You stopped the engagement on the ground, if I may say so.
You didn't delay for even a moment, that is.
What was happening specifically, I know well, even the Lebanese leaders' symbols at that time were telling me what happened.
No, I was from the beginning.
When I spoke with His Highness
He told him that if we came to Lebanon
I am proposing this idea, His Highness the Prince supports and aids it.
All Lebanese leaders are present.
Because you are here in Beirut, you go out to everyone in your area.
And you are in the same hotel and in the same place.
In the same plane, you met and talked.
We created this atmosphere, but from the beginning it was our idea.
And this was the most important decision of all.
Of course, in Kazan
This is something I experienced at the Arab University.
We will be honest brokers
And I believe, thank God, that this proves to everyone that Qatar has made an effort
On both sides
To reach a respectable solution for both parties
And if there is no solution, there is one loser.
Before you take your step
The consultation was held at the Arab University and we found support
What we did
And I spoke to him in his language and we were there
If we succeed in Lebanon, we will transfer them to Doha.
And he instructed me to
Scare them and take their mobile phones away from them.
We were able to bring them there and also the brothers in Syria were supporting the position.
And I tell you in the beginning, if it were not for Arab support, the committee would not have been able to do anything.
They wanted to know why they wanted the solution.
I believe the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that has occurred.
And this tension
There is tension in Somalia, there is tension in Sudan.
In a case that surrounds the Arab world
And everything that extinguished the fire
It is a benefit to the Arab world from external interventions and interference.
And I try as much as possible to be in
Sends forces
Even if it were military.
In this case, I believe the subject is...
In Sheikh State point
He always said the solution to the Lebanese side and the Lebanese file
A Saudi-Syrian agreement
B Qaf Qaf, if it is correct or Qaf Arab means Qatar and the Arab University.
Can what happened in Lebanon lead to a serious reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Syria?
In the Arab world, we need to review ourselves
Because of the Arab disputes
And any agreement between two Arab countries
And this is what we tried
In the Seventy-Three War
When Arabs agree to solve a problem
I think this is a good idea.
Saudi Arabia and Syria have an important role in Lebanon.
The two parties
They shall prevail wisdom
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because we in the Arab world are facing huge and major challenges.
Everyone plays in our yard
And we have no power or ability.
And how do we stop playing in the arena of Arab countries?
As Arabs, we have at least a minimum agreement.
Unfortunately, we are complaining.
We are spectators
Our lack of agreement as Arabs and the lack of trust among us as Arabs, trust is missing among Arab countries.
And then the Arab countries
It's not so much about blame as it is a type of...
What is the name of the "Jalsy"?
This is a case that needs a stop from everyone, I mean I believe
Take this wish, will you embody it? Will you really ask for Arabic coffee?
We suffer when they suffer and we rejoice when they rejoice.
I mean it came with the words
Can you play a role in repairing the situation between Damascus and Riyadh, even if it is in a non-official capacity?
It means they are keen to find solutions and I am sure that by virtue of their wisdom
They may reach an understanding
Between them in many cases
And he was in harmony in politics and I am sure that God willing this will happen
Relationships are improving.
It needs both parties to want to take a step forward.
But I can't say for sure that this is what's happening now.
I am sure that if the Arabs focused on resolving the disputes between Arab countries and the problems of some Arab countries that I mentioned.
A state of optimism and a state of pride among citizens that in his wake is a general Arabic.
But I can't connect what happened in Lebanon
It can be translated on the ground, meaning there is an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
There is an escalation, perhaps American-Iranian, perhaps other issues, I mean
Will you still be afraid of it in the coming months?
We are Arabs
We can only request food and medicine delivery.
And electricity for the people
We in Qatar are always ready, His Highness the Prince.
In over 110 million and a half Palestinians are trapped
We do not want them to have a weapon, nor do we want them to have victory, nor do we want
They do all this.
And electricity
We will hopefully give the Red Cross organization to go and reach the Palestinians.
And we delivered food and medicine to the Palestinians.
And our disagreement with them continues.
I wish the Palestinians on both sides to prioritize national interest.
And they leave behind illusions
This means that the Palestinian schism is a big wound now.
On the solution
And they did not comply.
This is a serious matter and they must adhere to the Mecca agreement.
And they must request that even if they go again to Mecca or to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
And they resolve this dispute
They will not benefit.
Any promises from any party
I wish there was a solution, but there isn’t.
Our position on this matter is well known, and we inform all parties concerned that we are committed to it.
We will not be a party and will not accept to be a party in any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with them.
But we are a sovereign state and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone sees his interest, but these interests will not affect them or us.
We believe that the Gulf's destiny is to have a clear agreement between the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
Iran is for cooperation and peaceful coexistence.
But when the Sheikh's country says that Qatar is not a party
Is there any detail or clarification?
Just a hint
No, never.
Okay, I would like to return if you allow me to the Lebanese file.
In all honesty, the Sheikh's state meant we were facing a major blockage, but in the last few hours, we reached a solution.
There are those who linked what happened to what was announced
Perhaps it is scattered information that has no relation to each other, but what happened?
Until you reached this result
What happened in Istanbul, I know that there were specific dates set before
Oh, you knew about the negotiations.
Continuously on the subject of solution in
And there is no doubt that the Kingdom's support is very important.
And change the tactics of the negotiations
About the talks led
The result is positive that we have gathered so many parties from so many sides.
And we started talking
In this, an Arab and Qatari approach, this paper
Tell me what's wrong with this paper.
We started talking in the seventh grade, one after the other.
In the last moment to overcome the obstacle that remained in the end.
But the prince passed by the edges
And he removed this obstacle.
And he was in a solution
We heard the word Emir of Qatar in the opening session in Doha
It means that you don't consider that your role is over
Look, the most important thing is to keep this topic out of the spotlight.
We have no regional ambitions.
"No, by Allah, we will not have control over a state or anything because we are a state."
Our size, we take pride in ourselves, we believe that we can contribute to solving things with our other brothers.
But in the Arab world it is very important.
AN AN IN COUNTRIES
We want her to do something and this is very important.
Some small countries allow and support them in this role.
It means that some things are excellent, some are good, and some are less than good.
The last question of Sheikh's state
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority?
The wish to mend the rift between them
What are the best ways to confront Israel?
We stopped playing in the Arab arena.
We will fix our problems in Arab countries
This is an active member in Iraq
To give him the position
Regionally and internationally
But if we put our heads together, we can do it.
Any victory before us or any hope we have
Thank you, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabor Al Thani, for this interview.
The international efforts to put an end to the ongoing war on Gaza
We begin with your request for a contract to attend the Arab University Council meeting at the level
Ministerial and you ignored it
Request for an emergency Arab summit
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. In the beginning, I am happy, brother Hassan, to be in this program.
Even if the circumstances
Humanity that our brothers in Gaza are exposed to
Circumstances require us to do a lot.
Qatar has not given up on the Arab Summit
We, in reality, when we went with the idea of the Arab Summit before
Unified is not from the Security Council's decision but also through
Do not always trample and underestimate it.
And let me put it in another sentence.
And we discipline
The street can no longer bear it if we, as Arab officials, bear it.
It does not bear
When we were in Cairo
There were ten to eleven written approvals.
Some of them spoke in the meeting and it was possible to hold the meeting.
We are holding it as much as it is in Arab consensus.
And I don't blame those who think that without a meeting, they can have a look.
Or, or, how to solve the problem
Because it is dissolving
This is the important topic
Because our goal is not advertising or promotion, our goal is to find
It means you didn't turn your back on the problem.
And we ask ourselves, too.
We're going to go and press the other poor guy.
The previous and the next, and the decision of the Security Council, but let's just stay on the topic of the Arab Summit, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Speak clearly, the situation may require an Arab summit with those present.
Or we found that the majority of the brothers support the summit.
Who banned it?
And I don’t know what they mean by moderation.
We are the only nation
Only the Arab nation means if we go to any nation in Asia in Latin America in such a way
And without a solution
The ones that are classified as moderate countries
And what is moderation in our view
Do we give up on the Palestinian issue?
Because we like them
Do we intervene in the Palestinian issue in a way
What does it mean that his mother doesn't allow him to get involved in who is good and who is bad?
I don't know if HAMAS or Hezbollah will have a second party tomorrow.
Is she a student?
And can we say that they are a part of the Arab body?
It means we were planned to enter into an internal Arab conflict.
Okay, and let's go to the Security Council
There is no decision by the Security Council
Please, after I complete Israel's mission, I hope
The second Arab ministerial meeting that you invited to
The one dominated by discussions, disagreements, and heated arguments
He is at a crucial point.
This is not what's important.
If we make a commitment
From the crossings
There is no longer a peace issue.
Are the ministers ready for that?
Because on one side they say no, we have to wait
Okay, we are in an Arab initiative.
And peace talks with Israel froze.
We say that we are on the side that says we will lose in this matter.
In a loss greater than what we are losing now, well, we are always respectful, polite, and committed to the decisions since the days of the truce.
Saadha Al-Sheikh says that the L.L.M. disputes are not important.
Then there were those who wished Hamas would pass away and so on.
This means an expression of a political stance more than a dispute between one minister and another, and so on.
Unfortunately, this is a situation that occurred.
But not everyone
What we don't want to talk about is on behalf of others.
It is very important that we are men ourselves, men of our country.
We are implementing our country's policy.
Someone is doing things on her behalf of this kind
I think it means
I don't think they will respect us in the end.
Yes, is there anyone who plays the role of B-B on behalf of the West?
No, God willing, I didn't accuse anyone. I want to accuse someone in this matter.
After the Security Council's decision
What will be his agenda
The position began in the decision in the Arab effort
And here is the disagreement if Israel applies the decision immediately
We can say in the decision
But Israel did not implement this decision.
Are we ready to go and request Chapter 7? I know there's a difficulty, of course.
The international community has not questioned it, and if you are questioned,
Shyly
The situation is as follows:
They believe that they have done the right thing for the Jews or Israelis.
They will take their right.
This is the current Arab situation
If the Arabs had not gone to the Security Council
They agree on a summit and make difficult decisions.
And Western countries will seek to us
Because we are in the depths of the Arab world and in the world and in human beings and you see how the Arab street is moving in this matter.
But this decision is important.
In case our bosses are called one after the other
Okay, and in the end they said, "By God, it turned out there was no Volkswagen."
Okay, if we are like Germany or something, do we demand
It is not necessary for them to pay compensation for the attack they carried out, meaning that anyone who provides incorrect information should be held accountable.
And it kills hundreds of thousands
This is because you are a weak Arab party.
We Arabs went to each other
It is desired in how
Extract the subject
By the way, it was all over and done with.
If the Arab nation said, "If you send troops to Darfur, we will send troops to Darfur."
Arabs considered or some considered the decision 1,860
And the community desired the issuance of the decision.
The Security Council has issued the following.
I don't want to say that Ahwa is a victory or not a victory.
Things by what they end up to
Let us assume that the victory
What are we doing
We expect the rest of us to adhere to the decision.
But I assure you, we will abide by the decision.
Unfortunately, you will have to comply with it, but you are not supposed to comply with the decision.
Even after the Israeli rejection, Israel returned and accepted.
We mean we
Will you have an alternative or rather you who call for a ministerial meeting
I do not believe that the Arab nation
In the current situation, it is ready for any alternative.
And I don't think the Arab nation is ready.
In the implementation of the Gaza siege
For other political purposes
To favor one group over another in Palestine, instead of fixing who is between them, we replace Palestine.
We started trying to plan
Once they gathered, I don't know if it was Arab or European intelligence, without mentioning names.
And they worked, so we were sitting and sharing
In implementation
What is required of us from the West
But we are going
This means I want to have a sorting in it.
I mean, I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about
Consequences because this topic started two years ago, the topic of Gaza is not new.
I will talk about the topic two years ago but specifically about the decision
Do you have reservations about its clauses?
Published and implemented
What did we invite you for?
They may believe we have a different point of view.
Everyone had to be on the same page.
It's not necessary for us all to be on the same page, but I believe that those who left made an effort.
And we thank them for it.
Regarding what has been happening in Gaza in Gaza for two years, I said that some parties
Prioritising one group over another in the context of the blockade on Gaza
I actually agree with the statements, hints, or accusations that have come from here and there.
About real Arab complicity in everything that is happening now in Gaza
We are aware of the issue.
From the subject, let me tell you, and we are not aware of everything.
But I know
The Palestinian-Palestinian dispute
An Arab and international fire
And if he had not ignited, they would not have differed in this difference.
And it was after the elections that happened
The presence of Hamas in the government
With the majority
We expect them to give us a chance and see
Iraedon reform am hem am hem nasa ila al-an thawriyyin bi-ma'na al-thawrah an ma ay'afoon illa al-bandqiyah wa al-qit'aal.
But today they are inside
Arabic: Some of our brothers believe that this radical movement should not come to power.
Now they are saying to each other that there was an attack
Hamas previously broke the truce or the Palestinians from Gaza broke the truce.
Truce
The people of Palestine in Gaza remain hungry for two years.
This is okay.
For Israeli security reasons
Waadhi Okey, we don't want them in this ruling, it doesn't concern me, I'm in Qatar.
But what is the sin of the remaining people?
What is it after him who decides
These or those, not every state has its own sovereignty in choosing
Governments
This is the root of the problem.
But I'm sure it can be treated.
If we wanted, we would want to ignite the dispute.
But it is clear that if we are required to dominate one class over another, it is because this class is...
Category that we consider terrorist or that we consider
This all led to what is happening now.
And also the promises that the party will live up to are appropriate.
What did they do to him?
We return to the international and Arab efforts exerted to put an end to what is happening, as you mentioned.
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has refused so far.
And there is the Egyptian initiative that
Egyptian in Cairo
On those Egyptian efforts
It's not a wrap at all.
It is required to play an important role
And also, Egypt's borders are adjacent to the borders of Israel and Palestine.
We are the ones
And now we need to stop the function.
In Gaza and in Jenin, people are stopping the fuel in Gaza because
This is not the way to peace.
There must be.
Therefore, we always ask her to play a bigger role
What was announced about it
This means that you cannot evaluate the initiative now.
Or give the possibility of success or study
I believe the chances of success are high.
If the Brothers in Egypt can
They are approaching the Palestinian viewpoints.
And the one who discusses the initiative is expected to be the affected party in Gaza.
Because he is the one who can say yes and can say no.
And this is a very important point.
1,860 when the decision was issued
Our problem is Arab-Palestinian.
We don't want to hear anything
But I wanted to go when the Palestinian delegation went.
And when they went to the university, they asked for someone from Gaza to be with them.
Even now, show the Israelis that we are their brothers, we are one with them.
This is an important point.
We do not make the authority
This is our goal, to protect and to build our policy.
To remain in power
The Sheikh of the An.
I don't know if it's possible to discuss the Egyptian initiative since you haven't seen its terms, but...
In principle, do you think it is suitable to be a means of implementing the international resolution 1701, as some have stated?
A balanced role
Now is not early or the day after tomorrow because
Every day it passes
In the blood of my brothers there is shedding
We do not want the Palestinians or the Israelis to touch this issue until they finish their project, then we will start proposing this initiative.
And I am sure that the brothers in Egypt know this and are keen on it.
And I want to clarify that everything I say is true.
Now it is necessary to resolve the issue.
And it's not like what Israel wants.
Noting this Turkish role since the beginning of the crisis
Does it mean it's an expression?
About Arabic Void
And there was no doubt that the position was striking.
And it has an Arabic depth.
Her entry into the Arab deficit in the Arab deficit
We know that there is an Arab deficit
Part of it is due to the disagreements.
Part of it is because of everyone's point of view, I think my point of view is the best.
And Fulan believes that his view is the best.
And in Consensus, how do we make people respect us and know that there is an Arab decision.
And they do not single us out one by one.
One says, "No problem, let's give them two or three more days so that they can adjust and the community will be at the same level, and the issue will be resolved."
We must rise above this and not accept it.
Hamas may have made mistakes, we are accountable to Hamas.
Arabic Arabic
But now
At least I told them no.
In the context of the situation, Qatar is also required to agree. As we hear, we will return to this point, but
Field-wise also at the same time you heard
Khaled Mashaal yesterday was the head of the political bureau of Hamas movement.
First, it is not necessary that everything that brother Khaled Mashaal said is true, with all due respect and appreciation to him.
Why don't we sit with Khaled Mashaal and talk to him as Arabs?
I will give it to the Arab University and tell them
This is important information.
From Hamas
The conditions imposed by Israel also impose conditions
Let them impose conditions, meaning they are not allowed to impose conditions, and Israel must impose conditions.
What do you think of this Arabic folk gift?
And the rabble or these Hadhali fans, we don't need to listen to their words, they say to me, "He says he heard the words."
It is completely different, he says, the first thing he did was to liberate his country
With or without allies, he liberated his country from Nazi occupation.
Now we are the ones we are talking about
The Arab gift, we expect
The appointed presidents represent the views of their people.
Arab peoples in all those demonstrations we have witnessed
It can be met from these rows of the demand
Also, many of those who criticize Qatar in this situation are demanding
In front of us, the office and the representation are still open.
What they are speaking with the same logic
"Cutting ties, we are moving with all Arab countries"
To cut off all relations even if someone says he has a treaty with him.
Iredon Qatar azhihi qothoq
We are the ones
And this is more important than the relationship
Not only in this decision, but also in the more difficult ones.
From this decision
This means that we must have a unified Arab position.
For others
No one sells to anyone else because they gain moral or material benefits or are called.
Yes, that means before we close this file in this topic, there are also countries that have taken individual steps.
Good, Chavez's subject is different, Chavez has a disagreement with America
Our people do not need us to call them.
Five permanent ambassadors of the great and present arguments, these films are the ones.
We're done with it, the street is now smarter than that.
By the highest ceiling, His Eminence the Sheikh
Or he demands that the resistance forces in Lebanon confront the Israeli aggression and so on.
Do you think that if this matter is framed in one Arabic framework, it can succeed?
But we call for an Arab stance that respects us.
I believe the Arab countries are ready to fight.
And we are not motivated
How do we address Syria, Lebanon, other countries, and Arab countries that do not speak to each other?
What must be in
A qualitative shift in Arab relations
This is the current policy between Arab countries.
List, but I think my validity has expired.
In the goals
The important issue
And we know how the Lebanese structure is
Lebanon, there is no doubt that
She gave an example that she would return her belongings.
The situation in Gaza is different. The situation in Gaza is still the same.
Trapped on all sides
And this siege
It gives a different nature
Yes, I mean the goals for Israel, meaning the goals of the operation for Israel.
The day the people strike, the day the people take turns, the day like that, the day you get for the person.
Therefore, the example of the one who walked in Lebanon is not a good example for them.
The solution model that occurred in Lebanon
Consider it valid
To Gaza
The problem in Gaza or the Palestinians is easier to solve than the problem in Lebanon.
Different opinions on whether we should return our land today or tomorrow.
Disagreements over power
On the distribution of power
This is different because the fabric is closer to some
From the intellectual fabric in Lebanon
Therefore, the solution is easier.
And here is the problem
His Excellency Sheikh
This means that if we summarize this topic, we have only minutes left to go where we can.
And diplomat means
How can this process end?
For Palestinians in Gaza
Let me tell you
Or he would refuse
And I help
The one who didn't come with us
Failure to be us Arabs
From a strategic point of view
But on the Palestinian side
There have been some efforts, but we have not seen a comprehensive initiative.
No, not before, not now, why?
This is not a matter of initiative as much as we feel
The issue is resolved, we are helping without mentioning Qatar's name because some people may be sensitive to the name of Qatar.
Our goal is not to hold a summit because we already have a summit in three months.
If we take the initiative, will we be better than our brothers? I don't think so.
And we don't press them.
Because history will not spare us if we press them.
We are moving forward in this initiative, we saw all the parties, there was a meeting on the fourth day and it was postponed due to going to the Security Council.
We hope that we will be able to make progress. We hope that our Arab brothers will help us as much as possible in this matter.
We hope to keep him away from the subject of competition.
Arabic Arabic
In her anger because of a dispute with the Sudanese government at one time
And this is also one of our problems, meaning okay, we don't fight with each other, we disagree with each other.
What I want to discuss in this topic
In Kuwait, on the 19th of this month, I believe, the Arab situation is as follows.
As you know, as I mentioned and explained, your capacities
Does the Arab atmosphere help the first economic summit?
His Highness
And of course, any summit with any Arab brother, we always prohibit it
And we always prevent the presence of any summit
But he does not fear that it will turn into a political summit.
Of course, considering that time imposes itself
It's too late, even if it means ten more days
We are talking about Palestinians after they have gone 25 days without eating.
It means it will be
The Arabs were said to be unable to participate.
This is what we said.
This is what we said.
With all due respect, this summit is programmed and we are committed to it.
I believe we are
The Arab street is upon us
In our way we are moving.
Therefore, I mean
And we surrender
And he says, "Okay, this is the content."
At this meeting
Thank you, viewers, for your continued support.
And goodbye, coverage continues of the ongoing war on Gaza, see you later.
A few days ago, the International Day of Persons with Disabilities was celebrated.
Hassa bint Khalifa Al Thani
In Doha and contributing to the preparation of the draft of the private law
As a member of many local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
I have presented more than seventy-five lectures, papers, presentations, and published articles in Arabic and international journals.
Initially, let's agree on the term currently in use.
For the sign for the disabled, is it for people with special needs or like I said, for people with disabilities?
Now, first of all, good evening.
Because people with disabilities have taken a rights-based approach or from the culture of human rights.
Because she treated people with disabilities as people first.
Human
And then his disability resulted from his attempt to adapt to society.
Then the medical concept prevailed.
Then, the LAL moved towards the concept of the concept.
Special education and special teaching appeared in the field of education.
This category has become
So we started calling them people with special needs.
These are the standard rules from which it was derived
The role of the Special Rapporteur in monitoring the implementation of this document
Then the pace accelerated until the international agreement appeared, which was legally binding and distinguished from the rules in this aspect.
And a basic condition or basic rule of this term was put in place.
The one who treats these people as human beings, as people, as individuals.
With the change in terminology, as you mentioned, is there a change in the view towards this segment of society?
Yes, and it is measured in a way
Varies from one region to another
But the special thing about this subject is
The Arab world is distinguished or different
However, the human rights approach is present in the human rights culture, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons may be due to a lack of financial resources, not so.
Of course, that's what I wanted to say, that culture exists, but there is a lack of resources, sometimes a lack of political will.
Sometimes legislation, but
But unfortunately, awareness is low and human rights culture is non-existent.
Ten percent of the world's population has disabilities.
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities in developing countries are of working age.
And they suffer from unemployment
It means through my visit to Darfur
Or with the presence of mines and weapons
For males, it is better to a lesser degree.
People with disabilities are in remote areas in distant areas
Therefore, there are many trends from organizations working in this field that are trying to raise
Awareness is to achieve the right to education
Instead of creating many religious centers, so to speak.
It is directed to create rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
And this is one of the things that, thank God, we have been able to do through our work in the office.
I tried with the organizations located in the state of Qatar
Place an agenda for work
Or include work agendas for these humanitarian organizations so that those include the centers of the L.L.
In light of the decline in the situation of the disabled in the world
I can't call it that or agree with you that there is a decline.
If it is in decline in the Arab region because the issue of disability
Within the social context, within the political context, within the economic context, we cannot expect the conditions of people with disabilities to be.
And they are from the marginalized groups.
In a country like Gaza, like Darfur
On the contrary, I absolutely cannot make it so that there is no improvement in the situation.
And I actually translated on the ground, for example, if I can give an example.
In the same way as the Qatar Red Crescent.
We agreed that the projects will enter
For people with disabilities on the health side, there are other projects within that strategy.
We tried to enter it too.
Within the work of organizations based on the earth
With us, the mother of Kamal Kuro from Syria, welcome Kamal.
Good evening, Suleiman Qarru.
Suleiman Kuro, please excuse me, Suleiman
My best regards to you and the respected Mrs. Hafsa.
First, is there a mental disability included in the laws of the United Nations?
Intellectual disability means a healthy person who, as a result of pressure, became a pressure factor and did not suffer from intellectual disability.
The disability resulted from his torture and imprisonment, and he has a mental disability to this day, and he has been receiving treatment for six years.
I know, I know, about 40% of people between a child and an intellectually disabled person are the result of prisons.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
Truth means I am
Understanding means knowing as they know their children
And all means the intention means the intention without without without without making themselves the names
And in the West, there are values
Agreed, but people
From people who have understood and then abandoned or been defeated by Islam, wisdom is not taken from them.
Thank you very much, Naif Al-Said, you told us from Kuwait.
I return to our guest to comment on what was said in
Communications: Sulaiman wondered if there was a mental disability.
Yes, according to the classification.
The International Disability Organization certainly includes intellectual and mental disabilities, also known as cognitive disabilities.
Among these disabilities, there are sensory disabilities, meaning visual or auditory disabilities, and motor disabilities.
Of course, as I mentioned, disability is
Action and reaction occur within a specific communicative context.
In the Arab world or in any other regions
Certainly, addressing disability has taken a long phase.
And even at the level of the United Nations
For example, during my experience and work as a private instructor, there were things that I tried to address and work on.
In other words, justice for all
Until he prepares them
The various tahilieh to ensure their entry into schools, also the work of the labor organization
Working on vocational rehabilitation that includes people with disabilities
I made some improvements to it.
Especially after the reform
Generally, it exists in this international body.
I also mean as a special decision maker.
My reality and this was positive for me, if not directly related
And which supported this position
I saw him in many meetings, for example, the international agreement
For the rights of people with disabilities
It means that she is limited by some of these restrictions or shortcomings.
For example, with regard to legal capacity.
And this is one of the most basic points in the world of disability that cannot be overlooked.
The United Nations, unfortunately, disrupted a lot of things during preparation and drafting.
Regarding organizations and agencies
For example, I will end with this.
The world, governments, and non-governmental organizations, member states of the United Nations
We sent another questionnaire.
For the United Nations organizations and their agencies in different regions
In order to know to what extent disability programs are on their agendas.
If budgets are balanced if there is participation of people with disabilities
Human rights
And it is not only development issues
Ok, we are receiving more calls now. Mashri Naji from Algeria, please, Naji.
And peace be upon you
I wanted to ask my sister from Algeria, and exactly when.
I like to ask, I am a disabled person.
Okay, we'll ask her this question. Naji Mesri spoke to us from Algeria. Thank you very much, Ahmed.
Al-Halabi from Greece prefers Ahmed.
Good evening, madam. Good evening to your guest.
Health care, seasonal clothing, and even taking them on seasonal tours, which is what happens in Europe.
Is a mentally ill person considered disabled?
Especially because they may cause harm to others or themselves.
So everything we are talking about is in the realm of unproductive discussion and thank you.
Sister Hassa mentioned the financial shortfall.
In particular, I call on the poor countries in Africa and Latin America.
Establish an international disability support fund and allocate one percent of the net profits of every institution in the world
And this is mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
A shortage will affect many disabled people, war victims, and others.
Thank you very much, Mr. Ibrahim Abdullah, you told us from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Masri wonders and reviews his problem as a disabled person.
On a local or national level, meaning through Algeria.
The needs within the local community must be met within that community.
These are the same rights that should come to any other person.
In other words, the right to life first, then the right to housing, the right to health, and education.
Therefore, I truly call from this platform to governments and Arab governments in particular.
For the benefit of this citizen and this individual.
For integration
Those needs and rights are part of the existing agendas
No, there is no need to create any devices.
New to meet the needs of the disabled person or no need if this state
It can and must be committed to performing
I advise him first to return and refer to the responsible authorities at the government level if possible.
Because it is within the national scope and must be within this scope.
Your mention of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, many countries have signed it but do not comply.
Here, we pose a question from one of the callers who said, "Why are there no laws?"
It is a fact that we are in a human society, which means there are many mistakes and many truths.
Certainly, many agreements and certainly many treaties do not have a literal commitment in them.
Or ideal commitment, many countries have joined many such as CEDAW and others
But there are breaches and violations and we know about them
But the issue is to adopt an agreement and organize it.
First, we will ensure that there is at least awareness
This awareness begins from the top of this pyramid, which is the decision-makers.
And the officials then progress until they reach the society as a whole
The issue is also our commitment to prepare reports and these reports reach the United Nations.
The issue of knowledge, understanding, and raising awareness and
For the reports, did you work as a rapporteur at the United Nations?
Yes, from what I saw and recorded, there is interest.
Therefore, I believe that there is a relative advantage to adhering to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Therefore, I advise, encourage, and call.
It also means that it is important for people with disabilities to be included.
And we will hear what Ali A'abid Al-Sanari, the head of the Qatar Association of the Deaf, has to say to us.
The mute speaks about it, Sayed Naji, Sghrna, welcome, Sayed Naji and Sayed Ali as well.
Peace be upon you.

This is a great benefit for all people with special needs around the world.
Especially in the Arab world
And I, as a deaf person, wish that
These countries must implement this international agreement.
which will serve people with special needs and it is necessary that

Dear viewers, welcome back and to today's episode, Sheikha Hissa bint Khalifa Al Thani.
For the disabled, an international fund to support
Disability and be obligated for all countries to provide money, what do you think about this proposal?
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Fund
Unfortunately, those contributions are very weak.
The task of monitoring the application of standard rules
When I worked for these six years, there was no support to speak of.
Only from China and Austria.
It always means I thank this country for this support.
The main supporting country is my country Qatar.
The one who founded the office through which we were able to implement many activities and projects, praise be to God.
Yes, this lack of support indicates what?
It means like what we proposed at the beginning and this point is always raised that
With the actions of ordinary people
The name of the program that cares for the disabled or cares for the disabled is Fakeef.
It means that there is a real, genuine, and serious commitment.
In all its forms, in all categories
The disabled, children, women, displaced persons, and refugees.
All of these will actually lead us to a degree of what is called
Equality of opportunity, participation and equality
And there are those voices that always demand and never tire or grow weary
In the Islamic region and the Arab region, why not allocate a part of the budget to this cause?
For the benefit of these programs and projects
Like what he presented is true and I thank him from this platform.
Islamic Development Bank
From the budget allocated to it
This non-compliance you mentioned is about not paying the financial dues.
Aid funds for people with disabilities: Do they only include developing countries and Arab countries or not?
Even developed countries do not provide
The L.L. means the person before me, who is the Swede. Yes.
Also, some countries of the European Union
And of course, there are many countries, especially in the Arab region, that may not be
Even known for the existence of this special course
So in my case, it means what happened
Sweden and China were
The Arab region, unfortunately, also had many promises, but unfortunately, there was only one state.
We will talk about the Arab region but
More communications from Hamad Al Marri from Qatar. Please, Hamad.
Hello.
And peace be upon you
Dr. Hessa Al-Sheikh Hessa
Almost ten years
This girl now we notice that she has a mental disability.
So what is your role in relation to a girl like this who is suffering?
She is with her friends.
With means sometimes even if we stay
What is your role in relation to Qatari girls?
Thank you very much, Hamad Al-Meri. Qatar's Quran Bahjat from Kuwait. Welcome.
Like they say, oh sheikh, Hassa.
Why don't we mix our oil with the other oil?
Arab people with special needs can be counted.
And they can help them.
We have enormous financial resources.
We can break the psychological barrier between us and them.
To revive the individual's morale
And seek her blessings for this noble purpose.
This is if we are really believers.
Appreciation to Sheikha Hissa for her efforts and what she has done during her terms as Special Rapporteur.
With our gratitude and appreciation to her, and thanks to the State of Qatar for everything it has done for people with special needs.
Thank you very much, Aisha Muhammad, you told us from Qatar.
Peace be upon you, teacher Sila.
And peace be upon you.
And your noble job
Hassan, the honorable Sheikhess.
My question is about prevention.
As they say, prevention is better than cure.
There is another level of disability, regardless of wars and car accidents.
At the genetic level, the result may be due to a shortcoming by families, which is marrying relatives.
I think this is a large percentage.
Leads to disability
Thank you very much, flag bearer Sheriff, you told us from Tunisia and I come back to you, our guest.
The first caller, Hamad Al Marri, asked about
This guy is dating a disabled girl with a mental disability.
And he wonders where he is going.
In every country
Certainly, there are services provided for all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether mental disabilities as we said or any psychological disabilities.
Regarding this for schools
Previously there was
Special education, I mean in the Ministry of Education and Education, which has now become the Supreme Council
The flag bearer, Shariff from Tunisia, pointed out a very important point.
And scientific papers, and others
B. Programs for organizations working with disabilities only, but also within campaigns that
Special programs for teenagers
All of these have been the focus of many campaigns and reproductive health programs.
I spoke about this aspect.
Healthy strategies are adopted.
Awareness is being done.
The risks of marrying relatives
And genetic factors
I believe it is implemented in the state of Qatar
And with customs and traditions, but it takes a certain time.
Especially in tribal communities
But with time there will be a response to it, but it is necessary that there be a legal obligation in the sense
Yes, Kroon Behjat questioned and suggested that one percent of the Arab countries' budget be allocated.
To help people with disabilities, let me in first.
Yes, there is statistical estimation that the World Health Organization applied to the whole world.
There are forty or nearly forty million disabled people.
Half of them are women.
But these numbers are doubling
A study in South Africa found and proved it.
Certainly, the statistics that appeared about the war in Iraq about the war in Gaza
Every killed person is met by three disabled people.
And since our Arab region has become a region of unrivalled conflicts.
So, even the proposal that Behjat Kuroan presented
One percent will not be enough
To assist the disabled in the Arab region if
The issue of lineage is relevant to disabled people or other marginalized groups.
Honestly and truly, I don't see that it agrees
Which addresses their problems and needs
She confirmed that people with disabilities are the most neglected.
The ones carried out by governments generally do not count the disabled.
True, and this also relates to the culture of society and sometimes restrictions.
Community, meaning when a census is conducted by
The relevant devices
About the presence of a disabled person in the house or home
There was only one question asked: whether there was a disabled person or not.
The relevant department for this matter and through the concerned parties there
Cooperate to prepare a form
We recommended that there be more details
First, clarify if this person with a disability is a male or female.
And does his assistant wake up or not?
In fact, even the number, as I know, is correct, unless we have not reached the exact result.
Be sure to follow Fatima Al-Dosari's progress with us from Qatar. Welcome, Fatima.
And peace be upon you
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a child with disabilities.
And I extend my thanks to the ruler of the country, Sheikh Hamad.
And his wife, Lady Musa, forbade him from embracing this group.
I am truly proud of the care and attention I receive.
On its important role
Latifa Al-Maseefri, please.
Because they represent a major obstacle in society without education and without treatment.
Thank you very much, Latifa Al-Maseefri from Qatar, with us, Naseem.
Abdulkarim from Jordan, welcome, Naseem.
Please, Karim, listen to me
And peace be upon you
Thank you, I actually have a comment.
First of all, I am an audiologist and worked in the state of Qatar for about four years.
And it was a month of awareness about hearing and speech problems.
We were working on conferences, lectures, and awareness for hearing impairment.
Now I want to talk about Jordan. I have been living in Jordan for about three years.
Honestly, it provides new and wonderful services.
Honestly, we are offering new services, whether in terms of material, immaterial or moral aspects.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education means in the sources
The one that belongs to the Ministry of Education in government schools.
So we, as private institutions,
We receive great and beautiful support.
Okay, Karim, do you have a direct question just because of the time constraint? I apologize.
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan is a wonderful service and I think it's very good.
Comment on what came in viewers' communications
It means someone who works in this field
Regarding the subject of the letter.
I will also return to the issue of the agreement.
Which are required to be ratified and acceded to once they are adopted.
And it is the duty of this state or these organizations
Because it starts from the issue of the rights of these people regardless of
And honestly, what is it that
To be done during that period for the disabled and for
And now you wish it would come true
Of course, I wish you both
I hope that this research or this survey will be measured and more qualitative research will be presented in this field.
Also, this experience has shown me that
Six years of experience.
And coordination between Arab countries as well
Also, they have a role, it is not just a matter of rights, they are recipients of rights.
Sheikha Hissa bint Khalifa Al Thani, former UN Special Rapporteur on Disability, thank you.
We welcome the elegant presenter of the League and Cup channel, Lana. Good morning, Lana.
I am also pleased to welcome the outstanding captain in the ranks of the Al-Asalah Club, Captain Ali Qasim.
Hello Ali.
Welcome to you
Good morning
I'll leave it to you to congratulate each other. I'll congratulate each one at their convenience. Please accept my apologies.
I had an open studio for five hours and Abla, I didn't have two hours Abla Abium.
Hanat, the State of Qatar, government and people, they certainly deserve this global achievement.
I can take this opportunity to congratulate and wish the best to Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
Or his crown prince Sheikh Tamim
Yes, of course, I am one of the people from the mathematical field and one of the workers in this field and the people who know these lines and this field in a big way.
Because even we
Between us, we deserve it when we got 6 votes between us and America 14 votes for Qatar and 8 for America.
Not at night because our file is rich and comprehensive and supported by many ambassadors, supported a lot, let's announce the stadiums
This means that some people were afraid that there might be something like America
Perhaps in some countries, these things will be ready, so they won't need to set up stadiums and set up some projects for this event.
Because the Urdu ones are ready.
But they were afraid of this point.
Captain Ali, you are athletes, I expect this to be a very important achievement for athletes.
I expect it will enter the mainstream of economics, politics, and health.
But the critics.
What does this achievement mean in terms of numbers?
Of course, it's a great achievement, especially for us as athletes. Even non-athletes saw how happy they were.
I hope to inform you about it at the moment of the announcement.
By God, I was coming from the exercise and we were listening to the radio.
We were waiting for him and I was with one of the group.
Walking in the car and putting on the radio
First they announced on Qatar and then
We all shouted, the two of us, and of course, we closed the hole.
My friend came out of the hole.
Screaming and the world is watching our work, the danger and the journey, we are going
We completed the journey from the beginning.
Thank God it was a very special day, I think, and all the channels probably focused on this event in a big way.
Lana, you are definitely in this topic.
And especially the sports channels
How did they celebrate this topic and what was their reaction?
There were media from many channels in the world
A major landmark is clearly visible on the map, known as Qatar.
Of course, the presence of the player in the national team is also a very important thing.
And I expect that this is his responsibility to a large extent.
What do you think about this point specifically?
Okay, Captain, what are the characteristics that this player must have to be included in this team?
Now, on more than one occasion, Riazi came by the way.
And we now need to create a strong generation
It means and has basic rules and technical football techniques in a studied manner
What are the rules and fundamentals that this player must have?
I think that professionalism ensures everything.
Desire in exercises, consistency in exercises, discipline
All these things are essential to help the player put everything he has into the game or in the exercises.
Every phase has its own special character.
She has her own whims and feelings.
From various programs, entertainment to sports, where is the most beautiful for you, where did you feel the most?
And God, it's nice.
By really taking care of yourself, you know how I want to take care of myself through sports, this is the most important thing.
Then you have football, the fans' darling, everyone follows it, whether you like it or not, when you miss the game, you want to watch it.
What limits the media in one aspect for us
What confines you so much puts you in a particular aspect
Too much condition but football
Both sports medicine and sports are beautiful.
Also, it means in many important things that I love to talk about.
I don't want you to come back ten years younger so you can reach 2202.
What did you wish for this thing
Of course, we certainly wish for this, especially since the World Cup means that any player can
It means that anyone who watches a World Cup match will be excited and happy, so what about playing in the World Cup?
I wish they would live up to expectations, God willing, and this is their chance, God willing.
What word would you like to say to a professional player, not on what word you would like to say from your heart to them.
We wanted you to be here with us during this time.
By God, it's like the one currently, I mean vacation, but
I brought him back to the championships after an absence of ten years from the Gulf Cup.
You're definitely referring to Mashallah, a beautiful imprint from Qatar TV and lovely memories.
Mashallah, meaning Qatar TV has now become like a university that graduates a large group of journalists.
Our team is a strong team, God willing, it will win many different awards.
Let's talk about something with the mission of the Amalsal Club
What's your situation there? What's the news there? God willing, you're comfortable.
Of course, praise be to God, honestly, Am Asalal
Yesterday, of course, he was with us in the studio, we talked a lot about the players.
I expect that some of the young people who are following us will still feel like they are one of us.
Needed
It means that the players are performing naturally in the professional water polo league.
I got my chance in the Amal Al-Aseel, in terms of Kareb or Kareb.
I was able to take the place of the Asian Cup with the team, thank God.
And my situation, thank God, is good with the team.
The topic of sports, how can we do it as a social activity
And Qatar, how can sports be introduced to women, children, and young people?
It connects them with each other, meaning everything complements sports.
You have a different role in different sports women do not play a role
Sports awareness is spreading among all members of this society, from the young to the old.
It will take approximately 10 years until we reach or 15 years until we reach this occasion, I think it is enough time.
Because our new generations are still learning about the new.
In a generation that is growing up, but in a generation after that, people need to be educated about sports from a young age.
About us Aspire Aspire Tower is a great landmark that we do not deny the great founder of the tower.
A single sheet and number for the new sports generation
We just need to lower our intentions and set off.
And they specifically love football.
How do I get the audience to keep communicating throughout all the different LOL matches, even between clubs?
And God, the truth is that we have a problem in the Qatari League, which is the lack of spectators.
But this is the problem with attendance, meaning the Qatari Football Association has not yet found a solution to attract the audience.
What is the method we need to use to attract them to follow these matches?
It depends on the person himself, meaning some of them do not like to ban the playground.
The media plays a key role in the idea of mass disengagement.
They are currently working on a ticket system or a points system that collects points.
Lala is a union that means it has a plan of several steps to attract the audience.
Some clubs have methods like Al-Rayyan that attract the audience. Of course, Al-Rayyan is rich, so it doesn't need an audience.
Some clubs need to have some club administrators organize activities and events.
The right of the public to stimulate the right of the public, but I believe these are the means that are available
The game means the new generation
Their love for the job, their faith in their abilities, and the moral support they provide are all very beneficial.
We certainly mean to thank you for this good meeting, God willing.
We would like to take your final words on this wonderful victory, of course, Qatar's win for the 2022 World Cup. Thank you for the start.
We will return, but Qatar has never insisted on the opposite, it has always avoided and been at odds with us.
By the will of God, Captain, please allow me to say the last word I wish to address in this meeting.
And I say to them congratulations and may God bless the Imam, may God bless him.
Thank you for Captain and player Qasim and we wish you all the best in your sports career and in your life as well. God willing, God will help you.
And we love sports more and more.
The topic of the episode is young talents
Some young people think that this period is really just a current phenomenon, but these songs have a very deep and great history.
A group of young people sing Arabic or English lyrics.
We are going to follow this topic today with a group of rap enthusiasts.
We will get to know them better through our meeting that will bring us together on air.
Welcome, our viewers, wherever you are
A new type of singing has spread in the Arab and Gulf area for years
Coming from the West, specifically America, and it is rap music.
And before delving into the topic of rap singing
There is a danger in using any term without any reservation
Anyone can sing rap.
Regarding writing the song lyrics
Almost all rappers write their own lyrics.
Generally, all these details are very important and we will learn about them through two people who are strongly involved in this field.
They made a nice band.
Good morning, welcome to Yusuf Al Nuaimi and Salman Abdullah Yusuf.
Hello and welcome Salman, good morning
Good morning, hello
I am very happy to have you with us through this program.
And also through the subject of rap singing, of course.
What's your take on the subject, Yusuf?
We saw that rap music was not present in the city of Tartus.
Batraga is the most beautiful.
In the language of the citizen
Some of them are happy, some are sad, and some are about political issues.
Yes, I am in the world, and the rap
And these songs are art from one of the arts, just as the visual arts paint a picture, the poet writes a poem.
The singer can sing, the player can play any instrument.
You feel accepted by Qatari and Gulf society for this type of song.
210
There is a feeling that people love to collect rap songs.
Different ages
And there are families and there are a lot of people who have heard more than one language
If it were on a website like this.
And how many are there in this group so far?
Everyone can say words, write poetry, and rap them in style.
The rapper, God, like what you say, you can say that he sings himself.
He is the one who sometimes plays and the one who writes the lyrics.
Oh, okay
Listen to it, by God, I recorded this song.
Okay, now all these songs that Salman produced, from Munqith, Yusuf, from anyone from the same band.
I didn't think it would be available on a specific CD sold in the markets.
But you know that when you are a person, it means I will make an album and put it on the market, which is difficult, a business license and procedures, you know.
Okay, why didn't you think that you are twenty-five, meaning the one hand never claps.
You guys must have 25 hands, God willing. God protects all of you as young people and brothers.
Work on this CD. You can promote it through more than one website on the internet.
You have Facebook, you have YouTube, you also have it through local newspapers.
I think there are thirteen songs in it.
Registration is the same time
It was a bit foggy, but it was clear enough.
The quality is a bit weak, but it's not the same at the same time, it's clear.
And it is a 50 CD collection of Western music.
It means that I can't say what it is because some young people have known this art for ten years.
No registration required and I expect distribution in this period now it's different
Especially since there is a large collection of music, a large collection of techno music types now.
These are young people or these are the artists who produce a large collection of beautiful songs.
Also, we need to talk about the parties you attended.
And God, I saw the party in Doha, we participated in one party.
Of course, Al Sadd Club organized it for us, so they didn't come with us.
Unfold the audience.
I see something that means we didn't expect these numbers
What we found surprising was that the families were more
Families are more than young people.
From to and organization meant awesome
We were a bit confused and it was our first time in Doha.
Our prediction means there is no demand.
But the audience's reaction was wonderful.
And it was a long time that the songs were useful, I mean
Let's hear something or some lyrics from one of the songs they composed, for example, and presented to the audience, which was particularly well-received by young people.
For example, let's hear some of the words so we can also explain them to the viewer.
We can hear it on the air.
Please, feel free to come in.
Please be safe.
The problem is that the words are a bit unclear.
Let’s hear it
I don't know
We now have the Doha Morning program.
The one who gets up in the morning has an open mind.
Salman, like the mountain, has been in the rap scene for five years.
One, even if he doesn't accept, can be poor.
I brought a lot of people to them
I need to learn these words soon.
Okay, the songs you sang, for example, give me a sentence from one of the sentences you said, for example.
This is what I see, not all songs are random, meaning what he said now, the most important thing is that they call it freestyle in English.
It means the same weight
But when we sing a song, we mean the words we write carefully.
Thank you, let's follow it up.
We can say Good Morning my country, Good Morning Qatar with the program Sabah Al Doha.
Stay on air and broadcast live directly to the viewers.
What do Iphone One One Two One and Xixun do? They are looking for something from the arts.
We have the Doha Morning program.
Of course, the beautiful song you saw.
I'm now insisting that the youth be present online and present everywhere.
Greetings indeed when you recorded it
She was a participant.
Every one of us, between us and each other, every one of us has the right to his own.
I feel like Yusuf can't accept my words for a while or take them or can't walk them.
So each one takes words
We certainly mean that every artist, every painter, and every poet is always in the process of creating something new.
Also, it can be written about the love of sports.
In love with the homeland itself
Of course, you participated in the National Day through the march.
Through your beautiful songs, you young Qataris also represent Qatar.
Doha is getting ready to welcome the Asian Cup, and there is a big procession on the Corniche.
To receive this event
We are going to transfer these footage to you to receive, of course.
Doha hosts the Asian Cup
From Doha Airport to now
And watch these clips live together.
For the sake of our children, our students, the existence of this crowd, the existence of our sons
I arrived early this morning at Doha Airport for the Asia Cup to complete
Preparations for hosting the major continental event
We return again to our guests Yusuf and Salman who are illuminating the studio.
The most important Arab-Gulf rap group in Qatar is Sah.
We can say that about you.
God, it means we are currently meaning
I'm organizing a party, but it's not definite.
But now you are working on a specific event and I will announce it, God willing, Yusuf.
Inshallah, but it's not certain, it means until now in the beginning of the journey.
We wish you all the best at the beginning of your journey and I am sure that our program will be your support, God willing, with all our hearts.
Also, Salman, what do you all think, you guys are all twenty-five people
Where do you submit the application and how do you put the ideas together and write them with each other?
Of course, there should be some joint songs.
It is not necessary for one person, such as Salman or Yusuf or any one of them, to sing a complete song.
You need to have harmony between you, where you meet, and when you meet.
By God, you see, twenty-five of them are so difficult to gather all of them at once.
I started talking to Yusuf and I talked to those people so that today we can meet in one place.
Because I don't understand the idea of the song and the lyrics
And in a second after, he was gone.
Sign the ones that are on me.
Go deaf for him while he continues
This is for you, Yusuf. Record and broadcast it to me, Fashwi.
See the LLL expertise that exists here.
You should buy some CDs of the biggest artists.
Take some experience, take them, that means some of the techniques
They're sure we always mean
Artists who have spent years in this field or have expertise and reputation in this field.
One hears them, they are trying to improve their methods, their ways, to try to improve their method, meaning they are not imitating.
It means that I can't because if I do the same style, the same tone of voice, the same level of words
I'm just copying, I'm not doing anything new, I'm doing something special for myself.
It means we rely on them a bit.
Yes, I also expect there to be a large group of young Gulf people in the Gulf itself.
In a primitive way, we follow this report together and benefit from it, and we also enjoy watching it with some of this report.
The mystery still surrounds the talent that many people possess.
Using very primitive means
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah Aldail
The city is located far from the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
150 kilos
He has great ability and extensive experience.
To detect the surface groundwater sites
And in depths exceeding one hundred meters
You know that drilling wells is expensive.
But with the expert, he can determine the right place to dig the pit.
Of course, the method of discovery or ‏طبعا طريقه اكتشاف او
Identify the location of the water
She has been since ancient times
They were the Quraysh of our fathers and our ancient ancestors.
They use a probe to determine the locations of the wells.
For drilling
Abu Ibrahim's methods for discovering water
Modern devices are not.
Or soil analysis in scientific laboratories
But he relies on God's favor in his work.
And its channels are under the earth
They are either the seeds of the pomegranate or the pomegranate's stalk.
A branch of pomegranate or a branch of fig
Now we are practically applying the process of discovering waterways.
The end of the stream is now starting to return to its original position.
Return again
Return, return
The translation of the given text is: "This is the return now, if from here, we put a mark."
And here the water course ends.
It requires great experience and a long patience.
In order for the discoverer to reach the sensitivity of the movement of the tools.
I went to more than one area.
It means 95% success rate.
Of course, this method and the method of using copper rods are the same.
Of course, there is no precise scientific explanation.
For this metho
It is surprising that the success rate of those who practice this primitive profession is so high.
Over 95%
To detect the surface groundwater reservoirs
Glory be to God. Man has learned what he did not know. This is a report, of course, which we took from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
They worked on it as a special team and ended up with more than one CD.
It means whether it's online or some of them on the phone.
F. In some cases, there are competitions between the Gulf countries, between Qatar and Bahrain, between Qatar and Kuwait, between Qatar and
You can download a stronger song about a stronger topic.
About a problem about about means to the end a lot of issues
Follow him or be hollow like my superior, meaning be hollow if there is nothing
God willing
Also, at the same time, we need to take this into consideration.
It also means a large collection of songs.
I will try my best to disseminate it.
We will keep in touch with you from time to time.
Even we know what the first album news is for this band.
But I confirm the name of the band
Rappers Qatar
We're going back a second time and our guests are there, and we're going back to the Corniche and the beautiful atmosphere that
We are definitely with you live through the direct link that we are broadcasting for our viewers.
Wherever you were on the Corniche and the reception of the Asian Cup
We are certainly proud of them and proud of the different arts.
It addresses many social and psychological problems among young people.
But Yoona is in the studio two
Of course, I will complete the twenty-five.
Abu Yusuf and Salman welcome you once again.
Subscription will be stopped once
So I'm trying to contact the company, but we don't know where the company is and no one is responding to us.
I must improve myself, at least the one who is out there.
Facebook YouTube
Sites like these mean
By the band
We received, we are always coming out
You arranged like we saw with some of you, God bless you, you did this work
You are putting these songs on a set of pictures, your personal photos.
Or download it on YouTube, download it on the sites where there might be videos that one can follow.
And Allah in our lodging before
And in the songs, a lot means
The obstacles you are currently facing are that there is no site where you need a company to sponsor you.
No, you really don't need a place to gather as a group.
What are your wishes so that you really wish to achieve and reach the high level you wish for.
It means we're done, we're holding on
Tell us, oh God, we are counting for you, we are arranging for you, we are downloading the album for you.
Eicon means something means something official
Because it means five years now
Hobby means no more.
Yes, we participated in many things, we participated in programs, we participated in series.
I wish to develop Icon into
It means that in something means that supports us means that we are always with him
Yes, and we also want to know your wishes, Salman, other than Yusuf's wishes. What can you say?
The only wish is to westernize the music video
In sha Allah, we wish you all the best through this group.
The good, and we wish that God willing, your songs will always be present in the Arab world and in the world.
And indeed this is a high art, an art that is heard in a big way.
And there are messages like what you mentioned
God willing, you will always succeed and we wish you all the best, God willing.
Send my regards to the whole group and good luck, God willing.
We will conclude this meeting with the song they made for the program.
With you, KD and DJ Mr. Bubu on the program Sabah Al Doha.
Good morning, morning ladies and gentlemen.
This is KJ Master P and SKT One Hot 2 Breeze
We can say Good Morning my country, Good Morning Qatar with the program Sabah Al Doha.
Stay on air and broadcast live directly to the viewers.
And don't forget, the program starts at 9:30 in the morning, meaning everyone is sitting in front of the TV.

We have the Doha Morning program.
With us in the preparation Hassan Naama with us in the presentation Shimaa Al-Hammadi
With us in the direction Nasser Al Malki, the guests of the episode are rappers from Qatar, of course.
Translation: It is reused and utilized in the house again.
This is an electric or shopping cart.
In it, any person shopping in a supermarket or elsewhere.
Anything you put in the car, anything you want, you buy it.
A large screen will appear showing the components of this product.
This was also a great and feasible idea.
Meaning just a barakot iskan works icon in the car reveals this commodity
It makes the purchasing process easier for the buyer.
It takes complete details on a special screen in it
I expect it to be more in a healthy awareness.
When it is in a device with you, even with the same car
The most components
And warnings, also its side effects.
The full details are in it, I mean
Or he has ambition, for example, he was in a number of projects, four or five.
Traffic problems are being addressed.
Traffic congestion and other parking problems were addressed, and it was also very creative and nice, I mean
Masha'Allah, also the Cultural Center for Childhood
Let's, Professor Abdullah, also talk about the different activities that I will hopefully see in the coming days.
Yes, of course, there are surprises, but it's just a quick pass.
Ideas, if you like, I can mention them from some of the projects that are presented or
This is an example of the smart or creative idea of moving underground.
Everyone who leaves their house has a purpose.
They gather at a specific point.
Of course, these are all the pictures that the viewers are watching, I think they will enjoy them.
Children's creations
Exactly yes, this is an example of a cash machine.
For women, for example, I have a card
Enter this card, for example, I need a black T-shirt.
For example, right now some stores or for example, I have some lost things at home, a key, I don't know what.
For example, what I found was office keys, office keys
Of course, we have a main goal, which is the wish of Her Highness Sheikha Moza.
The Royal Enclosure of His Highness the Prince
At an early period and this is of utmost importance in the design of projects
The number was also selected from among 300 children.
Then we also have the promising preachers in Ramadan.
Yes, she was the one who presented the closing ceremony, she was the host.
We really want to open our hearts and doors to all the children who want to present their programs.
And after them they will depart.
Our need for support for this as well and their presence is at the top of our priorities
These projects and programs serve this main idea.
Different and diverse children's skills
To self-development
Okay, do you have any cooperation with some of the different youth clubs in Qatar?
Also, there are scientific clubs in Qatar.
Of course, all our programs are built on partnerships.
All our programs mean specialized partnerships
With a group of also community service institutions specialized in developing these skills
He is in partnership with all institutions interested in the field.
The Photographic Society
The General Secretariat of the Council of Ministers also played a very important role in the Center for Creativity of the Girl.
Yes, he played a big role in explaining Qatar's vision.
Training children on it
And attracting and encouraging children, all our programs are built on institutional partnerships.
According to the specialization of these projects and institutions
What's different about you?
Of course, being in Katara gave us a strong push and a lot of support.
And the fastest form
Of course, there are a number of projects in partnership with Katara, and preparations are currently underway for their launch, God willing, in the next two months.
Of course, there is cooperation in many programs.
Especially what concerns reading
Chairman of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
And we are walking in it now, especially we are now in the time of preparation
Building a promising scientific future for all children, future generations, and the upcoming youth, God willing.
The word I want to convey to parents, young people who follow us, and children who want to be present through the center.
Here is the translation: ‏We are giving it now
Our children's times have ideas that we do not mock or belittle.
We must give it attention, whatever these ideas are.
Because in fact, if someone is interested in this idea, they will develop this idea. At the very least, they will develop a child's love for thinking.
This is very important that I take care of it.
I communicate with him spiritually. I communicate with him now. Our big problem is that most of the fathers
He provides support for him
He encourages them to urge parents and educators
Today, children with ADHD are our future; they are the origin of this future. Those who give more attention to their imagination are the ones who will shape our future.
It really means we lived while we were walking around this exhibition among their projects.
I was living in a dream
In a dream, all ideas are very broad imagination, that is.
And now the dream means a reality, there are many dreams that have come true and have become a reality.
Thank God, we wish our children who were present all the best.
Our hopes for you are related to you, God willing.
With permission,
From different ages and both genders
I reached 70 projects
Pioneering and new projects are being implemented.
To talk more about this exhibition
National and also about the Cultural Center for Childhood
Professor Abdullah also at the beginning, I mean, he briefly told us about the exhibition.
What does it have in store that brings together many activities? What can we briefly say about this exhibition?
"Fan" was a new style of expression, a way for children to express their love, loyalty, and belonging to their country.
Of course, it came under the patronage of the Minister of Education and Higher Education.
In the exhibition tour, this exhibition came.
He starts growing with him until he reaches twenty or thirty.
Of course, we started training children to see Qatar at 20-30 degrees with its five axes.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, and environmental development.
The first one is Qatar in twenty to thirty years, where will it reach.
Then he starts thinking about how his way of thinking
How does he create and come up with creative ideas?
I expect so, it means he has a wide range, praise be to Allah, he is very successful.
But when we give it such specific symbols and help it
I expect his thinking will grow bigger and more.
Professor launched the exhibition under the slogan "Generations' Dreams, Tomorrow's Realities"
The slogan is the dreams of today's generations.
He will be part of tomorrow's Qatar, Qatar's future.
And indeed we experienced this while we were walking with the children when the child speaks, he says "true happiness of the minister"
I want you to open my project. I invite you to visit my project on the 20th or 30th.
The child thinks after twenty years
In it, he expresses his love for his country and what he loves about the field.
Of course, it is accompanied by various activities and competitions.
One of them was the winner of the Stars of Science award.
And also the winners of the first prize of the Arab League University
Of course, all the children
On the sidelines of the exhibition, there were various shows with a specific schedule.
To showcase their projects that they have done, meaning during the exhibition.
What a blessing to have you here.
Science Stars
Some of the winners of the projects that participated in the exhibition.
She also won one of the main prizes.
The forest or the reserve
Also, we need to talk about the colored ball.
Of course, the colorful ones are also part of our vision and the children's dream of a future for Qatar.
Also think about twenty-two.
How can a child contribute to a creative project of twenty-two?
Her main idea is to be in a layer that exists in the ball.
It gives a color when judging
For example, if it goes to اما, the referee will monitor the movements of the ball through the following:
Or the movements of the stadium and what changes in it through this electronic layer
The following text is already in English: "The one that is present in the ball"
Of course, creative ideas, of course, the main idea, many people ask us, "Is it is?"
And these projects
We always say that we have reached the children.
At this stage of developing or enhancing these skills, they expand their horizons.
Giving them an idea of how to express their love for their country through these projects.
Giving them self-confidence is how they can present their project to the audience and explain their idea.
In his field of interest, in the field of something he likes, this is all considered an achievement, an achievement for him.
Support was support that meant appreciated and thanked for it.
Now it is entering the development stages and
In support of several officials, and support from the committee, and I expect support from the public as well.
The forest was not the second because this girl
The method of entry for subscribers is the channels that the visitors enter under the ground through the pipes.
A large protected forest
The visitor walks around and sees the animals, sorry, the reptiles under the ground.
In Sinnar, on some animals and the Aigys Research Center, the condition of the animals is being monitored.
In the marine environment and entering it in an equally creative way.
The reason for its victory is also its wide imagination with all its details.
This, of course, leads them to the
In a way, it's talking about an underwater tourist city under the water.
In one who speaks about a city for butterflies
In those who speak about a forest, a forest above the earth
In one who speaks about many tourist ideas
It means exciting
Perhaps this is something that children's minds are now at this time, perhaps at two hundred and thirty thousand and fifty.
And in the future, perhaps these things will actually come true.
It means in three projects
The scientific club adopted it. He said these projects are what I need now, I want to work on them.
For example, the project that I like is the L.L.L. water air conditioners.
I'm now looking at the Arab newspaper
And the news says that Qatar University is celebrating graduation
In the presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al-Mahmoud
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Education
Dr. Sheikha bint Abdullah Al-Musnad, President of the University
Good achievement, it certainly means for the beautiful university.
University of Qatar and also Caligari University
Also, these good news that we are reading about our male and female students.
A pioneering educational achievement, God willing, and we wish them success, God willing, in all specialties, God willing.
Where he is considered one of the young faces that will strongly enter the Qatari drama scene.
And how long, and also colored patterns and threads.
Abdulhamid Al-Sharashni is considered one of the artists who have formed themselves.
If it wasn't convincing
He was not chosen to be present in the works being carried out in Qatar.
Currently, the artist Abdulhamid Al-Sharchani is participating in the series "The Killer Feeling" and "Tassaniif Al-Jouz Al-Thani".
We are pleased to have you as our guest this morning.
To talk to him about his participation in these two important works and about his experience in general.
Welcome and good morning
The Doha Morning program has been online for the first time. I met you for the first time and you were present with us in Doha Morning.
And the people who are tired of the program.
And you are my sister Lisa.
Welcome, let's start the conversation
Oh God, a hedgehog
I am a responsible and administrative man
And apply the laws
All I can say is that
Get the coat.
Then listen, why are you calling me Yani?
See their spirit if someone agrees with you that you won't go back to the Pashtun
He and of course I had another question to start with, but since we saw this part of the series of the first part.
Pointing out that Khalid ibn al-Walid
Some historians attribute the great poet Imru' al-Qais to the city of Marrat.
Many things and information are related to this city in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
And for more, we continue with this nice report by our colleague Abdulrahman Marash.
We are following up with each other
Of course, it is a testimony from one who knows no flattery or favoritism.
And confirming the Iraqi nature of this or that city
As much as we see its effects and hear what has been said about it by its narrators and poets.
Their old and new, for that comes a rich record to be added to the city's record.
Muraat is one of the cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
It is an old country historically, it was born in the Jahiliyyah era.
Historians disagree on the reason for its name
Some attribute it to Imru' al-Qais al-Kindi, the well-known poet.
And the Al-Ghadir that is attributed to him
The date of its creation is unknown.
The Jahiliyyah era
Similarly, the most famous thing in the city of Marrat is Mount Kameet, which has become a proverb.
Because it is in the city and sticky to it.
Jaffa is also an archaeological site.
Kathir and since this teacher is considered a tourist teacher in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
The municipality of Marrat made a tremendous effort in the work
From a park above this mountain
And sessions for all parents and residents of the Kingdom.
It is named after the great companion Khalid ibn al-Walid, may Allah be pleased with him.
To fight against the apostates and Musaylimah the Liar
Among its effects is also Ghadeer Kameet.
It is a place where the floodwaters gather and stores water for a long period.
One of the most important sources of water in the past era
And among its effects is the Oujouhi Heritage House.
The city dates back to pre-Islamic times.
It was famous for its poets whose poetry was ignited by their passion.
With its beauty, its monuments, and its famous mountain, Kameat.
Abdulrahman Al-Murshed in the program Sabah Al-Dohha
Murat city, north of Riyadh
We return once again to our esteemed guests.
Please inform us and the viewers about these methods and means.
As I said at the beginning, we, InfraStructure, have a very special infrastructure.
We open a page for him to be registered and have a special file on our system.
Email of his/her parent
This deception involves increasing focus, writing speed, gluing speed, and general distraction.
The guardian has full discretion.
Well, this deception is added to the student's file.
Find his son's file online
And he sees how much his son benefits, meaning
He sees his grades and also his attention with the teachers
Even we actually enjoy the intelligence of this beautiful girl.
We brought most of the children who are in the center and send them our best regards.
I entered this center with a teacher named Tayyaba who is present through this center.
We get to know her intelligence and the level she has reached, of course, from her entering this center.
Of course, the year
He focuses on work and then Ramadan
But this, of course, would be unfair to one job at the expense of another job.
And some people only turn on the TV during Ramadan.
He watches TV and shapes the people of the month of worship with TV.
Lighten up, lighten up, TV series, lighten up, let him work for two years, isn't that better?
Of course
I hope they accept me in Ramadan.
But I hope to send you all my regards.
And God willing
Also, in the plays that
Of course, from the art of drama to the art of fashion
A fashion show was held in Katara Cultural Village.
Of course we will continue with you with all our love and sincerity.
And it develops children's abilities and skills to a greater extent.
Untranslatable parts of the input: ‎‏‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
We have a sure model, we talked to our guests who were with us.
Now we have Professor Ibrahim Hussein Abdelsalam. Welcome and good morning.
How are you, Umniya?
Praise be to God
By any means currently
Professor Ibrahim, let's first get to know the materials that are being presented through this center.
And as an example, her mother, Umniya.
I will also take the approach or method that Professor Nesma talked about with her.
You feel like there is a difference in his mind.
You feel that these skills and these methods
Things changed in terms of his skills, his mind, and even his educational level.
Scientific methods
One of them is that I first do a global test called the TONI test for the child before starting anything else in my program.
I'm starting to work on the second part of the test, which is also the TONI test.
We measure the level or the level of difference in the level of the student through it.
A quick math test or questions will now be conducted in Riyadh.
The wish will come true and respond through the air all the time.
Of course, my wish has no idea about these questions.
We are familiar with this topic.
Of course, I had another question to start with.
We ask you about your participation this year in the second part
What does your participation talk about it?
Of course, after we presented one series of designs
Of course, praise be to God, He guided me in several roles.
Professor Ghanem
Of course, the roles were distributed with the executive director Ashraf Shokateh and the great professor
Of course, an opportunity from Tar Production Company.
Truly, the right of the youth
Of course, Professor Ghanem, the year nominated me for the right
Of course, each episode is different.
I have a few episodes where I will work on characters
And, of course, there are nice experiences in the workplace.
A pyramid from Kuwait's pyramids, Professor Saad Al-Faraj
With us are artists from Bahrain Abdullah Malik Al Ghurair
Like Ali Mirza, we have a similar one
Also with you is a group of young people, Abdullah Adham.
We have a few young people, Abdullah Alasm.
This has been the case for years, and we work two jobs in a year.
Biggus, this is why Apple HUAWEI asked you if you were born in the year 1990.
But I didn't think that this or your dream would come true in art.
Praise be to God for everything
You are right, art is just a study.
I didn't take it as a talent, I did.
I took art as a talent, of course, which is what built me in my beginnings, the artist Abdulaziz Jassim, of course.
Among the artists who consider me as a person like their son.
Anything I have to say
Of course, we are all with the series.
We went out and had a great time, thank God.
Now, if it were not for Tara, a big thank you to Professor Abdulrahman Al-Sulaiti, a big thank you to Professor Abdulrahman
You compare us to Kuwait. In Kuwait, 12 to 13 new representatives are elected every year.
In them
Of course, the biggest thank you means you are giving opportunities
But let's start again.
We talk about the series of Sanni Sannif, we talked about it, we got the idea about it.
The killer feeling too
And the foot is also a man's foot.
And we have a sure model with us, with the processor, Professor Abdulaziz Al-Mae Al-Tamimi
Until this process is done live on air.
And I will see how I can treat the personality, for example, first let me become to Professor Sabhi Abdullah, hello.
Welcome to you, peace and mercy of God
If we start with you, teacher, please.
By God's will
In the name of God, of course.
We hold hands
I see the nerves
It was like a drawing or a message from God, showing all the parts of your body.
From the inside, it has its problems.
Ejike sometimes feels dizzy.
Headache and dizziness
Relax your hands, relax your nerves, it's okay.
So, Professor Abdulaziz will discover a specific issue through his hand if he is suffering from a certain disease.
The person on the left side has an inflammation in his middle ear.
In the good days, what does it mean, Professor Abdulaziz?
You have an ear problem in the ear
Who created me when I was small?
Here I feel the same.
The nasal sinuses
Same the pain in the nose, you get a headache here.
I have a headache here.
This has a problem with the nasal sinuses.
She has a headache between her eyes.
The weight increases without eating.
The thyroid gland is a bit tired, you are always lethargic and sluggish, and you always feel heavy in the body.
Excessive sleep
Oh, how much sleep or body laziness, I always feel that it is heavy.
Tonsillitis is permanent.
There, see the shudder, do you notice the shudder?
He has stress and of course you never walk barefoot, maybe the last time
Brother from Tunisia.
Mashallah, you told us things about his presence and
Does this massage also work for children?
The pains are true, praise be to God, the size of the belly is the size of the belly of the child's hand.
Most of our children sleep here.
When people in Chile don't like him, they think he has gas in his stomach. May God bless you.
As soon as the mother puts her breast, the father explains something by spreading his thumb.
It is in the palm of the child's hand
The hands are opposite each other, the child is facing them
Let's see, every mother can learn this movement.
You press like this right left right left
This is a thing about the child and about the child, and about the child, it's so nice.
Okay, regarding the discoveries, you have specific discoveries, especially for women.
It means that as we said, in every house, 90% of the women are blessed, God protects them from women.
First thing and first warning: ceramic and even flooring.
When we walk barefoot on ceramic, of course, our problem is that we always have to hold on. We can only walk barefoot on even floors. This is a danger.
Walk barefoot or the guide that the ceramic in the houses increased health problems
For the earth is cold and equal
Because the brushes were in trouble, they complained of asthma.
More increased
The woman is keen on focusing on walking barefoot on heels.
This is the heel area of the foot, the part of the heel that is behind the heel.
From here, this foot, now, below the heel.
This is the first discovery, the second discovery is on its way to facilitate childbirth.
Just focus for a moment.
In the seventh or ninth month
Just enter the birth month in general
What they're saying is that on the 8th, there's danger and the most dangerous thing is that she walks barefoot.
The pregnant woman should be careful when walking barefoot.
If you enter the time of birth,
I seek refuge in Allah from Satan, the accursed. Behold, the shaking of the palm tree will cause its ripe dates to fall down upon you.
We know that Maryam (peace be upon her) was given her sustenance to her.
So you see, even to the degree that I discussed with the scholars in science, they said, "Why did Ibn Kathir's interpretation change?"
And I will not give you the idea that God has put in this science and inspired me with it.
Hey, shake the palm tree trunk. When you shake the palm tree, of course, how did it come out?
It was as sharp as a pin or a nail, like you said.
When the palm tree shook, it gave orders to the wombs that were once reduced to wombs in the middle here.
The intestines gave us orders to facilitate childbirth, to modify the fetus.
The head of the fetus rises or something adjusts over time and becomes normal.
Glory be to God, this fruit has many benefits.
Hold the hand, start and guide it.
Some of them take it as a habit, while others know that it is actually science.
They are afraid to tell you what you think of them.
Yes, Professor Abdulaziz, your discoveries are important.
But I wanted to know the last question, meaning the time, praise Allah, it passed quickly.
One person wants to communicate with you, any person who wants to communicate with you a specific email are you from
The mobile phone is in the control room. He wants to contact Professor Abdulaziz and call us after the program.
Of course, you can contact us through Qatar TV numbers and take this number.
I was not created except to serve people.
If we believe this belief, God will bless you in your work and keep people away from you
Sin as you sin, and do everything that comes to mind as a normal human being.
But we aspire to goodness more than
I always think of good things
Our viewers, hopefully, also enjoyed this segment, of course, through reflexology and hand massage.
Also by foot
We saw a live model on the air of how the person with us discovered the diseases he had.
What do I suffer if we wish you to inform us and whoever wants to contact him can also read about him on the internet.
How to implement it if it will include more schools in the coming days and years
Good morning
How would you rate this experience?
In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
The reality of the obesity problem in the Gulf countries has become a major issue.
We feared that Qatar would join the fifth state with them.
And this program means that it is honestly that the first lady in New York has it.
Doha visited and they had a program for this
They offered it to us and we built it for ourselves, no problem.
It means our students with students of New York with students of Spain with students of England
فتجوف حتى اخواننا ط ط طلابنا في قطر كيف مستواهم مع دول العالم و هاي شيء نبغيه احنا في المستقبل
Because we encourage eating fruit among students.
He stopped playing sports.
Of course, the fifth week, your family meal with the family.
Of course, these two birds are on the stone.
Of course, the sixth week, he said, what did we gain from this experience, we are today, thank God, in the end.
We are happy with the students
They were three independent boys' schools Abu Ubaidah
Independent girls are elegant.
Our morale is high.
The family is aware, their brothers got excited at home, they started eating this food like them.
A relationship beyond the students has developed, and this Saqafi influence has even reached his home and his family.
They go and tell that I was attacked like this or that I was taught like this.
The training staff or whoever was giving this information to the students
How was it chosen? How was the communication with the students done through Min?
Yes, we did, God bless them, they were good to us in several ways, meaning they made us happy.
And we have brothers in Al-Amal who taught them about the diet center, taught them about healthy eating as well.
And learn with sister Asha Al Tamimi the etiquette of eating etiquette
How do they organize themselves, how do they eat, how do they prioritize?
To teach cooking, sports, or awareness of the benefits of healthy food.
It was in the form of separate lessons, not curricula or anything.
How did you convey these ideas to your students?
Some were inside the school.
We met at the beginning of the program at Aspire Zone, where we gathered all the students, boys and girls.
Because this topic is not a topic that concerns a specific person, it concerns us, it concerns all of us, because these are our children.
The students explained how they were initially taught with it.
You mean the results were satisfactory.
But is three schools or specific classes from these schools enough?
It is now we, of course, the first experiment in the world, the first time things start on a large scale.
It starts on a reasonable good scale with all the characteristics of independent boys and girls, especially
So that it is compatible with our culture, our environment, and the conditions of families, for example, they accept things for their children that they do not accept for themselves.
Fibon Ihma originally means they participate in it and it is really important.
A student at the age of twelve or thirteen is at the right time, he knows about his health.
These hardships mean that many people think that God is weak, but they imagine that it is impossible.
Some of the heroes we see in the cinema, like this one, with weak bodies, say this means it's like a mythical thing.
We talked in detail, but unfortunately, there were many weeks when we couldn't cover it.
We can also remind them of it through Sabah Al-Dawha.
And the fruits that have vitamin B, which you can get from fruits or vegetables.
So, a person knows the benefits of fruits and knows that if he eats them, his health will start to improve, which gives him morale.
In the fruit section, they would go to the supermarket and choose their fruits.
For example, this point
Diversification, of course, means that they competed, each school excelled in its teachers with non-traditional ideas.
The spirit of competition is the spirit of the
We give them the general picture and each one is creative.
The teachers are the ones who were training the students and there is no special staff at your place.
We train them, we train them.
But it means that the teachers were adding, for example, some schools like Abu Ubaydah said on Saturday we will do it for the students' activities.
For example, on the day off from school, they decided to adopt a school they said they were going to run.
I organize a healthy cooking day with the girls. Ok, we made the boys do healthy cooking themselves, so the girls' work meant they had more skill in this topic.
Of course, thanks to Al Rayyan Water, they provided all the water to schools for free. Al Rayyan Water in this matter.
Of course, it means healthier water because it will need to purify its body from all these toxic substances that enter its body daily through water.
This week we said the third
It means his body started moving.
He can play football or basketball, but he doesn't know that I love that sport.
Yes, exactly, and some of them may want to play other games, some of them may not want to play a team game.
How much on air directly
Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Jaber, founder and director of the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Association, welcome to you.
And of course, as much as possible, we try to focus on most of the important topics.
We wanted to get to know and let our beloved viewers know what the disease of hardening of the nerves is.
Because this name may also be somewhat strange to us, please.
The number of women affected is greater than the number of men.
All currently available treatments are preventive treatments.
White blood cells that are supposed to protect us start fighting us.
We fight by hitting the nerve cell
The easiest for the audience is a piece of electrical wire.
Covered with a layer called the softener to remove it, it is a layer of nylon.
Of course, it generally leads to imbalance, double vision, and blurred vision.
It leads to problems in the digestive and respiratory systems.
Leads to madness in its worst cases, leads to quadriplegia or hemiplegia.
Of course, the treatments
The most important functions in the human body can be badly disrupted by it.
Or this disease is called nerve sclerosis.
Theories say that it is a viral transmission
It is not a contagious disease.
And it does not pass to children.
Some consider it a disease depending on the region.
But the equator, for example, is completely immune to this disease.
Currently, we have cases of this disease on the equator.
This disease is still not curable because its cause is unknown.
So far, scientists are not able to determine the cause of the disease in order to find a cure for it.
The current process is a reverse process.
They are trying to avoid the effect of the disease itself on the human body.
They are trying to start from the back, in other words.
And maybe we are a little afraid of this topic, which means we can say that this disease may come suddenly.
There is a specific group that feels this disease, meaning it is spreading in a certain age group.
Ahwa was internationally ranked from twenty to forty years old.
Currently, the international organization for the same disease has reduced the age from twenty to fifteen years.
Because he has been a falconer for forty years.
But it does not heal the human being.
Of course, we as an association are open to alternative medicine and prophetic medicine.
Yes, it means through the link of the Qatari Association for Multiple Sclerosis patients.
What is the reason for the existence of this association?
Actually a large group, so they thought there should be a link to this topic.
Of course, I'll give you rough numbers.
In Kuwait, it is said that there are 100,000 infected.
Over 1,000 infected
The rest of the Gulf countries have between 100 and 300 cases.
I was diagnosed five years ago.
My number was sixty-four or sixty-four.
Is there some symptoms that show the person really has this disease?
And we don't have confirmation that it is a virus, so we don't want to adopt a specific theory, that's the point.
The second point is how do I know if I am infected or not.
This is very difficult.
I, Mr. Abdulaziz, am trying to find a specific point.
