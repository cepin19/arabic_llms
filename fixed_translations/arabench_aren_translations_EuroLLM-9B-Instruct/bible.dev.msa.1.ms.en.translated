Jacob was the son of Joseph, the husband of Mary, who gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
All the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ fourteen generations. The birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise:
As for the birth of Jesus the Christ, it was this way: When his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit.
Yusuf was her husband, and he was righteous, and he did not want to expose her, so he wanted to divorce her secretly.
But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit."
You will give birth to a son and name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."
This was all done so that what the Lord said through the prophet would be fulfilled, who said:
"Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel," which means, "God with us."
When Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took his wife.
He did not know her until she gave birth to her firstborn son. He named him Jesus.
The visit of the Magi
And when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem
Saying, "Where is the newborn king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
So he gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people, and asked them, "Where was the Christ to be born?"
They said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is written through the prophet:
And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are not the least among the princes of Judah; for out of you shall come a Ruler who will shepherd My people Israel."
Then Herod secretly called for the wise men and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
Then he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the child. And when you have found him, bring me word so that I may go and worship him also."
When they heard this from the king, they went. And behold, the star which they had seen in the east went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.
They came to the house and saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and offered him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Then, when they were told in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back another way to their own country. They fled to Egypt.
And when they had departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him."
So he arose and took the boy and his mother by night, and departed to Egypt.
And so there was fulfilled what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I have called my son."
Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was furious. He sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men.
Then what was said by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:
"A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children and refuses to be comforted, because they are no more." Return to Nazareth.
When Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt.
"Get up, take the boy and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the boy's life are dead."
He got up, took the boy and his mother, and came to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. But being warned in a dream, he turned aside into the region of Galilee.
And he came and lived in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist paves the way
And in those days, John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea
"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
This is what Isaiah the prophet said: "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"
John wore a garment made of camel hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region around the Jordan went out to him, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
And they relied on him in Jordan, acknowledging their sins.
When he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Make fruits that are worthy of repentance.
Do not think, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
And now I have put the axe to the root of the trees: every tree therefore that does not bring forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.
I baptize you with water for repentance, but the one coming after me is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
The one who winnows with the wind in his hand, and will clear his threshing floor, and will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire." The Baptism of Jesus Christ
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
But John forbade him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?"
Jesus answered him, "Yes, go, for this is the way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed him to do it.
When Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.
And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, the Beloved, in whom I am well pleased."
Jesus faces the test
Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
After fasting for forty days and forty nights, he finally became hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."
He answered and said, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.'"
Then Iblis took him to the Holy City and stopped him at the wing of the Temple.
He said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you, and on their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'"
Jesus said to him, "It is also written: 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'"
Then Satan also took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said to him, "I will give you all of these if you fall down and prostrate to me."
Then Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.'"
Then Satan left him, and angels came and attended him. The beginning of his ministry in Galilee.
When Jesus heard that John had been handed over, he withdrew to Galilee.
He left Nazareth and came and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,
To fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah, who said:
"Land of Zebulun, and land of Naphtali, way of the sea, across Jordan, Galilee of the nations."
The people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and those sitting in the field of death and its shadows were illuminated by the light."
From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." The calling of the first disciples
And as Jesus walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
Then he said to them, "Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
At that time, he left the net and followed him.
Then he went on from there and saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee, and his brother John, in a boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And he called them.
So they left the ship and their father and followed him. Jesus taught and healed the sick.
Jesus went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
The news of him spread throughout all of Syria. They brought to him all the sick people who were suffering from various diseases and ailments, the insane, the epileptics, and the paralyzed, and he healed them.
A large crowd followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.
The Sermon on the Mount - The Beatitudes
And when the multitudes saw it, they rose up to the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him.
So he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:
"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for this is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you. You are the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
"You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men."
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
They do not light a lamp and put it under a bushel, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house.
Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven. Fulfill the law.
"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them."
For verily I say unto you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall in any way pass away from the Law until all be accomplished.
Whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does and teaches will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
For I say unto you, Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. Anger
"You have heard that it was said to the ancients: 'Do not kill, and whoever kills will be liable to judgment.'
And as for me, I say to you: Whoever is angry with his brother in vain is worthy of judgment, and whoever says to his brother: "Raka," is worthy of the congregation, and whoever says: "O fool," is worthy of the fire of hell.
Then, when you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,
Leave your offering there at the altar, go and be reconciled with your brother first, and then come and offer your gift.
Be quick to forgive your opponent while you are on the road with him, lest he hand you over to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the police, and you end up in prison.
I tell you the truth: do not leave until the last penny is gone! Adultery
"You have heard that it was said to those of old: 'Do not commit adultery.'
And I say to you: Whoever looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to stumble, tear it out and throw it away, for it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
And if your right hand causes you to stumble, then cut it off and cast it away from you, for it is better for you that one of your limbs should perish than that you should be cast into the Fire. Divorce
"It was said: 'Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a written divorce document.'"
And as for me, I say to you: Whoever divorces his wife except for unchastity (adultery) makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. The oath
"You have also heard that it was said to those of old: 'Do not swear falsely, but fulfill your oaths to the Lord.'"
And as for me, I say to you: Do not swear at all, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God,
It is neither on earth, for it is the footstool of his feet, nor in Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.
Let your speech be: Yes, yes; no, no. What is more than these is from the evil one. Revenge
"You have heard that it was said: 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'
And I say to you, do not resist an evil person. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.
And if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat, give him your cloak as well.
And if you are forced to go a mile, go two.
If someone asks you, give them. If someone wants to borrow from you, do not refuse. Love your enemies.
"You have heard that it was said: 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'
And I say to you: Love your enemies. Bless those who curse you. Do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat and persecute you.
To be the children of your Father in heaven, he makes his sun shine on the wicked and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
Because if you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Do not even tax collectors do the same?
And if you greet your brothers only, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
Be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
Charity
"Take care that you do not do your charitable deeds before men, in order to be seen by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven."
So when you give to the needy, do not blow a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be honored by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward!
And as for you, when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
To make your charity in secret. Your father who sees in secret will reward you openly. Prayer
"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full!"
And when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
When you arrive, do not repeat vain words like the nations, for they think that their many words will be answered.
Do not imitate them. For your father knows what you need before you ask him.
"Sanctify Thou us, as Thou hast sanctified Thy name.
Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Our daily bread, give us this day.
And forgive us our sins as we also forgive those who have sinned against us.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For yours is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever. Amen.
If you forgive people their mistakes, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
And if you do not forgive people their mistakes, neither will your Father forgive your mistakes. Fasting
"And when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, who are dismal in appearance so that they may show others that they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.
And as for you, when you are silent, anoint your head and wash your face.
To not appear to people as fasting, but to your Father who is in secret. For your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. Treasures in heaven
"Do not store for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.
Because where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
The lamp of the body is the eye: if therefore your eye be single, your whole body shall be full of light.
And if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
"No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money." God cares for us.
"Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor for your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?"
Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?
And of you, whoever cares, can add more than one arm's length to his height?
Why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow! They do not toil or spin.
But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these.
If God so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O men of little faith?
Do not worry, saying, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?"
For all these things the nations are asking, for your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Today has enough trouble of its own.
Condemnation of others
"Do not judge so that you will not be judged."
Because by the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and by the measure you use it will be measured to you.
Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?
How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' while the log is in your own eye?
O hypocrite, first remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye!
Do not give what is holy to dogs or throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet and turn to attack you. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask and you shall receive. Seek and you shall find. Knock and it shall be opened to you.
For whoever asks receives, and whoever seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.
What father among you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
And if a fish asks him, will he give him a snake?
If you, being wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!
So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets. The narrow gate
"Enter through the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it!
The narrowest door and the most difficult path that leads to life, and few are those who find it! The tree and its fruit.
"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves!"
By their fruits you shall know them. Do people pick grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
Thus, every good tree produces good fruit, but the bad tree produces bad fruit.
A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot produce good fruit.
Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
If you know them by their fruits.
"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord!' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven."
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name and do many mighty works in your name?'
Then I will declare to them, "I never knew you! Depart from me, you evildoers!" The wise builders and the foolish builders
"Whoever hears these words of mine and acts on them is like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
The rain came down, the rivers came, the winds blew, and they hit that house, but it didn't fall, because it was built on the rock.
And whoever hears these sayings of mine and does not act upon them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
The rain came down, the rivers came, the wind blew, and it hit that house and it fell, and it fell with a great crash!
When Jesus had finished these sayings, the crowds were amazed at his teaching,
Because he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
Healing a leper
When he came down from the mountain, a large crowd followed him.
And a leper came to him and bowed to him, saying, "Lord, if you want, you can make me clean."
Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I want to. Be clean!" And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
Then Jesus said to him, "See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof to them." The centurion's faith.
And when Jesus came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him for help.
"He says, 'Sir, my servant is laid up in the house, paralyzed and in great distress.'"
Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."
The captain of the hundred replied, "Sir, I am not worthy to have you under my roof, but say the word and my boy will be healed."
"For I also am a man under authority, and I have soldiers under me. And I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who were following him, "I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith!
And I say to you: many will come from the east and the west, and will recline with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens.
And the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go; it shall be done for you as you have believed." And the servant was healed at that very hour.
When Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying ill in bed with a fever.
So he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and served them.
And when it was evening, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he cast out the spirits with a word, and he cured all who were sick.
In order to fulfill what Isaiah the prophet said: "He took our infirmities and carried our diseases." The price of submission
And when Jesus saw a great multitude about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.
A disciple came and said to him, "Teacher, follow me wherever you go."
Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
Another of his disciples said to him, "Lord, please allow me to go and bury my father first."
Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead." He calmed the storm.
And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.
And a great disturbance occurred in the sea, so that the waves covered the ship, and he was asleep.
And his disciples came to him and woke him, saying, "Lord, save us! We are perishing!"
"Then he said to them, 'Why are you so afraid, you men of little faith?' Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm."
And the people were amazed, saying, "What kind of man is this? For even the winds and the sea obey him!" He cast out the demons.
And when he came to the borders of the Gerasenes, two demoniacs met him, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man could pass by that way.
And they cried out, saying, "What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"
And there was a large herd of pigs grazing far from them.
So the demons asked him, saying, "If you cast us out, permit us to go into the herd of swine."
So he said to them, "Go." And they went out and entered the herd of pigs, and the whole herd of pigs rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the water.
The shepherds fled and went into the city, and told everything, and about the case of the madmen.
So the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
Healing a paralyzed person
So he got into the boat and crossed over and came to his own city.
And when they brought him who was paralyzed to him, they came to him through the faith they had in him. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
And some of the scribes said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming!"
Jesus knew their thoughts, and said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?
Which is easier, to say, "Your sins are forgiven you," or to say, "Rise and walk"?
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"--then he said to the paralytic, "Rise, take up your bed and go home!"
He got up and went to his house.
When the crowd saw this, they were amazed and praised God, who had given people such authority. The call of Matthew
And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man who was blind from birth. And his disciples asked
While he was reclining in the house, many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and his disciples.
So when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, "Those who are healthy do not need a doctor, but those who are sick do."
So go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” The question about fasting
Then John's disciples came to him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
Then Jesus said to them, "Can the groomsmen mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast."
No one puts a patch on an old garment with a new piece, because the patch takes from the garment, and the garment becomes worse.
And they do not put new wine into old wineskins, or the skins will burst, the wine will run out, and the skins will be ruined. No, they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved." The raising of Jairus' daughter and the healing of the woman with the issue of blood.
And while he was saying these things, behold, a ruler came, and worshiped him, saying, "My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus then got up and followed him, along with his disciples.
And if a bleeding woman, who has been bleeding for twelve years, came from behind him and touched the hem of his garment,
For she said to herself, "If I only touch his garment, I shall be whole."
Jesus turned and saw her. "Daughter, cheer up!" he said. "Your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at once.
And when Jesus came to the ruler's house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,
He said to them, "Move aside, the girl is not dead, but asleep." They laughed at him.
When the crowd had left, he entered and took her hand, and the girl stood up.
So the news spread throughout that land. Two blind men were healed.
And as Jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
And when he came to the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord!"
Then he touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith be it to you."
And their eyes were opened. Jesus rebuked them, saying, "See, no one knows!"
But they went out and spread it throughout that whole land. Healing a mute
And as they were going out, another mute maniac was brought to him.
When the devil came out, the mute spoke, and the crowds were amazed, saying, "Never has anything like this been seen in Israel!"
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons!" Few deeds
Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
And when he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, for they were troubled and were like sheep without a shepherd.
Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
Ask the Lord of the Harvest to send laborers into his harvest.
Send the twelve
Then he called his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every infirmity.
And the names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them: "Do not go off the road into the Gentiles or enter any Samaritan town.
But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
And as you go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Heal the sick. Cleanse the lepers. Bring back the dead. Cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.
Do not acquire gold, silver or copper in your areas.
There is no provision for the road, no two garments, no shoes, and no stick, because the doer is worthy of his food.
"And any city or village you enter, inquire about who is worthy in it, and stay there until you leave."
And when you enter the house, greet it.
If the house is deserving, let your peace come to it, but if it is not deserving, let your peace return to you.
And whoever does not accept you or listen to your words, go out from that house or city, and shake off the dust from your feet.
Truly I say to you: the land of Sodom and Gomorrah will be more tolerable on the day of judgment than that city.
"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves."
But beware of the people, for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.
You will be brought before governors and kings to testify on my behalf, for them and for the nations.
So when they surrender to you, do not worry about how or what you speak, for you will be given in that hour what you speak with.
For you are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
And the brother will deliver his brother to death, and the father his son, and the children will rise up against their parents and kill them.
And you will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who endures to the end is the one who will be saved.
And when they shall drive you out from one city, flee unto another. Verily I say unto you, ye shall not have gone through the cities of Israel, until the Son of man come.
"The student is not better than the teacher, nor the servant better than his master."
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more his household!
Do not fear them. For nothing hidden will remain unconcealed, and nothing secret will remain unknown.
What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.
And fear not them which kill the body, but cannot kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And one of them will not fall to the ground without your Father.
And as for you, even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
Do not be afraid! You are better than many birds!
"For whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father who is in heaven."
But whoever denies me before men, I also will deny him before my Father who is in the heavens.
"Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace but a sword."
I have come to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
And the enemies of man are his own family.
Whoever loves a father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves a son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.
He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.
Whoever accepts a prophet by the name of a prophet, the reward of a prophet is taken, and whoever accepts a righteous person by the name of a righteous person, the reward of a righteous person is taken.
And whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, truly, I say to you, he will not lose his reward."
John the Baptist and Jesus
And when Jesus had finished commanding his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities. Jesus and John the Baptist.
When John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent two of his disciples,
He said to him, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect another?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "Go and tell John what you hear and see:
The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise, and the poor are evangelized.
Blessed is he who finds nothing.
While these two were going, Jesus began to say to the crowds about John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Those who wear soft clothing are in kings' courts.
But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
This is what was written: "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way before you."
Verily, I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven is being forcefully taken, and the violent are taking it by force.
For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
And if you want to accept, this is Elijah who is to come.
"Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear."
"And to whom is this generation like? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling to their companions"
They say: We chanted for you, but you didn't dance! We were there for you, but you didn't beat your chests!
Because John came neither eating nor drinking, they say, "He has a demon."
The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' But wisdom is vindicated by her deeds." Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
Then he began to rebuke the cities in which most of his miracles were done, because they did not repent.
"Woe to you, O Tyre! Woe to you, O Sidon! For if what happened in Tyre and Sidon had happened in Jerusalem, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
But I say to you: That Sa'ida and Su'a'ida will have a more likely state on the Day of Religion than you.
And you, O Kafarnaum, exalted to heaven, shall be brought down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.
But I say to you, that the land of Sodom will have a more tolerable condition on the day of judgment than you." Rest for the weary.
At that time Jesus answered and said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure.
Everything that has been given to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and anyone the Son wants to reveal him to.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
Because Neri Hein and my load is light."
Lord of the Sabbath
At that time, Jesus went on the Sabbath through the fields, and his disciples became hungry and began to pluck ears of grain and eat.
And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, "Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!"
He said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him?"
How did he enter the house of God and eat the bread of the presentation, which was not allowed for him or those with him to eat, but only for the priests.
Or what you read in the Torah that the priests in the temple on the Sabbath profane the Sabbath and they are innocent?
But I say to you, that there is something greater than the temple here!
If you knew what it is: I want mercy, not sacrifice, you would not condemn the innocent!
Then the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.”
Then he left from there and came to their assembly.
And if a man's hand is withered, they would ask him, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" So that they might accuse him.
He said to them, "Which of you, if he has one sheep, and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?
"So how much better is a human than a sheep! If doing good is the Sabbath!"
Then He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and it became like the other, sound. Praise be to Allah, the Chosen One.
So when the Pharisees went out, they consulted together about him how they might destroy him.
Jesus knew and withdrew from there. And many followed him, and he healed them all.
I instructed them not to reveal it.
To fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah, who said:
"Behold, my chosen one, my beloved, in whom my soul delights. I will place my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations."
He does not quarrel or shout, and no one hears his voice in the streets.
A broken fortress does not fall, and a smoking wick does not extinguish, until the truth comes to victory.
And by His name the nations shall hope." Jesus and Baalzebub
Then a blind and dumb man was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb man spoke and saw.
All the crowds were amazed and said, "Is this not the Son of David?"
But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, "This fellow does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and any city or household divided against itself will not stand.
If the devil casts out the devil, he has divided himself. How can his kingdom stand?
And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges!
But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
How can someone enter the strong man's house and plunder his belongings, unless the strong man is first bound, and then his house is plundered?
Who is not with me is against me, and who does not gather with me is dividing.
Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven people.
And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.
Make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for by its fruit the tree is known.
Oh, you snakes! How can you speak what is good when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
The good person from the good treasure in the heart brings out the good, and the evil person from the evil treasure brings out the evil.
But I tell you that for every idle word that people speak, they will give an account of it on the day of judgment.
"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned." - Jonah
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
He answered and said to them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, and there will be no sign given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet."
Because just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
Men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here!
The Queen of Sheba will come from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and indeed, here is one greater than Solomon!
If the unclean spirit comes out of the man, it goes through places where there is no water, seeking rest and not finding it.
Then he says: Return to my house from which I came out. He comes and finds it empty, swept, and decorated.
Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than he, and they enter and dwell there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first! So will it be also with this wicked generation." Doing the will of God
And while he was speaking to the crowd, his mother and his brothers stood outside, asking to speak to him.
Then one of them said, "Behold, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak with you."
He replied, "Who is my mother and who are my brothers?"
Then he stretched out his hand toward his disciples and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers.
"For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
Like the sower and its interpretation
On that day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.
A large crowd gathered around him, so much so that he entered the boat and sat down. The entire crowd stood on the shore.
And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying, "Behold, a sower went out to sow."
And as he was sowing, some fell on the path, and the birds came and devoured it.
Another fell on barren places, where there was not much soil, and it sprouted immediately because it had no depth of earth.
But when the sun rose, it burned, and since it had no root, it withered.
Another fell on the thorns, and the thorns grew up and strangled him.
Another fell on the good soil, and it produced a crop: one a hundred, another sixty, another thirty.
"Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear."
The disciples came and said to him, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
And he answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
For he who has, more will be given, but from he who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
For this reason I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.
Isaiah's prophecy was fulfilled in them: "You will hear but not understand, and you will see but not perceive."
For the heart of this people has become hard, and their ears are heavy of hearing. And they have closed their eyes, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and should turn, and I should heal them.
But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
For I say to you truly, many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see, and did not see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and did not hear them.
"So listen, you are like the farmer:
Anyone who hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches what was sown in his heart. This is what is sown along the path.
And the one sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word, and immediately receives it with joy; Yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he falls away.
But it has no root in itself, but is temporary. If tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, it immediately stumbles.
And what is sown among thorns is he who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
And as for that which is sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and brings forth, one a hundredfold, another sixty, and another thirty." The parable of the wheat and the tares.
He presented another parable to them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field."
And while the people were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.
When the plant grew and produced fruit, then the weeds also appeared.
So the servants of the Lord of the Household said to him: "O master, is it not good seed that you sowed in your field? Then from where did the weeds come?"
He said to them, "An enemy man did this." The slaves said to him, "Do you want us to go and gather them?"
He said, "No! So that you do not uproot the wheat with the weeds while you are gathering it."
Let them both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.” Just as a mustard seed and just as yeast
He gave them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field,
It is the smallest of all seeds. But when it grows, it becomes the largest of all plants, and it becomes a tree, so that birds of the air come and nest in its branches."
He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field, which indeed is the smallest of all seeds; but when it is grown it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches."
This is all that Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and without parables he would not speak to them.
To fulfill what was said by the prophet who said, "I will open my mouth with parables, and utter the hidden things since the foundation of the world." Interpretation of the parable of the wheat and the tares.
Then Jesus sent the crowds away and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
And he answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man.
And the field is the world. And the good seed is the children of the kingdom. But the tares are the children of the wicked one.
And the enemy that sowed it is the devil. And the harvest is the end of the world. And the reapers are the angels.
As the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of this world.
The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all stumbling blocks, and those who do iniquity,
They will throw them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear. Examples of treasure, pearl, and net
"The kingdom of heaven is also like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid. In his joy, he went and sold all he had and bought that field."
Also, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking good pearls.
When he found a single pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.
Also, the kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the sea, gathering of every kind.
So when they were full, they brought them up on the beach, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they cast away.
Thus will it be at the end of the world: the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous.
They will throw them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all this?" They said, "Yes, Lord."
"Then he said to them, 'Therefore every learned scribe in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure new and old things.'"
And when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there. Nazareth rejects Jesus
When he came to his homeland, he taught them in their assembly until they were amazed and said, "From where did this man get this wisdom and power?"
Is this not the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
"Are not all his sisters with us? Then from where has he got all these things?"
And they found him. But Jesus said to them, "No prophet is honored in his own country or in his own home."
And they did not make many forces there because of their disbelief.
Beheading of John the Baptist
At that time, Herod the Tetrarch heard the news about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist, risen from the dead! That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him."
Herod had seized John, bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
Because John was saying to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
And when he wanted to kill him, he feared the people, for they held him as a prophet.
Then, when Herod's birthday came, Herodias' daughter danced in the middle and pleased Herod.
Then he swore that he would give her whatever she asked for.
She, having learned from her mother, said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist."
The king was sad. But for the sake of the divisions and those leaning on him, he was ordered to be given.
So he sent and had John beheaded in the prison.
So he brought his head on a plate and gave it to the girl, who took it to her mother.
Then his disciples came and took up the body and buried it. Then they came and told Jesus. Feeding the five thousand men
When Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there by boat to a deserted place alone. But the crowds, perceiving it, followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus went out, he saw a large crowd; and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
And when evening came, his disciples came to him, saying, "This is a deserted place, and the hour is now late. Send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food."
Jesus said to them, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
They said to him, "We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish."
He said, "Bring it here to me."
So he told the crowd to sit down on the grass. Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and blessed and broke the loaves, giving them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowd.
So they all ate and were satisfied. Then they picked up twelve baskets full of the leftovers.
And the eaters were about five thousand men, besides women and children. Miracle of walking on water
And immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the crowds away.
After the people dispersed, he went up the mountain alone to pray. When evening came, he was alone.
And the ship was in the midst of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.
In the fourth watch of the night, Jesus walked on the sea to them.
When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified and said, "It's a ghost!" And they cried out in fear!
At that moment Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid."
Peter answered him, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water."
He said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water to come to Jesus.
But when he saw the wind was strong, he was afraid. And as he began to sink, he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
So Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, and said to him, "Oh you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
And when they got into the boat, the wind died down.
And those in the ship came and worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
When they crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.
So the men of that place knew him. They sent to all that surrounding district and brought to him all the sick.
They asked him to touch the hem of his garment only. And all who touched it were healed.
The pure and the impure
Then the scribes and Pharisees who came from Jerusalem said to him, "Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat."
"Why do your students go beyond the tradition of the elders, they do not wash their hands when they eat bread?"
He answered and said to them, "And why do you transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?
Then Allah said, "Honor your father and mother, and whoever curses father or mother, let him die a death."
And as for you, you say, "Anything that benefits me is a tithe that I owe to my father or mother." So you do not honor your father or mother.
You have nullified the commandment of Allah because of your tradition!
O hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied well about you when he said:
He approaches this people with his mouth, and honors me with his lips, but his heart is far away from me.
And they worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men."
Then he called the crowd and said to them, "Listen and understand."
"Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man, but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man."
Then his disciples came and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?"
He replied, "Every plant not planted by my heavenly Father will be uprooted."
Leave them. They are blind leaders of the blind. If a blind man leads a blind man, they both fall into a pit."
Peter answered and said to him, "Explain to us this parable."
Jesus said, "Do you still not understand?"
Don't you understand that everything that enters the mouth goes to the stomach and is pushed out of the exit?
And that which proceeds from the mouth comes from the heart, and that is what defiles a man.
For from the heart proceed evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander.
This is what defiles a person. But eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person." The faith of the Canaanite woman.
Then Jesus left that place and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
And a Canaanite woman from that region came out and began to cry out, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely demon-possessed."
He did not answer her at all. So his disciples came up and begged him, saying, "Send her away, for she is crying out after us!"
He replied, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
So she came and bowed before him, saying, "My lord, I mean!"
He answered and said, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
"Yes, sir! And dogs also eat the scraps that fall from their masters' tables!"
Then Jesus answered her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you wish." And her daughter was healed from that hour. The feeding of the four thousand men
Then Jesus went from there and came to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan, and crowds gathered around him again, and he taught them, as was his custom.
And many people came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the mute, the maimed, and many others, and they laid them at Jesus' feet. And he healed them.
Until the multitudes were amazed when they saw the dumb speaking, the lame walking, the blind seeing, and the crippled being healed. And they glorified the God of Israel.
And Jesus called his disciples and said, "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may faint on the way."
His disciples said to him, "Where in this desolate place can anyone get enough bread to satisfy such a crowd?"
Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."
So he ordered the people to sit on the ground.
And he took the seven loaves and the fish, and gave thanks, and broke them, and gave to his disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitude.
So they all ate and were filled. Then they picked up the leftovers and filled seven baskets with the broken pieces.
And the eaters were four thousand men, excluding women and children.
Then he dismissed the crowds and got into the boat and came to the region of Magadan.
Aya asked.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus to test him. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He replied, "If it is evening, you say it is clear because the sky is red."
In the morning: Today is winter because the sky is red and gloomy. O hypocrites! You can recognize the face of the sky, but you cannot recognize the signs of the times!
A wicked and perverse generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah." Then he left them and went away. The Pharisees and Sadducees went out and began to ask him to show them a sign from heaven.
And when his disciples came to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
Jesus said to them, "Watch out! Be on guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod."
So they thought to themselves, "We didn't take any bread."
So Jesus became aware of it and said to them, "You of little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have no bread?
Do you still not understand? You remember the five loaves of bread for the five thousand and how many baskets you took?
And the seven loaves of the four thousand, how many did you take?
How do you not understand that I did not say to you to beware of bread, but of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
Then they understood that he did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter's confession of Christ
When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that I am, the Son of Man?"
They replied, "Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
He said to them, "And you, who do you say that I am?"
And Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!"
Jesus answered and said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in heaven."
And I also say to you, that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.
And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
Then he warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus foretold his death and resurrection.
From that time on Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.
So Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "God forbid, Lord! This shall never be with you!"
So he turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on God's interests, but man's."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wishes to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me."
For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
Because what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul?
For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will reward each according to his works.
Verily, I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
The manifestation
After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
His appearance was changed before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.
And if Moses and Elijah had appeared to them, talking with him.
So Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here! If you wish, let us make three tabernacles here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And while he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces and were very afraid.
Jesus came and touched them, saying, "Get up, and do not be afraid."
And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone.
And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
And his disciples asked him, saying, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus answered them, "Elijah indeed comes first and restores all things.
But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they have also done to him everything they wished to do, as it is written of him." So also the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands."
Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist. The healing of the boy with a demon.
And when they came to the gathering, a man came forward to him, kneeling.
"My son is ill, he is often in great pain, he falls into the fire and into the water many times."
And he brought him to his disciples, and they could not heal him."
Jesus answered and said, "O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to me!"
Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him. And the boy was healed from that hour.
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, "Why could we not cast him out?"
Jesus said to them, "It is because of your unbelief. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
