If you don't want me, I don't want you.
O Sultan, you are the one who says such things.
It's a shame that you're missing out on opportunities. It's a shame that we're not taking advantage of them.
Then I'm not interested in the subject, it's my right to take and you're actually entitled to take before me.
Sultan, and the one who shows mercy to your parents, do not cause us problems.
Sa'il la at-tasir, astaghfirullah.
By the way, there is a brother who advises his brother on what to say.
You are suffering.
I found a Chinese woman in the house who was cooking and eating meat.
Chinese has no ruler, no shepherd, and no boundaries.
Say the truth about yourself
The Chinese is not written very well, we will do it again.
I won't become a fool, Salah.
And we missed the opportunity.
No, no, no, I'm not trying, it's impossible, it's not me who's doing that.
The problem is that he is afraid
He is afraid of him
This is a government project, everyone takes and sucks
This is a rule.
Now people who have no connection to the projects are taking
He is the chairman of a large project committee.
It means that he has the thread and the needle.
Global Beaches for the Third Millennium Project (in parentheses: Infrastructure, Phase 1)
The bull fell on him
This is the one with the extractor.
If he is taking
And you are the most beautiful.
The owner has the right to take from their project.
Because his car was broken.
Who was it that sent me the project site, not me.
Lala, if it's your right, do it.
Whoever gives you the right to oil will give you your car four times and five times
He left Ali
I won't become a monkey and ride your head.
Reach out and touch
Jawf Khamis Ril Khaltak
Now, when you say it, they say to you, "You are a millionaire."
One-third of the property is the right of the owner.
And one-third of the commission
The one who sings in the folk band.
Yesterday you said there was a state ceremony.
And the buyers of the Amee Fenner
What is important
We put the class down
There is no use, aunt.
La ilaha illa Allah, he will be guided, Inshallah.
And he eats all of it with him
Yesterday all night I tried to talk to him
This is an opportunity.
For the good, it works
And goodness, God willing, will prevail.
This is a known thing
The issue is between us.
What's up, bro?
After, he needs to recommend
But a quarter
A problem that can stop us like a bone in the throat.
The riyal began to fall.
I'm going with him today.
This morning, two hours
And he began to be convinced
After a while, we had a meeting with him.
We need to work on it, you and I, together.
The one who wants to cut our livelihood
What started with him was only the shaking of the head of the two men.
My brother Ali, my brother Osman.
I don't know
Based on the fact that today is my first day of work.
Ava alayk.
How can it not happen
Of course, but are you sure you want to take it?
Now I'm just asking you
You are suffering and walking on the street.
Eat or don't eat.
I am a type of eater
What you need
Chinese is back
We are in the first item of the contract
If you have something
And if you have any concerns
I want to know the following
I and you are from the project.
God bless you, Saleh.
You can because it is the first time you have participated as the chairman of a committee in a government project.
And this is simple and I'm your brother
Between us, our share
As part of the project budget
Ey, how are you?
So that no one feels the past
We put a note to go to the amount
This amount was sucked in.
By the project managers
What happens
No, no, no, Salah.
You know the basics
But it seems you have some fear inside you.
This is his right, of course.
First and last
Everything is in our hands.
What a charming guy
Heal you in the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. This is a healing.
The new car that my friend bought, believe me, it's amazing.
Oh, God says
The car tilted forward, okay, good.
And in a prime location
Only one of them has money.
What did you say after someone said something to me or I heard it
The one who bought the land and registered it in his name.
He said, "That's enough."
Now he wants the money in his hand
It's attracting again now
We are not going there
Salvation means
What is our goal?
We're leaving from the Eastern Gate.
He wants to go eat a bite.
Don't shake your head.
And otherwise, your brother
You come, sit down, and don't worry, come on.
He happened to him all night.
He told him that if he became a champion, he would die and they would deserve it.
Line cell is not compatible
And the imposed ones
And inshallah you won't take it just once.
This is the Global Beaches for the Third Millennium project.
Between brackets, the infrastructure
They then started the second phase.
And you continue with him.
May Allah bless you, you did your best.
That's nice, but it doesn't match
And you are like everyone else.
But there is nothing in it.
But I hope I convinced him.
We want a percentage
They are all in agreement regarding
Even after he agreed, he told me that.
The apparent reason is that they want to ban the budget meeting for the project.
Either of them is halal and I must follow it.
We're confident in it.
I will submit it as soon as possible so that it can be approved.
Take your ease.
Which brother do you know?
This is the brother of the lady, he is a shareholder with me.
This means this
You have the doors, the windows, and everything related to finishing.
Sweet, sweet
Jum is enough for you to finish.
You have already defined your own right.
We are taking something
Let us give our soul a week to think.
We determine the amount we take.
People are waiting and wanting
Abdulaziz's speech
Ayee one and determines the right of his soul to one million
This week, he will be depressed.
And he will specify the amount he wants.
They decided, thought, and determined.
What's up, how are you?
Do it your way
What is yours is yours, and what is theirs is theirs.
Hey, what's up? What's going on? What's wrong with you?
I swear by Allah that He will join us in that.
What are you doing inside this project?
This is a government project.
Your brother's name is Sultan.
This is my neighbor's house.
The hours we arrive at the line were broken on the car.
Sign up with us.
Sund Abdullah
Lala in three others after
I want to do something about it.
I say, Um Awad, let's get our budget done and finished.
No, no, this is a lump sum.
And I hate him.
And this poor man has dependents.
If he is a Zaydi, let him be twenty-five-quarters illiterate.
And a quarter of illiteracy
Everyone stuck together
Hey, I'm the one who distributes the most to them.
Back a lot
The good father at his mention
Yes, Mom.
No, no, no, but this is the last one, yeah, yeah.
No, Yabe, you don't want to go to Thailand to get treated.
Moment by moment, I'm healing.
And you are the one who weighs them down.
Keep only from the first stage in parentheses the infrastructure
Used syringe
Add to them three thousand
Buy me watches from Thailand that have the whole dial glowing
I have recorded it.
Any Imamah
I didn't register it, but I wanted to make sure about your name.
My dear, I say to you, mother.
The Chinese grew.
Yes, but the budget must be determined so that it is not completely open.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting and everyone will say the amount they have in mind.
Available for you
One million is enough
Waay Habibi
Guys, guys, just a minute, give us a chance
The committee is in agreement that they will adopt the project budget. The money issue is settled.
I stay more
We told you to keep quiet about the scandal, sitting in the ministry courtyard.
Oo Ansarx, don't embarrass us
Ya, ya, hey, everyone, are you all together? Congratulations.
The electricity went down and it's still on the way.
Teb At-Suwon na Balbaleh f Saheh Al-Wizarat
Oh God, come, oh God, come.
Shorten your reputation
You know, you were with them, how much did the budget reach?
Without my brother.
With the project, we all mean all of us, fifty million.
This is the first phase, but fifty million
The total amount is 100.
He is good.
Oh, Real, the guardian of the neighborhood, Salim.
Generally, you should be fine.
Oh God, calm down, let's work. The beneficiary community is waiting for us.
No problem, but the most important thing is that we don't want discussions, they should adopt the budget and that's it.
And we will start implementing the project tomorrow.
It serves a very large segment of the community
This is the project of the global beaches of the third millennium, which Allah has granted you.
This is the first stage, may Allah guide you.
Between brackets, the infrastructure
This project is for the next generations.
Of course, on behalf of the program's family, I would like to congratulate and bless you on the opening of the project, which I believe will take place tomorrow, God willing.
The work took a year and a half to complete.
A year and a half
Of course, again, under the name of the Future Tenders program.
This project
For the coming generations
May Allah continue to bless us with the gift of oil.
Second, third, and tenth stages
With the presence of the representative
Welcome.
They are old, they are talking to us, oh, when will the stars come, we want them
We're going to Iudona, Ashvig.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds. I am old and senile.
We all sat in the sun to escape the heat.

But I'm not feeling well.
Majou Jadami al-bahr
Why Shallok
Emaan told me that your sister, Manira, congratulated you.
About my father's old car in the desert
I said, "Just wait, I'll check on her and tell her the truth."

But when one goes to the countryside, he says, "This belongs to my father."

Nineteen years if not more
No, it's not possible.
Brothers of Um Salim are thieves.
He came back and yesterday he told me the same thing.
I want my son to have a mosque before I die.
What do you know
I don't say that my brothers are like that, God forbid.
Now my father died, I am 18 years old.
As-salamu alaykum, yaa ye tasal
And I saw the pleasure
I'm looking for you
I go to see her every three months.
Falcon has made us understand what happened in the past.

Nor is there any hellish wealth.

By taking my share, I'm done.
We invest our money in the company, it's better for us to do so.

I don't say that your brothers will turn out better than my brothers.
Jovini, I am
Twelve years
And I am a lawyer in these courts.
And in the end
Don't take the right or the wrong
Why are they doing that?
That's why I say to you, mother, don't trust them.
Take them gently.
Billeteong tellahong
Why do the courts take so many years?
We are all four-and-twenty.
We can reach millions like other countries.
"By Allah, mother, you never thought that a verdict would be issued."
Jovi, you are my brother.
I swear by Allah, mother, I don't have anything
Mom, I'm going to school.
I say, "Allah is enough for us, and what an excellent trustee He is over the oppressor."
We rely on God and He is the best guardian.
You have a court date in a week.

Says Al-Qazi, "Write a memo."
This is us, Mom, from one memo to another.
Mother, they invest millions and you are empty.
And, as I said, the Adabjin, Abidj and Aprilj
Don't take it for granted.
That's why I say if I were you, I would do the same.
Be quiet about what they give me
Because the time

But greed
And there is no paradise for me
My father inherited and showed me how to do it.
Neither I nor he are descending.
This is the command of Allah.
Why are they torturing my father in his grave?
My brothers are expected to come out like that.
This money and I don't match

I don't know how to behave, Nasser.

And I am not the first.
How do you go back to them?

Of course, I'll go and complain.
He said that you can handle it
It means leave it to him.
In his hand, he had his official papers.
Officially, we can't prevent it.
He has the right to see everything
If the budget and accounts are dry
We give her 40,000 every three months.
If the budget is tight and you want to be fair

This is what we are asking for Abha.
This is not the case if the land is known and the projects are known.

Look, you will see twelve signs.

Poor thing was shocked.
By God, it is forbidden.
Stay behind them.
And whoever shows mercy to your parents, O Ya'ba, I will not write your name in the record of the court.
It's the hottest thing for humans.
Coldest at the throat

You are not supposed to move except in the room, Mom.
God heal you, God willing.

I do not resort to the courts.
The courts see nothing but notes behind them.
Delays and slaughter of lawyers on the last line
Years passed.
And life goes on.
And you don't take from them even one ariyal.
God rest her soul, Um Salim's mother.
They told me one day before you die.
She told me to carry on and go to the courts.
"Tell our courts this."
She died and did not take any money from her inheritance.
She died and the case is still with the judge.
How would it be if we were like the second countries
Hello Abdullah
Brother Abdullah
Years passed.
This is my brother Saad.
God bless you all.
The most important thing is
Lama and Akhuwat
Brother Rashid
You are like my brother.
I don't give up on problems, money and
You have a second topic other than your sister's topic to talk about.
If you plea
Why is he silent?
With him, it's right.

And her father is a reporter at the ministry.
All from my father's permission.
We've endured all of this.
Let's try this last attempt
Tarushed lahum rafeejak Abdullah.
What they respect, they say their etiquette to him and drive him out.
Let's get Khal Anjof Al-Mutawa Abdulrahman Ash-Shibswi with them
Yes, that's good.
He said, "Inshallah, Nasser."
Eye of good
I threaten them with the court.
You forgot the late Um Salmeen and her Hajj for the courts.
Brothers of Um Salmeen can have a normal court.
But my brothers
Can't even be afraid of people's words
They can say it's a disadvantage to go to court, and people will say that about us.
Let's make the soul of his servant Abdulrahman Al-Mutawa feel better.
Welcome you and welcome you
The speech of Yameen is
What do you have, the best lock on the door?
What do you say, my son?
He says the truth.
Please, by Allah, do it
I am going to the court tomorrow morning.
Why are you waiting for tomorrow
Then I am the one who decides, not you.
Ash-Shubizar means from now until tomorrow.
Hello my brother Rashid
Take that as a word from me.
I told you before
Let me threaten them with the court
Now he is standing in front of me asking me to give him my soul.
Because they dried up the well, my love.
It is necessary to go to your sister's house, happy.
What is that
"Haha, you told me this is what Allah will give you."
The deliverers of the prohibited
A very small model of the court building
God bless you
The deliverers of the prohibited
Hand over your enemy
What else did you say, other than you?
Quite, I won't go today.
Leave it for tomorrow
For God's sake, please hand over these documents to the court building.
Ready, we worked on it, it's the icon of the journey
Two reasons for this
As soon as I opened the door.
You have all the best wishes.

Goodbye
Today, my sister's house is ours.
Ooh, the ministry agreed to his project, Bo Waleed.
My sister, I'm so happy, I can't believe it.
He told me to implement my project tonight.
Alhamdulillah, after the share for me, yeah, yeah, once alone.
God, how happy you are now, Abu Waleed.
From Qadah
My sister told me yesterday that Arada is very happy.
Surely, by God, Oh Manal.
Ey Waleed, he has money in these affairs, but Allah has provided him with lawful children.
God willing, I will tell the truth about Abu J.
Forgive us for our shortcomings
Mahboub Youssef Al-Qasour or Bou Waleed
God bless you, Abu Waleed, you did not fail.
God bless you and increase your good deeds, inshallah.
Good cook, God bless you, my friend.
The accountant Zain and the secretary are now back to organize your work for you.
They told me, "You just pay the office and leave the rest to us."
Please wait, sir
And my darling looked into my eyes
I want a BlackBerry
We want to build a bigger house.
See his response here.
Yes, we agreed today to receive a call after eating.
And now, dear audience, with a word from the project owner, Abu Bu Waleed, please accept his kind words.
Forgive us, again.
Congratulations, congratulations, Mr. Bou Waleed
You deserve it, you deserve it, may God bless you, you deserve it.
But to be honest, you have no business or trade.
Hey, Real, this project has a story, guys.
How are you?
Look how it means "Alhamdulillah"
This year
On the day the Japanese national team plays with us.
I am in Souq Waqif.
I don't know about that.
This is a catalog of the factory of the Ministry of Multiple Ministries, and we have applicants who have submitted their applications.
Anyone can build you a bridge.
What is understood
Any contractor
Japanese tails are not for playing
It's disabled, but I'll tell you the computer's PPP.
I want a cinema
He wanted a kitchen that was a kitchen, not a kitchenette.
I told you the day I submitted the catalog to the committee of the ministry.
How do you agree with the factory?
I paid them the amount
Meaning: introducer
The most important thing is to agree with the factory.
Thank God I signed it.
And give me a break after, so I can ask for my first order
I'm waiting for you
Adopt it, yes.
But let's wait for the signature line of Bu Fadh.
Here is your secretary's task
Qali Bu Fahd ma daum.
Ask for Jay for you
Ha Yabu Walid Bash Sou'it
The problem with Fahd, I don't know, maybe yes and maybe no.
A day exists
He doesn't have time.
It means "Come on, let's go."
You are the manager. Congratulations.
Tabee Boo Fahd yadabakni.
No, it is not necessary for him to sign.
The contents of all these files are from my office and need Fahad's signature.
And the solution means
God help you.
The clock is two and a quarter, O Bu Waleed.
The shift is over
I think Bofh is a bit crazy.
God willing, come tomorrow.
You say the manager has known him for a long time and is his friend.
Ashviji, you
A manager sitting at his desk taking a picture
Explain why they are sitting at their desks.
Loss, but the starch in their clothes
Hash'a lee, batleh el-maqtab, a'ool daash farzheh, ana yaa farzheh.
It means they are not doing anything foolish.
Only I can move the chair, not you, Abu Fahd.
Yesterday the manager asked about you
And the interests of God's creation are disabled
You look like you're going to them today.
Trouble, for goodness' sake.
Every day I face a problem
Because the factory is giving me a deadline
No, God forbid, God forbid, I won't say it.
Ask him if he asks about you.
But you're waiting for Boufahd.
See these files
All are waiting for the signature of Bu Fadh.
I expect today to be okay.
Relax, you guys
Otherwise, go and walk around.
If he goes, I will talk to you
If something happens to you, don't call them, just leave them in the dark, poor things.
Allah ma'a salama.
Forgiveness was granted to the lady
Son, I have been approved for my appointment since last month.
But, my friend, men don't fall in love, what's this talk?
YaBok, the registration deadline is going to ruin my daughter's university application. I'll keep the scholarship documents until it's done, YaBok.
My problem with the factory is the delays, the delays.
You must be patient for a while.
All your transactions are expected.
The riyal drinks his coffee but he finishes it on them
"So I told you, it's quiet now."
Hala, may your life be long.
Goodbye
Moment by moment, people.
Wait a minute, where are you going? Be patient for a moment.
Understand what happened
What happened after?
I told him about an important trip.
He has a special door
This is the case.
You, our interests have stopped, you.
Every day, you go in and out of Mufid
What's wrong with you, look at Bo Fahd
The courier is waiting.
God forgive those who have wronged him.
You will find it from where or else where
The factory in Japan
To the person, the deadline has not ended.
And your aunt is from the second side
She is a poor, indebted woman.
You will find it from where and where
Mama, I'm really scared about my father.
I won't leave him, I'll go with him.
Who is speaking?
Hello from
Bo Waleed
Because you told me the factory and the money of your wife's husband
Look at Bou Fahd ya.
It means I'm waiting for when I look
I can't find anything on them except
This is what we are waiting for, hopefully.
Ya Yebeh, you didn't shortchange me.
But all my friends are attending university this week.
Shadur-e-Yehba
The telephone is a Japanese device.
With nothing but good patience, my dear, but you
Someone, please talk to me.
I hope you're looking at Boufhad.
I don’t know what to do with my sister
I waited for us a lot
God help you
Bou Waleed's condition is not serious.
My sister, he's hot, he's shivering and trembling.
Because the deadline is about to expire.
He has five more days left.
You're going to take all his money.
I rely on God for him
Either is better. Either is better. Either is better.
I hope I feel better.
A strange ear, this one.
The text above says "نص اللي فوق يرقل"
The second text under the moving mall
My sister made me 50% off.
Give me a discount
I don't have it.
Your affairs will hopefully all turn out well.
My sister, you didn't do badly.
I'll wait for my money for a while.
May Allah reward her with the best.
I fought with my sister but
My boss came out. May God help us with our boss.
It appears our manager heard
God knows, he's going to light it, this manager is planning it.
I found it from him or from Bufhad.
Allah answered me and Allah is the problem
And tomorrow is the last day
Beautiful my solution
We do not mention God.
Toward the brain, toward the brain
Where did you go, you talk
You're calling me from a landline.
Brother Bu Waleed
I am calling you because you broke my heart.
But stay standing by the phone.
Goodbye
Long live you, you were a committed human being.
We used to look up to you.
Don't think I'm forgetting about your daily trips from work.
I can deduct from you
And then with this mobile
I'm deducting from you
I put you in the inventory committee
You're going with them today to the store
We both have to go to work today.
And if you go out
Don't blame me after that.
Poor guy, today is his last deadline.
Majhouf Madouh Amioud Telephone Waiting to Call
I'm afraid he will be fired from his job.
Oh, Bu Waleed, my phone is ringing.
It breaks the heart
Let the poor man go.
Ya Bu Waleed
They are human beings.
Heal you, O Bu Waleed, I am not calling you on the phone.
Spirit of the deal is done
And I don't worry
What, you can't do it, for God's sake?
The apparent continued presence of Bufhed
I'll make it for you
This is a senior official.
Who goes there
Oh God, help Pakistan
Brother, where is Ooz Pakistan

Look at Bofhed.
Don't sit down.

And for all these years, this is what you have done

But we were young
Hey, I'm so full, I'm going to put the bread on my chest, I'm going to carry the plaster, I'm going to carry the money.

Praise be to God, praise be to God.
Eil khlaas btahda alwujifa
I bear witness that you, O Bu Saeed, have not fallen short.
Here's the translation of the given text into English: "At this time, the rest of the prophet is coming, take care of you and goodbye."
Yes, we are banned
What do you want after I extend it to you for a year?
But but
May Allah bless you.
You extended to me four years
And otherwise, I should have retired a long time ago.
The children all went to work.
Last one yesterday continued
Ya Bu 'Abdul 'Aziz, come back now.
I am looking for relaxation.
No, and your job is to be a correspondent.
On a nice little fox.
I don't believe it again
I am four or five years old and I have never tasted a pig.
What's wrong with it being nice
Ashmeh in Khoshmi
Everything that you order will be delivered, God willing.
Ask the human resources department for me.
You finished the papers
I was there yesterday.
Your transaction is delayed.
Bro, I'm bored.
But it's over.
Don't cut us off, O Ad.
Hello, how are you, Khalid?
From this moment on, it's over.
I hope we can relax, my friend, we can relax, oh yeah
Sweet, sweet
I'm at work and can't leave.
The General Administration of Human Resources can be translated as "تقدر اتمر الاداره العامه ف الموارد البشريه".
I have a transaction there
You need to take it and hand it over to the civil service.
Thank you, thank you, you're a genius, you didn't shorten it
Where are you going?
My dear, I'm going to the bank.
Our determination is all of us
Either now
The bank is waiting for me
Trash with a limit
I don't know how to get out of work.
Okay, okay, bye bye, peace
His shape didn't match.
He says he can't get out.
I'm sorry,
Tomorrow morning I will go to the bank.
A learner who has been studying for years.
Of course, he feels the pain.
That's the best for him
You let him rest again.
Poor Farah, he's going back home.
Call me, he said, and Khaled will call you back.
Trash for to finish his treatment
Fear Allah
Everyone depends on themselves
My mother is sorry for the noise
Azeen, my phone is broken.
I'm not sorry for the dog, Mom.
But I say, whoever leaves work and goes home
Erooh Khaled wa ishghleh
Lying in his room
The ones who disappeared in their sea
Good morning.
Hello my daughters.
Yabeh walli islimak
But they called me and said the manager was really upset.
These are the treatment methods.
Hello, Mrs. Saeed.
I told you, let the children rely on themselves, you heal yourself, you don't listen to the talk.
Junk, except for what you agree
Yeh wa 'alayhi
This is me sitting here, waiting for you, and the dog is right in front of me.
Today we eat it.
Allah ma'a salama.
I almost forgot to tell you
My dear, I love you.
God help you.
Yes, the one who owns the market
You have to leave as soon as possible.
Come out, my daughter, come out
And the name of God is Ar-Rahman, Ar-Rahim.
Praise be upon you
Zain Deleted the House
Ails Ails Ais
I told you to stay home.
Teach your family how to manage themselves
Shaswiyam Sa'id.
Their conditions are difficult, I am forced to help them.
Well, well, well, I'm relieved
And I will give you a rifle, my friend.
And give the pig to eat the onion
The poor man's misery
And from taxis
Therefore, on his behalf, he said.
The branch in the market went away
They want the identity card
After you get in the car
And I gave him the papers.
Thank God, you look fine.
But he relied on himself
I'm telling you
I want you to relax.
Hello, Elise, I love you
Good morning, don't miss it
The Ministry of the Ministry and Government Affairs
Our address is Ministry of Education
And after the family transactions
Take care of the elders and take care of the young, you are indeed their favorite.
The children are holding good and important jobs.
And their time is busy, what should I do
Every day, unless meeting with the director, unless meeting with the return officer, unless meeting with the minister.
It means they have nice jobs, but they need time, they want work, and that's it.
And I'm obsessed, so I'll finish my transactions, and I'll leave you with a second job that will make you feel like a mercenary.
Yaayk, may Allah reward you
Away with you in safety.
Oh God, forgive us, again, oh, you Bushaihin.
So they called me and told me it was over.
If you make your father laugh tomorrow, he will complete the transaction for you.
That's why I'm really late.
Fear your Lord
Tomorrow is impossible, tomorrow in particular I can't
From His love for you
He is annoyed and tired of you and your behavior towards him.
You don't even respect the gray hair on his head.
There is a fallen person in the room for two days
From the halflights on the streets and from the suns.
Let the transaction give you
And the spirit of the Lord rested upon him.
A committee came from the morning to the afternoon yesterday
My reputation, mother.
My building is very late.
As long as tomorrow is your last day and committee
Your treatment is required to be finished tomorrow.
Otherwise, come to me at night and complain to me about them.
Bajar has a mandatory committee to find them.
What's up, Dad?
Tears fell into his eyes.
Initially, I didn't tell my father.
The committee is the one that changed their minds.
They said it would be the end of the week
Anzen ghol hak abuk
Ya Ybeh, don't go.
I am going to heaven and not coming back.
I'm not going to sit and eat at the cafeteria with these guys
Laugh at him
I'm done now.
I'm going to apologize to him.
I'm going to him
Thank you, my friend.
Eternal, oh beautiful.
Thank you, you are wrong
And he turned out to be selfish after all.
And do not grieve for them; and do not be distressed over their plot.
You are the good and the blessing
From today I'm going
We complete our transactions ourselves
Tell it to the house.
And I will kiss your head.
Hello, Hello, Hello, my friend.
Good morning.
Oh, dear father
In the whole world
Mall Mapic doesn't get upset
I don't care.
And you are just like what I told you
A.B. What's the deal with this transaction?
I want to finish it myself.
They told me to come quickly.
You have a request
With the Minister's pleasure
She was happy for a moment, my father.
I have a grudge against the big people.
Oh, my joy, they said my son is with the WA. Alas, this is it.
Trust in God, your spirit is immortal.
Bousaid Wenk
And whoever submits to you, submits to Allah.
The situation is very difficult for me.
You just go and I will throw the package to you with the blanket.
My dear, you are beautiful.
It means what happened
The apparent one forgot
Because the committee met after an hour.
There is no God who will save you.
I have a meeting with the minister today and will be away.
Give me the transaction
My situation is that I work for the people and the house for work.
No, there is no magof.
Peace be upon you.
And you are welcome. Please, please.
No, no, no, he didn't tell him anything.
Which of the following weeks will go to the beach?
And he says, "Amehis says there is a village there."
I'll go in the morning.
Take your rest there, of course.
No, and I will add another verse to the poem
A cook says that he doesn't need it
And he went to him
With peace
Maybe what is right
May the evil of my uncle be upon me.
God bless you.
Lala Yabok, M Mafini Shi Ma Fini Shi
Your papers are scattered.
That's in the village.
And this is from the Zood.
Ravijit treatment
Thirsty, you dog, you want water
Yib Li Mai Mai
My dear children
No, no, but cross it out, cross it out, I don't want it
Do not write that.
I want them to be happy.
Vij Yakhuti
And you are the singer.
No, no, no, he said to him.
Yes, by Allah, my sister.
Sister, please let me in.
The one they call the League and the Cup
And the judge was discussed.
What does he say this old man is and who is his father?
And hold it on him, but no nonsense, and no nonsense.
Again, the people of Euzone were there.
They call him Waiyebon and tell him to speak on radio and television.
And more than that
Take him, my sisters, and throw him in prison.
Believe me, my sisters
My dear, these days nobody is useful
He is full of problems.
And by Allah, if he dies now
What I leave is that he talks and on his saying, but we are not nonsense.
Praise be to God for his safety.
The blessing visited us.
Goodbye
I'm late for work, man.
Listen, Ybeh
I was up all night last night.
I warn you
Now I just wanted to remind you, Yabe.
Well, come on, mom.
Impossible, after you called
No radio, no TV, even Qtel is not connected.
My sister is alive and well, she has been like this for two days.
Munirah, your bride, sheds four tears on her groove.
You have no right, oh Yehbe, have mercy on us and those who have mercy on your parents.
Like you said.
Bassna khrabyat
What's left for you to annoy me
Uncle, Amnarah's father
Yana after the prison shower
And Khalaas said.
Fish the lake
After Zour ya Yabeh, his gift fell to him, and he invoked protection from Iblis, and God willing, nothing but good will come of it.
The second time he grabs your hand and tells the court to release his daughter.
Well, come on, mom.
Repentance after saying so
If you contacted the radio or television, you will only blame yourself.
Quet la't toba
Let me go now.
Between you and me, this is the talk
My manager said so.
We have no idea.
This is tomorrow I'll go and disconnect from the administration.
We'll just make some nonsense
Now, I'll tell the manager.
YaH has a million excuses and excuses to say.
Where am I going, you mean?
But it means it's over, bye.
I miss you.
Yes, indeed.
Goodbye
I'm telling you
It means you know, Salah, why did you kill him?
The public interest forced us to reduce the number of correspondents in the ministry.
You are right, but
And the one who gives you only one thing is nonsense.
Nice of you.
Bassna khrabyat
Yes, indeed.
You are welcome.
We have work, please.
What's wrong, Yabe?
Lynn handled the situation
I'm sorry, but I need
What's wrong with the fashion?
Munirah was standing and listening one day when I said something
Ey yeh qalt
I hear them saying that they are not going to leave the miles.
My soul is now inside you
And let me understand with Abu J.
The prison shower, we said it was wrong and we kept quiet
We are silent now after what happened to us
But because we are the people
You know how
I seek refuge in Allah from Satan.
And God willing, it will only be for the best.
Remember Allah, He will guide you
Mabee et-taqwaa, khalee qahwatj jal.
I know, buddy
Bored.
Your uncle is giving you a two-week deadline.
"By Allah, I will not hold you by the hand and take you to the court so that I can release you."
Mama, even if I leave
You make me suffer.
But take it upon yourself
Even if one told you
Do it yourself, you won't hear anything
It's not just nonsense.
Yes, uncle, he is
But don't punish me these two days.
Call me a crazy person, brother, we only want to hear it from you once, and only once.
Not only that, but it's over.
To be you the police
Lala yamma, you understand wrong.
And my cousin's son has a problem, so we asked him to speak on the radio tomorrow.
He was a little hesitant.
We were hesitant to talk to him in a public place.
I said, "It's true, my uncle's son, I'll give him the house and talk to him privately, it's better."
You felt like he wanted to say something
It means hesitant and that's what and that's what
They came from somewhere.
But but but but but but but
I am not your mother and I do not know you. I will be separated from you until the Day of Judgment. I heard that or not.
Salah Saad
No, Allah will not save you, this is the end, thank God we got out of it.
You have a sense of responsibility.
An example of a successful employee
But unfortunately
Although I tried
Hello.
Why did you bother yourself?
I just called the secretary to let you know I'm coming.
Shaheen Ashfeek
You know what this is
Afaa, there is someone in Qatar who doesn't know what is right, but we don't talk nonsense.
You are sane, but we are talking nonsense.
Bassna khrabyat
Eye the job
But there are no jobs, so I know the circumstances.
Zein, Real didn't hire you.
I am a Minon employee here.
What left a place, by Allah, O Manira, I did not go.
Even one I said before I came five minutes ago had a job, but they took it away from me.
My sister Asha divorced her husband yesterday.
It means my responsibility has become so big
After that, his responsibility became so great.
God, I have no idea what to do, God.
Come close to the minister.
But honestly, I'm dry, not thirsty.
They think I'm afraid he'll put it in my place.
I'm done, I've killed you
Who told you that I am Basak?
But I want this way to be far from me.
I am thinking of a way to slaughter him.
It ends in one go
But what is it?
I know that.
"Mb di lly ayethajj f al-ra'dīo"
Bee-bee-leh lakh milseh
And you are just a piece of information.
You, Saleh, are a citizen full of national spirit.
You are a patriotic citizen.
Received
I'm done, for God's sake.
I consider your voice to be the voice of truth.
I, Bufhad, after talking to him for a while.
Most truthfully, O Saleh.
He says that we have heard this before, but it's nonsense.
My mind knows him.
This is normal, Salah.
I am a tent fighter
Forward, forward, forward
And there are few like you.
Your words are very beautiful.
And your words on the radio are really beautiful.
We heard only nonsense
Umble Allah, back but alone, because Boufhad is now saying it, he says it, he says it, he says it, he says it.
But nonsense
This is the original, long live you, this is it.
Your request continues without stopping.
It's hard, isn't it?
Then Ma'ali stopped.
I want you to continue because of people's problems and their issues.
Listen, Saleh.
I'm giving you a single problem, but
You, Saleh, are the voice of truth.
I want to do it now, I want to do it now
A senior official of this.
Return it, brother, he said it, it's true, by Allah.
Yes, indeed.
This is your chance.
The opportunity does not come twice.
No, it doesn't mean anything
You heal, you don't understand.
Wait, come on, brother.
One of the problems, troubles, and hays
Mr. Minister
The Ministry in its latest project requested eight thousand tubes
The printed version has a capacity of 120 cm³.
But this employee
He agreed on the capacity of the pipes
So that he can benefit from the difference in price
Bassna khrabyat
What's wrong, what's wrong, oh brother Saleh, but no nonsense.
There is no God but Allah.
This call is a special request.
I hope you call it yes
Last but not least, nonsense nonsense nonsense
Do you know
Life and what it makes of you
But this is the last unit and that's it.
Sultan Asadullah flew.
The minister was taken away in a hurry.
He says you said something true
Ey, now I've finally got the field back, Bofhad can play his Abroha.
I am doing all the tasks
Anyhow, how old are you?
The minister's aide is prohibited.
Goodbye
Bassna khrabyat
This is the last unit, after this it's over.
Oo, and this is your job application papers, forgive me, I'm a bit clumsy.
It means they wanted to reach it.
Listen to my words
Because he is afraid
Try him out and see his scandals and troubles.
You have pointed out the flaws and criticized them.
They are afraid of you.
Deceive me, my sister, Asha.
You are the good one
Tomorrow, visit your uncle Abu Amnarah.
Condition to work
They don't have a history of criticizing and exposing the flaws.
Why do they hate our country?
Do we have any flaws?
We have intermediaries.
I've never heard the word "waist" before.
In our government circles, I go around in circles.
We have no bribe.
I don't know her
And look at the employee
Do we have foreigners taking more than the sons of the country, no, no, no.
We did everything with our own hands.
You are a son of your mother and father, we never had a master.
An official will be angry with you while you are in the job.
We are the best people
Best country
Flawless
Thank you.
Shamkhrabat was on the radio yesterday.
Mama, I want some sweets.
I told you that there is no sweetness except after dinner.
Save me, there is no sweetness
Shall I cut the shirt?
Mama, I and Adul were sitting and playing.
I don't know if you're playing
But because I tore the shirt.
Aspell Allah 'alayk ya 'Adul.
Come, come and see your brother's son, the best of the best.
The one you told me we don't need to buy it expensive, I told you it doesn't matter, the boy will turn out beautiful.
Look, what can I do
What works for this tech is the salvation of this tech shirt, what works for this is the waist
Said: "I do what I want, of course, no one likes it."
Mama, where is the sweetness?
Look at the crack in the workmanship on purpose then tell
Back and on him Walid
Farahanee is wearing it for the first time.
Barowijeg fih ana
We need to change
In the garden
Why do I suffer
His father is a subject of discussion.
What I crave
Take it from you
Hat doobak w doob yahaal
And they let him do as he pleases.
He is causing havoc.
Don't come, discipline me
Come and teach me
Yes, we are with them
About the extra mistake and respect yourself
Let him be, Ouli, by himself.
You are all fighting with each other, you people.
Bay Ab'eid Yama
Mama, don't you ever interfere.
Tell him, "Erabi, your children are fair, listen to me, you and him."
People of this place
Your eyes are not enough to distinguish between people and oud.
But I knew
The thief is on me, I'm not on you.
Let’s go up
Huzil don't deserve one
Even if they return to them
One prefers that one
The time of the peaceful hearts
Translation: "Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, bye bye bye, goodbye, goodbye"
But by your life, the minister asked for the papers and I must expect them.
Translation: "Alright, alright, I understand with the minister, then you don't have a job, I understand with him."
The blue dried up, the disaster dried up, the catastrophe dried up.
His new clothes, no, Aisha.
This is not an action, people.
And the griddle
LaLa Joe is going to change clothes.
Jovi Jovi
It means there is no hope of wearing it.
Jawwi sarwal 'adul 'iya nablis ryal wahidhu wa'tla'
No, no, this is not actually cut by hand, it's just a trick.
I'll tell you, the inside of heaven is like an electric saw.
But I can only say that I rely on God for what they did.
I'm telling you
Who among you wants some sweets? Come on.
I don't know yet
If you still don't know Allah, take a look around the world.
I don't just love you because you know how to ride a bike.
I love you because there is something else about you.
You are saying the truth, that's right.
I want you to want a sweet.
I want two apples
I will give you four units.
Who tore our clothes in the cage?
How did your father cut them?
He has a big pair of scissors so he can cut the car with it.
Under the bed is all the sweetness
These messages are usually delivered.
Only yesterday did I see this hole.
Ashkha'aheh, he is silent about it.
The most important thing is
We are victorious in our words
From the apartments of the clothes of Walid Yahal
Any computer
Ash'aneh qaadee i't-hajjee dhi.
The cracking I saw with my own eyes is impossible, people who can do it.
Why don't you want to believe me?
Spirit of your quarter, spirit
Zain, just give me a moment.
This is your condition.
Every day, Mom, they fight
Where are you, the first time?
Oh God, forgive me and have mercy on me.
Aye Allah ahedakum
Isheel estimates the large scissors
You are the one I am looking for, my friend.
Look at the shellakh, mother.
I'm going to get the biggest pair of scissors
Respect yourself, Sultan, respect yourself, Awosh.
Oh, come and whoever has mercy on your parents, bury them. Come, oh, come.
How do I start
And each of you
You are fathers
And the child is born
The child is born
You are my brothers.
Listen to my words and make peace. Extend your hands.
I want to say what I'm doing now
Better, O bird, I have torn their clothes.
They ruined my clothes at that hole they made for me. It's a disaster for my files, documents, and the whole world.
And God did not leave him.
Ayeeb, give us a list of Arabic language museums and their available funds. God has not left us.
What is left of it
Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, Lima is tired and going to bed.
My brother is awake and I know it.
And each one greeted the other.
He's not my father from his heart, he's not from his heart, this is his heart full of hatred and hatred.
Oh, God, I'm so angry because I broke the computer.
And to Fahd
Sultan Attah Attah Attah
But, oh mother, fear your Lord.
Give it to him. Pay attention.
Take your uncle's children and go play outside.
Oh God, oh God, hopefully God will fix you
God bless you.
Realize each one his own length of feeling.
Sow the seeds, sow the seeds for the children.
Mother, God willing.
Their brother Abdulrahman
Mom, this is the first time.
Do you know, Mom, the Lord of the Oud?
He doesn't know how to interact with people.
And they understand each other.
You're not going to get upset at me.
You are expected to
Each unit has a role
God will make you prosperous. God will make you prosperous.
Even you, Ybeh, became like them.
Oh mother, mother, do it, my child, what Allah commands us, may He guide you, and you keep saying, "Khalee, khalee, khalee."
And he said to him, "What is your name?"
My son, this is the last blood of my son.
Failed us, you kids
Those who delete were the poor, the poor.
I don't want to believe it.
I can see with both of my eyes.
They told him that he wouldn't believe this.
He says from above
Ahoh Jaf Yhal Min Fawq Afleton Bas Lanan Min Fawq A'balah Akbar
Either way, I'm not drunk, I'm awake.
Please, you can go.
You are tired a little or your head is spinning
Do you know who this is?
Tell me how they can throw stones at you
Important thing is peace
My dear.
I'll tell you, I'll feel better now, the most important thing is that they signed the agreement, I'm done.
In the name of Allah, In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
What is this? Oh my god, oh my god.
My God is enough for me against the enemy
Mama, Mama
The whole reason is you.
Your reason
Big ones, but little ones, they've taken advantage of you and your intelligence.
And without the hospital, I would have died.
Eye-dried and first time I ever saw it.
And note that after he doesn't take a sample from you, oh Hazza.
Ahoh ma kan amsaghl f al-biznis ma'ana.
But now it's been a week since he's been banned from us with the material
It is clear that he is dying and he is getting to know you.
I won't be heavy as long as I'm in the car.
No, my sister.
What can he say about me, cut himself on
A boy from a noble family and a cat breathed on me.
Let things become normal, it’s better.
He is the one who is chasing you and the one who is cutting his soul for you.
It's true, I replace the same feeling of admiration
But I don't know, I feel like I'll wait for the right opportunity.
Illiteracy is illiteracy
Destroyed and I'm looking at you, and how
And don't wait, young man, she will come and tell you, please, I want to meet you.
My brother, be the one to take the initiative.
You are right.
But I'm waiting for the right opportunity.
The right opportunity
More than that, you are enrolled in the same course.
The teacher is a role model.
Say it, Aflaanah
Ya Aflaana, la'a'al saj, hiya shamsamah.
It's been three months since we've been watching with our eyes
No one knows the second
Brother, you are the first one to receive money.
You have to go and tell her, please.
I might know you
No, it's not a strong enough excuse.
I need to wait for the right opportunity to come to you.
Hadeeha and Moodah.
I don't know, exactly what you mean
We finished filming the series yesterday
Yes, indeed.
You never forgot us and did not fail us.
I was free for a while.
When we buy the land that is in front of us, this is for Walid's sake.
I hope he gets married tomorrow, if he does, he won't go far from us.
Shalfaideh hain aad aad
Waay too late.
And you have good news
Yeh man jamee yawn ana jaa'if abaha aheef khalee'e min sharaha.
And they bought the land through the Development Bank
God bless them, hopefully they are there.
Hello, hello, good morning.
Hey uncle, pay the advance.
Thank you, my friend, thank you. May Allah reward you, may Allah reward you with goodness.
Hello, Norah. Hayaaj Hayaaj Bar'a. The car worked. Inshallah, come and join me. Come, come, come.
And peace be upon you
Best wishes to you
Neighbors are sitting with isoflurane and you are the most affected among them.
I say, get out of there, it's better for you.
Neighbors are sitting with each other, and you are the most annoying among them.
I have a nice brother who locked me in my car and I am not able to get out of it.
After your permission, after your permission, give me your car key.
After selling the car
Leave you in the Titanic atmosphere that you are living in.
Goodbye.
Goodbye
Now you know a lot of things about me.
And I only knew Walid.
Waleed Rashed Abdullah
Of course, a lot of people if they hear your father's name, they will think of you as the actor's son.
Mashallah same name
Essentially, my father is Rashid Abdullah, the actor.
Rashid Abdullah, the famous actor Abuok
Why didn't you have dinner with them, you should have had dinner with them in that restaurant.
Don't, tell me, please.
How did you find out about the famous actor Rashid Abdullah, my friend?
Aye, yeah, right.
My friend at the university knows them and what they said to me.
Aww, he likes him and he likes acting and I only watch him because of him.
He said we no longer live with a famous one who has value in society.
Oh my heart, oh my joy.
Shalhileh Shalhileh, his blood is light, yes.
Or his son turned out to be like him, after that, I asked God to make him better.
Believe the one who said
Drew Drouet
I have to take a picture with this actor I love. You can see why.
My mother said hello to Aboubakar, my aunt's son.
I read an interview with him in the newspaper.
They say they are filming a series about the days of diving.
I say, you should buy a sheep for the new year.
Prove that he is indeed a good neighbor
Hello, is there anything new?
We have a lot of names
They told me, "Allah will save you, O Bu Saad, your name is present."
It is determined according to the need and the employee's experience.
We don't know.
We can transfer you
"Let me see what I can do for you."
Call your enemy by God's name.
We said we would move and sit there until Allah provided us with females afterwards.
Fix your job
Back, Abu Ali
Enough, don't consider me a stranger.
Anything you need
I am at your command.
Neighbor to neighbor, and I am your brother.
But now I heard and I was dry.
Zein, Mashallah, on you. You know about furniture.
A boy is going away with you
You don't have to, sister.
Whenever you want to choose furniture, tell me.
My dear, Abu Amk is about to take over from his predecessor, and if they agree, he will get the whole furniture for free.
And I'm going to repeat it again.
And the only answer is Sang.
We are today considered as people
And I don't know if she's going to study or not.
But I wanted her to be self-sufficient.
Of course, I was speaking it.
It means I'll ignore you and tell my friend to talk to you.
Mother, Ali.
I'm not for anything
"Dam hee a'tebuni wa ana a'tebha, ana bitafaheem ma'aha"
You are dreaming
Let me talk to your aunt's daughter for you
Keep the subject on
On your own terms.
My friend, I forgive you
Bengof
Good night.
And you are from there.
Bouali Khair
You want this car, it's worth it.
Every day, the second one makes me a pastry
The structure of Allah, he will save you at the university.
And this is the second time I've been killed.
Your daughter is our daughter.
What you need
There's no need to risk your life, my friend, Rashid.
There is no God who will save you.
The car is parked in the yard and the driver is sitting without work.
The Development Bank is not short of money, so you can get a house and a car.
This is not our car.
The car of Rashid Abdullah's neighbor's house
Void relationships have evolved
We discuss topics of mutual interest that benefit both parties.
Ooh, what a terrific development, Hazzi.
Oh God, walk.
Mom, embarrassing
I have no idea.
Noura said, "My daughter and every day the university delivers her."
I told her that my father's car needs a week for repair.
No, by Allah, I am not going to do it.
She said that she has to take the bus every morning.
"Testimony to God, O Ali"
Nice people
No, no, no, my book
There is no might or power except with Allah.
Yahee Baloo Yahee Baloo Chaswi I'm fine now
Shaswi responsibilities and views
My daughter is going to university.
Yabo Ali, as long as your intermediary is Professor Rashid Abdullah.
What we can say is that it's over.
Bousaid Bousaid
I'm sorry.
Bouali knows our appreciation for him.
Thank you, may God reward you well. You did not fall short, O Boussad.
Everyone loves you, God bless you.
God is beautiful, so is this.
Guys, look, Professor Rashid is busy, let him go.
Excuse me, excuse me, Mr. Rashid, you interrupted me, or something
Under your command, we are prohibited, prohibited.
You have a strong medium at your disposal.
We are your friends and brothers, and if we want something or need something, Allah, Allah, do not forget us.
Say, where do you want it? I'll bring it to you.
Askhak aṣāʼir laysh ʼaṭirnī.
You are courting Manal for me.
They agreed, yeah, they agreed.
Manal told her mother about me.
Ashfijj mab amsadheqh
Am Walid
And dresses for your party.
I didn't understand.
The truth is for Walid, God willing, I see with my own eyes.
Poor thing, she called me back.
Take accessories
Send us your jewelry accessories
This is my mother.
Now, I'll ride a fancy motorcycle.
Masha'Allah, Masha'Allah.
Mashallah, I can't believe it.
Am Walid, you know what happened to me.
To everyone who gave you after you gave the car
And the drill.
If you go with that color, they won't believe that the aghla and amlah are the king's husband and wife.
Ambaye wae.
And God willing, you will go in these clothes.
Ha, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Without my clothes, you won't recognize me.
They say that he is one of the sheikhs who left us.
Coffee is good for longevity.
Bouali, I never knew you, God, I said this for sure, this is one of the cabarets, you're not Bouali, you're not Bou Ali.
I like you
The walk is not far.
God bless you, the two of us are going to propose to Ali with them.
Prominent people
I untied my hair from the car.
I said, I'll definitely get it from you
The last series I played in.
In a scene that was a wedding, remember any wedding
I was wearing that black abaya that glitters.
And after your father, teach me how to wear the burnoose.
Because your brother Allah will protect you, you will never wear a jacket.
Mashallah, amenour, amenour.
What would happen if the mileage on the community were to be reduced.
That's not fair.
By saying my brother Rashid
What do you have after the button
Good
The text "اللي دايما اجوفها معاي انا وخلود" translates to "The one who always has her with me and Kholod" in English.
The past is what it is.
You are my love.
We are now the people
What, our daughter Noora is going far away
Noura Hak Waleed
Mom, tell them I saw her at the university and I won't find anyone better than her.
This blessed hour
Inshallah, I say the truth about her father, and Allah writes what is good.
Why did you keep it? What's the reason?
Because his father is an actor.
Ruh Nād Abūkā
"Quickly, Rashed says he wants you"
Where are you, my dear?
Scream in anger
They say it’s because his father is an actor.
What are you ashamed of yourselves for?
I am an actor.
But the most honorable is the one who is most righteous.
I'll be on stage for two hours and my season will be over.
My play ends
You play roles
I represent
I send them a message to inform them
But you
I wear acting clothes.
On stage
But you
You played the role of F. Miāls
The rich elderly lady
He is the actor in us.
He is the real actor.
Don't be sad, Walid.
Raise your head
We are honored
But you missed the view from here when I was here
And listen to her screaming at him, don't look, don't look, poor thing, it breaks my heart.
And the master walks.
It is said that the horse is heaven
He is Khamis, Real.
This is Thursday.
My mother didn't wake me up.
I love you
That's why he walks like that
So that neither women see him nor he sees them.
I saw how beautifully she was dressed.
Seda does not look around.
But tomorrow I won't be at the office.
Khamis, Taqfīq, Taqfīq, ra'hum ash-lun libsah al-isti.
Khamis Fargni on his sixtieth birthday.
My wife is right, she calls it her lady's dress.
Oh God, it's Thursday again.
In the hollow spirit of Salem Ashby
Poor guy.
You're lying, when are you going to be like this?
If you hear the talk that is said behind you
No, Mashallah, even my friends say it could be more.
Why am I doing this?
Atghar Ali
Attack on him
I sit in front of the TV for hours
This is ahayeh
Aye, by Allah the Great.
Lala ordinary
Wa al-salam 'alaykum, akhti.
Jift aḥīn
I can hear you very well and I heard the voice of Real.
By God, sometimes I take off my clothes and walk on the street.
Respect yourself and divorce her.
Difficult to launch
There is nothing, there is nothing, there is nothing, there is nothing, there is nothing.
Don't come near me, don't come near, stay away.
Here is your translation: Haa ashniktek
My intention is good.
You are challenging me.
The only thing that bothers me is these forms that you have to fill out.
Especially this one, I, this one from your quarter, all of them are unknown to me, from the life of Allah, these two, the marhaban.
By Al-Ghazooz, the one who planted a garden, just came out.
Jalil al-hayaa'i lima yastahii'
You want to torture me in my grave.
Let me understand with her
After I said something to you
I understand with you.
I'm not alive to congratulate anyone.
Salem, I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
Our friend Khamis is coming.
Even if I see the flood, and yes, I'll go.
No, I'm not saying the lame in his head is talking loudly.
Ordinary Thursday, this poor guy
He was always telling her that his mother was very old and that he was going to take care of her.
I rely on God for my wife
They say you have Thursday.
Now Ahoh is busy with an international call, so I'm going to hang up completely so the line doesn't get cut.
And He cured her of her ailment by means of the message.
I say, God help you, Khamis.
Heal you, you are not sleeping
I don't have a note, I swear, I don't know what's coming to me.
Regarding the meeting tomorrow.
With the women's delegation in the ministry
Possible means
God guide you, Khamees.
These names are from the Minister's office.
And then come here
You are afraid of her.
If I were to ask Salem, I wouldn't be afraid.
Say the truth
I'm not scared and I'm not sad, behind the water tank

Call my father.
Hajj Murtieh
She says, "Hey, get the pen. I'll give you the number."
Administrators, some of you
This is your nature, you realists.
You are a lot like him, but I see you differently.
If I intervene again, I will only report to the Minister's office.
This is a mistake
And he threatens me to say that I complained to the minister's office.
This is a bold move.
She's going to cut my bread, you see.
But I'm the one who's wrong, the one who listened to you and called her.
Jawf aad yaa Khamis
If you complain to me at the minister's office
I came with you to there and told them the whole story, get me out of the story, I said.
I have a special talent.
You are afraid
My brothers and sisters.
Good morning to all of you.
It is an honor for me to have you attend the meeting.
But where are the rest of them?
Tap and scatter
He is Khamis Wana.
Yay, long live you

No, don't cancel, let them stay in the office.
The whole meeting is one hour.
This is my phone.
Bye, it happened and it happened
By Allah, I have been with you since that day and never went to their house.
Where do I go
What can't I go
Today, Zak is in the same situation.

Brother, please, I need to change the social care department.
Are you sure you're going to delete the Care section?
Why is it strange
Thank God, He saved you
You are the sister, sorry, brother Khamis.
Call our office and inform us.
I have reached your new department.
And who's with you in the office?
Isa, Salih, and Jassim and
Yaa khamis, yesterday the minister decided to transfer you.
Today, you are in your new department.
And I explained to you my problem with my family
You are a convert to the minister's decision.
I'm going to the minister
Today he got his annual leave.
And I will come back after a month and a half
Yahyeh wartah
I think that's it.
The minister said the same thing to you.
Daum Lin, I'll look for a place for you because this time I'm transferring you because they told him a lot about your problem and your wife.
I'll tell you the truth.
And the solution
They say that if you call me once, you won't be able to stop calling me.
And sharing can make it easier for you to translate them.
They made them put me in the car. I put them in a carton.
Jum wahidah
I gave you 10 based on the fact that you are 5 in the office, so each one of you is on 2.
What's his situation after he dies from his wife, he's afraid of her

At least go to a place for at least two or three.
They say the garden is a recreational area for people living in the complex, which is the bank.
Real men don't discuss, they don't need women's opinions.
Let's go to Raj.
I put the game on, we found out you were absent.
A garden is not a park.
A minute later
My dear, do you know that I love football?
Our friends and brothers don't know that you play soccer at school. If they find out, they will kill you.

This is from the resource management department.
Yes, you lived a long life.
Leave it on the side
Then I have a few comments on the proposal.
A man who lived a long life.
Do you have anything else?
No, you are not welcome.
Take care of them and I will meet them if I have time, God willing.
I asked the female employees who I sent to you.
Best luck
I'm going now and then I'll talk to you.

The series is truly wonderful.
The rest is just to act out the series, get on the table, act it out.
This is a rape of the artistic conscience.
And rape of the society's values
A series based on strange events
Unbelievable

And the shouting was like this.
You are basically known for not wanting anyone to know what you want.
Without a doubt, my brother Hamed, let us be democrats.
We will decide the matter by majority.
My brother Nasser, do not hide behind the majority and democracy in the field of critical evaluation of any artistic work. There is no democracy and majority in this field.
You were involved in your government job in the past.

I tell you, I heard the sound of the bell
And one day, when he went out, the Indian had a knife in his hand.
Ey, he asked me, I said, "You are Hassa's mom." I told him, "Ey."
Ey, I opened the door.
There was a ring, I think that's worth 70,000 to 80,000 dirhams.
I'm afraid this Indian guy will bring us the wrong Asia.
No, I didn't say that.
This is Samera.
Hamid's wife is our company's responsible person.
This is Allah's gift to you from her.
Ey Lajj Ashfeej
The ring is very fancy.
I never dreamed of having a ring like that.
The occasion, may Allah bless you, Hassa, my dear.
This is the father of this series. I call it the series of goodness.
Ali and Hamid are important employees, but since they are our employees, they cannot present the series in their names, so they present it in the name of "من"
What else is there besides this ring?
I say to you, if the guy doesn’t come out, it will be between you and me.
Ask me anything, I say the truth.
The couple of the genius
The one they call the Wizard

This is a good time to love someone and ride a bike with them.
Our series we are working on is called "Rape of the Conscience"
I was called to discuss a role in a TV series.
I want to know one thing.
Always our Gulf series like what we say, the employee this year, rape.
The important thing is to say, my love, what my role will be.
And you, my dear, are 100% content.

This is Omar, the manager's secretary.
God protect.
His age did not ask me at this time.
He said that the series they are making is weak and trivial.
It's forbidden to lose money on it.
Zein, and then I mean to say, shorten
God protect their souls, they're going to be in trouble, you know, because Rashid, this idiot, said something not nice about the series to them.
I don't fear you.
Keep this topic on
Sick person
A social drama series
This is the first time I've seen it on TV in a few days.
Long live you.
The series currently being aired is called "Rape and a Rose Not Yet Plucked".
But the budget paradise we are asking for is a lot bigger.
A large budget is needed.
Then don't forget to ask God to bless you, and the institution that produces the work is a local institution.
God must have saved you, I'll destroy them.
Take care of yourself for the rest of your life.
I read the technical page
We hear these days about the start of filming the series "Rape of the Conscience"
And a huge budget was allocated for it.
While the series is said to not be at the required level.
And another says that the series is a school for teaching deviation.
There is a high probability that they will stop filming.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, Hala, Hala, Abdulhamid.

Mercury will allow us to take advantage of the design and create a cosmic space
And accordingly, we will send a letter to all correspondents in the world so that they can contact us.
This is your job, done.
Mercury Artistic Production Company
And discussing its issues in a way that makes the series one of the best works that have passed in the history of the world
I don't believe the person who wrote this
If you are not ashamed, do what you want.
The eye is ashamed
Reasonable, we have journalists like that.
The assigned journalist is expected to have a principle.
Ya'een, you have congratulated me.
What are they recording?
I met yesterday Ya Shu'a Allah Sa'ah the minister, you know my problem
I say to you our series is going to be a series of strange events.
Tomorrow, the first episode and with it, with the people.
Hey, my friend.
Anyway, this is the first episode of Sabri's patience.
A man who has lost his voice only talks to himself in Gulf series.
And then she dried up and said, "Stay, I will slaughter my children only with you."
Oh my child, art is a taste, not an abnormal case that you impose on society and people.
Yamma, this could be in visual art, but in drama, it's completely different.
Ooh, no, don't worry about my head.
And it was evident that the eagles were Turkish.
No, you can't, you can't control it now at least, dig the first five episodes.
The series is bad
And it is forbidden to give our children iPhones in this age.
Call my brother, he's not wasting time.
Many TV shows are worse than this and are exposed.
Actually, this work, oh brother Salem.
And God, you're wrong.
And each house has its own hand.
Go and pick people who understand dimensions and the hidden meanings of lines.
And show it to them
We don't have it, we.
Hide your scars
The minister and his guests passed by.
I went to greet him.
Yes, we are the ones who agreed to the series.
Call the one he likes, but the minister is happy.
Let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleague is the one who said the insult.
I only send messages that praise the series.
No, never get sick.
Tomorrow I will write the review and I will send messages from me to thank for the series and praise and I will be the first to send these messages to the readers.
God willing
What is not to be happy
For this year
We agree with him.
The best series in the history of Gulf drama
All of them agree with them, the minister's efforts.
I'm walking with you, agreeing with the journalists.
The headlines are the headlines
I wish to re-rape the conscience
Thank you to the Minister of Information for this series.
I wish they would do it again.
I was the first to be called by the minister's office.
So, the remaining payment for your series is what we have released for you.
What are they blaming for your magical smoke?
And until they dried up something
We're in the black now, we've made money and the profit was excellent.
And then you see the series is a failure
The author himself said to me, "I am a drunkard."
I'm now proposing to you the second part of the series.
The minister said between me and you
We got it from the old days of journalism and the fake success we created.
He said that he was not comfortable with the series from the inside.
It's impossible for us to agree on a second part.
If the minister himself requests a second part.
I cannot help it.
However, I would like to reiterate my thanks.
For all employees
In this series
I congratulate them on their victory.
They deserve it.
The truth is that the work won these awards in these prestigious festivals.
This is the biggest proof.
I'm surprised you're saying that.
One thing is not easy
The golden award is a content of ignorance in ignorance
Eshkan says so.
Say to the readers, "Who agrees with us?" and to the press, "Who agrees with us?"
He says in part two, why don't I say
As long as you have these Arab and Gulf TV festivals, you can do laundry.
Washing art
I hear about money laundering
Mb Fun
Illegal money
The same thing with TV series.
What should we do with you?
How are we going to do it?
We don't have a contract with them, so they have to comply.
Write for them
Our products are exported abroad in various types of roti, small and large bread, triangular and shaped bread.
We are mute or we have signed the contract with them
Two million dollars
I made a deal with the Australian baker
This is the inventor of the roti.
They told you what product he makes.
And God said to me the roti, but what is the roti made of, I don't know.
Biswi Allah islamak roti abgarar
You are called Susteh
It means instead of taking this roti, which you call bread.
This is the inventor's thought, he made it easier.
Roti Jeans
This is the secret
You eat roti with soosa.
Bro, they're doing weird things in Delaware.
This is a recipe for making sesata. First, you put the sesata in a bowl and melt it.
And different flavors of strawberry, strawberry, strawberry, coffee are equal.
Do you know how much I invested in this project?
Three million dollars with patent rights
Come on, Samah.
Yes, Abu Naser
Under your command.
And the river is long or long-lived.
What am I saying, Samah?
Take your son Nasser yesterday to play soccer with the friend he is working with.
I agree with him.
This team has everything we need, except for security and drivers.
And we are considered incomplete because we only have one guard. If he gets hurt, we will be involved.
And I am supposed to have a link with fans
And one day, I took the employees who were on his say-so and I dismissed them.
I'm telling you something
About the important people in the company
What constitutes the heart of the company?
The baker took the money from the hospital dough.
And so, he was very angry with the boy.
He told him that he was a son of a well-known family, so he couldn't go and make fun of us, and the whole world would know about us.
Those who want to play in them do what they want
But it doesn't take the important people who form the heart of the company.
My team's star player has a match and I'm missing four players.
We don't need excuses.
What happened happened now
Hamdi didn't come to work today, boss.
Ride your knees with him
He said, "Wear it."
And I was stopped by Jaboni in the middle of my speech
The match began.
So I didn't feel anything
They tell me that the ball came and went, but I don't remember.
You used to play goalkeeper.
But for Nasser's sake
There is no might or power except with Allah.
Shallah, we'll leave you with the ball and the nonsense.
From today, Nasser.
There is no such thing as football.
Your team that you just deleted
The Lebanese all went back to the bakeries
Otherwise, you'll regret it.
This is the subject.
I don't hear from you anything
Your request, Mr. Nasser.
Let the boy say something, it’s enough, your request is granted.
For you, Abu Ahmed.
I see you have a saying
Tomorrow we have our last match in the round we are playing.
Don't upset him, Abu Nasser, it's enough, just do your homework, that's enough.
Zain ya shabab
Congratulations!
Go go go, congratulations.
Mr. Nasser, I want you to come here.
God bless you, my team today was on time.
Professor Nasser is needed
You promised to make a party for us.
I suggest you call and book a room at the hotel.
And once alone, I let the journalists and newspapers know that there is a problem
No, Rashid, do it here at the millis.
Because my father is so passionate about the game and winning, he might let the team continue.
Yabwa al-Kas Yabwa al-Kas Yabwa al-Kas Yabwa al-Kas Yabwa al-Kas
God hears you.
Lala saw his pictures with the players and arranged a press meeting with them.
Wako Jannah S. Mahir, sports page editor, will arrange a meeting with him.
What is the picture
I don't go far from me.
Oh God, let an icon picture come out corrected.
He said to me, "I'm not satisfied."
Fai ta'leekak 3ala fowwa ibnaa'ak al-khabazain asdi'd al-la'bain bi-hazha al-inqaza al-kubra.
With a fighting spirit
And the effort
And loyalty to bakeries
Bou Nasser means that we saw the bakery team play four-four-two throughout the tournament.
Allegiance to the bakeries and the trainer's plan
Thank you, Uncle Abu Nasser
God bless you
The guard
By the time he wins the league and the cup, they will arrange a meeting with you.
No, it's not a tail like the one of the council.
Dell sent their representative to you to work with you on a meeting.
Yabwa al-Kas Yabwa al-Kas Yabwa al-Kas Yabwa al-Kas
Do you know, we encourage young people
I hope you will see him in the future.
Yes, goodbye.
Mashallah, your phone doesn't shut up and your radio is on in the newspapers, blessed are you with this game.
Do you know what was bothering me?
Aad Nuzl La Nah In Saer Almakain Qali Tamer Yabou Nasser Alkorh
Now I'm famous and newspapers only put my pictures if they write under the heading of the first sportsman in the international bakeries.
I am away from the ball.
This is the translation of the input text: اش هالكلام هذا
I have been since I was young in the preparatory school.
The one who was wearing the shoes was playing soccer.
You say I should stay away from the ball.
As long as the guy with the shoes is playing football, I am close to the ball.
I am close to sports, I am an athlete
So we're no longer the international bakeries, we're the international stadiums.
Yesterday I heard him saying that he wants to start a sports club.
Of course, and today we meet the sportsmen in the international bakery, Omar Nasser.
To develop football
Of course, before the match, we want to know your predictions and before the platform arrives.
The match is difficult today
And the team that controls the text line will have a high heel today.
In sha' Allah, we are currently contacting professional players' agents to develop the International Bakery team.
His name is Saud. Listen to me, Allah, Allah, for the sake
Listen to me, the deal that went wrong was the players' load of the shipment that was coming.
We didn't get anything.
When I gave you the prices
Your prices that we sell to the world
How so, the Gulf is not like the world
Of course, no.
Haida, man, that's your job.
You just need to come when the Gulf buyer comes, let me know.
Keep your windows open
Two defenders, one midfielder, and one center-back.
Look, my love, I'm telling you the players are the tail of the four.
Three of them are the head
Meten of the
$1000 all taken by Jaki once
How much do you want for the 100,000? I'll give you 550,000 dollars for them.
It's sweet that this is happening for the empty ones, they now have the right to the Brazilians.
This is the player of the season, this is Aroha, with a million and two thousand dollars.
Having set the price, he sent a fax to the buyer, and when he received it, he said, "May God protect you from the club in the UAE."
You are the owner of the garar and the garar is your garar
Received
Oh my God, I'm so happy, I'm so happy with the man's stomach.
Ey ashlan.
Knee Knee
The knee, the whole knee
We won't be sad if there is no cruciate ligament or anything
Oh, Abu Naser
What is the adductor muscle?
Mqabes, su fihm maftah, yalah ma qasrat
No, Pracha Bou Nasser didn't succeed, meaning good players, meaning the Brazilians and Africans, by the blessings of Allah.
God bless you
I say to the store, the store, this keratin, oh God, the store
Mashallah, you have a second business.
La la la but players only
Hollow Inzolon Cartridges
For my sake, yes, for my sake, I come from the African jungle.
Yes, why not, again.
Carme is a hero of one cartoon
We created man from a quintessence of clay.
Ey, I'll tell you what I heard, bud.
He says this is a great idea.
"We are still here"
Why are you not giving us this sprout as an advertisement with them?
"Unless you tell my father, Abu Naser, that you are taking care of him and raising him, he will be of no use to you."
Then I go to the stadium to watch the national team play.
How many how many how many how many
Slowly, slowly, slowly, it's still tender
Place it in the airplane attachment with regards
Anything you need, I have all the players
If the coach of this man understands
We are two zeros, we control the game.
Yes, this is a coach in Spain.
A breeze I like
The successful trainer
The one who regulates the traffic during the match.
For example, the north is a line that is opposite the wokera line.
Honestly, this is your trainer, he can't do it his own way.
Yabeh Yabeh the coach has been with the team for two months
We need to find a solution with him.
If he understands football, he can do the sides, he's not sitting all the time during the game, he attacks from the depth.
Eye is sitting on the dependent on the trap of the intrusion
Oh my god, and the one who gives you the keys, don't make me lose my head
The imposed is withdrawn as a consequence of the Kaconomalalawi parents
And he puts shinamwa hababwa hitwalahtawa hawawa, he makes him leave.
No, no, no, no, no, until he plays
Shoololo Habbooboo Taba Lawa Kele Eeuli
Any line
Apply the plan
Wheel Hololu
Something that doesn't have to be necessary doesn't have to be between the manager and the team coach.
Today's star of the match and team star, Isac, scored a super hat-trick. God bless you, Jakolamando.
How does it mean we don't understand football?
Listen, Sultan.
He went home.
Lala la, I don't connect it, Absiareh bakeries, let him take a taxi.
Save your money.
Oh God, be with me on the line.
That's what my father did.
The coach said, "We're going to sit down like this."
She's going to be fine.
The team destroyed it.
"Peace to our team"
Mama, Mama
"La mab saahi means qalj, come here, you are divorced. Say the truth, it's between you."
I said from the first day I saw him, "Right, I like this Real Madrid, I didn't like him."
I feel like it's a whirlwind of responsibility.
Let's leave the excessive talk and the past behind
The spirit of your father's truth and know from him the past of your daughter why she got divorced.
And God will tell you, O brother Rashid.
But the reason he divorced her was back
Lala, it's not allowed, Abu Abdullah. We need to know why the girl divorced us. We need to know.
For your sake, you don't interfere with my private life.
How can I interfere when Real is sitting in the miles, he wants to know why his daughter got divorced.
The one who doesn't know how to appreciate the husband or respect his feelings.
And who is this Barcelona?
What's wrong, I don't know what to say, Spanish
Barcelona is not the only one.
This is Guardiola's team.
I mean, I'm going to the real one who is sitting in the miles waiting for me.
If you go, I'll go too. If you leave, I'll leave too. Don't worry about me. If you leave, I'll leave with you. If you don't know anyone, I'll take care of your daughters.
Watch the door, don't shake your head like that.
Hey, it's enough that she's a Barcelona team player.
Messi, the football wizard who always scores a hat-trick in every match.
Maradona, the one who said that Messi will be better than me.
And don't let your daughter who is not ashamed of her mistakes on him, look back.
Your daughter is neither a Barcelona fan nor is she from our country.
This means what you said
Hear me, Allah, guide you
To be your intention that the child
He goes to apologize to her and gives her a gift
It's disgusting.
And then, thank God, we have a lot of good things.
A house is a loss if we do not make our son happy in it.
Yes, but still
The condition is that I propose to you alone is that you are a Barcelona fan.
Mama, I'm not hungry.
What do you understand, Mom? Forget it, she's gone to sixty-two.
Here you go, here you go, mother.
Actually, Mom, you know, it's the losers who matter.
You are the only one I want
Here is the answer.
It's forbidden to break my heart.
Poor thing, it hasn't been seen for two days.
After a marriage that lasted only one month, what a shame.
You want me to get involved with him.
Mama, I don't want to fail with him.
And you said all these nonsense that doesn't make sense.
What is there for you to do about it?
Do you know if this is going to be a boy?
I'm not sure about that
She was blessed with
You informed the architect about the building I had in mind to buy and turn it into a furnished apartment hotel.
What's in Al-Mansoura
His father means tomorrow when his son takes our daughter and ask him for the building
And if I could
Speak to her brother.
Listen to me, it's fair.
Yaig one abuh millioner
Do you know what a millionaire means?
The opportunity doesn't come twice.
You know that the people in Spain have a short summer vacation, but they spend it there every year.
How does this Barcelona story mean?
The family can spread this rumor to prove their daughter is innocent.
Even if we assume that the past is true and that Real Madrid likes Barcelona and has a loyalty to Catalonia.
His wife is supposed to respect this.
And I don't mess up the team
This is if we assume that the past is true.
Salmj Allah Abu, Ismonu Bu Berjineh Lan Anda Bu Berjineh Aal Karneesh
They were tied up in a strange way, like a rope wrapped around each other.
People from afar think they are one tower

"Praise be to Allah from us and from you."
God bless you, my friend. May your hand be strong and may you eat anything you want. God bless you.
Thank you Darling
But tell me, Abdullah's eyes are waiting for your response.
No, Mother of Abdullah, no, don't cry, look at me.
I would look for the Cooperation Council and I would not find better than you.
Oh God, tell them to come and give us their estimates for the construction.
I'm done, Tamer, I hope you're well.
Only family members contact you.
Look at their requests for the wedding, prepare the DJ and I will sign it.
In the name of God, what God wills, in the name of God, what God wills. After many hours, my friend, after many hours.
After the response of Talak Abdullah
May God give me children and money, may God give me.
God bless you, my aunt.
Wear it to protect from the cold.
Either, but I don't know where my mother booked us.
Mama, tell me where did you book for us?
My mother says we booked Malaysia.
What's wrong with Malaysia, for God's sake?
Goodbye.
Aschvejg hadi ayi min shahr al-'asl 'aysiyhi
Aishwija ya yamma quli liy.
Tell me the news, mother.
Waay javee haseenay yameh
Seeing herself why
Proud, let her take over
Mama, Zain, I made her hair look like her mother's hair.
I broke my heart
Hai ama
Anzen and heal her like that.
Shares in it
Allah isalemek, ada tensin atibinalna wajaj min Espania zait al-zaitun.
Either Spain, where do we go?
Ey Anzen.
My mother says we booked a Maldives trip.
Aye, aye, Ma'am, after the Maldives, it's beautiful.
And by the blessings of Allah, I will go to your Tunisia by the blessings of Allah.
Now I said you're coming back happy from the trip.
My body hurts, Mom, why do they take the children?
Come, let's change the tire.
They are disputes between them
Heal your pain, my eyes.
You and the one who heals you will learn about my son later.
Heal you, mother, because you are bothering me.
I didn't see the crusts, I'm depressed.
What's bothering you, Mom?
Let her take care of it, but divorce her, divorce her. You don't owe her any money, your father owes her a lot, and the girls owe her a lot.
You shut up and let the one who is healing your son know that I know him well. Below is something else and he is old and lives a difficult life.
Call her and divorce her, mother.
May Allah have mercy on her.
Way, way, say it three times
You are divorced, moment by moment, do not touch me, there are two more times left.
Divorced, divorced
By God, I am nervous, I swear.
But Mom, go away, I swear to you, go away and relax, take the burden off your mind. The girls are on Afa, whoever says so, go away, Mom.
Oo, problem
But because he saw you at the disco
Hit him, hit him, let me argue with him

Now, alone, the dance club is not comfortable, I mean.
And sometimes when necessary, I laugh, there is nothing in it.
Anything in it, what does it mean that the world has turned upside down
I went to his house and washed his curtains, and now he doesn't know if you're a girl or not.
I, I, O Abu Abdullah, my daughter is getting divorced.
My daughter is getting divorced.
A feather grows on her head.
They sell and buy them from Toys R Us stores.
Like how Yufj is burning now on a product and my gang
And most importantly, they did something to poor people
What, you want the apple peeled? Throw it away.
It's normal when you shoot at them as you like.
Weak according to Real.
This is normal in the 60s, it's okay.
And drink from the cup from which God created you.
And the thing that you don't want your soul
You don't want it for people
The land of this compound was from him.
And in a strategic location
Ax Khalah ala Allah bas
No, the price is not cheap after all.
Currently standing
You need to get approval from Bou Sakr.
Yes, I went to the office and didn't get it.
I went to him the week before and they told me he was traveling.
Other than that, it's only after tomorrow that I'll be able to stand up. The problem is, I need Bou Saqr's approval.
He has a taste for the milse.
No, no, no, this is not official work.
God bless you, go to the office, not home.
After he eats
Bo Saqr this Ashbishbahe
Listen to each one and he has a key
"Say this, Bu Fahd."
You know him.
Tell me, I am only bored with the TV and you told me that you are dead and in the grave.
But it means that we have that knowledge between us.
God will cut your chatter.
God willing, if you believe, you will hit the nail on the head. At the very least, ask him about this determination.
After this event, may Allah guide you.
The month has thirty days and it is equal to fifty times Iswi
I suggest that for your lifetime they put you in the Guinness Book of Records.
The most equal country in the world is Iceland.
I don't say that he is the brother that you have with you.
Hello, please give me an hour, by Allah.
We are honored, long live you.
Hey, Father Farmer
It says that Bu Saqr is making a deal every day.
This is what I'm looking for.
But, oh farmer, today is a special occasion.
Today Allah will return your son, Saqr, to you.
Mashallah, you deserve all the blessings in your long life.
Abshir Walad Al-Halal on his behalf, Hayaak Ya Yabeh
Peace be upon you.
Xenophon returned.
On this occasion, my son Saqar and I will go to the agency and choose the car he wants.
A year and a half I have been waiting for approval.
Currently stopped
But the day I reached him
And bye-bye.
God bless you, Abu Saad.
It won't be that way.
He told him to leave.
Emir goes to the showroom and chooses the car he likes.
We buy three for him.
Audek Lah
I am Abrohi Amodini Lah
You told me that you will meet him in the year of the Hajj.
Today, his little son Shahin.
Ahoh lebbeh al-ashyaat.
This is your chance.
He passed by him and blessed him
He deserves safety, long life.
Mah Shaheen ya Bu Saqar
Allah isalemkum taslamun ya jama'ah
Praise be to Allah for the safety of our son Shaheen, who lives a long life.
God bless you.
Only from the brother
Long live you.
I didn't recognize you
God will reward you for the attraction
I was with you in the Hajj, long life to the year.
Even I remember I bought a red watch.
I pray to God to bless you.
I was in the hospital.
One of our family members is from Azor.
I am honored to meet you
Ha Saqr is still hesitant about entering the field of commerce, or else he would have decided.
I wanted to go with him, my friend.
Why, oh falcon, is trade so good?
You should never put a desk and a sofa in the same room.
Bo Saqer
Long-lived, don't leave me and say, "I'm done"
Xenophon returned.
I have a gift for you, a falcon.
A full role
And if the trade suits you, you will say to her, "I will not buy."
Today, someone like you has everything available to them. You took the lesson, thank God, and the world opened up for you. A Mercedes and the best office on the Corniche.
Yesterday, Abu Abdulaziz said, "Your father's right, if Saqr wants to, he can bring his business partner with me, 50%."
Mama, how do I balance between trade and university?
Mom, don't force me to do anything, I don't like it.
And you, by Allah, delete the agencies, offices, and policies, be careful.
Opportunity, my son, from now on you can start your business without capital.
You are the head of your family, loved by the people of your father.
Be smart and invest it
Believe me, my child, this is a chance of a lifetime.
O my God, prepare breakfast as quickly as possible.
Wow, he finally arrived, after the garlic and the pepper.
There is nothing, nothing tomorrow, I am afraid he will take the samosa agency.
A young man opened himself up to business.
This is what you were asking for. You know what I said today.
Mom, I want to expand more after the investment.
He wants to own the Caribbean Sea and invest in the islands there.
It is far from the eyes of the envious.
Boo Sultan yesterday said to me, "Your son just left the business."
He has twenty agencies and six restaurants and is a shareholder in two banks.
And I gave him the elbow of the man who never returns a certificate or a name
Apparently, God knows best, but they haven't opened it yet.
Ah, that's the one in the northern part of our office, near the door.
Not just my thoughts are on him.
Thanks God, bless you, congratulations Abbas.
In the name of God
God bless you.
The pain of regret is not worth it.
What, Dad, what, a whole year of suffering and hard work, supermarket checkout.
What is the current situation is that every day he comes to the hall.
Shafeh Tarsh said this secretary has a name, Samir.
Say this, Squr's son, Bou Squr wants to enter with you as a partner instead of taking the store from you.
After I've got a partner with you
There is no power or strength except with Allah.
But after I see you, you'll be begging me for it, no way.
He asked me who the brother was
He told him to go away.
Why do you say you have an Iranian baker?
You, when we were walking by that store, there was no small sign with what was written on it, the name that was written on it.
Maktub Al-Fareej Bakery
No, I want a different name.
And peace be upon you
How does it work with you?
May Allah grant you a long life, inshallah tomorrow or the day after tomorrow we will finish the workers' housing plan for Future Company.
Lala, Monsieur, she is my Madame, Elissa, I know you, Monsieur, he is the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?

Today, I'm one of them and I'll tell you that I work in the business field with him as an Ariyal and Wibi invests them.
But what we have between us has neither knowledge nor science nor study of economics nor even of trade.
One like this
You think he will succeed, but I think he will waste his time and lose.
I heard you, Abu Naser
I heard these people say something on Monday
Translation: "I'm sorry for the inconvenience"
This is yours and I have a falcon, praise be to Allah.
Jawful Allah 'alayhi.
Jofoh today
Long-lived, we are not talking about your son, Falcon.
We are talking about the base
Your child is a falcon, praise be to Allah for him, and I am worried about him, he is an exception.
Translate the following text into English: I'll tell you to talk about the base
We built a falcon, my son built himself, he built himself
Kahou gave him a car as a gift once.
Sell it and invest the money, and the advice he gives you is from himself.
What God has willed, will be.
Oh, father, we are talking about ordinary people.
One of them, Abu Nasser, took him and put his hand on the road.
What an amazing falcon he is, he has commercial talents.
Major economic trends
We need to ask who his father is.
It's forbidden that I, by Allah, am surprised.
What an amazing God.

May God bless you.
By God, I don't know what's wrong with you, Salim.
Yes, tell him.
The previous one was correct.
The company says they shredded the father's fax.
They said to him, "It's over."
The house is not habitable.
Like what you see
He says that the first thing he heard was the news
It crashed on the desk and the fax machine was destroyed.
He has a shadow on him
Aye, he said, the one who said he taught me archery. When his arm grew strong, he threw me.
What's the doctor doing now?
Pray for him, Salem.
I am shocked.
A liability in this world
A man gives to the poor with his right hand without his left hand knowing.
This is the association that, of course, delivers donations to all Muslims throughout Asia and Africa.
But of course I want you to also explain to us, O long-lived one, about your goals and future steps, God willing.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Our goal at the Saqr Charity Association is to achieve solidarity in this nation.
In addition to sixty banners for our brothers who were affected by the earthquake in Pakistan.
This, and last but not least, means that we are now appointing seven poor families.

And then, all along your way, you will be with me.
My life is mine.

Yes, by Allah, any place, any place, if you and I are there, I will be happy there.

Blessed, hopefully, a lovely order
Good luck, God willing, good luck.
Oh, if only
The owner wants to do any project, for example, for example
To be honest, do you want a partner or something else?
I heard that they say that you are planning to do something that could affect you.
Hello and welcome.
Waaza, do you want to increase the existing one?
Thank God, the work is excellent.
What do I want to do, Abu Saleh?
But we were late, so we did it last week.
Yes, indeed.
Allah willing, all will be well. Goodbye.
He remains.
You are sure
And it has details and you don't know the big problem
Every Monday after
It's a store fee next to your store.
Oh, you envious, malicious one.
Before I knew that the market was open to everyone
You need to know.
Your heart must be open to your cousin.
I'm asking you a question
Disguise, attract, laugh at me, and fix me
I want to do my job very well.
You are taking the place of the adhesive in my store, which has been destroyed on me.
But God, they didn't say come, congratulate, sit in my place, near the ear of the mind, they didn't say that.
This is envy, this is hatred, by Allah, by Allah, I swear to you, this is hatred, it drove me to him.
Ava, you guys are people.
Ava'l-ik ya Bu Saleh
Hey, what's up? By the way, what's up with you, you know, Boo Zanto?
Extend my hand like you extended your hand and I will become your morsel.
Ava, people.
Group, pray for the Prophet.
What did I do, for God's sake?
Eyep, a designer from the Philippines, advised me.
No one can stop you.
Why, why, why does a Lebanese guy have to be a jerk?
Talk to him, joke around, laugh, and they will have fun in the end.
I see Boussaleh is bringing a Lebanese.
He kept telling me and convincing me.
His words enchanted me.
I was satisfied and made me pay twelve thousand euros.
And after two days, Allah, your agent is going to the souk al-haraj and the best cap is there, my brother, my twin brother, I called him Ariyal.
Aflose the loans.
A Lebanese designer
I met the professor yesterday. You told me it was hard to get there, and it's still hard.
Yes, by Allah, today is even more difficult.
I feel Abu Saleh has changed in the last two days.
In a what
I don't know anything about it.
Abu Saleh is very mentally exhausted after his cousin opened a store and brought a Lebanese designer to the city.
Two weeks ago, the store had a big sale.
What is the problem here in Ghatri? Why did he open a store? If Ghatri comes again, he will invest in the same project and open the same store next to it. I can go to him.
No, no, no, the designer Fadi Hala is with him and they are thinking about a solution.
How is that now?
Sitting in the garden, eating a meal.
If we were to form a shape, I don't think the shopkeeper would let us in.
A place far from them means
That means to clear the area for them.
Ezin taslam wa kam al khasam
A shade means, God willing, you don't give with every wedding dress, evening dresses, shame
Call for a national uprising
What's going on? I went to the store where you bought me today, and they're putting an ad with every wedding dress, two evening dresses, and a discount of 25%.
Oh God, let's go, let's go.
Don't worry, look, in two weeks they will come back and do the same work. Do one wedding and get two. Don't worry, with a 25% discount.
They are not going to fight us.
I'm thinking like this too because tomorrow if we leave them to destroy our house.
It doesn't matter to you
He's gone now
This means a challenge and I thank him
It's not a challenge, man.
Good for you, Zain, you did well. Nobody wants to be poor.
Hey, you'll get the news in two or three days if you don't visit the store once.
Good for you.
Keep it cool, sugar, sugar. I'm coming for you now. Come on, by the way, peace.
Best wishes
Saad says the shop has a bad smell, he says he doesn't know where it comes from.
The smell has nothing to do with the air conditioner.
Her smell didn't fly out of the store for at least six days.
One hundred percent
Yay, in the evening
Turn off the electricity to the store.
This means justice.
Now you expect me to sign an affidavit or drop the case and open a file
Translate the following text into English: It doesn't matter to him.
By the end of existence
Oh, Mr. Bunoser, something strange is happening, no one is entering the shop.
Omar Bounassir, sugar, sugar, my customer is coming to see me, I'll come back and tell you strange stories.
There is a person and he is lying on his bed, fallen asleep.
In terms of my mental state, I was afraid to tell him that the bank is online and they want the installments.
Timing was against him, his uncle's son was in debt, and he was in a bad situation.
Zain Shalli happened this time.
Therefore, if they enter the store by mistake and they scold the designer Saad, yell at them and run away from them.
Ey Inam, and upon him, may the node come upon his eyes and look at the ceiling.
Mother, what's wrong with me
Saad in the store
My mother is a magical woman.
Women see him and they invent fear.
I don't know what it is
Lost me, lost me
Adeoni wade yakhok
I'm afraid I'll be imprisoned.
And I don't have any proof to go complain to him.
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do.
Let him deserve it.
And to the one who surrendered to you, say: "The magic you did to him turned the designer into a monster, and the women, when they saw him, were afraid."
A rumor spread about him.
Ey, my friend, tell the photography group that they need you urgently.
Hey, and whoever you're with, tell them that they need you, they need you, they need you.
"By Allah, they are raising my blood pressure. They are killing me. I can't take it anymore, oh Professor Abdullah."

I'll take care of myself, I'll watch after I'm not watching one scene
You bear the responsibility and you, the production manager, bear the responsibility.
And now, Ashbysoone
Before anything else, the director is irritated and it's up to God, but they will act.
He wants one with special features, he wants it to be secure, and it has to be a certain wattage.
You are right, you are correct
What did the director say, she said
I have one, may Allah help you with it, hopefully it will be useful.
SS Saud Acknar
Saud Qawati, I am the one who told him, Saud Ekhnear.
Either of these, when they were small, they were called As'ad Ankar, and when they grew up, they were called Qawati.
Quatati leish.
I'll tell you why he's poor, he's wandering the streets, collecting scraps and selling them by the kilo.
My brother, wealth and honor are not a disappointment.
His shape must fit the Ahwah Jof Ahwah that Amdoh told him about, and Ammurbab, there is no length or width.
It certainly works.
Inshallah, but I'll tell you, your makeup is perfect, it works well, it's light after that.
The whole world is waiting for what I said.
I don't have the number.
But I'll take Emir and Yai and go to him

Be quiet, be quiet, you.
Saud Qawati
We have one man in our neighborhood named Saud Qawati.
Umble, I'm sure he's in the neighborhood, but I don't know which house he's at.
This is a one-room house called Saud, where he and his mother live.
Yes, that's right.
But this is not a Saudi Qatayf.
This is a Saudi laptop
Of course, it's just evolving over time, it's like a laptop, a mini laptop.
He is tall, strong, and a bit of a hood.
Tala'i Kan Sel Al Awati and started to suppress laptop owners. Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh uncle.

The price is reasonable and the quality is very good.
Above average means not the highest quality
Even in chocolate for the fancy bakery, but I'm sorry, I thought you might want the right price.
After the departure of Abrooh, the most expensive and most expensive of all, after the death of Atudona, the most expensive of all.
It's impossible to replicate this artistic touch.

The same chocolate that the royal court of Spain always orders.

Please, please, rejoice.
Come on, brother, give us some of that chocolate, brother.
I say that the matter is with the person
No Saleh Abdulqader who is in the accounts
By Allah, you deserve it. Come after I give you one. Come.
And we rushed to the coffee.
My aunt went to their wedding.
Oh my dear, I went to their wedding and it failed, you can't believe it, my sister.
I heard what your aunt said.
Because of that, I want to make a wedding for you, it didn't happen and it didn't work out.
You have nothing left but a month and a half.
I organize everything.
But oh, I let you go
You don't live in society, so people who get married put their halal and haram together.
And I saw your face
When I bought you something, I saw how you praised me and praised your taste.
What they said to you was wonderful and nice.
Yes, but how much did we pay?
The money we paid for the kafi was used to buy four sheep for the wedding.
And whoever you hand it to, don't interfere, your mother will know to do everything, you just give her the money.
It means they agree with anything we choose.
And you really have no taste.
What do you think about the silence?
But discrimination costs more money.
Why is it that the one who went away is the one who was nice?
What do you think, Beidi?
First time in Qatar history someone thought of making a desktop in the shape of a computer mouse.

You are not the first one to get married.
Think about marrying in the Comoros, you'll see the country's beauty.
We were not at the beginning after all.
If you want to be comfortable, where will the bride stay in the wedding tent?
Iron, dye, and some wood
People are satisfied
They take advantage of us, these scammers are really good at it.
And now what do you mean
Mutnqer w Za'alan
What do you want to get married to, for sure
I spoke to the bride's mother and told her that Saleh is facing difficult circumstances.
What wants to get married, can't afford the wedding expenses, that's normal, you want to talk to her, you can talk to her, from a friend, I talk to her.
We received a bouquet of roses from the Netherlands today.
I think it would be nice to put them on the tables at the wedding.
Of course, it’s my first time in Doha.
The Middle East after
Put it on the bill
It means that the number is increasing
Amih 272, i.e. salvation
But Samir, I don't see the formation in the wedding of weddings
Do you know after Hajj people
I think you've booked it
You earn more than me.
A door opens for you that I know you will close.
God help you, Saleh.
But, by God, you'll get it. I tried to sort things out a bit.
But I, praise be to God, am determined to go to the pure daughter of the Arabs from any Arab country.
He says, "There's a wedding party, it won't cost you all a million dollars and you'll be able to go."
God bless you, my love.
God willing, the month of the wedding is coming.
You just need to select a card and tell me.
Dam, an batakat aadi al-gharaz khalaas, al-mumkin an al-nas a'i'rafun anhum ma'zoonun, wa'n wa's sa'ah jum, bis.
This is all that matters to you, not what people say.
People know the level of the wedding from the cards.
Either tomorrow I will go and show these cards and see what people say.
They were so obsessed with their wedding that they never saw the cards of those and those.
We didn't say that, we just ask for it from the internet.
Its cover is made of panda fur fabric and it has a fancy zipper.
You don’t have to apologize, but I don’t owe you anything.
I'm not a doctor in Al-Halooj, the women are asking for cards, meaning they are asking for them.
By God, you have broken my heart, my brother.
Poor thing, they must be pressing it.
Oh, Real, there is no one who lent me money.
You even said he sold his car.
And he went to the garden twenty years ago this morning, he was walking and talking to himself.
I don't blame him, my poor brother, God knows when we will develop.
Sugar the door and don't worry about it
Forgiveness, brother.
You didn't try to convince them that you're having a wedding according to your means.
It means "on purpose" in English.
Why am I alive, my soul?
The problem is that our society is obsessed with appearances, boasting, and vanity.
You are forced to be a patient son of the same disease.
If you want to live there
I once saw the mother of the bride
I only want my clothes.
Leave it to God
Say "No"
How did you get married?
And I don't want to marry Minon, I do.
And then, my friend, even if I decide to get married.
I'm thinking of taking a foreign or even Arabic course.
Yes, by Allah, my country says so.
By God, we were determined to bring a DJ for the songs.
But Madame Am Nasser bought the right to her son's wedding, that singer
This singer is famous but I forgot his name.
Ashvej madhe booz
I don't like the garden I'm making.
Enough to sell his car and every day one of the four of them would bring him.
He went to the room and found him talking to himself.
I see that the language has changed now
Because my brother Saleh's mother is tired, she's gone back.
I have nothing to do with him or her.
I am not less than people.
We will not abandon you in the park
And he lent you money, mother, but my brother spent all he had and didn't leave anyone to lend from.
And whoever gives you a kiss is only you
My mother has new requests for the wedding, and my brother told her to cancel the wedding, I don't want to get married anymore.
Now, where is it?
Inside Isuon, she received first aid.
He says now she is fine, but they are arranging a room for her in the hospital.
My shameless cheeks
You are a breeze of spirit, my sister.
Dr. Jalaj said don't talk and gave you an injection so you wouldn't fall asleep.
Wherever he rests, he makes us feel like we are in paradise, whether it is good or bad.
I'll tell Abdullah to come and tell us that he has no money.
Therefore, to your mother
She was afraid of her.
She has a soul and she kissed her on the head
And tell her to do whatever you want.
Beeeb for Abdullah Arweeshid
By Yusuf Taib, I don't think he will be short with me.
It's forbidden for you, you only find Yusuf.
Heal her, please.
Yenit, you, Saleh.
But Minister Amkhalifeh because Real Sheba and above all that he is disciplined and honest.
I think you should go and tell him what you told me, there's a high chance his heart will stop.
Yes, I understand.
Because of the difficult situation you are in, you want to ask BoYusuf to withdraw funds, of course, from the Ministry's funds.
And God knows, you when you return them to him
If they go to the audit group and ask them about the money.
I can go to Dahiye, of course.
Anyone who knows what to do next knows how to behave
God, how are you in the Real Madrid library and you are carrying the responsibility if something happens.
For the rest of my life, I will steal.
Our uncles are called embezzlement.
On the first floor
In the Gothic, there is a blue ribbon on it and in its circle, there is something like what I say, like the picture of the dove, yeah, yeah.
Inshallah, Uncle, Uncle, bye Yusuf, I, I, if my homework is difficult.
I'll go back to it all
Call me Boyusof.
You are the last of my life
Destroy me, Khamees.
Salah Salah
Listen to the words, by Allah, if someone else had done it, you would have written it down or something would have happened, oh, oh, oh, Khalid.
Salah Salah
All the methods I tried were useless, Uncle Yusuf. I'm drowning, it's over.
I can't go back to the wedding now.
And I don't know them all, they are all bald.
Heal you, heal you
Lala, the second rove, the second rove.
In the stairs, in the stairs
Uncle Yusuf, the stairs are made of marble, which one of them is it
The Gothic "alala" with a picture of Real Madrid on it is ridiculous.
We booked two rooms, but we only got the makeup and hair rights.
And tomorrow morning we will be there

The most beautiful groom, God bless you, I love you, you are so cold.
Mama, the police are knocking on the door.
I am wrong to obey you, O God.
It's forbidden to marry me today.

Oh God, let's get out of this prison

But it's a shame, brother, if this happens.
The company provided a contract for three million, two million of which were for the value of materials.
Wrote a memo to the minister
We said that corruption is bad, but it still reached the level of waste.
You are a jinn, you don't live in this world.
The minister congratulated Osman on his appointment.
And our manager, why didn't he have to say it, he had it
I don't know about him, by God, I don't know.
Where is morality?
The right became wrong and the wrong became right
Ya Saad, you're sure that Minister Funches, you guys, is the best in the world.

I'll try, bye bye.
Who took my sister home?
A rule that comes after a lot of laughter and chatter, which one is it?
This is my colleague and I at university. I'll take care of her if I arrive normally, that is.

What do you hear us saying
Your thinking is old.
Right and wrong, there is a lot of old and new
Right is right and wrong is wrong
The world has evolved, we are living in the age of technology.
The era of global changes that the world is adapting to and no one can keep up with.
Yes, we lived and we died
Don't blame me, Amenira. It's hard when someone gets irritated and nervous.

Of course, of course
Of course, I know you don't need me to remind you of the rules of the job.
But at the same time it is very important.
We are recovering some of the values and principles that were lost.
For the common good
May your life be long.
We all need to
Theft is a must for your entire life
You are haramah.
Thank you, thank you to all of you.
And what I want to say after that
And beware of the first day of work.
There is one employee among you.
Honest, faithful, dedicated, and one of those people who are always there for you.
Just a doubt
There is a trustworthy employee.
To take the necessary legal actions in our ministry.
I do not give good news, long live you.
Praise be to God, we are all thieves.
Best wishes to you, my dear colleagues, and behind you I say, "Long live you."
Where is Khalid?
Yes, long live you.
Khaled, you are very good, praise be to Allah for you.
I hope you live long.
By God, long-lived, you know how to choose
God bless you.
Why did you let the devil tell you that?
Praise be to Allah who comes to the trust.

Mom, why is Dad in prison?
Our head's exposed.
It means he became an officer.
Faulty to say about Abu Amine
This is a mistake
Every body is covered

And God willing, I'm going to look for a job for you that will occupy you like that.
In a respectable unit, she covered her body and charms.
And cover my chest after I wear a scarf for her.
I wanted to go with her.
No, and after that, I want her to wear a pair of pants that exposes half of her stomach from above the waist.
But it's no use, you hear the talk, you don't want to walk the path of justice.
This is what I'm saying to you.
I don't blame you but yourself
We are proposing to your daughter Sarah for our son Rashid.
One of us built a tower for his daughter in these straight real days.
Waraashid Awladi, I bring you good news.
Yes, it's a good real thing
Eyebat the hero from his room
Four and twenty hours drunk
Drunk, Tite, and all day I'm depressed
And the Arabs, you don't ask about them
And what a great upbringing, Abu Rashid.
And I give you the glad tidings of hypocrites
And the trumpet, how?
Aasil ya Awlydi, and the drugs, how are they?
The one written from the end will give you five rials if you find his black eye on him and compete with him.

Hello my dearest daughter Mona.
Majid was not named Abdulaziz.
Any justice
My daughter is crying.
You know that since the establishment of the State of Palestine, with its capital in Jenin, in the year 2000 after the signing of the comprehensive peace with the State of Israel.
Israel still practices terrorism, pressure and siege on it.
The latest claims against Palestinians by Israelis and their Arab friends
They are smuggling plastic knives through the tunnels.
Especially the second item, paragraph five, which states that the Palestinian people should trim their nails every day.
We are now moving on to the fateful meeting.
Cheap sir
When Israel agreed to the establishment of the Israeli state
Hey, what are you saying, you're ruining our reputation, you're working and leaving the second one.
Please.
Sorry, Mr. Lion, sorry, Mr. President
Let me have the word
I fully committed to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
What is this Israeli representative talking about?
Elaqua doesn't have anything made of hard stone or plastic as a commitment from us.
Even our fathers, my friend.
What do you Gulf people call it?
In all of Palestine, it is made of wood.
According to the agreement, American companies will manufacture wooden cars for us.
And all the doors of our houses are made of heat-treated wood, my friend.
We don’t want speeches.
Don't change the subject
Mr. President
This point is important. I ask you to vote on this matter because nail care is a violation of the agreement.
The corresponding person raises his hand
But I had a strange dream
To control the students
I wanted to say it.
This is the fourth school I'll be attending tomorrow.
Because I have a strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The boys are chasing him and tearing his clothes, but he is silent.
I went to the beach once without a headscarf.
My manager said so.
Rashid, we don't want to separate him.
They drew on the ground with chalk.
Iron is abundant in the universe.
They said, "This teacher has a shaky personality, he's going to ruin it for all of us."
I tell them the old story of the cat.
Maryam returned
And after the previous one, this one is new, no one told me
Ketua lah gersah katjib kameleh on the chair
He sat down
And he knew nothing about the past
A dry day, they will play on it in the school yard.
Bask عاد
Translation: Tomorrow, the manager you work with will call me.
But we will give him a chance.
Because I want to tell you something
The time of kindness and weakness is over.
O my cousin, O Abdullah.
Rached will go to a different hole
And I don't need to remind you of the important educational saying
You are a graduate of education and I am a graduate of education.
And we all keep the saying.
The teacher is the son of the first lesson
Raa'a at-Jawfown A'a'd Ra'a'd al-Qua'i'd
And I want to be wrong
Woe unto him
As soon as I tried to talk, he told me to shut up.

Who among you is the one who is making noise and said shut up, good one.
You are the one who told me to shut up, okay?
No, it's not me.
That's not what you're doing, is it?
Go to the manager's office.
And he said, Professor Rashid fired me
Mabee ajof raq'ah waheek ahni sam'ee
Actions speak louder than words.
The expected is not just the first day, it's the whole year.
Woe unto him
The one who hears his voice
And I explain and I don't talk
Do you know what I mean?
Nervous, you know what nervous means?
It means nervous
You heard me, I said yes or no.
I have heard about him.

Oh God, take your anger and leave
Take your time
Oh my god, it's great.
Of course, I'm still looking for it.
We didn't see any teacher.

Mum, from my eyes
You say that God is pleased with you.
Do you know the difference between a boy from a wealthy family and an ordinary boy?
The ticks look like this: red spots.
Come on, where are you going?
In the bathroom
And when it is time in the bathroom
Knock on the door quickly and say, "The first portion is starting in 10 minutes, by Allah, quickly."
I am all of them before one juice and one plaster.
I took them all before I needed my friend Abdulrahman. He's really good for health.
Now go to Saud and get the PlayStation tape from him.
What do we learn from this story?
Man is a social being.
He must possess the virtues of good character.
This is the PlayStation money and he said, "I'll give you the whole PlayStation back to you once."
Inshallah, Tamer will do something after my friend Abdulrahman, my friend.
Now, yes
We learn from the story
Of course you know I'm leaving this week because I got the approval for my higher studies.
I said I must submit the event file before I leave.
How did Abdulrahman say? He told me he didn't know where he wanted to go, but he didn't specify the time.
Madam, his father is traveling and he didn't say anything, thank God, I thought he was safe.
For sure I gave it to him today afternoon and he got angry and didn't say his father's right, no, no, no, no, no.
Hello my friend Abdulrahman.

What's the matter?
Sweet, sweet, indeed

What did you ask me to do with my eyes?
Master, Master, how do you ask Master Mike?
In the master's walk, he answers the student's water, his bed is not like that, this issue will not go over well, I will write it in the report.
You think you're also joking
Do not raise your voice or scream at anyone or else you will not be heard.

I and you
What we said is nonsense.
What is that
Listen, things are going well, it's much better for you.
What threatens us?
What's the need and I want to relax you
You are the one who says such things.

We're going to see Mr. Bouanif to remember, not to support.
This is Rashid, who acts in the village as he pleases.
You made me talk
Alright guys, be quiet and listen to what Mr. Bouanif has to say.
Now this guy, who doesn't care about a single penny, plays with your nerves.
Leave me alone.
If you give him a hand, he will stick to the umbrella he made yesterday.
The game is played with its people.
That's nice.
With the best of luck.
For now, I haven't seen anything.
You know he has a jewelry store.

I am looking for a job that made me laugh, by God, it made me laugh.
It doesn't save the job in the pocket
Thank you, you did a great job, keep it up.
Send him your regards.
Ey Ka, after Allah, your mother has sent her greetings to you. May Allah send his blessings upon you.
Aye, bye bye my love, in the safety of God.
After your brother gets arrested and becomes a minister, you'll believe it, eh?
Well, Mom, we're working on something heavy.
But my father, if you don't do your job, they won't say anything.
But that's what I gave you
Ey, it's nothing, it's normal.
Our automatic machines need words
My love, enough, make my dream come true
Before I had a dream, my dream was
Reserve me a tower in the Corniche towers
Oh God, wait for me.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Kadah, Yabo Saleh
I say, your friend looks annoying.
By God, it's not clear on him, brother.
You are a good man, Boussaleh.
I believe that he stole the phone and gave it to Boosaleh.
Look at these moves and of course, I'll give Sultan a million bucks for it.
Initially, his relationship with Zaynah was fine with Bou-Salah.
No, Boss, I don't think so, I'm not planning anything.
Practical, it's back to the drawing board.
I opened the car door for him.
The minister's car's brakes are not working.
Oh, oh, don't break my heart, don't break my heart.
The news about the murder we hear in the cafes has become a thing in the country.
But I don't believe the person I'm listening to.
My heart is stopped. My heart is stopped.
I'm afraid, mother, that I might fall in the hands of the women, or that I might be forced to carry the plates, mother, and I've been humiliated among the women.
Say something, O Boussultan, and I will be amazed in the morning.
Please, I know what I did wrong.
Limited edition.
I am sitting working on a low flame.
Because I opened the door for him, this is the beginning of the plan in my head.
I should be the minister, not him.
Let me work, I have a plan.
Let them take it.
Any plan
But he must trust me at the beginning.
They told me his eyes are like a minister's because he was appointed two months before you.
I think I took it and left it
Magic can undo
Sunday
Shenayi-ye digar-bord.
And any activity prohibited by photographers will result in his photo being burned in the newspaper.
The smell of it will rise to the surface.
Of course, I'll do it.
You be patient, let me work on it and I’ll get it done.
On the contrary, long-lived
Of course, the minister is happy.
Then come and tell me
He thanked him for the sheep, because it had good meat.
The riyal at the door, people are coming for it.
I won't become a people's favorite if you want me to treat you and you want to make yourself smaller.
The minister just said, please, please.
No, no, I don't imagine myself as the minister's assistant, just as a picture of the minister's assistant.
Offer it in the second, give it
By God, brother, I really like your plan.
You want a car in it

Honesty is revealed.
This minister of yours is a lazy man, apparently he liked the past.
Dumb to you, my brother Saad.
No, by Allah, I did not follow any activity today nor did I read the newspapers, I have no idea.
Bless you, bye bye, goodbye.
God will make the ant disappear and give it wings.
Hello brother, is there a conference at the hotel tonight?
Wedding
Afa means a lot, it means there is no activity, a birthday party, a wedding.
I don't know, but you might see the hotel we're in.
Oh, there's a hotel behind you.
Please leave me in the car and go to the hotel, ask
Take your time, ask, rest, soul
Everyone will agree, God willing.
This minister lets us sleep and rest
It means that he has no party, no wedding, or any occasion to celebrate it.
15,000 hotels and we still can't find a lucky one like you.

One asks the other, and the other says, "Today, they put a lot of pictures of the minister in the newspaper."
The winner will receive a prize.
It's been like that before, you come and get the coffee and listen to the comments every day about the pictures in the newspaper, they say, "Haji, I will never stop."

We told Amieh, "This is your son, Mahalod, and you are his mother."
What you have is second life, eternity, and workers, only workers and eternity.

Look, I'll tell you if my father finds out about you.
I say to you, Khalid, heal Khalid.
Saud says that Kholood puts on makeup and dresses up like a girl from heaven six months ago, six months ago.
But but but you, Saud
He puts on makeup and on her, Khalid, the anti-makeup, and he saw the goti makeup and played with it.

Okay, the most beautiful and delicate.

Please let me out of my room.
Oh, the loss, oh, the eternity
I fell out of my eyes
Oh my God, don't hurt my feelings, you know, I'm telling the truth, my mother.
This is my son and I know him well.
Therefore, O Khulood, O Naseer, O my eyes, I wish all the people had sent him a message and expressed their feelings.
And you may think that he is a thin and gentle man, but I say to you, my daughters,
Fault, fault, you shouldn't say this about your brother.
But again, you've made the past bigger and it's insignificant, it's small.

When he left the responsibility of the house and children to the mother
We don't want to dig into the past.
My father said yes or no
But I'm going to
Transfer the Bluetooth to him
But I won't give it to him.
I see my father's shock, I'm going to leave
It's a bit weird.
Whatever it is, A'mel.
He knows about us through us.
It is better than what is known through others.

Comrade Dash, inside our house, there is no one who buys hours.
At the beginning of the match, you were really scared and it was noticeable on you.
But they are afraid of what, they are afraid that our team won't score goals
We want more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were terrified, afraid of the opposing team.
I'm not scared of the opposing team, I'm scared of our team. I'm afraid I won't score more than three.
This is our team's level, I know it, I'm talking about our team's level.
I have great confidence in you.
The opposing team has nothing.
Beautiful foxes, I want to say that you have advanced with the first goal.
Where are you going?

Dear viewers, we have one of the most famous fans of the Foxes team, known as Tharlob.
But the important thing is that they say you won because they are short-handed.
This is in the talk, this is in the talk, there is no beauty
What is missing? This is a very good team, a team with ten people.

All talk, no action.
When this man fled in the words of foxes
This is inside a high-flying plane.
This is a fair supporter.
See my brother
He received it excitedly.
Please, go ahead, my dear.
Hopes for the Indian boy who breaks the ball.
I don't see him for any period of time
Oh uncle, I have a big grudge against you, and I won't stay here anymore.
The friend I saw for how many days I didn't know, he was at a coffee shop here in Flagio, his name is Starbox.
I remember that friend was counting with us, but the owner of the café didn't have a tea cup.
Da adame eyni ada alwalad ishrin riyal bashish.
What did he do like that
He is negotiating with the club's senior officials, so they are not making any decisions with him.
I say Thulub

On the day of our match with them
Enough, enough, Thagob, say it, say it, this is a poem, say it, say it.
My mother, oh Allah, in the secret world, I am.
This is the same money I am finding the same
I don't sleep much at night.
Do you know that we are a Foxes fans association?
It means you can't tell me Fayez's name so that I can beat the journalist first.
We have a press conference and God willing we will announce the winner's name there.
The one with the beauty
The famous Thualob, a fan who was honored today by the administration of the Foxes Club in a very kind gesture and a very beautiful initiative.
By Allah
Thousands of congratulations on this beautiful honor and certainly a wonderful gift.
I say to you, this is in a pen or in a bag.

I say to you, it is
You are late.
I don't know when the matches are, my friend.
Now, how do we catch him?
We just have to wait and see when the Foxes play the next game.
There is a thing that I forgot
Zain, we can't catch up with him.
Brother, you're late.
There is, there is, there is, there is
The right of the right of the

What did you say, Walid?
And I, and I, I walk the bag's path in it.
Oh God, let's go back to the old days again.
People of the spirit of your room, people
God protects, but.
God protect.
Come back, your father understands this talk now.
Before my father knew.
A million pieces shattered.
Let's go and buy another one like it as soon as possible.
Before I say goodbye to my father
And whoever submits to you, O mother, is submitting to Allah.
Do you know your father? If he gets angry, he becomes like the Minon.
You are the soul of your room and do not leave it.
What else is there
By mistake, I hit the vase, and it fell and broke.
Mama, I'm scared for him.
I don't know where it went.
La la la, this is his father, he's not awake.
You shouldn't do that, the boy is like that, Mom.
Amzighen qalbu amkhar'ayn'ah tubun at'in'nun h'ali'ahl h'adhi.
I say, Mom
You are going to kill him, so where is the boy going?
So if you want to, just buy a phone
God protect.
My aunt, I know where Walid went.
Come on, I'll replace it, where is it going?
Oh my god, oh my god
Akah Ahni
The one who gives me your hand, I won't go home.
I'm scared of you
I haven't dried the vase.
I don't know what God knows.
That's what your father God gave you, your head.
Come, mother.
I'm not afraid, you can come in, I'm home, okay?
I have the solution.
What we said, O Bu Waleed
Your student asked you, O Walid.
For you, I forgive you this time.
I see you at home
WinHoe is WinDelf
Wineh is Wineh.
Translation: "Alright, Abu, Walid, don't be afraid, your father didn't do anything to you yesterday."
Of course, it's beautiful.
Oh, how beautiful, oh
By leaving it, I fear someone from the poor will take it and break it.
He said to me, "I want to be alone like the one who broke it, Walid."
Exactly, he wants to go back, I went and all I found was this last one in the store, it's a strong moment, and oh well, where are the others?
In the room, they study.
Oh God, protect her.
But these values are based on.
Wow
Okay, come on, study.
Yes, this is the game and we are going to do it
Yabeh walli islimak la atqool haq ummi.
Yeah, I don't say your brother's truth, last time, by God, yeah.
Call him.
And you specifically make a mistake on your friend in the coffee, I am.
Brooke, if my brother finds out about you.
I'm not connected to this phone, so I'm hiding, madam, I'm hiding.
Mama, why don't you take his right as a doctor?
God guide you, mother.
The Amazigh heart is broken and frightened by the many things he has endured.
Poor boy
You are
Mama, where is my mom? I don't see her today.
We wanted to go with her
My sister, this doesn’t fill me up.
Wow, Mom, what happened to Salfa Amnarah with her son Naif.
Her son was born at the age of Waleed Allah, may He protect him.
The same length
Yesterday she told me, I don't know what to do with her son.
Waad drove the hospital car but Reel was Yusuf.
Yesterday, about the past

He says, "How did you not tell me?"
This is a psychological case.
The boy was forced to have Ebola
He takes his son and ties him to the hoosh.
Then he says to him, "Do it again, and sleep in your bed."
You are sitting and teaching in a ruin.

Eat in peace.
I'm just lucky.

Otherwise, I will kill you from the weather.
Oh God, turn on the shower, wash before your father comes and fixes it for you.
What I have to do is me.
It's forbidden for the poor
Sitting, they are shouting, they are arguing.
I'm afraid I'll become something to my children.

I am nervous.
What they dropped out of was most successful.
Why did you take them to their uncle?
We shot 48 out of 50.
Why don't we get 50 out of 50?

God bless you for giving him the testimony.

Greetings to you live and welcome to a new episode of the program Beyond Borders.
Oil accounts for more than 35% of the total different energy sources.
While the rest goes to natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.
Therefore, oil is the primary source of energy in the world.
The Arab Gulf countries and Iran alone possess 868 billion barrels.
Iran with 12%, then Iraq with 10%, Kuwait and the UAE with 9% follow.
For each of them, then comes Venezuela with a percentage of seven percent.
Then Russia with a percentage of five percent.
Following the translation of the original text, the translation of the given text is: "So the Gulf countries and Iran make up two-thirds of the world's reserves."
To unprecedented prices and exceeded one hundred and nine dollars for the first time in its history
In this episode, we try to understand many of the complexities of oil
And the problems faced by the exporting countries are:
Despite the huge increase in its price
And the problems that citizens and residents of these countries face.
Due to inflation and unprecedented rise
The following will appear on the screen or write to us via our website on the internet WWW.aljazirah.net
For today the market is the main factor
And the producing countries are not.
The market power is what determines the price.
And OPEC is not.
Of course, supply and demand have a part, of course.
But other factors
Other factors are political tensions.
In the world
And real estate markets
and the LLL Poles and others markets
And they headed towards the prices of the umbrellas.
In the Comoros, including oil, for example.
And tomorrow, it will reach $1, God knows.
Oil in February 2014 jumped from $44 to $44
And today we see that even oil prices
It fluctuates from day to day.
Oil prices dropped below $90.
And it rose in the second quarter
Especially with the arrival of spring, two of the world's refineries enter the maintenance period.
Always in relation to the second quarter.
The seasonal demand for oil is decreasing.
In winter, it drops below 90.
And all of this indicates that speculation has power and control over the market now.
Reta Kezera Eḥna Lamā Narjū al-Sūq al-Tradīḑī fī al-Maẕī.
The market was affected by supply and demand.
The LLL Al Arradh Al Talab Al Musami
Today we see economic growth.
Today or yesterday, General Fallon, the commander of the Central Region in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
His resignation sparked a huge reaction due to its relation to the so-called upcoming American war.
Political or geopolitical effects
It affects the oil market in a way that is either negative or positive, meaning very quickly.
The effect may certainly come to him, and he will have his effects.
Even the politicians react with political wagers.
The one who may confirm says that some of them may say that the American war on Iran is coming.
Here's what the market will be like: the market is bullish.
Question in the shadow of His Excellency the Deputy Prime Minister, now in the shadow of the White House
This brought the area back to a tense atmosphere.
This is the camel spider.
But perhaps Falun saw this scenario
A very rapid reflection is reflected on the oil market
Today we prove with numbers that there is no shortage.
Let me give you an example in the last seven weeks.
In the United States, oil reserves have increased to more than the average of the past five years.
Today, I mean, I mean, I say
And not even for the coming war, because today I tell you that even the world has a limited stock.
Even today, global consumption, look at any country in the world, there is a long line or queue in front of petrol stations.
This is another thing.
What is the danger this poses to
What number do you expect? I have no idea, it could be
Might be three hundred dollars, might be less, but
If these tensions reach a boiling point, they could lead to real tensions.
Because, as you said, the Gulf accounts for sixty percent.
In a country that is far away from oil-producing countries.
See the impact is coming in the opposite direction on the oil market
It can reach up to three hundred dollars.
And they moved from stocks and others to the oil market today, look above two trillion or trillion dollars.
Today we are watching Brent.
Yesterday, oil prices rose above $100 a barrel, which means that...
These tensions in the region and the anticipation of
April, as previously stated, is the month to launch this war.
"By Allah, Allah knows best, I did not mean my generation."
In the area because the L.L. is now
Year by year, it is an election year.
The current American administration has been in place for only a few months.
George H. W. Bush waged war on Somalia and sent thirty thousand Qandil in his last days at the White House.
We see and do not anticipate events
But I don't expect this scenario to be
Because this is a very expensive scenario.
You won't pay anything. It's you, the Iranians, and the consuming countries who will pay.
America Today
Now it is dependent on African oil and has many alternatives.
Look, let's talk clearly.
You said in the introduction of your article that sixty percent of the population
From oil reserves
But now they import twenty-two
Their oil comes from West Africa.
From West Africa, and whatever they import from any region in the world
Oil production
Because this is a difficult number and proven precautions and precautions
On the so-called deep water or on the discovery or on the sea production from the great depths
The Navy, and therefore the Gulf, will remain a difficult number
and Caspian Sea oil
I consider it like dreams because it is not reality and true.
They will ruin it and destroy it.
The important thing means there
Today, Qatar is the world's largest exporter of energy.
The issue is that these countries are a difficult number
There and the needs of countries for energy
It certainly means that there is something called security in supply security
Despite internal opposition in the United States, even at the level of General Fallon.
But there are still concerns.
From the President Bush to do so
He noted that the political risks did not come from the Gulf countries.
It means that I don't, no, no, no, it's not a matter of generosity because we don't have anyone who deals with generosity, we don't.
No, I don't deal with a lot of generosity.
But it's not in my article.
We are not part of any charitable work.
Or, please be so kind as to
But generosity with Westerners is not with anyone else.
Specifically with America
Win the market
Where will we go for our economic return?
We will not
Like oil and gas
You put it in for the generosity and
I have the proof.
I have the proof.
No more than sixty to seventy dollars
Not the rise in prices
But the decline of the dollar that you insist on is not the only factor.
You are primarily Gulf and OPEC.
Export must be in dollars and you refuse
Change the currency despite the currency collapsing
Although the return is not in your favor.
No, I am not 70 years old.
But the experts' words are not my own.
Okay, the dollar fell by 35% and oil prices rose above this decline.
If we take the year of measurement as 2004, it means...
I see that oil prices were ranging between $53 and $63.
It means, of course, it means
The price of oil has increased
But the increase is slight, said the deputy.
It means that if we take them
We consider her to be the one now.
Even at these prices
It means that if we compare it to 2014.
Even the rate of the dollar's decline has been exceeded.
The exciting LLM
It reacts to the decline of the dollar
Every time the dollar falls, oil prices rise.
This is also something the market started to give him a feeling of.
My current priority is to reduce costs.
No, the situation has changed. Maybe it was in the beginning of the decline two years ago, this was said, but the situation has changed and there is now
The dollar began to lose its value against major currencies such as the euro, yen, and pound sterling.
The question here is why you insist on tying your currency to the dollar.
Its value is weakening and it has no cover.
This is a historical period.
Petroleum and its derivatives in dollars, as well as European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
It states that America was in the middle of the 1970s.
The gold cover that was for the US currency was canceled
This is not correct.
What is the correct first aid?
The OPEC organization includes
Four Gulf countries
Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia
Today, OPEC's share in the global market
Forty percent
Today, if we take the world consumes eighty-five million barrels
Waha deals with the dollar in pricing its oil.
If you were to work in another field, everyone would.
You cannot do that.
All oil-exporting countries must agree
From adults
Those with 66% of the world's reserves are the big ones.
Tiat, but I took it as an export.
Venezuela, Libya, and Iran are among them.
Cameroon, Angola, and Equatorial Guinea are the countries organized under the OPEC.
The market's daily shares do not exceed forty percent.
It is produced and exported from countries outside OPEC.
And this cannot be given to the owner of the forty percent.
You cannot do it yourself unless
In countries that tried but failed
Attempt is not my real identity
You are rejecting because of the ties with America.
From Dora to his other work
All oil-exporting countries
How many barrels of oil are imported per day?
They are the losers when he is the one who issues the ISIS.
His currency has risen significantly.
He sells his oil in dollars.
Now, the bank has no money or the receiver receives it by taking his money in dollars and then converting it to his local currency.
His currency is not tied to the dollar.
True, but it is
But your problem is also that you sell in dollars and your currency is not linked to the dollar, you don't have a problem.
Here is my important question now.
What is anxiety and the impact it causes if your work is related to the dollar in the face of a falling dollar.
It has been associated for a long time
Especially in the 1970s when the dollar was a very strong currency and had a lot of power.
This detachment is not easy.
The paint is easy
No, here No
Divorce has costs.
There are interests of these countries and not against them.
Profit and loss
Dojins announced in its publication yesterday that there are four countries, Qatar is one of them.
But there is also a report from the Gulf Finance House that says there are four Gulf countries because of course Oman has left the unified Gulf currency.
I read the statement in Dungeons and I don't think it's a real statement.
The Qatari Central Bank Governor denied
Yes, he said, and he will study, but also all the Gulf countries must
You must study profit and loss in a thorough manner without emotions, as I said.
Let's leave it to the L.L. to leave it to the study and even until they come.
Jawf ba'd jib jib lak 'iktiyadiin 'aykul 'fik fi badra'sah 'ikra'nah
This study reflects
Lobal House is a simple, well-organized thing that was released in a report on March 8th.
Apple only four days
Global House The solution is simple and requires a political decision.
The political decision is summarized in two points.
Need number one cannot be ignored.
About its intention or the five and Kuwait about its intention in two thousand and ten to issue the currency or study the issuance of the unified Gulf currency.
The second point is that a decision must be made to break the link with the dollar.
First, regarding the unified currency.
In my personal opinion
To see the unified Gulf currency
The currency, the currency when this currency will be strong
You will be You will be
Perhaps one of the strongest currencies in the world, as you say.
And behind it are precautions and behind them are huge revenues.
So, this is what the Prime Minister focused on when he said, "اهوه ما ركز عليه معالي رئيس الوزراء عندما قال"
These Gulf countries because no country can stand alone
Only with a stronger economic content.
And the economic bloc today, even the euro today, I see it.
But you must not forget that the central bank has a very important role.
The evaluation is as follows:
Profit and loss account
From all these news
A tense situation
Fen and Tammany, as observers say, Global House said that inflation will continue.
For a long time in the Gulf countries, but the solution is in the hands of the governments.
Some countries have raised salaries to 70% like the UAE.
In order to stop the inflation process that
And this is my question now, when will you increase the salaries of the poor people in Qatar?
And hear your answer after a short break
About today's topic: oil reserves and daily production of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
She has a reserve of 64 billion dead.
Two out of ten barrels
And it takes 92 out of 100 daily.
1,5 million and 2,7 million of 10 million.
Qatar: 12.2 billion and 550,000 Oman: 6.5 billion and 770,000
Bahrain has a population of 1,550,000 and 35,000 tourists.
The total revenue for the year was 38 billion.
3,000 to 7,000
In Europe, one hundred billion
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion
In Asia and other countries
However, the total GDP of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries was 267,113 in 2006.
The total output in 177999.7 billion is expected.
In 2018, 9.11 billion
However, the high inflation is eating away at the salaries of employees and workers who live in this region.
It will increase from two thousand and eighty to three thousand and eighty of ten
Kuwait 14th in the world, forecast in 2028, 89.8 out of 100, UAE
Ten Saudi women who were supposed to be six and a half will now be six.
Ten out of ten
Salaries are being devoured.
What are the amounts and percentages that you will increase the salary of the employees here?
If we want to solve the problem
With real treatment
Salaries always, salary increases always
It is not the solution.
I am not against increasing salaries.
True, this is not correct.
We are always
In fact, I believe
The issue of increasing inflation and lack of control over inflation will lead to inflation eating up all these increases.
To address inflation, a high committee consisting of all experts and specialists is formed.
And now this committee is putting
Because of the increase in salaries around the world
And the golden economic rule, of course, says
It will have no end.
And no matter what
Salaries have increased, no matter how much they have increased
Inflation will increase
Treatment is required and must
In a scientific study, the employment-specialized institution, Beit.com, conducted a study in collaboration with the British research organization, YouGov Siraj.
They surveyed 15,000 employees working in the Gulf countries in 20 important sectors.
Especially experts and job seekers are not satisfied with their jobs.
Inflation is eating away
Less than those with experience.
They are thinking of moving from these countries where inflation is eating away at them.
You will now lose
This is the easy idea, meaning that you put the easy idea and try to apply it.
The relationship of inflation is the increase of salaries
Parallelism in the subject exists.
Exists and
We are keen and the state and the government are keen to the utmost.
This issue needs to be treated with real treatment.
Always temporary treatments do not solve the problem, but increase it.
It means it increases it
Please stay for a little longer until this committee is set up.
All the applications
Here is a problem and you are the deputy's relief.
Fatigue will always be
Hiyah, but the state also tried and raised the 40% increases.
There is a very important point in the subject of increases.
In the matter of increases, you only increase Qataris, and non-Qataris work for Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
You care about Qataris and not about expatriates.
And it is the high percentage in it.
Ahmed, you live in Qatar, not in Germany.
You talk about this topic and suffer
Salaries of the highest officials in the government sector are much higher.
And conversely, we saw
In the government sector
And the government sector became
Ban, the best elements and competencies have become
Also, I read a report and we know that in QF the oil sector
For the workers
We are like experts when we are like experts we have
Engineers and workers who come from outside Qatar
And because we also interact with the global market
For each of these things, there is a percentage increase in salaries.
And hope is with Allah, but we say
There is a plan by the government
I say controlling inflation is more important
From timely treatment
I will see, and I am sure
There will be a ban there
Positive results
You will be within 10%.
The sweet is asking you for 22 billion oil and 34 billion gas.
No comment. We are the client, not the client's husband.
The process and of course we
The economic growth also means that it must be reflected on people.
And of course, any economic growth today, Qatar is the highest economic growth in the world
And vice versa
The large belts in the country are also part of it.
Unless for this huge conveyor and huge projects.
The country also did not have a part of the inflation
It also led to a part of the inflation
This also led to an increase in liquidity in the market.
Firstly, regarding the dollar's relation to oil.
Oil was mortgaged in exchange for protection from the enemy.
In the United States of America, therefore, stability in governance is something that means
Thank you.
Saad Alghamdi from Saudi Arabia, your question, Saad.
Peace be upon you and the mercy of God and His blessings.
The truth is that the episode means success and a good title.
What I would like to address is that the region is now under the policy of America.
America's policy in its current war, in addition to the cultural war it is waging against Islam, there is a global economic war.
In Yimwan, China
The American deficit with Japan also reached 61 billion dollars.
Also, Japan had invested in the year 2000.
With America, it is equivalent to nine
$1 billion while it is now investing with the European Union more than $27 billion.
In line with American politics and making the dollar a necessary currency for the whole world
My brother, I say that buying now
The Gulf region will become the most important area for the world's energy needs.
KKK means K K K place
Thank you, brother Saad.
Mohamed Al-Waseef from Egypt
Hello, the deputy is with you.
The deputy's haste reminds me of the Arab rulers in the Middle East region.
When there is
When there are congestions or demands for price adjustment.
Salary adjustment, salary adjustment in terms of prices, as you have kindly offered.
"So in Qatar, we consider you to be a model."
And determined not to preach about the increase, this is an Arabic style
We want Qatar, which is considered Abu Adreika in comparison.
He is a man of his word, he says what he wants. Do you have a question? Do you have a question? It is his right, of course, he is responsible for this policy.
Question first
The black deputy must take into account
One two to interact with public opinion
With the umbrella, as you have kindly offered, because they are the people who should receive care.
Arab rulers who don't care about the poor
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you.
I want to send two messages to you and one to Al-Aqeel
I want a raise in salary too
Salaries are excellent and good, good, good.
"May Allah bless and keep you safe. As for the subject we need to work on, we need to make its meanings."
With the glove and always, God willing, there will be no glove in Qatar and we are confident.
And the ruling makes it so that Qatar, as it said, the money goes to the ruling family and the ruler.
The following is the important question now.
Oh, let's answer the brothers.
He cannot rule.
What happens to this wealth?
Now there are entire new cities, like Lusail and other places, which are almost like pearls, meaning even Qatar has started to expand.
This is not the issue, this is the issue itself.
Adequate urban plan
In short, because we have only two minutes left, we will go to Qatar.
Qatar is now a post-oil and gas Qatar.
There is of course a clear policy for the state.
Because he is not.
A conserved wealth
For a watchful wealth
Therefore, today the trend in the State of Qatar is
The capital of the Middle East in education
Today we see that the city is a cultural and educational city.
Today, this educational city includes the best universities in the world.
Establishing medical cities, media cities, and financial cities
For today, oil and gas are not
Yes, of course, we do not copy anyone.
Other satellite channels and
The island is not the only thing, you will make a thousand islands and you will not be able to bear the island.
Because, my brother, these countries are our countries in the Gulf now.
In the 1970s, the boom. Now everyone remembers the 1970s boom.
Today, today, we see growth in Qatar.
And this also requires a special episode about post-oil Qatar.
Our vision about oil, its future, and its wealth in the region, especially in Qatar. In conclusion, I convey my regards to you, the program team.
This is Ahmed Mansoor, greetings without limits, peace be upon you and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you and the mercy of God and His blessings.
Greetings to you all live this week from the Qatari capital Doha.
Welcome to a new episode of Beyond Borders.
At the time, Qatar hosts the largest US military base outside the United States, which is the Al Udeid Air Base.
With the enemies of the United States in the region
Like Iran and Syria
Her doors are open to leaders
However, Hamas leaders enjoy special relations with the Qatari leadership.
As the Emir of Qatar was the only Arab leader
The one who visited the southern suburb of Beirut, which was destroyed by Israel during its war on Lebanon in the summer of 2006.
Unlimited support for rebuilding what Israel destroyed in Lebanon
And the time when Qatar reconciled and the time when Qatar reconciled
With her older sister, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, H, about two years ago.
At the same time, there were clashes with the regime in Egypt.
Like the Lebanon file, where it succeeded where others failed.
A gathering of Lebanese leaders in Doha, where they signed an agreement that led them to safety.
To the last elections
As for the stubborn files
She wanted to be the driving force behind these files, not Qatar.
The smallest Arab country
And in today's episode
We are trying to understand the principles and rules that Qatar's foreign policy is based on.
For the benefit of whom?
The small Qatar, geographically and in terms of population, is playing these big roles.
What are the qualifications that enable her
This was in a direct conversation with the Prime Minister and the Qatari Minister of Foreign Affairs.
For viewers who wish to participate, they can call the program's phone numbers that will appear on the screen one by one.
The visit by the Emir of Qatar
The roar of the guns of Al Jazeera Channel is a desire to improve relations with Saudi Arabia.
From the past, there was an attempt by a Saudi coup against the Emir of Qatar in collaboration with members of the Al-Marrah tribe.
In its issue that was published on the 20th of June last
What is the nature of the secret deal?
In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
Many of the things that are not things
I think it's accurate.
Flour, I always say in more than one interview here in this program.
And we consider it the backbone.
The Gulf Cooperation Council
There was a misunderstanding.
Then he said
And the difference in points of view
The border incident is true and this was a major obstacle.
Saudi-Qatari historical relations are special relations
These relationships, if we look at them, are very interesting.
Between the two families and the two countries
Shabah Shabah ba'az su'oof al-fahm
Neither before us nor before them
For there are no conditions between brothers
And now the relations are in a position that I can confirm is very excellent.
For the benefit of the Cooperation Council
But how was Al Jazeera's situation with Saudi Arabia resolved? That was the obstacle or the reason that led to the year 2000.
At a crucial point
And I repeat to you, if I went back to all the programs, I would always say
Not only the elder sister, but I said that we rely on the Cooperation Council in the following:
Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
And we give importance to our relations with them.
There was a media exchange and this was clear to both parties.
These countries found themselves
Failed when the brothers agreed
The Qatari-Saudi private house
Rather, they found that the most important thing was to enter into a dispute
They have neither a camel nor a donkey in it.
And I don't think it was a strategy from anyone who entered this dispute.
But Sheikh, let me, let me here in this context so that the things or points are above the letters.
Many observers believe that Al Jazeera has been biased in the last two years.
At the time when the conditions that were criticized on Al Jazeera's screen were still ongoing
Before the situation inside Saudi Arabia
Whether the arrested people, the opponents, or others, the list still exists.
The Al Jazeera channel has stopped discussing these issues.
Until the covering of the island in Hajj
In praise of the system and what the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is doing at a time that contradicts
What I see first is that you can ask the island administration about this matter, don't ask me because I am not the one to ask.
The two countries are gathering
Stability of the region
This strategy continued and strengthened the stability of the region first.
The region refers to the Gulf region.
Gulf region
There are many issues affecting the Gulf region.
Also, the call of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Kuwait.
It had an impact on the entire community and the entire Arab world.
He spoke from his heart about settling Arab disputes, moving beyond them, and burying them.
It doesn't just mean in terms of views
No, they are policies and policies are perspectives.
The Arab world considers this to be a serious matter.
A type of war
While the developed world
You are talking about the same interest
Now you have been left for several years
The current situation is the current situation
Look first
There is a complete difference between this subject and that subject.
The idea that a small country can beat the big ones and make them feel weak in front of it.
Every disagreement or misunderstanding
It had its reasons.
And its causes ended
It ended with the commanders' verdict.
Are there any guarantees for the future relationship?
There are guarantees between the two parties.
Based on the love, brotherhood, and interests that unite the two countries.
And the leaders' words are considered more than a document.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship
And we expect a lot of this Qatari-Saudi relationship to develop.
For the best and there will be large areas
This relationship, like our B model with other Arab countries, is with other Gulf countries.
Regarding Qatar, an important country
Saudi Arabia is an important country.
Egypt, in relation to Qatar, is what country, because it was noticed at the same time that you reconciled with Saudi Arabia.
Three organizations are Hezbollah
Al Jazeera is a channel.
Or the system in Egypt, the largest Arab country
First, let me start with the following:
The Egyptian people
We respect the Egyptian people
And her interest
With many Arabic remnants and the sacrifices of the Egyptian people.
And this is a case
Someone believes that this is an issue through which we want to enter a gateway for understanding or not understanding with the brothers in Egypt.
In the shadow of this, in the shadow of the fact that you are coming, we respect Egypt and the Egyptian people.
We believe that Ahwa is a good person.
We disagree with Egypt on two points.
Or a dot
We told him that we had prepared for the coup in Gaza and I don't believe that.
And we do not enter
In cases concerning other countries
Do not interfere in the affairs of any state unless there is room for reform.
It means that there was no intervention from you in the coup that Hamas carried out against the authority in Gaza.
Of course, we didn't know about this until the rest of the media did.
Yes, we have relations with Hamas and we have relations with all parties.
What made Egypt different or have a disagreement with you on this point?
This is coming to me.
Hezbollah conspiracy
Hezbollah conspiracy and also
But I am talking about my country.
This subject surprised us greatly.
If it vibrates for the benefit of Qatar
The Pyramids of Giza
The Pyramids said, "Connect."
To undermine Egypt and its status
It is possible to return
Mowjooh, we go back to the conspiracy they said about.
The days will reveal this matter
The beginning is not from the Gaza conference.
And I absolve the Egyptian people of it, I absolve President Hosni Mubarak of it.
If we go back a long way to the MENA conference
After the Madrid Conference, the MENA that was held in Doha is remembered.
This was an agreement for when the conference convened with us.
They said that we do not want to hold the conference.
Hey guys, we know you have coordination with Israel
From Qatar, this is.
What we want to understand is what
We sat down and talked, and the conversation was always nice.
It has two parts.
What are they
In disagreement
In political terms
We went to the Gaza conference that happened
His Royal Highness the Prince spoke with all the presidents, including his brother, His Excellency President Hosni Mubarak.
We received it from a foreign country
The brothers in Egypt have a view on this subject that what is being held
And they kill people while we watch.
If you want to hold a meeting in the university, we can hold it anywhere in the Arab University.
It is shameful that on the sidelines of the Kuwait conference, I discuss a case
By Israel and the Western world, standing by and watching the issue
When we came, we said, "Okay, now this is going to happen, and there is nothing we can do. We Arabs cannot stop it. Neither a major state stopped this fighting."
Egypt announces request for ceasefire in Gaza after Abbas calls for a ceasefire
Even we
We must not take the Arab street lightly. This is our disagreement with the Brotherhood on a single point.
And this is in international customs.
And their hospitals are not enough doctors, they stopped at the borders
You stood at the border
There is and no one would enter
The Brotherhood was very sensitive to this issue.
The reason for the sensitivity is that Gaza is adjacent to Egypt and is considered part of national property.
When we talk about any humanitarian issue anywhere in the world, we are talking about a humanitarian issue.
And we respect the sovereignty of Egypt
And I know the situation, but this does not affect the Egyptian situation.
We hope for a lot in Egypt
It is the largest Arab country
And we believe you can convey our voice and the voice of others in the Arab world.
For all other parties
Even the rescue operation after the quake
The one the Europeans tried to save
What happened in Gaza from the conference
Whether it is a donor conference or I consider it a rescue for the government.
We were invited to a conference, we were invited to coordinate between the GCC countries.
And we met in the Cooperation Council
These amounts will not be disbursed to any party.
But you will spend it.
For the affected parties in Gaza
Directly, and this was
Because entry is prohibited from all sides.
I am happy for Egypt and all the people of Qatar are happy for Egypt because Egypt
Egypt's victory in political matters is important to us.
But you are ahead of the game
Give me just two minutes.
One of the ministers boasted about what was saved and said
And whoever bids on Egypt here, we will break his neck and his arm.
I believe this official wronged his country.
No, they did not fail and they could not speak except about themselves, if we come to the truth.
This is what helped them, and I said the truth about our brothers in Saudi Arabia. I intervened because the king has his own judgment on this matter.
The things are going on in the Arab world
We agree.
The king decides that this is the best solution.
We accept the decision of King Abdullah because we respect and trust him.
But to say that one of them prevented us, even to insult those who prevented them.
They were like students in a school.
I believe this means that
The word
It is believed that Ahoh should be able to exert his power.
We are sorry for this matter.
If they believe that a smaller state has the right to withdraw from the right
You are entering, putting your nose in Darfur.
Decision in Arabic at the Arab University
African and a decision from the United Nations
I believe the main problem is
Hezbollah's conspiracy to clean Qatar
I don't know what conspiracy Qatar is.
It means that if it spreads, after swine flu, if it starts somewhere, it could be Qatar that spreads the epidemic.
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and its capabilities.
But Qatar has its own point of view.
Qatar has a separate policy
Qatar, if it can solve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor for us.
For there is no Arab dispute.
We believe that any Arab dispute weakens our position in front of our main issue, which is Palestine and other issues that we address.
The Arab world has become a recipient
Even our analyses became the same analyses
Western analysis
While Shana, we know we know what happened in Pakistan
"Indeed, I want someone to receive me and spread the red carpet in Washington."
Has anyone blamed Qatar?
Has Qatar offended any Arab country?
I tried to contribute money
These contributions are provocative.
What is possible is that I say "As-salamu alaykum" and you say "Wa'alaykumu s-salam" to annoy me.
This is a second case, meaning you have a problem or you have a deficiency.
This is a case that concerns you, not me.
But if you have an internal problem
I always say it.
And especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah
In Kuwait, I know this man, his father is honest.
A man says what he hides.
In his heart, lalalalala, this lalalalala, this is the kind of talk I always say.
This is what I always say.
I always say in the midst of our disagreement with Saudi Arabia, I used to say this.
And refer to the whole document you have in the island but
The case is different, no, no, no, no, no.
We said unilaterally that we will not stand at this position.
And we tried as much as we could
What I want to enter in this topic
I see their affairs, I see their mistakes, where
And we see our mistakes, it doesn't mean everything we have is right.
This is His Excellency the Sheikh
To the presence of internal problems in Egypt
They want to get out of it.
Denies Qatar's relation to any form of conspiracy against Egypt externally and cuts its relations with Turkey or other countries.
And God, we have a superpower
And they are, God willing, seventy million if we are able to do eighty.
They also have a problem that they need to solve.
You played a role in the Qandeel Shleyt case despite knowing that this file is an important file for the Egyptian government.
And I worked with the French.
We received a call from a friendly country
In the case, we saw that we said, oh brothers, this is what the Egyptians said.
We want to see this topic on demand.
By Israel and other countries, we will see a second party to see this issue.
When we saw this topic, we told them, "Brother, if the same conditions as the brothers who talk to the brothers in Egypt."
This announcement means that one official says we are essentially making fun of the entire Arab university.
And God, this means, means poor thing
What does it mean to pass it on to us?
President Mahmoud Abbas remains
And we gave this to him
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is with you guys
I think this is a health phenomenon.
I am not the owner of the island like I was accused.
The island needs to enter the media competition like there are many media entities in the West.
In many media outlets, it is common for teenagers to be constantly insulted.
But after a while they reach the stage of maturity.
Can, can, and cannot
First, we are with Saudi Arabia and our position is different.
And even if we give in to Saudi Arabia, we accept this in Qatar.
Important relationships
Egypt is an important country, but in terms of Saudi Arabia's relations, it is private.
Also, Egypt's privacy with any Arab state, Egypt is the largest and greatest state.
This is true. This is true, but with Saudi Arabia, it's a different story and a different relationship.
This is a personal dispute between officials here and there.
We respect the Egyptian President.
Please confine the disagreement to policies and points of view.
I'm telling you a problem when there was an attack on Gaza
The second problem is that they are sensitive to things that we have not yet discovered from anything Qatar does or the like.
Why not seek a meeting with the Egyptian president now between the prince
Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter.
And as it was reported in the newspapers, they said that the first thing they did was to search secretly, and then we found it the next day.
There was a conversation between me and Omar Suleiman
In Saudi Arabia
Irreversible herd
I can't say that we agreed on everything.
Let's say that no one else explains that you compare yourselves to them
But dignity is dignity for the young and the old.
The minister said that if Egypt receives the appropriate compensation, it will be satisfied.
Recruitment among children
I think this is Egypt, but bigger than this, I think it's a house of expression.
Do you have a vision to solve problems with Egypt or are you just waiting for the Egyptian people to intervene from heaven?
This, this, please, I want to talk about the intervention of heaven and others because God knows who lives and who dies.
And here I am, I am calling
A limit that made him believe there was a way
And we are proud of Egypt
A certain path is needed in Pan.
Either stop with me or stop with my back.
Any tool that hurts any Arab citizen
In the Arab world, he is suffering and this is the policy of His Highness the Prince.
Countries derive their strength from sources of power.
The United States has sources of strength, China has sources of strength, France has sources of strength, and a small Muslim state, Qatar, has sources of strength.
Mana balla
The obvious thing is that there is none.
All of you are working like idiots.
But we are a small country on my eyes and on my head.
And I repeat it a thousand times.
So that no one can say that we have a sensitivity
None of us will confiscate it.
You have now tickled Israel.
Medicine before I go to Israel from Zabih
What is your vision for solving the problem with Egypt?
The problem was also that they were not the first
And every day they complain about America. If I tell you about the major countries you are talking about.
They deal with us for the sake of interests and we deal with them for the sake of interests.
All complaints and everything
In order to destroy the relationship
I believe it diminishes any major country that does so.
It also diminishes our Arab pride to go around complaining about each other.
Everything comes and everything we know
Our vision is to be based on the Arab interest.
And we are with them in anything
Are there any upcoming steps to repair relations?
But I know that there are intimate relations between the president and His Highness the Prince.
If anyone moved any matters
The rapprochement of the two countries and the two leaders will find itself lost because of the latter
No, maybe tomorrow, maybe in ten years, I swear I don't know, you know, we from our side, whenever anyone invites us to a conference, we always attend.
Anyone who invites us to a conference, we will boycott it, and if we have an opinion, we will express it at the conference.
What we can do is that
Because Egypt is our elder sister in any subject, but we have our own point of view and we discuss.
This is all that is required, when the time comes, we are of course pleased with this matter.
It was cancelled due to political reasons.
We, as mentioned, respect the Egyptian people.
Of course, canceling a contract and adding a contract, you're asking about the amount of cancellation, ask how much Egyptian came to Qatar at the same time.
But the policy of the state, we are like what the Egyptian people told you, close to us in Qatar from our hearts a lot.
On June 4th, you tickled the emotions of the Arab people by closing the Israeli office on June 4th, published by Arutz.
Why do you say we tickled him? If we wanted to tickle them at 12 years old, we would have closed it.
Since the Shanin, everyone was in the same position of carrying before they reconciled with Israel and before secret negotiations took place between some Arab countries and Israel.
After, after, after, after, after they reconciled, most Arabs
Whether under the table or above the table with Israel or talk to her in any of the characteristics
If we wanted to tickle emotions, we would have done so at the previous Islamic conference.
At the United Nations, Nasser's supporter Abd al-Nasser hosted a dinner at the Israeli embassy, in the presence of Israeli ambassador Peleg.
Yes, he was one of many guests who attended his lecture, but I don't know for what occasion the ambassador held it.
Because we in the United Nations sit together with Israel, no one denies this issue.
Or we found a glimmer of hope in lifting the burden from our brothers in Palestine
The administration has changed, the matter of Egypt was a small part of mine, but unfortunately.
I didn't grow you, you're the one who grew me.
My question is about the United States and the new administration, and the impact that has on your relationship with the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
A difference in views
A road that solves many problems in the area
And if they are all serious, we will help them to the fullest extent.
A special relationship or a solution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration is expected.
Many of these issues have been resolved.
The Emir of Qatar spoke yesterday in Paris about what is happening in Iran.
Iran has special relations with it despite its bad relations with the United States.
First, I need to put it in the context of the internal affairs of Italy because we need to respect every country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said in this program that the Doha agreement ends with the holding of elections.
Is this your vision too, or do you see the agreement existing or will you strive for a new agreement?
The Doha agreement was for a phase that would lead them to hold peaceful elections.
One and a half years have passed since the last elections, and it's been a while since the Doha elections.
We were following it day by day and moment by moment until they reached the elections according to the Doha agreement.
We recently intervened in one of the electoral districts to correct some misunderstandings that occurred.
But you still have a relationship with arranging things in Lebanon.
You know, we are always close to Lebanon. The Qataris love Lebanon and go there often.
It means I am the first country you can visit after the Western State of Lebanon.
Question: Quick answer about what is happening in Yemen
You have entered the Houthi issue and there are accusations that you supported the Houthis.
Or at least your intervention will put them in a club with the state, and now they are in greater danger, which is the danger of the south.
We suffered what we suffered, this is the same reason why you didn't stop here and why you didn't stop here in Qatar.
And indeed we had a lot of pressure on this issue, but this was our vision and this was the position of His Highness the Prince on this issue.
The Houthi issue
And its stability has a positive effect, and its instability has a negative effect on us.
Our intervention through Naseehha between the two parties
Or we signed an agreement
But I understand that if this is intended to be exploited for other reasons.
And I was with them there and we always stood with them in every matter.
And and and and it has no basis in health
I see that we don't need it
I sell it
And I say this while I am sorry, I know that there are many Arab audiences who are against me.
Thank you, dear viewers, we hope you will continue to follow us and we hope that we have clarified some of Qatar's foreign policy for you.
In conclusion, I bring you greetings from the program team and this is Ahmed Mansour greeting you without limits.
Peace be upon you and the mercy of God and His blessings.
Dear viewers, peace be upon you. Welcome to this special interview.
Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani Prime Minister of the Council of Ministers Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar
Of course, why I say a special and exceptional interview because
Qatar, and this man in particular, was the main sponsor
Sir, a simple and direct question
I think it happened because there was an Arab consensus at the beginning.
And we tried that when we went to the United Nations
The Arab consensus was important and the Lebanese agreement from both sides was important.
To reach the results
It is very important that external interference is eliminated
Many opinions or suggestions from abroad
Arabic Lebanese International If you love to say, say it
But it meant going through stages
There is nothing to say that these stages existed.
Do the complexities in Lebanon mean
Since the truth
This means that when you meet and enter directly on the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file.
Have you discovered that the Lebanese knot is a major knot?
Lebanese Arabic regional international needs a large deciphering
It was a very small and simple contract, but it was inflated by external intervention.
For we know that Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, a beacon for several things.
Lebanese people should not be allowed
It affects the security and peace in Lebanon.
Problem number one
External repercussions on Lebanon
You suddenly decided after twenty-four hours to take everyone on one plane.
From the plane directly to meet the Emir of Qatar
They did not even expect it, meaning they could not rest for a single minute except for what you are doing for them.
This is the secret to keeping them from relaxing and thinking more.
And they make many calls. It was a secret.
To propose the idea of moving them to Doha because we need a cooler climate
Or they will gather them in many different difficulties.
And in many circumstances
So we brought them out for these conditions for the conditions that you came to solve
If we want to succeed, we must move them from this atmosphere.
And quickly
Fallah Allah waffakna fi al-haff al-bayyan al-Fenisi aw al-bayyan al-Biroot.
Then we succeeded in getting them to agree to go to Doha.
The two parties decided to go to Doha
Some believe that Qatar is inclined towards one side against the other side.
And from Beirut, but
The Prince's statement means that we are mediators if we are middlemen
In this process
Medoutspokenly, the state of the Sheikh
Did you seriously consult?
With the two main parties concerned, at least as is the case here in Lebanon, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Syria.
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
He expressed his support for the idea
We benefited from Prince Saud in that we
Everyone wanted a solution
His justifications are weak.
If you go, if you went to the mind
His justifications are weak.
It should have been removed because there was a lot of tension in Palestine.
There is the Iranian nuclear issue
The Arab University must have a mechanism to solve issues.
The African Union is better than us at solving issues
And he tries to gather the ends
And he works conferences to solve the Arab League, which has gathered a heritage for years, they are unable to
Let them gather the Arabs or gather the parties if there is, or intervene to help the oppressed.
It must be studied
If we want to be awake for the Arab University, not the Arab World University.
With Arabic as a tool for implementation
One of the officials here was President Nabih Berri
SyncSync
Now it turns out that the Lebanese agreed
And God, you know, we
The first is Qatar.
It never led to a result.
For the Arab interest
It is a force for the Arabs
We tried it in a few places.
In the United Nations, when we went to the Doha Agreement
And the agenda is to solve the issue, not another agenda.
There is no doubt that
And the most important role they have in the Arab world in general, specifically.
In position
He stopped by our agreement.
For others, come and help us.
Because this is a serious issue and this is a serious issue but
Why have we reached a point where everyone plays in our yard?
In our yard
It is very important that the interests of our peoples and people prevail.
Now we need an Arab summit after this agreement to see what we will do among the Palestinian brothers.
What will we do in Somalia?
What will we do in Somalia, I am not a member of the Arab University.
Why don't we try to join the Arab University? Sudan is not a member of the Arab University, Iraq is not a member of the Arab University.
We are part of the Arab world and a small part of the Arab world.
We hope this is not a suggestion, this is an idea.
Can Qatar have good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia?
I believe that first, if we are asked to do something, we do what we can.
But I am sure that His Majesty King Abdullah
King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
And his brother President Bashar
Because historically Saudi Arabia and Syria had an agreement
A transient phase can be translated into English as "A transient phase".
We find that after her, God willing
However, I insist on asking if you could play a role in this aspect.
Even if it's not publicly known, you now have some kind of confidence.
We are seeking rapprochement among Arab countries.
And this is the policy of His Highness from the beginning, but this means the subject
Can what happened in Lebanon indicate that the region is heading towards serious settlements?
What happened in Lebanon is a local Lebanese matter, the affairs of the region are still ongoing.
Not very attached to this situation
I wish the opposite, I wish this
A new beginning in the Arab world is a wish.
We can create
It will happen somewhere else.
In other words, the Sheikh state is afraid that the escalation that was in place before will continue.
At least from here to the end of President George W. Bush's term
There is no doubt that my concerns remain, whether it is about Palestine or, more specifically, the issue of Gaza.
It means we, I want to ask
We don’t want anything else.
He tells me to take care of this humanitarian aspect in Palestine.
We can deliver medicine to them.
And food
Electricity for the patient in the hospital.
If the electricity is cut off, it dies.
I wish
As the Arab League, we agree on an amount for this issue of medicine and food, which we call medicine and food.
Brother, we don't want the Red Crescent to deliver it.
Let the Red Cross deliver it.
But the Arab side is committed to this Israeli blockade.
I don't want to go into the details of this subject. I'm just saying that we Arabs must deliver the medicine and the Quds, even if we disagree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made an effort and pledged to the Kaaba.
Because this is a conflict that will only benefit the other party.
Don't deal with this party because we will complete the solution for you, this statement is incorrect.
And I
So far, I have no signs of a solution in front of me.
Do you fear an American-Iranian confrontation in the coming period or do you welcome it?
This is included, of course, we
At least talk about the State of Qatar
Iran is a significant neighbor for us.
We may not agree on all of your policies, or they may not agree on all of Qatar's policies.
For example, they say to us, "We do not want you to have relations with Israel or contact with them."
Perhaps there are those who consider you to be a party through the American rules that exist there.
This subject, we know how to deal with it.
There are those who said that after the visit of the Emir of Qatar to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
It was as if he met or consulted or spoke with the Saudi family
In Istanbul, there are negotiations between Syria and Israel.
And I can say by chance
The second topic was that the Kingdom was keen to find a solution and I was in contact with Prince Saud.
What happened in the last few hours
Tactical change of the tactics of negotiations
From you or from the parties
We are responsible for this.
And from you from all sides and we locked the room on ourselves
And finally, we found ourselves, and then the intervention of His Highness the Prince was important.
And from there, the invention spread.
Without mentioning them now, it is over.
And it was a clear message when he said, "We know our size, our location, and our role to the end."
He wanted to play the role of Monon without provoking any other party.
Whether Arabic, regional or international
But still
It has become a responsibility
You wanted that or didn’t you
Some people mean jealousy means some of us want to avoid jealousy because we are as a country
These countries are:
You can work or
I think this is the most comfortable combination of the two.
Perhaps the last or before last question, your relationship with Washington now, is it a long-lasting, distinguished, lukewarm relationship?
"Our relationship with Washington is a good one, let me say that."
There are different viewpoints on the issues.
But this is our right and if they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How good does it mean how to translate it on the ground that your relationship with
If you talk about economy, it's excellent. If you talk about education, it's excellent.
If you talk about health, if you talk about politics, I can tell you that it is fine.
In my opinion, clearly, during the next phase
In my opinion, we should leave the subject of confronting Israel.
And if we want to stop the game in the Arabian arena
We will fix the Palestinian issue
We agree on an opinion so that we can be a respected force.
I think we have it.
We are something effective
Thank you, our dear viewers, for your good follow-up and until we meet again, God willing, with my regards to you.
Welcome, our viewers, to this interview with the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabor Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We are trying to look ahead to the Arab political reality and Arab efforts.
His Eminence Sheikh, welcome.
To research what is happening in Gaza
And I hope that through this dialogue we can
To shed light on some of your questions
Israeli entry into Gaza in a purely land-based manner.
Our goal was to have an Arab position.
Treat it with friendly countries
And the brotherly countries
And how to try to find a clear and strong Arab position that the Arab countries
And then we find areas for reconciliation
Before us, we know that more than one Arab country has violated
In an arbitrary manner
And no one was counted while
We find that we are accountable for everything, whether intentional or unintentional.
We are the specialists
The only people in the world we always target
We always discipline in a manner
I believe that
To the point that we won't be able
Let us meet at the level of leaders
To stop the punishment campaign, we are the ones who are being punished.
We want to create a rift in the Arab world.
And there were five other verbal approvals.
By a two-thirds majority
But the purpose of the subscription is not
We hope that you are correct and that our view is wrong because the goal
Solving the problem now is not the goal of holding a summit.
But is it dissolved in the blood of Palestinians?
The ministerial request we made now does not cancel Qatar's request.
And that was also confirmed by His Highness
In his speech, he said that we are not particular if the embarrassment is that it is in Qatar, we are not particular that it is in Qatar, the summit will be wherever it is.
An Arab position that others respect us
Yes, but with respect to the ministerial
We don't want to tell them that the Security Council's decision has been issued.
And Israel
She was not concerned with the decision and continued, and still kills and bombs in Gaza.
And we need to ask the Arabs what we are doing
What are we doing
Will Israel be finished after it ends?
Apply the remaining part of the Security Council's decision
There may be a situation since Israel has not stopped
Shooting to not force our brothers
On a decision that considers that the debt is overdue
From so many days
We will talk about the ministerial meeting.
You ultimately support this proposal.
We support an Arab summit, of course, and this is our idea and the idea of several Arab countries as well. Syria and Yemen requested the summit.
Oredei in an existing Arabic crack
Or all of our troops to the Camp of Moderation
And the camp of non-moderation
What does they mean by "and lack of moderation"
The Western Farzina
The Arabs who are called moderates and the Arabs who are not moderates.
We find that there is a moderate mother and an immoderate mother.
And then we need to know what moderation and non-moderation are, is moderation walking according to Israel's plans?
And end the case in a humiliating way
Or we just need to keep the issue alive.
This is an important question.
The topic means whether countries
Israel's plans and wants to solve the issues in ways
I do not say that it is going according to Israeli plans, nor do I want to accuse anyone.
But I say
If we call it a moderation camp.
What is moderation in the eyes of the West
Do we agree with slaughtering a specific group of Palestinians?
Of course, there was an election.
I am not a supporter or an opponent of Hamas, but I am speaking about reality.
The reality that exists is that there is
The idea
Some call them the Redical Movement
But we must ask ourselves what this radical movement is asking for.
Something is wrong with her, or she is a student.
Are we sorting them?
And we also create other blocks
No, we can't.
Internal Arabic thought
This seemed to be happening
Therefore, we do not want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, His Eminence Sheikh, in short.
Who prevented the Arab Summit from taking place?
I can't say no, there are desires and the subject is known to everyone.
Subject of the ban
But as I mentioned to you, we could have been
We take a vote and get two-thirds.
But that was not the goal because it is not a challenge issue as much as it is an urgent need that we believe we have
I don't think it's an urgent matter.
Okay, we went to the Security Council
Or in the decision of the Security Council
But the Security Council's decision, Israel said, is that it will continue and then wait on the subject.
I want to focus on it again.
We do not want to apply the decision to the weaker party.
How will it differ from the first meeting
The subject of disputes usually means disagreements and differences of opinion.
As important as it is
Are we ready to have a clear Arab position?
Humanitarian aid
From the supporters of our brothers clearly
And also, address the Israeli side and tell them
This requires us to investigate it, but I don't think everyone is ready.
Why don't we freeze the Arab initiative?
The 48th and we are committed, we committed to the truce 48 and the Israelis did not comply.
Naturally, there are disputes in the interviews, but in reality, those disputes are not that serious.
Expresses positions that express what is in the hearts of certain people, meaning
One of the altercations that I learned about is
There is no one who describes the Hamas movement as a gang.
And not even a minority
This is a situation that occurred and we responded to it in I am one of the brothers of the ministers
And I believe this means what the West says.
On this, a radical movement and a group, and one says that this is Hizbullah.
And we don't want to be men of others
Therefore, it always means and I don't mean anyone
Any foreigner will find
A Western country or countries will find
Among Arabs
Yes, okay. His Highness the Sheikh now.
Call for the Second Ministerial Meeting
And God, his agenda is one thing
This is you Arabs, what is happening and what is the position of the three-month nation?
A million Israelis will
The result of which was the issuance of Decree No. 56,846
The decision that was issued
Israel has not implemented it after the mission is completed.
There is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort
He is thanked for this decision in this resolution.
We are requesting Chapter 7 because Israel is above the law, meaning Israel
And if you ask them again, they will say, "We understand."
It's not the Arabs' fault if they are
If so, Israel should not question it.
It is above international law.
This is a reality.
Why did you go to the Security Council and why did you link the convening of an Arab summit to what the Security Council would issue?
In the meeting, the Security Council will strive for us
It needs a difficult decision.
To the decision
A manager may lose his position.
We in the West are afraid
And we are among those who wish that after they decide, for example
I want to get out of the subject.
Those who committed this attack on Iraq rebuild it entirely on their own account because they destroyed it.
Let's not ask the Iraqi government or the people who died.
There are no compensations.
Exactly the same thing happened in Sudan when they first started talking about the trial of al-Bashir.
His Excellency the Sheikh
His Excellency Sheikh
A major Arab diplomatic victory in the Security Council
He saw that they had difficulties in the Security Council because it was the first time they spoke about a presidential statement.
The consequences
Israel did not comply with it
You will be committed after two days, after a week, after you finish the task.
Because they did not comply with the decision.
Sorry, people are supposed to comply
Because Israel accepts after it has completed the task.
You have an alternative to this decision now.
All that we have done
Unfortunately, some of the brothers carried out with diligence.
Gaza blockade, participated in
I am a friend of the West and I do not object to having a relationship with the West and I am not
Against the West and against America
But these people know the language of interests
If you are strong, your friends will be too.
Or if you have a point of view
Finally, our point of view is taken into account one in a hundred and we say we won.
What is victory?
What does it include
I can't say anything about any reservations now because the decision is final.
And the Council is its own master.
You participated in the formulations
Yes, we participated in the formulations to some extent.
But you did not invite Arab ministers to meet with the American Secretary of State.
But I'm sure the brothers who went to Ikefon will take care of us.
I referred to Arab parties for a specific interest.
In this field, His Eminence Sheikh ‏
Two years ago until the moment
Look, I don't want to talk about accusations.
What I can claim is that we have looked at everything.
Are they people?
An Israeli official has made an international statement and we have also contributed to this statement.
And from here, the dispute began and the siege began.
And in the past month, Israel killed 28 Palestinians during the ceasefire.
And they are starved until we exhaust them because we do not want them to be in power.
Those parties, the happiness of Sheikh.
It clearly says that the Palestinian-Palestinian dispute
It means that if there was
Who created the Palestinian conflict? Maybe there was a Palestinian-Palestinian conflict.
I say to you, you are right, one hundred percent.
I don't say that Hamas is right one hundred percent.
I do not claim that and I do not say that.
But the mediator is usually a mediator at a distance from everyone.
And I don't just mean the intermediary, I mean we Arabs are at the same distance from everyone.
And we don't want it to be present, so we need to end it in any way.
Training forces right and left once
And once they were besieged and not given any money or salaries.
And once we create a positive model in the West Bank
"Let the people in Gaza see how people are living."
Live a life that is not desirable.
In contrast to Gaza,
You called for a second ministerial meeting, a ministerial Arab meeting, but at this time
The talks about it are still ongoing between Hamas and Turkey.
This invitation you made seems like an attempt to circumvent
Turning if we made another initiative
We don't have any initiatives.
In this topic
Because Egypt is an important Arab country
And it is required of her to play a role and we will support any Egyptian effort that leads to reaching an understanding.
But it is important
We don't come.
Tomorrow, a side like this will defeat a side like that.
And the path to harmony
A balanced Egyptian initiative
Between international requirements, Arab requirements, and human requirements
And the role of Egypt is a very important role.
She is a leading Arab state that we respect and appreciate.
This is what you need to know about Egypt.
The current proposals and initiatives do not meet those requirements, His Highness the Sheikh is pleased.
I have a concept about the initiative.
What was announced, we hear information about it from here and from here.
What I can comment on is something I don't know.
With all due respect to the Palestinian government or presidency, it must exist and we all recognize the Palestinian presidency.
But also some people
We are waiting for the other side to take their point of view.
Even if we can make this mediation succeed
In this regard, the point of view is taken.
Hamas's position was clear that this decision was not taken into consideration, meaning how can it be issued
A decision in which Arabs participate in its formulation without contacting or taking the opinion of the main party concerned with the subject.
We just want to say that we, of course, deal with the Palestinian state as a state.
And the authority deals with them, let's say, KK, one-sided
But now there is a rift between one side that is in one place and another side that is in another place.
This does not mean that if we deal with the people in Gaza, we should drop dealing with the group that is in the West Bank or the Palestinian Authority.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
If they ask for someone from Gaza, they will be with them.
Now we are coordinating together
What was announced about it
First, the decision is that he welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiatives.
Some considered it to be a religion.
This is an explanation, but what I understood from reading the decision is that he welcomed the Egyptian initiative.
We hope the Egyptian initiative succeeds in achieving its goals.
The fighting stops
I don't doubt them, just like I don't doubt our brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the Security Council's decision.
And you consider that this decision became as if it did not exist since Israel did not accept it.
Even if you accept it later, things will have changed on earth.
Yes, His Eminence Sheikh, speaking about the Egyptian efforts, the Egyptian efforts.
Turkish efforts are also sharing in the same time and it was
About Arab Failure
But due to Arab disputes that cannot be resolved, he came to occupy a place.
It was supposed to be occupied by Arabian hands
I welcome Turkey's position.
And a position that should be appreciated by Arabs and Muslims.
Turkey is an Islamic state.
And that is why this is a natural role
And people must follow my lead.
There is no Arabic consensus to address the situation.
One says let them finish the task
A clear Arab stance is needed to condemn this aggression, its continuation, and procrastination.
If there is an Arab position against it.
Israel is capable of absorbing a war, I am not talking about an Arab-Israeli war and we are one of the people who always call for peace.
We are a country, which means we want to live in safety.
But I am not asking for an Arab war, I am asking for a position.
Arabic wahdha
In the context of discussing initiatives and proposals, of course, you are following what is happening
And the proposals and conditions that Hamas puts forward
Do you think
As an observer now, the field reality is...
The politician who emerged from the military operation now allows Hamas to impose its conditions.
It is necessary that it is true.
This is the point we agree on. This point we do not agree with you on.
The second thing
They are not there, now they are talking. I don't know about this talk like you told me.
The second thing
Okay, in the following situations, Arabs are required.
This is the Arab reality.
The effect we witnessed after the start of those operations
There is no doubt that the situation in the Arab street is far, far ahead of
About us, we are governments
Of course, I'm sorry that some people describe this as a gift to the people.
Once they tell me this topic
Our people's views are represented.
The presidents now
If they want, it means they want.
At least they see something
Of course, there is a high ceiling and a modest ceiling
Stop normalization, stop diplomatic relations with Israel
Qatar Bank
The Israeli embassy office in Doha has been closed.
Qatar, which takes this position
The Arab side must be radical and take radical positions.
Anything that the Arabs agree on, we agree on collectively.
We are in an Arab agreement.
The treaty is one thing and the relations are another.
We are ready.
We are in line with our Arab brothers.
But there will be a clearer Arabic decision and credibility.
And they deal with others, not just countries that have relations
Even countries that do not have relations with each other.
Very important.
We are not clients of others.
Why can't Qatar be a model in this field?
If this is the only model, we are ready to be in it.
But we also want
Arabic model Qatar is committed to part of its Arab commitment
Like
And I don't go to sell anything to anyone
Our problem is that trust between Arab countries is missing.
And I don't want to say, we regretfully don't want to say, brokers.
Therefore, it is very important.
An official invitation anywhere because we must rise above this
Some summoned the ambassador, some lodged protests, and some expelled the ambassador, like Shweez Messa.
And this is part of the disagreement
But some of them summoned the ambassador and those who summoned the permanent five major powers, and these are all films on our peoples.
It means we talked about the modest ceiling of the popular demand.
On the upper ceiling, there are those who demand that Syria open its front with Israel.
"Look, I told you we call for peace and not for fighting with Israel."
And we do not ask for a fight with Israel
To fight with Israel
And how can we agree
These are also problems
Let us talk to each other and overcome our differences.
My statement that the Sheikh's happiness is that he said
The condition is that countries do not sell to each other
What do you mean
It means now
The street won't spare us.
His Excellency the Sheikh
Is what is happening today a completion of a project that began in 2006 with the Lebanon war?
She believes there is a difference
I don't think there is a difference between the goals.
Lebanon had free lands.
The rest of the parts, of course, should be deposited with the United Nations.
Or something like that
Lebanon means we dealt with the Lebanese issue in a big way
Israel, of course, needs weak countries around it.
Until you are the one in control and you have the upper hand.
And of course, there are countries that are supported by foreigners
Therefore, it wants to remain the only power in the region.
And now they want
Ignore this example in Gaza
In Lebanon, you speak with how many sects?
And how many entities
While Lebanon is in Palestine, it talks about one side only.
But I assure you that the Palestinians listen to the Arabs more and to foreigners even more.
Two sides, and that's where the gap came from, and everyone believes they are controlling the other side.
In my opinion, you are a monitor and a follower.
According to the plan, it ends with a broken bone
We Arabs, do we accept this because this example may be repeated to those who are difficult to deal with.
Or he says, "I don't know."
Whether for Israelis or others in the future
And we hit an example
The best in obedience and in helping to break the bone
I don't care about what we have, I and my cousin are strangers, and I and my brother are on my cousin's side.
We now expect no conflict with Hamas, and I do not say that Hamas or others are immune to mistakes or authority.
All of them have mistakes.
Now we must not pass this subject
On the knee of the side
Because here failure will not be the failure of the class.
His Highness the Sheikh of Qatar has been making proposals for some time.
And initiatives to solve this happened in Lebanon
That happened in Darfur. We will talk about this topic, even briefly, in a moment.
We are the ones
We don't want to burden our brothers because there is sensitivity at times.
"If a country takes all these initiatives, we have no objection, the important thing is that the issue is resolved."
We are not now our goal is to put Qatar on the top of the headlines
What were some of the goals of His Highness the Prince
This was his goal: how to stop this bleeding.
And we stop this bullying
What happened is beyond imagination.
And we are in Qatar
Do we know something they don't? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is that we have the intention.
The truth to reach a respectable solution
Talking about the initiatives means it is useful to know where the initiative has become in relation to Darfur, the solution of the Justice and Equality Movement.
And the Sudanese government in Khartoum
And it will be specific to solving the Darfur problem because the Darfur problem is the beginning.
Arabs helped
But as soon as we reached the international level, the case was resolved.
Based on that, we want to take revenge on the system and now we want to solve the issue and we don't know how to solve it.
And we always want, as mentioned in the beginning, to implement the decisions, meaning we are the best people to apply the decisions.
Avoiding the issue from competition, is there also competition in the subject of Darfur?
What I want to discuss in this matter
Before we end this conversation, Your Eminence, there is an economic summit.
Will this summit be held? Will you attend this summit?
No, we will ban the summit.
We wish it were held in an atmosphere different from the Arabian one, but it is programmed.
There is a defect.
Okay, if the Arab leaders attended, they would go to this summit.
When the blood of Palestinians was shed in Gaza and they are now gathering for financial and economic reasons.
I help in igniting
But it seems that no one is afraid of this street.
What do you know about the circumstances, I mean, of course, we don't wish anything but safety for all of us.
And we are safe.
But no one takes anyone with their small purse.
H.E. Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabor Al Thani, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, thank you very much.
Dear viewers, wherever you are, peace be upon you.
What is the purpose of this celebration and how genuine are the statements of the High Commissioner for Human Rights?
People with disabilities are the most neglected group in the world.
What about our Arab region and how much it cares about this issue?
These questions and others are being asked to our guest for today's episode.
The former UN Special Rapporteur on Disability
She holds a Bachelor's degree in Arts, Social Services, and Sociology from Qatar University.
And also on Master's in Environmental Planning and Social Policies from Helwan University in Egypt.
And I have held many positions in the field of people with disabilities.
One of the founding members and general coordinator of the National Committee for Disabled Persons
2989
And the Vice President of the National Committee for the Disabled from 1999
Even 2,033
As well as contributing to the establishment of the Al-Shfeel disability center.
For people with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest has overseen the launch of many programs, projects, and media campaigns.
And the activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world
As I contributed to delivering lectures and participating in discussions, conferences, and forums.
Welcome, Mrs. Hassa, to our show in this episode.
The accepted term is people with disabilities.
In the beginning, we called it "disabled" in the 1980s and before.
More educational when
They are among those who provide that education.
In 1993, a significant document appeared in the United Nations.
Speaking of this term before we go into details
About the rest of the regions, although there are regions that are not or classified as developing and classified as poor.
And Latin America, especially Latin America, this trend can be stronger in it than in any other region.
But statistics proved otherwise.
The trend towards the rights approach is present in the Arab world, you can find it in many countries.
The resources may be available and the political will may be present.
Okay, let me tell you some statistics, which you may already be aware of.
Eighty percent of them are from poor countries.
UNESCO says that about 90% of disabled children in poor countries do not attend school.
Ms. Hosseini, how do you comment on these ILO statistics?
It is very real to a great degree.
I first saw it in Darfur, in Gaza, and in areas that are experiencing such events, which are wars and conflicts.
There is no distinction between a disabled person and a non-disabled person, as the numbers are large.
Fifty-three percent of children are illiterate among females, for example, or approximately fifty-two percent.
And in other countries
There are many obstacles that prevent these children from reaching schools even if they do not have a disability.
The city originally had no infrastructure, so even if this child had found that school.
He can access them.
For children and other residents, it is
This means these projects and agendas are wonderful, but we don't hear about them much in reality.
It is only when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated a few days ago, that we ask ourselves: what is the point of this celebration?
The situation in the world
People without disabilities are better off than those who have disabilities.
There are organizations that have reached and established many projects.
A very important health strategy is being implemented.
Through this strategy
There is an overlap between human affairs and working with specific marginalized groups such as people with disabilities.
At this level of awareness, the Arab world is better.
At the point of awareness, we stop to receive communications and continue our conversation.
Thank you.
I have two questions I would like to ask as they were previously decided in the United Nations
The second point is what is it
The United Nations laws that call for the fight against systems that cause disability to the child's society, for example, my son's Syrian intelligence system.
Is there a law that allows me to file a lawsuit against the regime, as there are many in Syria who do?
Yes, Suleiman, your idea is clear. Suleiman Kuro, tell us from Syria. Thank you very much. With us, Naif Al-Said from Kuwait. Go ahead, Naif.
Peace be upon you and the mercy of God and His blessings.
And peace be upon you
Good evening
Evening light, please.
I have intellectual disability.
So, I hear Arabs say that the deaf understand by sign language.
And in the Quran it says: "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Glory be to Him Who has taught the Quran, and who has taught man that which he knew not."
I mean, I've been sitting for more than thirty years, I can't even talk, I mean, I only say a word or two a day.
Glory be to God, God, make me speak.
He was talking in Gharani and I found out what it means
It means an attack on me that I exploit the Quran and that I am a hypocrite and I mean people and so on.
They curse me and mean me and they are in the lowest pit of hell.
I only got defamation.
And they do not corrupt the truth.
The one whose house is made of glass does not throw stones at people.
And of course, psychological disabilities.
It falls within this definition, the question of brother Suleiman regarding
United Nations programs or their reactions to disability-causing factors such as political goals or others
Towards the different organizations and agencies
To discuss, convince and know her to what degree.
There are disability issues and topics on their agendas, meaning
UNESCO, the International Labor Organization, UNICEF, and the reality of these organizations originally put disability
It is one of the programs that tries not to overlook children with disabilities.
Appropriate opportunities and schools
In various environmental and other aspects
UNICEF
But there are shortcomings that we must admit, there are also shortcomings in the situation in the United Nations as well.
The most prominent points of weakness and shortcomings you mentioned are...
According to the United Nations
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
Directly, I was present in my country, the State of Qatar.
But there was a routine and bureaucracy that hindered
My work in particular, I sometimes saw it during the restrictions or limitations
People with disabilities struggle for recognition.
Until it reached a point that was somehow acceptable, it was not put in a separate article as the global disability movement wanted.
But it occupied a somewhat suitable part
Unfortunately, there is no formatting between them.
This is one of her main shortcomings.
The survey applied by the Special Rapporteur and applied to countries
Within the staff or within the workers in those programs
Unfortunately, we received only three responses from the 44 organizations and agencies that we contacted.
Do not put
A permanent, stable, and continuous disability for a long time, although this issue is primarily a human rights issue.
In the last period, yes, thank God, for two or three years
The issue of disability is at least being raised through events such as seminars and others.
Peace be upon you.
Dear Madam, why are there no binding laws and decisions for Arab countries, and who is responsible for implementing these international laws?
Regarding Arab countries and the allocation of salaries, for example, allocating a salary for the disabled.
Are there funds allocated by the United Nations?
Do these funds go to governments or to the United Nations offices, and do these aids really reach the disabled?
And finally, note that there were no binding decisions for the Arab countries.
Thank you very much, Ahmad Al-Halabi, you told us from Greece.
With us is Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia. Please, Ibrahim.
Hello.
And peace be upon you
Please adopt this proposal.
He is to write directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations
Turn to this box
Or a manufacturing plant
Only 1% of the annual net profit is allocated.
I return to our guest to answer the callers' questions.
And he says that doctors advised him to undergo surgery, but
It costs a lot and he cannot afford this LLL process, so where does he go?
He is from Algeria.
I believe it is important to meet the needs of my brother Naji.
Like any other rights, it means the rights of disabled people.
All these rights are duties that this citizen must obtain.
To join the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this is a binding and legal agreement.
Satisfying the rights and needs of individuals within the national scope
Or even at the level of non-governmental organizations
Binding for all countries and there will be monitoring to ensure the implementation of these laws.
At least at the level of top officials, there must be awareness.
Therefore, at least if we work on these charters in this way
Even if there is no significant commitment
There was a response to the monitoring reports you were doing and was there any interest
But don't forget the standard rules are a morally binding document, not a legal one.
To be committed and ratified
Understanding that these issues will be resolved or discussed or raised within a participatory context that suffers from many problems and challenges.
Naji Zakarni, Director of Qatar Center for the Deaf, is an expert in sign language at Al Jazeera.
Initially, Sayed Ali extends his deepest thanks to Al Jazeera channel.
The one who did a great job is now broadcasting this special episode.
Now Ali is speaking and says that he is very proud.
She was a caretaker for all people with special needs in the place where she was and still is.
We support her and stand by her side always and forever.
I also say that there are many people with special needs.
None of them know about this agreement because there were no training sessions.
Regarding them, especially if they are in schools, hospitals, or in government and private institutions.
It is necessary that this agreement be published.
It is like a law that concerns people with special needs in all countries of the world.
This confirms and emphasizes that countries should take action
By adopting and signing this agreement.
Similarly, like Qatar and some other countries, they signed this document with the aim of serving people with special needs and serving us.
Thank you very much, my colleague Naji, you mentioned me, you spoke on behalf of Ali.
Thank you very much.
Your opinion may make a decision.
The former UN Special Rapporteur on Disability may begin with the proposal submitted by one of the callers, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
About the establishment of a support fund
It is a fund for donations and accepts any contributions from countries.
This fund is expected to spend on activities that the Special Rapporteur will carry out when he is in office.
And even the Arab countries have only provided donations from one country, which is Syria.
Therefore, fulfilling those commitments is an existing problem in the United Nations.
The box that
Unfortunately, the member states are not complying and not paying attention.
Unfortunately, many people say it in every sense, meaning that we do not care about the situation now.
It is a fact that the issue of commitments is a problem.
Human rights
Human in its broad general form
The marginalized, especially
But that is why those charters exist.
So if these countries fulfill their commitments, but the idea is good that the brother launched it.
It is necessary to add that there should not only be an independent box, but also the organizations already present in the area.
Among her balances
Apply for the projects for people with disabilities in Gaza
Aid for the disabled
The issue always gets complicated, meaning that political factors interfere in it.
His state or government provided him with significant support.
Unfortunately, the number has decreased.
At token amounts
The father is disabled.
Of course, his nationality was withdrawn from him.
The girl withdrew from him, a girl of her age
I sometimes
Problems in teaching
We travel or go out, and confusion catches us.
Peace be upon you and the mercy of God and His blessings.
And peace be upon you
And they can
Re-building themselves with knowledge
I wish that the Arab countries would allocate a portion of their budget to this cause.
Thank you very much, Bahjat Kuroan, from Kuwait.
Aisha Mohamed from Qatar, please.
Hello.
And peace be upon you
Good evening to you and good evening to Sheikha bint Khalifa.
I want to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In the past years
With our best wishes to the people with special needs.
In the support of Sheikhah Hussa, the continuous one for them.
Holders of the Shurafai flag from Tunisia, welcome.
So there is another level, which is genetic.
I believe that genetic care reduces the rate of disability.
In our Arab customs, a cousin always takes his uncle's son, his aunt's daughter, and so on.
This means at this level, which is the level of disability, and thank you.
The comment came in response to what was said in the viewers' calls.
The truth is, as I said, at the national level.
Be aware that there are guidance and support programs
It is included in the health services
Which also falls under the umbrella of Hamad Medicine.
Within the psychological clinic, I also believe in the LAL programs of the Supreme Education Council in education.
Special Education Department, I honestly don't know if it still exists.
But it is certain that it is among the health services, yes there is support and there are medical services.
And the basic treatment for these conditions is provided to them.
Prevention is better than cure, and he pointed out the hereditary factor, marriage between relatives. Are there campaigns?
For example, for awareness
In this field
Of course, this is a very important and serious point.
And it is one of the things that I and others have touched on in many words and many posts.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns that are not only directed
The World Health Organization implemented it
Also, in relation to UNICEF.
Now in many Arab countries, including Qatar.
And certainly Tunisia
There are now mandatory decisions for early examination.
Which has been applied in many countries
This is all on the preventive side.
And do such campaigns receive a response?
Positivity, especially when it clashes with customs and traditions.
Of course, this is its difficulty, it clashes with the social culture.
If there is a decision to be in strategies to be in a will to confront it and to be bound
For example, the issue of early examination is a very important issue before marriage.
Are there any statistics that talk about the disabled?
Especially for the disabled in the Arab region
Questions the Arab region in the sense that
And especially
With the recent events in the region
In areas and in conflict zones, in wars, in terms of wars and conflicts, and others.
For every killed person, three disabled people are met
Events in Lebanon in Darfur in many areas
No, never, it's not enough, first of all, the issue is me
With the principles of human rights
There must be a position for disabled people, their programs, and plans.
Within the agendas that are originally present in the ministries in the institutions in the governmental and non-governmental organizations
And in conditions like those of wars or unrest
Only for your words, High Commissioner for Human Rights at the United Nations, Navi Pillay.
In the world, and what is even stranger, is that the International Monitoring Committee for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said that the population statistics
This means that disabled people are not included in the general population statistics that are conducted for the population.
It is not always announced.
For example, in the state of Qatar, when the census was conducted, I think it was more than five years ago.
But honestly
In collaboration with the Ministry of Planning and the Council of Planning.
The Council considered it a fact and participated as the Office of the Special Rapporteur.
To employ more, employ disability classifications
The requirements that are expected to be present.
The quality of those shoes, all these important details that must lead you to a result.
Is there a disabled person or not?
Exactly, but at least
Slightly, the statistics are progressing in this regard.
Hello.
Madam, thank you for this program and thank you to Sheikha Hussa.
But praise Allah and thank Him that I am a Qatari and receive this attention from my country.
My daughter is now a student in independent schools and receives good education, praise be to God.
And I want to thank Ms. Hassa.
And their motivational role and their role that makes us not to fear or worry about our children
And praise and thanks and great thanks to her and to whoever supports this group.
Thank you, thank you very much, Fatima Al Dossary, you told us from Qatar, we stay in Qatar with Latifa.
Peace be upon you.
And peace be upon you
My dear, the reality and the solution we are waiting for is to solve the problem of our Bidoon children.
What role do our Qatari children have in the Sheikha?
I hope she answers it. I will answer this question.
Peace be upon you.
And I bear witness to the special services provided by the State of Qatar for hearing disabilities.
We had an early detection program for hearing loss.
There is the Supreme Council for the Disabled.
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability.
Even the MG Oz civil society association or other communities.
Because the reality and the expected outcome is that if I compare over five years
What was provided for the disabled five years ago and now
Thank you very much, Karim Naseem, you spoke to us from Jordan, and I return to our guest.
Of course, the …
The community as a whole with its individuals and especially families that have
Children with disabilities have big ambitions and expectations from anyone.
Whether at the planning level or at the executive level
But with regard to one of the points you mentioned, which is a very important point.
Children who do not have documents or others, whether in Qatar or elsewhere.
The International Agreement, like many international documents.
And a commitment to translate it into plans and strategies
Those services are provided automatically.
From the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, sex, or nationality.
Well, Sheikha Hissa means she worked as a special rapporteur previously at the United Nations, dealing with disability, after six years of work.
You mean you wish
Maybe you didn't have enough time, maybe the financial aid wasn't enough.
This means there are many achievements that have been accomplished and I am proud of them.
Through my participation or through the organizations currently in existence and through the government institutions in many countries.
In the Arab region, I focus
There should be more research and larger studies.
We started from a global survey that showed us more than one report.
Raising awareness is an ongoing process that must be worked on continuously and extensively.
Coordination among Arab countries
And the people themselves, the people with disabilities and their organizations, because they are the ones
But they have a duty that must be done
They must fight for it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode, we thank everyone who shared their opinions and comments with us.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will meet a new guest.
So join us with your calls and messages in a new episode of Live with See you later
Rose Morning
I am very happy to have you with us.
In the beginning, before we start and ask different questions and chat this morning.
Thank you, Shaima, I'm here.
The whole Middle East deserves this global achievement.
Qatar really put us on the world map.
Thank you, Qatar
Also, please, Ali.
First of all, I became a brother to the viewing brothers.
And I say congratulations to the hosts and to all the Qatari people.
And, God willing, just like Sheikh Mohammed said, meaning
Before the dream and now, God willing, it will be a reality and work will begin from today or from the announcement period.
I was expecting Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup.
Despite the presence of strong files, such as America, Japan, and Australia, I was not worried in this field, in this topic specifically.
No, look, I'll be honest with you, seventy percent, I don't want Qatar to be involved.
Our file is very large.
View is really global plans and competing
We were the ones who were ahead of the competition
Why am I afraid
But thank God, Qatar's file was really strong and deserved it.
True, the file of 2022 and the World Cup and hosting it in Qatar
What about the fact that the same applies to the athletes themselves?
It means to them in this field, for sure, the happiness will be very, very big, God willing.
I like it, we used to listen to Insolve before the music, but I like to listen to the music like this.
At the moment of the announcement
Where were you? How did you receive the news? How was the shock? I don't know, just tell me, tell me, and tell the viewers.
F radio
The whole world is with us.
In the drawer of the advertisements and the hairs of the face
How did you see the global media
Look at the level of sports channels as a whole, no one is particularly keen, especially Arab countries, thank God everyone supported him.
Just announcing that Qatar has won the right to host.
All Arab countries, and it is no surprise that this is a kind gesture from them, have announced that they are ready to help Qatar no matter what happens.
Media from human resources can be used as volunteers.
Even at the level of external media, Shaima is a star.
I went to celebrate a bad event.
The French News Agency also included them among those they included.
About us, we also have meetings
It means that no one really cares, Qatar has become this way, let me tell you, I remember it every day.
Hundreds of times a day, from the smallest to the largest patch of land on earth
I expect everyone will know Qatar. Those who don't know Qatar in football are already known on the internet.
The owner of the 2022 World Cup
It means that any football player dreams of serving his country by being part of the national team.
Of course, any player in the Qatari League would like to represent the national team.
This means it is a positive thing for someone to kill themselves even in games.
"The player will give everything he has, even if the team succeeds and enters the tournament."
It means whether in exercises or in matches because the team's logo is on his chest, he must put on everything he has.
The officials did not fall short, whether in terms of attention or the game, especially the young ones, meaning they teach them professionalism from a young age.
Eating, sleeping, and
Tell me about your experience. You have played in more than one different stages for years, how was your experience and what is the most important for you?
Of course, it was divine.
The player was included in the national team from the buds to the first team.
You are training camps with clubs with the club with the national team
Each stage has its own character
Yes, Lana, ma sha Allah, you were so mobile, you were moving from
We're used to you now, because you're the athlete.
Every time I see you, we always do some sports. We like to get information from you and know the sports news through Lana. What's the sports news with you?
I honestly don't watch a lot of entertainment. We used to host celebrities in their fields, and we also host celebrities in sports.
Like Ali and others in their sports field.
On the contrary, sports activity
What about we were the capital of sports
Qatar and Hala have become the capital of sports and world football.
Instead of being in miscellaneous, I would like to present economic and cultural programs.
You have different areas, you have a flying ball, different tournaments.
But then sports
Excellent sweet
I wished for a straight answer.
I wish I was ten years old instead of twenty-five now.
F apparently the young players got a big chance.
And they hold it, meaning like they say, with their hands and
It's sweet for me, inshallah, the word I want to address to the players who
I hope that the young people who will have a bright future in the coming days will be able to achieve it, God willing.
Of course, I'm taking this opportunity and they should take advantage of it.
This opportunity came on a silver platter, they say.
They must be utilized more extensively.
What's new with you? What's the news? What's new with the programs that I'm going to introduce? I know we've brought you a bit of a break from the holidays.
Please tell us about your news, God willing.
In constant contact with the event, hopefully we will be ready for the Asian Cup in one month from now.
We finished two days ago, but the Gulf Cup on the occasion, I congratulate the Kuwaiti team.
The news published is also available, meaning with intuition, redo the conjunctions of intuition.
Of course, I'm basically on the idea of Qatar TV, meaning the first look for viewers was through the Qatari screen.
What prompted you to deny this favor to Allah forever?
Wow, they're broadcasting the news message on various channels.
Whether it is a private channel, a sports channel, or any other channel.
Thank you, Qatar TV.
We certainly wish you all the best in this matter.
First of all, I would like to thank the administration of Al-Wakrah Club for their support.
The fans of Al-Wakrah Club are one of the most passionate and loyal in the world.
My childhood in the village
A sheikh was with us yesterday. Sheikh Nasser was with us.
From the club
I am the son of Al-Wakrah and the son of Al-Wakrah.
But like I told you before, this program is professional
It concerns every individual on the land of Qatar
The youth, we know that they love sports and addiction just like Leti.
How do we make an athlete enter the arena of competition?
Media awareness primarily means that the media has a very important role in promoting sports in various fields of life.
You have the youth addiction, but currently, sports are starting to enter schools, sports awareness has become a part of schools.
At your events, they celebrate any sports event, they make celebrations.
You have the Qatari street, so we see the boy walking signs in the streets, this is also considered sports awareness.
The female element for which he specializes is in the stands or anywhere else.
Women's awareness or let's say sports training for women's participation in sports.
After that, we will have a Qatar national team for women players.
By imagining that sports, thank God, are starting to expand.
I also expect Lana that the time period
To do many projects and raise awareness about sports, and I expect this period to be sufficient.
If studied properly and worked properly
Hey, enough and in the same way we need to use it properly like what you said
Then in a framework I wanted to take advantage of how the younger generations can possibly take advantage of the selection
Means the capabilities of the expertise of the devices, everything is available.
Also, in a very important job, we are thank God in Qatar, this thing is well known among the Gulf and Arab communities that they love sports more.
How do I attract this audience to follow sports news and matches in Qatar on a regular basis?
And the attendees at the same time
But you see, most of the Qatari street loves sports, loves football, but the problem is attendance.
Means if you enter forums, you will get more attention, especially in forums of some clubs or most of the clubs.
A great interest in football in the league.
As a player, as a Qatari citizen, what solution do you think could attract you to stop being a sportsman, to stop being a player?
What is the way that they can watch the matches of your friends on the internet?
It depends on the person himself, not that it means as a general idea or something.
Some of them like to watch it on TV or in gatherings.
For example, Japan has a large plan to attract a larger audience to attend.
When the matches are prepared, I don't know what it means, I'm not sure what's going on, so hopefully, it will be resolved.
And Arabic
The most important point is that every player will be present, God willing, in the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, especially in the 22-man squad. What do you think we need?
Besides financial support, what do you think is the most important thing we really need?
And provide the means that can lead them to the generation that really deserves the name of the Qatari national team and participate in the big World Cup.
The time when I said the match was about to end kept running in my mind. I kept thinking when it would be over. Praise be to Allah, the time was over with the good ones.
We achieved the impossible and the dream we thought was impossible, but thank God we are living it now in reality.
Like Sheikh Mohammed, these are moments of celebration, but work has begun.
And God willing, 2022 will be an event worthy of the name Qatar.
I congratulate every person on the land of Qatar and say to him sincerely, Qatar has now become a landmark of the world.
Hosting 22nd.
Thank you to the elegant journalist Lana Al-Adey for your efforts. We wish you all the best. Inshallah, and we will always follow you so that we can benefit from sports.
Thank you very much, I'm sure the joy is in the eyes of the Emir
Qatari young talents
And they are sitting and singing a new type of song that is emerging during this period.
But in the form of a fast music and rhythm on the music site.
And also a group of rap enthusiasts, God willing.
Be our viewers and let our journey begin from this moment and good morning.
We are trying to take a look at it.
In short, we can define rap as fast-paced vocal music.
The performer sings with a slow rhythm, not a fast rhythmic singing of the song's lyrics.
The one with a large number of rhymes deals with a number of different topics and issues.
Which may sometimes be a person
A meeting of emotional and political nature
And it is often controversial
And is largely liberated.
Our rap performers do not sing the lyrics of the song.
But he repeats it.
And his voice is a secondary factor.
Generally, the voice is not important in rap songs.
For this reason, he is not called a singer, but a rapper or rapper.
And the Rabiyeh is concerned with the following racism in the songs
For example, the flow of the flow of
The sadness is followed by their sadness,
They have a special style for rap.
And I expect they will give you a better and bigger idea than me personally.
Good morning, hello
And God, first of all, it was a period when we wanted to do something new.
We excel in something
So why do we sing rap?
Then, the fourth element means an art that exists in every country in the world.
So why isn't it in the list?
So we mean we are inventing something new
It means we give him an idea from it, a message.
In it, I talk about the positives and negatives that occur in our society.
First, we convey a message that it is a shroud.
This is an art of different arts and on the subject, this information may have solved many social and psychological problems for young people to a great extent.
Every time I expect it to change and this with the change of time I expect
And by Allah, the trolling was a bit weak.
We sang from 2:50 to 3:00. The singing was weak at the beginning.
FND in the article about ourselves that the new beginning for us is 2010
In Tughbal and more popular
She likes to try, for example, to sing and perform in the same style as rap during this period, she noticed this thing.
Aye, certainly a large percentage of people.
Also in the job we need to talk about, they established so many groups.
A beautiful band that has had so many concerts, we can talk about this band.
How was it founded and how is the idea that one can actually form a band, and how many of you are in this band?
And Allah, in the beginning, we mean before the band was established.
The rap reached Doha, meaning it started in 2005.
Everyone who loves the idea of rap means that they sing rap, they sing, they go down to the website.
I'm down, Salman is down, someone else is down, so there's competition.
And we met people
So we are competing with each other.
Then, after a period of time, after, meaning, over these years, we reached 2011.
In 2011, there was a group system, meaning a group for the time being, meaning three or four people together.
So, we said, why not, why not unite, we are all one group under the name Rappers Tart.
Or in English, "Ou bien
So we agreed on this thing, so we said one name, we are all one hand with each other.
And we came out to represent this thing and say that this idea is the same.
Fifty-two.
Twenty-five, God willing, a large group
Okay, someone plays or everyone performs rap songs.
He is the one who coordinates and the one who composes.
It means you can say something personal.
The numbers in the group are well-arranged. The twenty-five are well-arranged.
Everyone is responsible for themselves and their own capabilities.
Every person in the band can make a complete song.
Without relying on anyone else.
But there are possibilities that the competencies may differ, for example, if Salman is better than me.
He hears her say, "No, change the words, just a little."
Everyone can edit the second one
You help a bit
Even if there is an official entity that adopts these actions or even a company that boasts about them.
And there will be distributors of dates.
It means that the work will appear in a style that is elegant and truly official.
And God, we wish for honesty, meaning we wish for support, that is, that support reaches us, that they say, "Tina is a company that builds, tell us, hey, we're going to download and produce an album for you."
We don't have any problem, that's all.
Some things are difficult.
So why don't you think about the first initiative to be from you?
Even one person recognizes the first CD
So you can attract partners later.
2007, I made a CD, I guess.
I distributed it, by God, to the youth.
How was the turnout?
And God
The text is already in English.
But not with this strength now.
We were expecting Insolf, but we don't know about the weather, for example, you hear about the young people, a large group between Valencia and Kastel, for example.
Let’s talk about it
They told us that we are arranging a party for you.
And it means covering all the costs and all the procedures. And coordination means, and work means, to be honest, it means that we did not expect it to be at this level.
It was a real blast and a fantastic job.
And there was a bit of pressure, I mean, there were no ads, there was nothing, it was just the concert.
What was in the ads, what was in anything, before the show, two days
So we said, no one wants, you know, a party two days before the announcement, no one wants that.
F the while we're inside, before the party starts.
This means another point in our favor.
Ey Fawana means that our voice reaches families, not young people.
We think that this idea is right for young people.
We discovered in this phase that there is a category, more than one category, that listens to us.
In a certain song, there was a lot of interaction with the audience and the band.
Otherwise, most of the songs had interaction.
No, we didn't translate most of the songs, but because there were many songs and we were a large number.
The group means to completely alienate the group
What are the words, how to deal with different issues
We are talking about the situation we are in, but we are in a hurry.
I'll do it at least even if it's a lot of work.
Even if they spoke before, I wouldn't be.
It seems you need to output the random strings.
It means the rhyme comes out
Critique means that we think about writing these words, but writing these words is better than writing this word.
Okay, we have a song, let's see it.
One of the songs you made
And follow it and also see the public's opinion on this topic
And God willing, they will also enjoy such words.
Thank you, I liked the introduction because it had the name of my program.
With you, KD and DJ Mr. Bubu on the program Sabah Al Doha.
Good morning, morning ladies and gentlemen.
This is KJ Master P and SKT One Hot Two Breeze
And don't forget, the program starts at 9:30 in the morning, meaning everyone is sitting in front of the TV.
With us in the preparation Hassan Naama with us in the presentation Shimaa Al-Hammadi
With us in the direction Nasser Al Malki, the guests of the episode are rappers from Qatar, of course.
Because it really contains the name of Allah, thank you guys, you're the best, I appreciate it.
I clap for you and the right of the youth above in the control room
Yesterday night it was recorded.
And who wrote the words in you or who
Everyone writes his own words.
Because if I go I will write lyrics for Yusuf.
Not only does he write these words, but he also loves singing and loves emotions.
I expect you should write in the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup, I expect you can enter it, yes or no.
We're definitely about ourselves, so we're definitely going to release a song about these topics.
But it doesn't have to be official or fancy, you know.
I think there should be Qatari songs about the country and love for the country.
Through the art of the Iahweh, the true rap art.
Yes, I expect that today everyone is waiting for it.
We are seeing live on air right now.
Of course, this cup and Zain reached the streets of Doha
If our viewers saw how Doha is getting ready to host the Asian Cup.
The relevant devices have completed all arrangements to be in reception
The expected crowd is certainly larger than what we have seen.
Before a while, I expect the length of the corniche from the beginning to the end.
Of course, it is important to welcome this important sporting event.
In upcoming concerts, inshallah, I will follow them in the coming days, inshallah.
It means that the party we were invited to was arranged for us.
But so far, things are a bit complicated.
The procedures and this are not certain.
So I'm trying to say, for example, I saw Yusuf and I saw someone else.
I saw a few of them, their father has a song subject, and I saw the three of them.
Unsuitable for the song
The possibility that we can sing
I am sitting at home.
And then I sent an email to Yusuf on the internet.
Yusuf, this is part of the song.
In addition, a job that you travel abroad
Entering this field and they have millions of audiences.
We don't try to translate, but one hears what is better.
But it would mean a strong competitor with his style.
What prevents me from taking ideas from them and copying them in things
But it means to reverse it, to take the idea, change it, and apply it to my song in a second form.
They worked on a special team and had more than one CD of people's voices.
Dath about a person named Abdullah Aldail
He has experience and is able to discover groundwater.
Their ability to detect underground water sources.
One of the residents of the city of Marrat
There are a lot of people with experience.
To determine the locations of water before drilling wells
And he may need to or he may dig many wells and there is no water.
Using copper rods or pomegranate branches
Or the figs through which the water sources are identified
What tools does he use?
Mak Mak Discoverer of Groundwater
This is old.
But now they have been replaced by copper antennas.
Now place the two sticks parallel to each other.
And now we walk at a slow pace, not in a hurry.
We see when we pass over a watercourse
Then the bars will open.
Now, now, we are passing through this way now we are passing over a watercourse
It has now opened in this way.
Once we pass, it starts now.
This is now in the middle of the watercourse
And and and and from and and
We can now determine the depth of the watercourse or the watercourse under the ground in this way.
And of course, the process is repeated more than once in more than one location until we find the strongest location.
Abu Ibrahim confirms.
Reaching an advanced stage in this profession
To make his discoveries very accurate.
In the Meraat region and outside Meraat in Shagra, in Aharimla, and in Aethithia.
Over 150 pearls were discovered.
The error rate was five per hundred, not exceeding five per hundred.
You need training, experience, and a gift from God, the Almighty.
Outperforming modern devices and laboratories
And in a very short record time
Abdulrahman Al-Murshid
For the Doha Morning program
The city of Marrat is located northwest of the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh.
We followed this report and promise you that we will have more reports from Arab and international countries, inshallah.
Gulf, hopefully
We have reached you, our viewers, through various posts and addresses, but they all have their meaning.
The big and the first title and
If I expect there to be a large group of young Gulf people in the Gulf itself.
In certain people they follow.
However, it doesn't mean that you should imitate them, but you feel that it's necessary to follow their work first.
And God, they are the leaders of the Gulf, in general, they have a connection between them.
F means I'm not a competitor in competitions, it means I released a song.
And I speak about the subject
Yes, it means to be a competitive like you say, it is purposeful.
There will be a connection between them, but it will be with a specific one.
In Saudi Arabia, Qusai is working, praise be to Allah.
In a big way, he got a CD and he got an audience.
And he has more than one company that can adopt him.
You wish you could reach this stage, and perhaps even surpass it, inshallah.
In sha Allah, we wish you all the best through this group, inshallah, with the permission of Allah.
Of course, and receiving this important sports cup, the Asian Cup, let's see the footage that is on the corniche.
In addition to a group of Qatari youth
The one that moves if it is from the West but in a Gulf style.
Also, emotional songs, rap songs, and a distinguished group of twenty-five people.
It is necessary for one to follow your news first.
I expect you must have an email, a specific website on the internet, or a forum.
How can one reach you?
And God, it was a while ago, we had a special site for us
But if there are any problems with the company, the hosting company.
It was like ice cream sometimes, sometimes I don't know what.
So we had problems with it and finally we turned it off
F khas la'il ma'm al maw'id mataskar mataskar
Okay, what's the alternative now so that we can solve this problem as a team?
In the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, or even in Morocco or Egypt.
The one must communicate with you and know your news and see the songs you produce from time to time.
Faish the alternative now
The alternative is currently relying on private pages, for example.
What exactly is the name?
He is a Jove from Austin Serge but in Google
Rab Qatar or Qatar Rappers
They make video clips even for you
The program worked on it yesterday
We uploaded more than one video to YouTube.
Song and pictures
Song and the same form as a video, but I'll shoot and then edit
I expect that I should see you develop more.
You need a place of your own, but not everyone has a device at home.
And the broken, the computer, the piano, and the guitar.
"And God, honestly, I wish we could get some support."
For example, a company means
We produce CDs for you.
I have reserved a special place for you
From ourselves
But in the end, we remain in a personal job, so to speak.
We don't want it to be a personal job
By God, my words are no different from Yusuf's.
Video clip, we need a video clip
The album
The spread force in the video clip I think is very important.
Because it conveys the information more.
So if there is support, everything comes with it.
Your sweet voices reach everywhere.
It means it is one of the different arts that deal with problems and deal with issues.
Thank you, Yusuf Al Nuaimi and Salman Al Abdulla, for being with us.
And I see her and we wish her all the best of luck, of course, with our program, GooD for Youth.
These projects were good.
In the project, it is almost ready, but it needs some technical development.
End date Price
You've reached the cashier. You have the total and all the details are ready.
And to identify the components and their dangers instead of grasping each part and seeing the components and their dangers.
He is walking in the trolley.
If the item is self-assembling, one can choose the material they want with the highest precision.
Of course, most of the projects were a reflection of the child's feeling about a problem.
He also has different activities and goals.
The center is currently in a group of programs that it designs and events that are based on a main idea.
We have ten goals that Her Highness Sheikha Mozah set for the foundation of the center.
Possibly, possibly, also
He goes directly down to the underground, travels under the ground, and goes to the underground train from his house.
But its main idea is clothes.
Here are all the stores in Qatar that have black T-shirts.
There is also a house key, car key, I have a button I press it
Hey, if you lose your key, I'll give you a call.
Yes, we will return a second time to the projects that you will hopefully carry out through the cultural center.
Weak early education for children
Develop his skills and nurture the gifted.
We move between a set of children's skills, whether they are media or research skills.
If the LL personal skills in speaking to the audience in convincing the audience
With the diversity of all these skills, we create a special program that serves them.
We started from the flags of the future and we have accomplished a great achievement in it now. We have reached the graduation projects and their end.
Also, we reached a large number of young children preachers.
And their creativity
You have a number of young announcers as well.
Back to television means they have to present programs for children.
We are sitting, we are watching TV
Through their television, Qatar TV
Annadam hoo ine an means we end up with them to eight and eighteen years
Welcome to them, they were good
This also means national television
We need to attract, acquire, discover, and develop these talents.
From advertising to research
To issues specific to the thinking process
To read to many diverse fields
In such cooperation between you, you will take ideas from each other.
In every field, for example, the program of Khateeb Al-Wa'ed with the Ministry of Awqaf
Our L.L. Generation Exhibition is also this.
The Science Club played a significant role in developing projects and providing technical support for these projects.
The Supreme Education Council also plays a major role and their support for schools and their partnership is also significant.
Professor Abdullah, your move to this great edifice, Katara.
Which also brings together a large number of events and wonderful activities.
Is this payment considered a payment to the Imam of the center itself?
However, you take a separate building like this.
Far from this great monument.
It gave us a more user-friendly interface for dealing with the public, that is.
And also pioneering and good projects
And in many places, guests are welcomed and introduced to the nature of the programs that the cultural programs that are offered to the child are presented.
Because our main project during these three years is...
The National Project for Developing Children's Reading
Under the patronage of Sheikha Hissa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
She adopted this project and provided it with very significant support.
This is a major project that is the development of reading and writing children's stories, developing their skills.
Different cultures that are related to reading in particular.
Of course, there are many programs.
This means we have recently moved.
Waadi al-An means rearranging some activities now
Its design and development are tailored to the nature of the visitors, meaning Katara.
We certainly wish you all the best, inshallah, through this center.
The one that brings together very important ideas.
Of course, first of all, thank you for this kind hospitality.
The most important thing is that the more we deal with children, the more we discover that our children are like us.
Today's children are not yesterday's children; their childhood is not our childhood.
They need us to give more attention, focus, and time.
Give him enough listening to his interest and imagination.
And I communicate with him mentally.
They work, meaning their way of dealing with their children is like a hotel that provides them with accommodation.
Or it is a bank that provides money
Or it is about the child lacking someone to listen to these ideas, to listen to this imagination.
We were actually moved during the past days in the exhibition, they moved us to twenty to thirty
Through this exhibition
We wish the best of luck to the projects that have won awards.
Thank you for attending with us, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumayli, Director of the Cultural Center for Childhood, and we wish you all the best, God willing.
Even these projects are actually achieved and exist in reality and are not just a dream.
Welcome, our viewers. The Children's Cultural Center concluded its activities on Monday evening at the Diplomatic Club.
National Exhibition of Generations' Dreams under the slogan "Dreams of Generations, Realities of Tomorrow's Nation"
Organized on the occasion of the country's National Day with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar.
The exhibition saw our viewers participate in various activities and different competitions.
Innovative projects for children
Generally, we are pleased on your behalf, our viewers, to host Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumayli, Director of the Cultural Center for Childhood. Welcome and good morning.
Good morning, may God bless you my dear sister.
Thank you for giving the center time.
To talk about this distinctive exhibition is a reality.
We are also pleased with your presence through the program so that we can cover as much as possible all the activities that took place during this exhibition.
This is the National Exhibition of the Dreams of Generations.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Of course, this is the exhibition
Contribution of the Cultural Center for Childhood
National Day celebrations
And of course, he had a very important touch with every child.
To enable children
He lives with a dream.
And with the project
This project or dream
The dreams of children are vast.
Its fields are wide, we have defined them within the framework of what Qatar is twenty to thirty
And other main areas of Qatar's vision 2030
We started training the children in four stages.
And how do brainstorming mechanisms and toolkit mechanisms expand the scope of thinking in a child
What do you mean by this sentence specifically?
These are the facts of the nation of tomorrow.
In other words, what our children dream about today
This project is growing with this project.
This was actually a true interpretation of this vision that children start living from this day.
I dream big
If it is an environmental field or a field such as health and human development and other fields.
The ones that serve the nation's LL
I expect that when we know that there are children in a certain place.
Or in a specific market
Were all these present through
The exhibition had honorary guests.
Guest of honor are those who children can learn from as role models.
Yesterday the Arab fall two or three weeks ago
And they were also winners of various awards in the Arab world.
There was a table to display their projects
Yes, and the photos are certainly proof of your words, Professor Abdullah.
This is a collection of photos that were present in the exhibition and various events.
This is also the owner of the last L.L. project, the owner of the forest.
Innovative or creative
This is one of the children's innovations, praise be to Allah. It's a very beautiful idea that we can expand for the audience.
And we tell it, what is this subject exactly, the colored ball
Approximately four or five projects discussed this topic, one of which was the colored ball.
Or, also, the smart stadium.
This ball, if it goes out of the field.
The color changes.
We will return in the future in the games, God willing.
Okay, what happens after these dreams, you mean?
It also concerns a need that pertains to his interests.
I expect that especially when there are officials in Icon, they will take into consideration these small projects from small minds.
But we don't know if these projects will actually serve us well. The president of the football association here in Qatar is B.B.
My opinion is about the colored ball.
Do you like the idea?
Of course, the cost of his visit was very high and he reviewed the projects related to football.
Road stop and adopt these projects at the moment
Chief of the exhibition at the moment and adopted these projects
The audience also voted for a large number of projects submitted by our children.
Our dear friends, what projects can we say that there was so much emphasis on and vote on them.
Of course, we have our own evaluation method in the evaluation committee, which has a main evaluation method.
These projects are the ones that won the awards, the first, second, and third project.
It was from the forest and won the first prize.
He had very detailed information about the project and the project was ready to start.
Besides administrative, of course, it needs many administrative aspects.
I went into very detailed and precise details, and also distributed the visitor brochure, which means she was ready for her project.
These are definitely the pictures we are watching.
This is a collection, yes, this is also a collection of many projects I participated in.
Perhaps they feel like they have, I mean, it's not that they're sitting there watching movies or cartoons.
No, it was not actually linked; it may be realized in part, which was adopted by institutions.
For example, we give names to projects, what are these projects
This type of alzaydah, how is it used in the house? How is it collected and recycled?
247 students
Qatar University celebrated the graduation of 47 students from the 33rd batch yesterday.
Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al-Otaiba, Minister of State for International Cooperation
A large number of parents and teaching staff members
The university is celebrating the graduation of 7,713 female students today.
Of course, we thank our colleague Salman Al-Majed and we will remain in the same artistic atmosphere. Today, we will have a dear guest with us.
From the family of the series of the artist Abdulhamid Al-Sharchani's works.
Which confirmed his presence in many works, including the series Hearts for Rent.
They have worked hard to prove themselves on the artistic scene.
Especially in the field of art, there are no courtesies.
Which means
Welcome, good morning, and I wish to greet the viewers.
On the contrary, the program is secure, frankly speaking.
I'm going to look at something very simple from one of your works and we'll start the conversation with you.
Laugh at me
Take the fake pashmina and give me the real one.
Spirit and this
Pashto is present
What will happen to the coat when I return it? How do I return it?
Let's grind the snake in her belly, the snake that ate her father.
I am a member of a committee consisting of five members.
The Higher Committee of the Conference
I don't agree with you.
I don’t mind.
If this is a quick clip, it's a simple episode from the series "Tasneef" that I'm going to watch the second part of.
We ask you about your participation this year in the second part.
Speak briefly about your roles in the series, each episode has a different topic.
What does your participation talk about it?
Of course, after what
That era has passed many times.
Mount Maret is also famous.
Acme, which has long been sung by poets over time.
When history is a witness and remains in the memory of cities
And refers to the Iraq of its past
170 kilometers north of the capital city of Riyadh
It is said to be attributed to Amr ibn al-Qais al-Tamimi
It was distinguished by its effects, the sweetness of its water, and the pleasantness of its air.
Poets have sung about it, been entranced by it, and its fame has been linked to its well-known mountain, Kameat.
Ghadir Khumm is said to be.
Of course, the city of Marrat is a city with a rich history.
And it preceded the emergence of Islam
There were old things whose history was unknown, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
We are currently in the situation that...
The great companion Khalid ibn al-Walid, may Allah be pleased with him, ordered the digging of this well when passing through the war of apostasy.
And it has remained so until today.
"A proverb says, 'If you trust me, I will complete it, I will trust you too.'"
If you see a comet, you see the Merah.
Of course, another of the effects is also the Kameet Pond.
The source of the sweet water that has been flowing for years.
Which was enough for the city for a whole year
From the beginning of the rainfall until the next rainy season.
Also, this effect is ongoing, and its creation date is unknown.
Also, there is the bride and there is the groom.
Jabal Kamiet is one of the landmarks of the city of Marrat.
This mountain has been the subject of many proverbs, poems, and verses.
Where it comes to him from all the countries of the Kingdom
One of its most notable effects is the Al-Waliydeh well.
That is because he descended in the days of the Riddah wars and was heading towards Yamama.
He camped there and ordered his men to dig this well.
The water of which people still drink and perform wudu from to this day.
Ya'qut al-Hamawi mentioned in the Dictionary of Countries that Khalid passed by Mirtas
It is an old mud house that has been restored to its original state.
It contains many sections that highlight the region's architectural character and its famous heritage and monuments.
The poet said that when we reached the water, it was the water of Majnah.
Ghadir Kamiet is not Ghadir al-Anjil.
Professor Ayman, there is also a cooperation between the family, the guardian, and the guardian of the child with this center, with the child as well.
And I expect there are different ways that he might be with you first.
The training process management in general
It means that from the moment the trainee, student or child comes to us, we are Ivar
This file contains your complete personal data.
Even his monthly grades are clouded, meaning we are confused.
Our home is a happy program for all
Every four lectures there is a mistake.
Through the user name and password, the guardian can access the account.
We give it to him so he can log in.
Yes, it shows the level he has reached from the beginning of his enrollment to this center until the present day.
Yes, we have several different models that I will follow up on.
We have a little girl
With Professor Ibrahim, we will be honored in a while.
We're going to see so many different models, hopefully we have enough space.
But we got a model of her child.
There will be more than one test in front of you live on air.
We ask her questions in mathematics and different questions
We're going to take a short break and continue with you, and then we'll see this smart girl. Stay with us.
The artist's management has become smart now.
It means that from the first two lines, three saw the work but didn't do it, but the remote control
What's going to tire him out when he has twenty thousand other series.
Mizbout 20,000 true series.
Silsil al-sanah means that some people focus on one thing.
The second works can be seen by placing the works.
It's true, it's not what it seems.
He says he only watches TV during Ramadan.
Of course, we welcome you as a dear guest, Abdul Aziz Al-Sharashni.
You want to address a word to your audience, to your viewers, of course, who love you, I am definitely one of your audience.
I address the word to the people
I say to them every year, and you are the best.
Right, we're going out a lot, we're not going out more, we're just going out more often, of course, I mentioned the reasons.
The next one is better.
We wish you the best of luck in your work this year.
Inshallah there will be a second meeting so we can talk about these plays.
All of it is connected to each other.
Because fashion shows have been receiving a lot of attention from many people and are awaited by lovers of new models.
We welcome our dear viewers via Doha Morning and we are with you via the airwaves.
Today, we are certainly talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of students and students, our children joined this center.
This center offers a wide range of different sciences.
Of course, their focus is on developing various abilities.
And also, hopefully, they will be operating their minds to the fullest.
Professor Name and Professor Ayman Khojal, the executive director of the Skills Development Center.
Hello and good morning
Welcome to you.
And with us is the beautiful wish, the wish for good morning.
Good morning
How old are you, my love?
Ships of the Quay Ships
What an amazing thing! We wish you all the best.
What things do you provide for our sons and daughters?
The explanation was with Professor Ayman and Professor Nesma and was specifically a program that benefits our children.
It is a program for mental mathematics.
Through FTP and through APACS
To achieve some specific goals, we tried to clarify some of them in a simple way
I felt that Professor Ibrahim felt that there was indeed a difference, the student first enters the first two days
And after he completes with you, maybe three or four months.
If he was studying in government, private or even independent schools.
Initially, the program works scientifically in a specific way.
After passing the first level of the program
This explains where the abilities that the child had lost or needed to develop can be reached.
And he has reached a certain point or what developments have occurred with the child
We are walking in a scientific way with a scientific program.
Not just some methods or mechanisms are applied normally.
No, in a scientific and organized manner
Before the start of the program and after taking this course or the levels it went through
Professor Ibrahim is with us now, as you can see. Our guest, Umniha, is a student who joined this center.
We wanted this thing to happen today on the air so we can show our viewers the importance of this matter.
I'll go back, I don't mind.
If this is a quick clip, it's a simple episode from the series "Tasaniif" that I'm going to watch the second part of.
But since we saw this part of the series of the first part of the series
Speak briefly about your roles in the series, each episode has a different topic.
The year focused on what was going to happen
Gaffal Fajal
She urged her while she was sitting down to give chances
Sixteen episodes in the Toons series
Of course, a director of a chapter appears, a chapter appears, a baker appears.
It means various solutions.
Professor Ghanem Al-Sulaiti from Qatar
We have artists from Qatar.
A lot of artists are not banned now, of course, we have female artists from Bahrain, Zahra Arafah, Ibtisam Abdullah.
We have
Faisal Rasheed and Muhammad Adil
Of course, Tara
Unless Tara, the youth would not have represented
Few jobs, we got in Qatar in the past year, two jobs.
Qatar TV also produces drama works, we have Anoual.
Television Ghatar is giving a product to the executor
Qatar TV did not fail, of course, but it only did one show in the year and all the Qatari actors want to work.
And this was the reason
Dit's that one series and all the artists of Qatar want to work on it.
So, even if something happens to you, you say, "Thank God."
Praise be to God in every way.
Okay, let's go back to the beginning.
Of course, thank you very much.
Consult him on a few things
Of course, the artist Abdulaziz Jasim from the judgment of humans to another day to after the diaspora to yes and no
In his plays, we started working with him in the theater. When he produced his first executive producer, Abdulaziz Jasim, we worked with him, we as a theater and television.
He is the one who built us, taught us, and distinguished us.
Of course, after Yoo-wa, Professor Ghanem in the world of talk did not short with us in Fayez Al-Tosh Al-Feen.
Because to be honest, we were given opportunities as young people.
They have 30 to 32 jobs per year
So we have two jobs in the year, thank you, thank you Tara.
Shu'oor Ghatel tab'a nafs al-shi'i min intaq'a Tara lil-intaq'a al-fan'iya
The series' director is Mr. Mounir El Zaher
We're back, our viewers, and today we're talking about reflexology.
Hand massage
This treatment has been practiced since ancient times.
We had a guest with us.
The method of examination is as follows.
Swelling during the menstrual cycle
It feels inside the hand, sometimes like sand, like broken veins inside the hand.
Arch your back.
Of course, our friend Sahbi has his nerves on edge.
You feel a little stressed and anxious.
The left side
Of course, we are now, dear viewers, checking the left part of his body.
Because it is economic in the picture
Any health problem that we know about, like headaches, we know about the dizziness that comes with it.
Heh, in the here
Does it mean a problem
What is this problem exactly here
The ear pockets here
You have a nasal surgery or a problem before
Tap the process icon, but it's taking a while
What is my flesh or something
He gains weight without eating.
The left shoulder hurts.
This is a nerve-wracking day when it takes a lot of nerve to do it.
Ten years ago, I walked barefoot on the sea.
Okay, we know that when someone walks on the sea, they are likely to empty their pockets.
Any uneven surface is not just the sea.
Negative energies can be the cause of the problems.
He may also be surprised that you discovered these things through massage.
Of course, the most important people are children.
Children, praise be to God, for the mother, focus with me.
I am tired of the milk and the food that he uses.
The child met her and put her in the child's car seat
Sugar your hands
Pray, God is great.
After a few seconds, you will notice the child relaxing, then they will start to cry because of the pain here.
Then, suddenly, praise be to God, I saw the gases coming out.
What discoveries did you make, Professor Abdulaziz?
But less than the second problems, I have joints, bones, headaches, thyroid, and obesity.
Secondly, regarding period pain or menstrual cramps or period pain in general.
I focus on a rock or stones or just by clicking here you give orders to the lower back and menstrual cycle problems if you have any pain in you.
In a few seconds, God willing, it will disappear.
The pregnant woman
Childbirth is easier for her.
But here or there of course or who knows
If they told her that she was seventh in the field of being born or ninth
Only on sand
Sand walking is no problem, but on rock, no
Seven dates are the best thing to break one's fast.
And if a wet date falls, it will be enough, God willing.
As the Almighty said, "I seek refuge in Allah from Satan, the accursed," and my discovery of this, of course, is from the Quran.
God means that He is unable to make this dried date come to her, He is unable.
Oh Allah, all praise is due to You, and I seek refuge in Allah from the word "I".
Translation: "Sajjir Sajjir, a small dog"
The bed is for childbirth and is weak, for example, I came to the childbirth bed and held the iron.
And even in private hospitals, you'll notice an East Asian woman.
Now, hopefully, this is actually a custom in East Asia.
My phone is with you, it doesn't need it.
Only mobile
I cooperate with each other, meaning each one of me, advice to every creature who hears me now.
Be careful with charity and be careful with caring for others. You were created to worship God and then
To serve people is the first thing. Second, we are not a man of religion or a sheikh, I am an ordinary person.
Professor Abdulaziz, I thank you for this good meeting. Of course, thank you to our guest who is with us.
A million thanks, God willing, and good luck, Lord.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of the Public Health Department at the Supreme Council of Health, will speak to us in more detail.
Good morning, Sheikh
Let’s directly start with a look at these events.
The truth is a healthy steps program towards Qatar
It means that the program is part of the national strategy to combat obesity.
Four of the ten fattest countries in the world are from the Gulf.
We started a strategy in the Supreme Council of Health, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and other bodies, to combat obesity.
Fearing it will spread more and more, FL FL will be closed soon.
One of the programs to protect against obesity is Healthy Steps Towards Qatar.
They are working on this competition together to make it an international competition.
Of course, the program is six weeks long.
Every week is different from the next one.
To raise awareness among students in the seventh and eighth grades about the importance of health at this age.
Because at the age of one, they mean they understand themselves.
As you remember, the first week was about your favorite fruit.
Week two: walking
You have to walk, meaning of course, the more you walk, the more points you get.
This is a map of Qatar and as one collects points, they apply and take their school forward and a step forward means a step forward.
There will be a nice competition among students.
The third week, he drinks Manbih water, he drinks carbonated water.
He gets used to drinking water when he doesn't need it, a lot of fizzy water, every time he gets thirsty he takes fizzy water, I don't drink water.
Then we have the fourth week, your favorite sport
Some of the games in school are not what he likes.
So we are looking for a sport he likes to play.
To force him to exercise.
The boy eats a healthy meal.
His family knows that he needs to eat a healthy meal to take care of his son.
And the Island Academy is an academy for boys and girls so we take
Of course, this is a successful sample, and God willing, we will increase the experiment in the coming years.
Of course, the students are satisfied, I don't know how they feel, they say our activity is more.
We played more games and enjoyed ourselves more with our colleagues.
The girls say our skin has improved and acne has decreased.
True, true, exactly, he becomes conscious
Fathers know about their children
And they and their colleagues in the second rows say, "What's up?" and learn from them and their colleagues and brothers.
And praise be to Allah, it started to spread that there are many schools enthusiastic about participating in the coming year from now, of course, I mean.
God willing
Of course, the official sponsor was Qtel in support of this.
We had Aspire Zone present sports competitions for students and awareness
On the dining table, that means
Thank God, there are several places, including the ones I mentioned, and some may have been missed.
But thank God everyone participated with what they had.
Some of the brothers were organizing competitions on Saturdays.
There was a variety in it
We tried to make several types and get the largest number of people in.
He is the future generation, that is to say.
In order to generalize this experience or to spread it as much as possible in Qatar.
"Fanateh, this is your first time, so there are a few things you need to adjust."
So after the spread, thank God, now and the results are good.
In sha Allah we are publishing it because there are people now asking, saying why we didn't include you.
Eat healthy food and you will reach this thing without any problem.
We are at this age when he starts from a young age, he will reach what he wants when he is twenty or twenty-five years old.
You mentioned a set of addresses every week, and there was an address in each one
If we return, we will try to make our paragraph today about the conclusion of the events.
Also, if we go back, we remember that in our program there was more than one host.
We go back and forth every week, what was the information we wanted to reach the students with.
In sha Allah my sister first of all of course for example the first week the favorite fruit
Of course, fruits in general, what is the benefit of fruit?
What is the benefit of fruits that contain vitamin C?
He himself begins to know what he likes in the fruit, not all fruits are his enemies, that is.
This means he can have an allergy of one type or two types, but why don't the others eat them?
The second week, people think that it's just walking for the small magicians, why are they walking?
I mean when I grow up I walk
On the contrary, you walk because it calms the mind and the brain.
And it relaxes the human's mind, meaning that when walking, the clarity of the mind improves.
You used to make them walk to the students.
None of them are required to walk, whether at school or at home.
And they score points through their classrooms.
Because they don't mean it every day, you know.
This was an event where people made a march, the girls' school made a march.
We want them to be creative, meaning they have innovative ideas.
The spirit of competition and teachers bring out new ideas, we don't want to give them ideas that they won't go beyond.
Everyone had their own skills in this point.
Of course, in the third week, I drink water, of course, all the time, we try to drink water so that we don't get thirsty and want to take carbonated water.
Of course, your favorite sport is the fourth week
So, if we can reach his favorite sport and support him in it.
He is passionate about sports.
Their love for sports is that they are playing it, they are playing a sport without feeling it.
Since we talked before, we are going to talk about the Qatar Association for Multiple Sclerosis Patients.
Let me welcome our guest for today who has lit up our studio
Welcome to you
Welcome to our program with us.
And this disease, perhaps, is one that many of us have not heard of.
In the beginning, as the Egyptians say, we will dive into the topic.
It is a chronic disease.
Affects the nervous system in the human body
Interval affects people from 20 to 40 years old.
This disease also has no cure so far and no known cause so far for this disease and its infection.
The active segment of society, which is the youth segment, is usually affected.
Treatments used for cancer patients keep evil and other diseases away from you.
This disease is an inflammation of the nerves in the brain and spinal cord.
And it is the central nervous system in the human body
The body prefers that there is a body close to the body
The neuron is a
The following text is already in English: This is the electrical wire that covers the SS.
White blood cells, the first white blood cells, kill or dissolve this insulating layer.
This leads to the nervous signal not reaching, or being weak or disrupted.
It leads to paralysis far from you.
Until now, with the development of medicine and the advancement of medicine, Professor Abdulaziz means that we have not found a solution to this disease yet.
Okay, but we need to know how to get the solution.
Also, one must have protection from this topic.
The direct cause means the nature of life, the nature of food, the circulations of life.
And what exactly is the direct cause that makes a person susceptible to this disease?
Everything that currently exists is a theory
Even by virtue of marriage
They are trying to solve the health problems that humans face.
Yes, yes
All these topics may cause some controversy in society.
So far, we don't know the reasons for it.
The age group that can be affected by this disease, which is sclerosis, is of course the elderly.
Both sexes
Of course, the disease after reaching forty years begins to calm down with the person.
But so far we have not found a cure for this disease.
Does this mean there are actually many people in the Gulf, the Arab world, or even in Qatar?
In Saudi Arabia, statistics say that they have 25,000 infected.
And also Qatar means
I personally know of three to four cases that were recently diagnosed within the last week.
Currently, we have 15055 cases registered in the files.
And many people when diagnosed with this disease go for treatments from other countries for example.
Professor Abdulaziz, are there any effects, for example, if a person is infected with this disease?
Is there any sign that gives the family of this patient or to him personally that I am suffering from multiple sclerosis?
And this virus, for example, began to destroy
He's not a virus, to be honest.
Because the nervous system is controlling the whole body.
So we go or we give a specific reason for a specific place, that the nature of the food, that the nature of the place
