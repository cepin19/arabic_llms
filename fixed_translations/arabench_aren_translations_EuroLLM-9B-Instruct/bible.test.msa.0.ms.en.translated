Who is the greatest
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Then Jesus called a child to him and had him stand among them.
He said, "I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And whoever accepts a child like this in my name, accepts me." Beware of stumbling blocks.
"But if one of these little ones who believe in me should stumble, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea!"
Woe to the world from these setbacks that must come, but woe to those who cause them!
"Therefore, if your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away! It is better for you to enter eternal life maimed than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire."
And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away! It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the hell of fire." The Lost Sheep
Jesus said, "Beware that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I say to you that their angels in heaven always behold the face of My Father who is in heaven."
For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost.
"What would you say about a man who has a hundred sheep, but one of them is lost? Wouldn't he leave the ninety-nine sheep in the field and go after the one that is lost?"
I tell you the truth, when he finds it, he will be happier with it than he is with the ninety-nine sheep that did not stray.
Thus, your Father in heaven does not want any of these little ones to be lost. Do good to your neighbor.
"If your brother sins against you, go and point out his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over."
But if he does not listen to you, take one or two others along with you, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. #two or three. 16:18 See Deuteronomy 19:15.
If he refuses to listen to them, tell the church. If he refuses to listen to the church, then you must treat him as you would a pagan and a tax collector.
"I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
Truly, I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
"For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them." Unlimited forgiveness
Then Peter came to Jesus and asked him, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Then Jesus said to him, "Not seven times, but seventy times seven!" #seventy... times. 22:18 Without limit.
"Therefore, the kingdom of heaven can be likened to a king who decided to settle accounts with his slaves."
When he began to settle his accounts, a man who owed him a very large sum of money came to him. #A very large sum of money. 24:18 Literally: "Ten thousand talents or talents, which is equivalent to about 300,000 kilograms of coins used at that time."
Since he did not have enough to pay off the debt, the man decided to sell himself, his wife, his children, and everything he owned, and use the money to pay off the debt.
"Then the servant bowed on his knees before the king, and begged him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you all the debt.'"
The gentleman felt sorry for him, canceled the debt in full, and let him go.
"As he was leaving, one of his slave friends, who owed him a small amount, grabbed his neck and started choking him, saying, 'Pay me what you owe me.'"
The servant fell to his knees before him and pleaded, "Hold on to me, and I will pay what I owe."
But he refused, and took him and put him in prison until he should pay all his debt.
When the other slaves saw what had happened, they were very sad, and they went to tell their master everything that had happened.
"So the master called him and said to him, 'You wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.
Did you not have to show mercy to your fellow slave as I have shown mercy to you?›
Her husband was very angry and handed him over to be punished until he paid all his debt.
"Thus will your heavenly Father also treat you, unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart."
The union in marriage
After Jesus had finished speaking about these things, he left the region of Galilee and went into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
A large crowd followed him and he healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to Jesus, testing him, and saying, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female'? #Created... male and female. 4:19 Genesis 1:27, 5:2
Then he said, "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh." #leave … one. 5:19 from the book of Genesis 2:24.
And the two will become one flesh; so they are no longer two, but one. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate."
They said to him, "Why, when Moses commanded that a wife be given a certificate of divorce, 7:19 See Deuteronomy 24:1, does she not divorce?"
Jesus answered them, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of the hardness of your hearts, but it was not so from the beginning.
Therefore I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery."
His disciples said to him, "If this is the case between a husband and wife, it is better not to get married!"
Jesus said to them, "Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom God gives the ability to do so."
There are men who cannot marry because they were born without the ability to marry. There are men who cannot marry because people have taken away their ability to marry. And there are men who have chosen not to marry for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this teaching, let him accept it." Jesus welcomes children.
Then they brought children to him so that he might lay his hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.
Then Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven."
Then Jesus placed his hands on them and left that place. The obstacle of wealth
A man came to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good deed must I do to gain eternal life?"
Jesus answered, "Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments."
The man said, "What commandments?" Jesus said, "'You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and your mother,' and 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"
You shall not bear false witness, honor your father and your mother.› #You shall not kill … and your mother. 19:19 From Exodus 20:12-16, and Deuteronomy 5:16-20. And 'Love your neighbor #Love your neighbor. 19:19 By referring to the Gospel of Luke 10:25-37, we understand that the neighbor refers to every person in need of help. As you love yourself.› #Love … yourself. 19:19 From Leviticus 19:18. »
The young man said, "I obey all these commandments, so what is missing from me?"
Jesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
When the young man heard that, he went away sad because he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."
I say to you again, that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
When his disciples heard this, they were astonished and said, "Who then can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Then Peter said to him, "Look, we have given up everything to follow you! What will we have then?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, when the Son of Man sits on his throne in heaven's glory, you who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
"And whoever leaves home or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for My sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life with God."
Many are the first people who will become the last people, and many are the last people who will become the first people.
Like the workers of the vineyard
"The kingdom of heaven is like a man who owned a field. He went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard."
I agreed with the workers to pay them one dinar for each day, then I sent them to work in my vineyard.
"The generous man went out around 9 o'clock and saw some men standing in the market area doing nothing."
He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will give you whatever is right.'
So they went to work in the vineyard. "He went out again about the eleventh hour, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
Around 5 o'clock, he went out again and found others standing in the market area. He asked them, "Why did you stand all day without work?"
"They said to him, 'No one has hired us.' He said to them, 'Go you also and work in my vineyard.'"
"At the end of the day, the generous owner said to his agent, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last to arrive and ending with the first to arrive.'"
"So those who were hired at five o'clock came, and each of them received a denarius."
Then the first group of workers came, thinking that they would receive more, but each of them also received a denarius.
They took it and began to complain about the generous host.
They say, "Those who were hired last worked only one hour, and they were paid the same amount as we were, even though we worked all day in the hot sun!"
"The generous host said to one of them, 'I did not wrong you, my friend! Did you not agree with me to work for one dinar?'
Take your pay and go. I want to give the person I hired at the end of the day the same pay that I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with what I have? Or are you jealous because I'm good with others?›
"Thus the first will become last and the last will become first." Jesus foretells his death and resurrection.
And as Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, he took the twelve aside and said to them:
"We are going to the city of Jerusalem where the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law, who will condemn him to death."
And they will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock and scourge and crucify; and the third day he will rise again." The greatest is the one who serves.
Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's sons with her sons, worshiping him and asking a certain thing of him.
Jesus said to her, "What do you want?" She said to him, "Grant that these, my two sons, may sit, one on your right and one on your left, in your kingdom."
Jesus said, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup #cup. 22:20 Any cup of suffering and pain. Also in verse 23. Which I will drink?" They said to him, "Yes, we can."
He said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but as for sitting at my right and at my left, I will not give it to you unless it is prepared for me by my Father."
When the remaining ten heard this request, they were very angry with the two brothers.
Then Jesus called them to him and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave— just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."
But this should not be among you; but whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.
And whoever wishes to be the greatest among you, let him be your servant.
"So also the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." Jesus heals two blind men.
As they left the city of Jericho, a large crowd of people followed him.
And there were two blind men sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David."
People scolded them and told them to be quiet, but they raised their voices even more: "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us."
Jesus stopped and called them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
They said, "Sir, open our eyes."
Jesus looked at them with compassion, touched their eyes, and they immediately saw and followed him.
The king lives
As they approached Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. You will find a young donkey tied beside its mother. Untie them and bring them to me."
And if one of you says anything to you, say to him, 'The Lord needs them, and he will send them back soon.'"
This happened so that the prophet's words would be fulfilled.
"Tell the dear city of Zion: #dear Zion. 5:21 Literally "daughter Zion." Behold, your king comes to you, humble and riding on a donkey, a young donkey, the foal of a beast of burden."
So the two disciples went and did as Jesus had told them.
So they brought the little donkey and its mother and put their clothes on them, and Jesus sat on the clothes.
Most people spread their robes on the road. But others cut branches from trees and spread them on the road.
The people who were walking in front of him and behind him were shouting, "Long live the king! #Long live the king. 9:21 Literally: "Hosanna." In Hebrew, it means: "Save now." It is likely that here it is a shout of praise to God and His Messiah, the king. Repeated in verse 15. Long live the son of David. Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord. Long live the king in his glory."
And when Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in turmoil. The people were asking, "Who is this?"
And the crowds that followed him said, "This is the prophet Jesus, from the town of Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus in the Temple
Then Jesus went into the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you are making it a den of robbers! #denofrobbers. 13:21 from Isaiah 56:7. But you are turning it into a 'den of robbers!' #denofrobbers. 13:21 from Jeremiah 7:11."
Some blind and lame people came to him in the temple courtyard, and he healed them.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the miracles he did, and they saw the children shouting in the temple courts, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" They were indignant and said to him, "Do you hear what they are saying?"
Jesus answered, "Yes, have you not read, 'Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have perfected praise'?"
Then Jesus left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and he spent the night there. The power of faith
And as Jesus was going into the city early in the morning, he became hungry.
He saw a fig tree on the side of the road, so he went to it, but he found only leaves on it, so he said to it, "You will not bear fruit anymore." The fig tree withered at once.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and asked him, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"
He answered them, "I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but even say to this mountain, 'Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' and it will be done.
And whatever you ask for in prayer, you will receive, if you believe.” Doubting the authority of Jesus
And Jesus went into the temple area, and he began to drive out those who sold things there. He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of robbers." And he was teaching daily in the temple. The chief priests, the scribes, and the leaders of the people were seeking to put him to death, but they did not find a way to do it, for all the people were hanging on his words.
Jesus answered them, "I also will ask you one thing, and answer me: What authority do you have to do these things?"
"Where did John's baptism come from? Is it from God or from man?" They began to discuss it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?' But if we say, 'From man,' all the people will stone us, for they are convinced that John was a prophet."
And if we say that she is from the people, we fear the people, for they all consider John a prophet."
So they answered Jesus and said, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." Like the two sons
Jesus said, "What do you think about the following story: A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work in the vineyard today.'"
The son replied, 'I don't want to go.' But he changed his mind and went.
"Then the father went to his other son and asked him to do the same. The son replied, 'Yes, sir, I will go.' But he did not go."
Which of the two sons did what the father wanted?" They said, "The first." He said to them, "I tell you the truth, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you."
Because John the Baptist came to show you the way of truth, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even when you saw what they did, you did not repent and believe him. Like the son of the owner of the vineyard.
"And listen to another parable: There was a man who owned a vineyard. He planted it, put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a watchtower. Then he rented it to some farmers and went away.
And when it was time to harvest the grapes, he sent his slaves to the farmers to get his share of the grapes.
"But the peasants seized his slaves, beat one of them, killed another, and stoned another."
So the owner sent more slaves than he had sent the first time. The farmers treated them the same way.
Finally, he sent his son, and said to himself, 'They will respect my son.'
But when the peasants saw that this was the son of the landlord, they consulted among themselves and said, 'This is the heir, so let us kill him so that we can take over his inheritance.'
They caught him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
"What do you think the generous owner will do to those farmers when he returns?"
They said to him, "He will destroy them in a terrible way because they are wicked, then he will give the kindness to other farmers who give him fruit in the fruit season."
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read, 'The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the chief cornerstone'? The Lord did this, and it is marvelous in our eyes?"
"Therefore I say to you: the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation that produces the fruit that befits the kingdom."
"Anyone who falls on this stone will shatter, and anyone who falls on the stone will be crushed!"
And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard such parables as these, they knew that He spoke of them.
Therefore, they tried to arrest him, but they were afraid of the people who considered Jesus a prophet.
Like a wedding feast
And Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:
"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son."
The king sent his servants to invite the guests to the wedding feast, but they did not want to come.
So the king sent out other servants and said to them, 'Tell those who have been invited, "Look, my dinner is ready. My fattened calf has been slaughtered. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast."'
"But the invited guests did not care about it, and each of them went his own way. One went to work in his field, and another to his trade."
The rest grabbed the king's slaves, beat them, and killed them.
Then the king was angry and sent his army, which killed those murderers and burned their city.
"Then the king said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy of it."
So go to the street corners and invite everyone you meet to come to the wedding feast.
They went out into the streets and gathered all they found, good or bad, until the banquet hall was filled with guests.
"When King Lear entered to see the guests, he saw a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes."
The king said to him, "O friend, how did you enter here without wearing the wedding clothes?" But the man remained silent.
The king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet, and throw him outside into the darkness, where people cry and gnash their teeth."
"Because many call, but few choose." The Pharisees try to trap Jesus.
So the Pharisees went away and conferred with the Herodians as to what they might do to arrest Jesus.
So they sent their disciples to him with some of the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are a truthful man and that you teach the way of God truthfully. You are not biased toward anyone, because you pay no attention to people's social position.
So tell us your opinion, is it permissible to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
But Jesus knew their wicked intent, and said to them, "You hypocrites, why do you try to trap me?"
Show me the currency you use." So they brought him a dinar.
He said to them, "To whom does this drawing and this name engraved on the dinar belong?"
They said to him, "They are Caesar's." He said to them, "Then give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
When they heard his answer, they were amazed, and left him and went on their way. The Sadducees were trying to trap Jesus.
On that day, some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him,
"O teacher, Moses said, #Moses said. 24:22 Look at the book of Deuteronomy 25:5, 6. If a man dies and leaves no sons, his brother should marry his widow and have a son who will be counted as his brother's son."
There were seven brothers between us, and the first one married and died. Because he had no children, his brother married his widow.
And it happened to the brother, the second, the third, and even the seventh.
After they all died, the woman also died.
Who among the seven will be a wife on the Day of Judgment? They all married her."
Jesus answered them, "You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God."
Understand that in the eternal life after the resurrection of the dead, people do not marry or marry their daughters, but they will be like angels in heaven.
As for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God said?
I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. #I am... Jacob. 32:22 From the book of Exodus 3:6. And God is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living."
When people heard this, they were very impressed by his teaching. The greatest commandment
And when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
A scholar of Islamic law asked him, trying to trap him, and said:
"Teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the law?"
Jesus said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind." #Love the Lord... your mind. 37:22 From Deuteronomy 6:5.
This is the first and greatest commandment.
The second commandment is like the first: "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"The whole of the Sharia and the books of the prophets are related to these two commandments." Christ is the Lord of David.
And while the Pharisees were gathered around him, Jesus asked them:
"What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?" The Pharisees answered, "He is the son of David."
"So he said to them, 'How then did David call him 'Lord,' when he said, 'The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool'?"
"The Lord said to my lord, 'Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet'?"
"If David calls Christ Lord, how can his son be?"
No one could answer him, and no one dared to ask him any more questions.
Jesus criticizes religious leaders
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
He said, "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees have passed on Moses' interpretation of the law."
So keep and practice everything they tell you, but do not do their deeds. For they say, but do not act according to what they say.
They burden people with difficult burdens to carry, but they do not want to make any effort to follow them.
"All the good deeds they do are done so that people will see them. They show off their piety, increasing the size of their headbands. 5:23 Some Jews wrote certain passages from the Bible and put them in small leather bags, then tied them to their forehead or left arm with cloth headbands, showing their strong religiosity. They also lengthen the fringes of their robes."
They like to sit in the best seats at banquets and in the front rows at gatherings.
They like people to greet them with special greetings in the markets, and to call them: ‹Oh teacher.›
"But you, do not let people call you 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
And call not any one of them as father upon the earth, for one is your Father, which is in heaven.
Do not let people call you "My Lord," for you have one Lord, who is Christ.
The greatest among you should be your servant.
"Whoever raises his own status, Allah will lower him, and whoever humbles himself, Allah will raise his status."
"Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law, you hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.
"Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law, you hypocrites! You exploit widows and steal their houses. You pray long prayers to draw attention, so you will receive a harsher punishment."
"Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law, you hypocrites! You go to great lengths to make sure you get even the smallest coin in the temple collection box, but you do no such thing with the collection box for the poor. You travel over land and sea to win one convert to your side, and when you succeed, you make that person twice as worthy of hell as you are."
"Woe to you, you blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears by the temple is bound by nothing, but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is bound.'"
Fools! Which is greater, the gold in the temple or the temple that makes the gold sacred?
"You say, 'If one swears by the altar, it is not binding to keep his oath, but if one swears by the gift that is on the altar, he is bound to keep it!'"
O you who are blind! Which is greater: the offering on the altar, or the altar that makes the offering holy?
Because if one swears by the altar, it is to swear by it and by everything on it.
And if anyone swears by the temple, he swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.
And if anyone swears by heaven, he is swearing by the throne of God and by the one who sits on it.
"Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin. 23:23 A plant whose seeds were used in cooking as spices, and also had some medical uses. And you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.
O wise guides, you lift the mosquito from your cup, but you swallow the camel!
"Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and self-indulgence."
O you Pharisees, you hypocrites, you clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
"Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which appear beautiful on the outside but are inside full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness."
So you also appear righteous on the outside, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and evil.
"Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
You say, "If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have participated in the killing of prophets."
By this, you confirm that you are the descendants of those who killed the prophets.
Complete what your fathers started.
"Snakes, offspring of vipers! How can you escape the judgment of hell?"
Therefore, I tell you that I will send you prophets, wise men, and teachers. And some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city.
Therefore, you will be held accountable for the blood of every innocent person killed on earth: from the blood of the innocent Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, #Abel... Zechariah. 35:23 The first and last of those killed according to the time and text of the Old Testament. (See Genesis 4:8 and 2 Chronicles 24:20) Who was killed between the temple and the altar.
"I tell you the truth, the punishment for all these crimes will fall on this generation. Jesus warns the people of the city of Jerusalem"
"O Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone the messengers of God to you! How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!"
But your house will be left empty and abandoned!
For I say to you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!' #Blessed... the Lord. 39:23 Psalm 118:26.
Jesus foretells the destruction of the Temple
And Jesus left the temple area. As he was walking away, his disciples came up to him, because they wanted to see the temple buildings.
Jesus said to them, "Do you see all these buildings? Truly I tell you, not one stone will be left here on another; every one will be thrown down."
While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered them, "Watch out that you are not deceived."
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will mislead many.
You will hear news of wars and revolutions, but you should not be afraid. These things must happen, but they will not be the end of the world yet."
Because nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes and famines.
But these will all be the first labor pains.
"They will hand you over to be punished, and they will kill some of you. And all the nations will hate you because of my name."
At that time, many will abandon their faith, and one will betray another to the authorities, and they will hate each other.
False prophets will appear and deceive many.
Because of the increase in wickedness, the love of many believers will grow cold.
But he who remains faithful to the end, this one will be saved.
And he will proclaim the gospel of the kingdom throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
"When you see the 'abomination that causes desolation' #abomination that causes desolation. 15:24 See Daniel 9:27, 12:11, and also Matthew 11:31. This is what the prophet Daniel referred to, standing in the holy place – for the reader to understand this statement."
Let all who are in Judea flee to the mountains then.
The person on the roof does not come down to take his belongings from the house.
The field worker does not go home to pick up his clothes.
"And how difficult were the conditions for pregnant and nursing women in those days!"
But pray that your flight will not be in winter or on the Sabbath.
For in those days there will be such distress, not since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever shall be.
And if God had not decided to shorten those days, no one would have survived. But for the sake of his chosen people, God will shorten those days.
If anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.
Because more than one false Messiah will appear, and more than one false prophet. And they will perform signs and wonders to deceive the elect of God if they could.
I told you everything before it happened.
"Someone may say, 'Look, the Messiah is in the wilderness,' but do not go there. Or he may say, 'Look, he is in one of the rooms,' but do not believe him."
Because as the lightning comes from the east and shines to the west, so will the Son of Man appear.
Wherever you find the body, you will also find the vultures.
Immediately after the distress that will occur in those days, 'The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.'
"At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. The tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with great power and glory."
And He will send His angels with the loud trumpet and they will gather those whom He has chosen from the four directions, from one end of the sky to the other.
"Learn from the fig tree. As soon as its branches become tender and its leaves appear, you know that summer is near."
Thus, when you see all these things, you will know that the time is near. 33:24 Compare with Luke's Gospel 21:31. It is near at the doors.
I tell you the truth: This generation will not pass away until all these things take place.
The sky and the earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. Only the Father knows.
"But no one knows when that day or hour will come, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father."
"As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be when the Son of Man comes."
In the days before the flood, people ate and drank and married and gave their daughters in marriage until the day Noah entered the ark.
They did not know what would happen, until the flood came and took them. So will it be at the coming of the Son of Man.
At that time, two men working in a field, one is taken and the other is left.
Two women are grinding grain on a millstone, one is taken and the other is left.
"So wake up, for you do not know when your Lord will come."
Make sure that if the homeowner knew what time of night the thief intended to come, he would wake up and not let him rob his house.
Therefore, be prepared also, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. The good servant and the evil servant
"Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master will set over his household, to give them their food in due time?"
Happy is the servant who, when his master comes, finds him doing his duty.
I tell you the truth, he will entrust him with all his possessions.
The wicked servant says to himself, 'My master will be late.'
He starts beating his fellow servants, and he starts eating and drinking with the drunkards.
The master of that servant will come on a day he does not expect, and at an hour he does not know.
He will punish him and place him with the hypocrites, where people cry and gnash their teeth.
Like the ten girls
"Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom."
Five of them are stupid, and five are smart.
The foolish ones took their lamps, but they did not take any extra oil with them.
The intelligent ones took extra oil in their jugs with the lamps.
The groom was late, so all the girls were upset and fell asleep.
"But at midnight, one of them shouted, 'The groom is coming, so let's go out to meet him.'"
"Then the girls woke up and lit their lamps."
The foolish ones said to the wise ones: 'Give us some of your oil, our lamps are almost out.'
"The clever ones replied, 'We can't, it's not enough for us, but go to the vendors to buy oil yourselves.'"
"While they were going to buy oil, the groom arrived. The bridesmaids were ready, so they went with him to the wedding feast. Then the door was closed."
"Finally, the other girls came and said, 'Sir, Sir, open the door for us.'"
"But he said, 'I tell you the truth, I don't know you!'"
Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know the day or the hour when the Son of Man will come. It is like this with three slaves
"The kingdom of heaven is also like a man who was about to go on a journey. He called his servants and entrusted his entire property to them."
He gave one of them five bags #five bags. 15:25 Literally "mina or qintar" and a mina is equivalent to about 27 to 36 kilograms of gold or silver or copper. Of money, and he gave the second two bags, and the third one bag. He gave each according to his ability. Then he traveled immediately.
So the one who took the five bags started investing them immediately in trade, and earned five more bags.
And the man who took the two bags did the same, and he gained two more bags.
The one who took one bag went and dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money in it.
"After a long time, the master of these slaves returned and began to account for them."
The man who took the five bags came and gained five more, saying, "My lord, you gave me five bags, and these are five more that I have gained."
His master said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful with a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master."
"Then came the one who took the two bags and said, 'My lord, you gave me two bags, and these are two more bags that I earned.'"
His master said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful with a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master."
"Then came the one who took one bag, and said, 'Sir, I know you are a hard man, for you reap from a crop you did not plant, and gather from fields you did not sow."
I was afraid of you, so I went and hid your bag in the ground. Take your belongings.›
His master replied, "You are a wicked and lazy slave. Since you know that I reap from a crop I did not plant and harvest from fields I did not sow,
Why didn't you deposit my money in the bank, and when I returned, I took my money with interest?
"So take the bag from him and give it to the owner of the ten bags."
Because it will give more to those who have, and it will overflow, but those who have nothing will even be taken from them what they have.
But the worthless servant, throw him outside into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. The Son of Man is the judge.
"And when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne.
Then all the nations will be gathered before him. And he will separate some from others, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats in his flock.
He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
"Then the King will say to those at his right hand, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."
For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you took me in.
I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you looked after me. I was in prison and you visited me.›
The righteous will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you a drink?'
And when did we see you a stranger and give you shelter, or naked and clothe you?
And when did we see you sick or in prison, and visit you?
The king says, "I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."
"Then the King says to those standing on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.'"
Because I was hungry you did not feed me. I was thirsty and you did not give me water.
I was a stranger and you did not take me in, I was naked and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not visit me.›
The wicked will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?'
"The king says, 'I tell you the truth, when you neglected to do this for one of my weak brothers, you neglected to do it for me.'"
"Thus the wicked go to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life."
Jewish leaders plan to kill Jesus
After Jesus had finished this discourse, he said to his disciples:
"You know that Easter is tomorrow, and the Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of his enemies to be crucified."
The chief priests and the elders of the people gathered at the house of Caiaphas the high priest.
They planned to capture Jesus by deception and kill him.
They said, "We should not do this during the holiday, to avoid riots among people." A woman pours perfume on Jesus
And while Jesus was in the town of Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,
A woman came to him, and she had a precious perfume in a glass bottle, so she poured it on his head while he was eating.
And when his disciples saw it, they were indignant and said, "Why this waste?"
It was possible that this perfume could be sold for a large sum of money to be given to the poor.
Jesus knew what they were talking about, so he said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a wonderful thing for me."
The poor will always be with you, #thepoor... always. 11:26 See Deuteronomy 15:11. But I will not always be with you.
I poured the perfume on my body to prepare it for burial.
I tell you the truth: wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her.” Judas Iscariot betrays Jesus.
Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said,
He said to them, "What will you give me if I deliver him to you?" They weighed out for him thirty silver coins.
From that moment on, Judas began to look for a suitable opportunity to betray Jesus to them. At the Passover table.
And on the first day of the unleavened bread, the disciples came to him and said, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover?"
Jesus said, "Go to such-and-such in the village, and tell him, 'The Teacher says, My appointed time is near, and I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.'"
So the disciples did as Jesus had instructed them and prepared the Passover meal.
And when evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.
And as they were eating, he said to them, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
So they were sad and began to ask him one after another, "Is it me, Lord?"
Jesus answered, "The one who dips his hand with me in the dish is the one who will betray me."
The Son of Man will go as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It would be better for him if he had not been born!"
So Judas, who was going to betray him, asked, "Is it I, Rabbi?" And Jesus said to him, "You have said so." The Lord's Supper
While they were eating, he took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
Then he took a glass of wine, thanked, and gave it to them, saying: "Drink from this, all of you."
For this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
I tell you that I will not drink this wine until the day I drink it anew in the kingdom of my Father."
After that, recite some hymns, and go out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus foretells Peter's denial
Then Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away because of me tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'"
But after I rise from the dead, I will go ahead of you to Galilee."
Peter replied, "Even if everyone loses faith in you, I can't lose faith in you."
Jesus said to him, "Truly, I say to you, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."
Then Peter said to him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you!" And all the disciples said the same. Jesus prays alone.
Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
He took Peter and the sons of Zebedee with him, and began to feel sorrowful and troubled.
Then he said to them, "My sorrow is so great that it almost kills me! Stay here and keep watch with me."
And Jesus moved a little away from them, and bowed his head and began to pray, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as you will." 39:26 This is the cup of suffering and pain. Repeated in verse 42. But not as I will, but as you will.
He came to his disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?
Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. Your spirit indeed is willing, but your flesh is weak."
And he stepped back to pray, saying, "O my father, if it is not possible for me to cross this cup, but I must drink it, then let your will be done."
Then he returned again and found them asleep, for sleep had weighed down their eyes.
He left them and went to pray a third time, saying the same words he had said the first time.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? The hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
Come, let us go. The man who betrayed me is near.” The arrest of Jesus
While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, appeared, and with him a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
The traitor gave them a signal and said, "The one who approaches is the man you are looking for, so arrest him."
So he came up to Jesus and said to him, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him.
Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you have come for." Then they came up and seized Jesus and arrested him.
One of the men who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Don't you realize that I can call upon the Father, and He will send me more than twelve legions of angels at once?
But if you do, how will the books that announced that these things would happen come true?"
And at that moment Jesus said to the crowd, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were a criminal? Every day I was in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me!"
But this happened so that the scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled." Then all the disciples deserted him and fled. Jesus in front of the Jewish leaders
Then, those who had arrested him led him to the house of Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had gathered.
But Peter followed him from a distance and went into the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat with the guards to see what would happen in the end.
The chief priests and all the members of the Jewish council were looking for false testimony against Jesus so that they could kill him.
But they did not find it, although many false witnesses came forward and told lies about him. Finally, two men came forward,
They said, "This man, #this man. 61:26 That is Jesus, for his enemies avoided speaking his name! He said, 'I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
The high priest stopped and said, "Will you not defend yourself against all the charges these two men bring against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. So the high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God."
Jesus answered, "I am he. And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has blasphemed God. What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, you have now heard his blasphemy."
"So what do you decide?" They replied, "He deserves death."
Then they spat in his face, struck him with their fists, and beat him.
They said to him, "Prophesy to us, Christ, who is it that struck you?" Peter denies Jesus
Meanwhile, Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. Then the servant of the high priest came to him and said, "You were also with Jesus the Galilean."
But Peter denied it before everyone and said, "I don't understand what you're saying!"
Then he went out to the gate of the courtyard, and another servant girl said to those who were there, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
But Peter denied it again, saying, "I do not know the man."
Soon, the people standing there came to him and said to him, "You are indeed one of them, for your accent reveals that you are a Galilean."
Then he began to curse #curse. 74:26 That is, he swore by himself that he was cursed if he was lying! He swore and said, "I do not know this man." Immediately the rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered the words Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times," and he went out and wept bitterly.
Jesus before the governor Pilate
The next morning, the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered and consulted to kill Jesus.
They seized him, led him away, and handed him over to the governor Pilate. Judas kills himself
When Judas, who betrayed Jesus, saw that they had decided to condemn Jesus to death, he regretted what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He said to them, "I made a mistake by handing over an innocent person to be killed." They said to him, "What does this have to do with us? Take care of this yourself."
So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went and hanged himself.
So the chief priests took the coins and said, "It is not lawful for us to put this money into the treasury, because it is the price of blood."
So they decided to buy the Fekari field to be a cemetery for strangers.
Therefore, the field is known as the "Blood Field" to this day.
And thus was fulfilled what God said through the prophet Jeremiah: "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price at which the people of Israel agreed to pay him."
Buy the field of the potter, as the Lord commanded me." #Take... the Lord. 10:27 See Zechariah 11:12-13, and Jeremiah 32:6-9. Jesus before Pilate
And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And Jesus said, "It is as you say."
And when the high priests and elders complained to him, he said nothing.
Then Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the many charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus gave Pilate no answer to any of the charges against him. Pilate was amazed at his silence. Pilate failed to release Jesus.
The governor would release a prisoner of their choice on Easter.
There was a notorious prisoner named Barabbas. #Barabbas. 16:27 Or "Jesus Barabbas" as in some Greek versions.
When the crowd had gathered, Pilate said to them, "Which one do you want me to release for you: Jesus who is called Christ, or Barabbas?"
Pilate knew that they had handed Jesus over to him out of envy.
While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message saying, "Do not do anything to this innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal because of a dream about him last night."
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd to ask for the release of Barabbas and the killing of Jesus.
The governor said, "Which one of the two do you want me to release for you?" They said, "Barabbas."
So Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said, "Let him be crucified."
Then Pilate said to them, "Why? What crime has he committed?" But they shouted even more, "Let him be crucified."
When Pilate saw that it was no use, but that a riot was beginning, he took some water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves."
Then all the people said, "His blood be on us and on our children."
Then Pilate released Barabbas to them, and after having Jesus flogged, he handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
Then the governor's soldiers led Jesus to the governor's palace, and they gathered a cohort of soldiers around him.
They stripped him of his clothes and put a scarlet robe on him. #put on... color. 28:27 Or purple, mocking him, for this is the color of a king's robe.
They wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
Then they spat on him, took the cane from his hand, and started hitting him on the head.
When they had finished mocking him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him. Jesus on the cross
When they came out, they found a man from the city of Cyrene named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross.
And when they came to a place called "Golgotha," that is, "Place of the Skull,"
Give Jesus wine mixed with a bitter substance to drink. When he tasted it, he refused to drink.
And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them.
Then they sat there guarding him.
And they placed a sign over his head, which read, "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews," as his accusation.
Two criminals were crucified with Jesus, one on his right and one on his left.
And the Maroons would curse at him and shake their heads.
They said, "You, who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself, if you are the Son of God, and come down from the cross!"
And he mocked the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders.
"He has delivered others, but he cannot deliver himself! He is the King of the Jews! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him!"
"He put his trust in God, so let God save him now if He truly wants to. Didn't he say, 'I am the Son of God'?"
And the two criminals who were crucified with him also heaped abuse on him with similar words. The death of Jesus
From noon until three o'clock in the afternoon, darkness covered the whole earth.
Around the third hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" #Eli... sabachthani. 46:27 From Psalm 22:1. Meaning: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
When some of those standing there heard him, they said, "He is calling Elijah!" #Calling Elijah. 47:27 The word "Eli" in Hebrew and "Elo" in Aramaic is similar to the name "Elijah," a well-known prophet who lived around 850 BC.
Then one of the people standing there quickly grabbed a sponge, dipped it in vinegar, and placed it on a long reed, offering it to him to drink.
The others said, "Let us wait and see if Elijah comes to save him!"
Then Jesus cried out again in a loud voice, and gave up his spirit.
The veil of the temple was torn #The veil of the temple. 51:27 The veil that separated the "Holy of Holies" from the rest of the Jewish temple. The Holy of Holies represented the divine presence. In two, from top to bottom, the earth shook, and the rocks were split.
And the graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints which slept arose.
After Jesus arose, those bodies came out of their graves, entered the holy city, and appeared to many.
The Roman officer, literally "centurion," and the guards who were guarding Jesus' body, when they saw the earthquake and the other events, were very afraid and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
There were also some women who stood at a distance, watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. #sons of Zebedee. 56:27 James and John. Jesus was buried
When evening came, a rich man named Joseph, from the town of Ramah, came to the city of Jerusalem. He too was a disciple of Jesus.
So he went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that the body be given to him.
So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a new linen cloth.
Then he placed him in his new grave, which he had dug in the rock, rolled a large stone over the entrance to the grave, and left.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. They were guarding Jesus' tomb.
The next day, after Friday had ended, the chief priests and the Pharisees met with Pilate.
They said to him, "Sir, we remember that this deceiver said before he died, 'After three days I will rise again.'"
He ordered that the tomb be guarded until the third day, so that his disciples would not come and steal the body and then say to the people, 'He has risen from the dead.' This deception would be worse than the first."
Then Pilate said to them, "Take a guard of soldiers, and go and make sure of all things by your knowledge."
They went and secured the tomb. They sealed the stone and stationed guards on it.
Resurrection of Jesus
After the Sabbath, when the first day of the week had already come, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
A strong earthquake occurred at that moment, because the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, went to the tomb, rolled the stone away from the door, and then sat on it.
His appearance was as bright as lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow.
The guards were very afraid of him and became like dead men.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
He is not here, he rose from the dead as he said before. Come and see the place where he was.
Then go quickly to his disciples and tell them, "He has risen from the dead, and he will go before you into Galilee; there you will see him." Behold, I have told you."
Then the two women quickly left the tomb, and their fear was mixed with great joy, and they ran to tell Jesus' disciples what had happened.
And suddenly Jesus met them and said, "Peace." So they came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me." The false report
As the two women were on their way, some of the guards went to the city and told the high priests everything that had happened.
The chief priests met with the elders, consulted among themselves, and then gave the soldiers a lot of money.
They said to them, "Tell the people that Jesus' disciples came at night and stole his body while you were asleep."
If this news reaches the governor, we will convince him and keep you safe.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. And this story has been passed down among the Jews to this day. Jesus speaks to his disciples.
The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain that Jesus had told them to go to.
And when they saw him, they fell down before him, but some of them doubted.
Jesus approached them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
"And teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And remember that I will be with you always, to the end of the age."
John the Baptist
This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah: "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way."
"A voice of a man calling in the wilderness, saying, 'Prepare the way of the Lord. Make straight the paths for him.'"
John the Baptist came baptizing in the wilderness, and he called on people to be baptized as a sign of their repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the people of the region of Judea and the city of Jerusalem came out to him, and he baptized them in the Jordan River after they confessed their sins.
His clothes were made of camel wool, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
He would announce and say: "A man greater than I will come after me, and I am not worthy to bow down and untie his shoe laces."
I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." The Baptism of Jesus
And in those days, Jesus came from the town of Nazareth in the region of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
At the moment he came out of the water, he saw the sky open, and he saw the Holy Spirit descending on him in the form of a dove.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased." Jesus' experience
And the spirit led Jesus alone into the wilderness.
And he was there for forty days, facing the devil's temptations. He was with wild animals, and the angels were serving him. Jesus chose some of his disciples.
And after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,
He said, "The time has come, the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe in this good news."
While walking on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men."
They left their nets immediately and followed him.
Then he walked a little and saw James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John, who were in their boat mending their nets.
Jesus called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the workers and followed him. Jesus casts out an evil spirit.
Then they went to Capernaum, and on the Sabbath day Jesus entered the synagogue and began to teach.
They were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the teachers of the law.
And in the synagogue was a man with an unclean spirit. The spirit cried out,
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are; you are the Holy One of God."
Jesus rebuked him and said, "Be quiet and come out of him!"
So the unclean spirit caused the man to have a seizure, and he cried out with a loud voice and came out of him.
Everyone was amazed, and they began to say to each other, "What is this new teaching? It commands unclean spirits, and they obey him."
The news about him spread quickly throughout the region of Galilee. Jesus heals many.
Then they left the synagogue and went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
And Simon's mother-in-law was in bed, sick with a fever. So they told Jesus about her.
So he approached her, took her hand, and sat her down. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.
That evening, at sunset, they brought to him many sick people, including those with evil spirits.
The entire city population gathered at the door of the house.
Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases, and he drove out many evil spirits. But Jesus did not allow the spirits to speak, because they knew who he was. Preparation to proclaim the Good News
In the early morning, before sunrise, Jesus went out alone to a solitary place and prayed.
So Simon and those with him went to look for him.
And when they found him, they said to him, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered them, "Let us go elsewhere to the nearby towns, so that I may preach there also, for that is why I came."
He went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. Jesus healed a leper.
A leprous man came to Jesus, fell on his knees before him, and pleaded with him, saying, "If you want to, you can make me clean."
Jesus was moved with compassion, reached out and touched him, and said, "I want to. Be cleansed."
The leprosy left the man, and he became clean.
Then Jesus warned him strongly before dismissing him.
He said to him, "Tell no one what has happened to you, but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." 44:1 For the priest was the one who decided according to the law when the leper was considered clean. And he was to offer the sacrifice for your cleansing as Moses commanded. 44:1 See Leviticus 14:1-32. Then the people will know that you have been healed."
But the man set out and began to spread the news of his healing everywhere, so that it became difficult for Jesus to enter any city openly, but he stayed in remote places, and people came to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a paralytic
After several days, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and news of his return spread.
Many people gathered, so much so that there was no room left, not even outside the door. Jesus was speaking to the people with the word of God.
They brought to him a paralytic, carried by four men.
But they could not bring him to Jesus because of the crowd. So they removed the roof above the place where Jesus was and, after they had made a hole, they let down the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "My son, your sins are forgiven."
Some of the Sharia teachers were sitting there, and they were thinking to themselves:
"Why is this man speaking in this manner? He is insulting God with his words! Who but God alone can forgive sins?"
Jesus knew what their thoughts were, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?
Which is easier? To say to a paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat, and walk'?
But I will show you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." He said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat, and go home."
"I say to you, get up, take your bed, and go home!"
He got up, took his bed and walked in full view of everyone. They were all amazed and praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!" Levi (Matthew) follows Jesus.
Jesus returned to the lake again. He taught the crowds that followed him there.
While he was walking, Levi saw him sitting at the tax collector's booth. He said to him, "Follow me!" So he got up and followed him.
While Jesus was eating in the house of Levi, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples. Many were there when Jesus called Levi, and they followed Jesus.
When the Pharisees and the teachers of the law saw him eating with the tax collectors and the sinners, they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with the tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, "Those who are healthy do not need a doctor, but those who are sick do. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners." Question about fasting
And it was the time of fasting for the disciples of John and the Pharisees. And some people came to Jesus and asked him, "Why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not?"
Jesus said to them, "Can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? As long as the bridegroom is with them, they cannot fast."
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast.
No one patches an old garment with a new piece of cloth, because the new piece of cloth will shrink and tear the old garment, making the hole worse.
And no one pours new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled, and the skins will be ruined. No, new wine is poured into new wineskins." Jesus: Lord of the Sabbath
On a Saturday, Jesus was walking through some fields, and his disciples began to pick grain as they walked with him.
Then the Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath!"
He said to them, "Did you never read in the Scriptures what David did when he and those who were with him were hungry, how he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?"
Led by Abiathar the priest, they entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which only priests were allowed to eat. #26:2 See 1 Samuel 21:1-6.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath."
So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”
Jesus heals on the Sabbath
And Jesus went again to the synagogue, and there was a man there whose hand was withered.
Some people watched him closely, to see if he would heal, to find a reason to accuse him.
Then he said to the man with the withered hand, "Get up and come here!"
Then he said to them, "Is it permissible to do good or harm on the Sabbath? Is it permissible to save a human life or kill him?" They fell silent.
Jesus looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubbornness, he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out and it was completely restored.
So the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians as to how they might arrest Jesus. Many followed Jesus.
Jesus and his disciples went to the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd from Galilee and Judea followed him.
From Jerusalem, Edom, and the east of the Jordan River, and the areas around Tyre and Sidon, they were a large gathering. They all came to him because of what they had heard about his deeds.
Jesus asked his disciples to prepare a boat for him so that the crowds would not press around him.
Since Jesus had healed many, everyone who suffered from an illness tried to reach him to touch him.
And unclean spirits would fall down before him and cry out, "You are the Son of God!"
He strongly warns her not to reveal who he is. The selection of the twelve
Then Jesus went up the mountain and called to him those he wanted, and they went with him.
Jesus chose twelve men and called them apostles, to be with him, and to send them to different places.
It gives them authority to cast out evil spirits.
They are: Simon, whom Peter called,
James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John, whom Jesus called "Boanerges" - which means "sons of thunder."
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, #Zealot. 18:3 From an Aramaic word meaning "zealous." That is, belonging to a Jewish political party that resists Roman rule, called the Zealots.
And Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. The power of Jesus was from God, and Jesus returned home.
People gathered around him and his disciples again, so much so that they didn't even find time to eat.
When Jesus' family heard about his coming, they came to take him with them, because people were saying he was crazy!
The teachers of the law who came from Jerusalem said, "There is Beelzebul in him. #Beelzebul is one of the names of the devil. He casts out evil spirits by the prince of the spirits of evil."
Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables, saying, "How can Satan cast out a demon?
Because if a kingdom is divided and its people fight, it will not last.
And if a house is divided against itself, it will not stand.
