The greatest in the kingdom of heaven
At that hour, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus called the boy to him and raised him up in their midst.
"Truly I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
For one who puts himself in this way, the child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And before, a child like this with my name had accepted me.
And if one of these little believers in me should stumble, it would be better for him to have a millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
Woe to the world from stumbling! Stumbling must come, but woe to that man in whom stumbling comes!
If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled or maimed than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire.
And if your eye offends you, pluck it out and throw it from you. It is better for you to enter the life with one eye than to be thrown into the fire of hell with two eyes. You have two eyes, like the lost sheep.
"Look, do not despise any of these little ones, for I say to you: their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven."
For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost.
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that is lost?
And if he finds it, I swear to you, he rejoices more than the ninety-nine that did not go astray.
Thus it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish. If your brother sins against you
"And if your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you two alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother."
And if he does not listen, take along with you one or two, so that every word may be confirmed by the mouth of two or three witnesses.
And if they do not listen to them, tell it to the church. And if they do not listen to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.
Verily, I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
And I also say to you: If two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
"For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in their midst." Like the servant who does not forgive.
Then Peter came to him and asked, "Lord, how many times shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?"
Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you until seven times, but until seventy times seven times."
Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a man, a king, who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
So when he started to settle accounts, a debtor of ten thousand gold pieces came to him.
And if he has nothing to pay his master's debt, he and his wife and children and all that he has shall be sold, and the debt shall be paid.
The slave was proud and bowed before him, saying: "My Lord, be patient with me so that I may repay all of them."
The Lord of that slave opened his heart and released him, and left him his religion.
When that slave went out, he found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred dinars. He grabbed him and took hold of his neck, saying: Pay me what you owe me.
Fakhr al-'Abd was pleased with his companion on his feet and asked him, saying: "Slow down, I will repay you all."
He did not respond, but went and threw him in prison until he pays the debt.
When the slaves saw what had happened to their companion, they were very sad. They came and told their master everything that had happened.
Then his lord called him and said to him, "You wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me."
Should you not also have mercy on your fellow slave as I have had mercy on you?
Her mistress was angry and handed him over to the tormentors so that he would pay everything he owed her.
"Thus does my heavenly Father do to you if you do not each forgive your brother from your hearts."
Marriage and Divorce
When Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.
And a large crowd followed him, and he healed them there.
The Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?"
And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?
He said, "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."
If they are not two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate."
They said to him, "Why did Moses command that a bill of divorce be given, so that she be divorced?"
He said to them, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of the hardness of your hearts, but from the beginning it was not so.
I say to you: whoever divorces his wife except for unchastity and marries another, he has indeed committed adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman has indeed committed adultery."
His disciples said to him, "If that is the case with a man and a woman, it is not appropriate for him to marry!"
He said to them, "Not everyone will accept this message, but only those to whom it has been given."
Because there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept this, let him accept it." Jesus blessed the children.
Then the children came to him so that he could lay his hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.
But Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven."
He put his hands on them and left. The rich young man
And one of them, approaching him, said, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
He said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except one, God. But if you want to enter life, keep the commandments."
He said to him, "Which ones?" Jesus said, "You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,
"Honor your father and your mother, and love your neighbor as yourself."
The young man said to him, "I have memorized all of this since my youth. What else do I need?"
Jesus said to him, "If you wish to be complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
When the young man heard the word, he went away sad, because he had a lot of money.
Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven!"
And I also say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God!"
When his disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, "Who then can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Then Peter answered and said to him, "Behold, we have left all and followed you. What then will we have?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly, I say to you, that you who have followed me in the new creation, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of his glory, you will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.
Like the doers in the garden
"For the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard,"
I agreed with the thief on a dinar per day and sent them to his farm.
Then he went out around 3 o'clock and saw others standing in the marketplace, idle.
So he said to them, "You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you." So they went.
And he also went out around 6 and 9 o'clock and did the same.
Then, around 11 o'clock, he went out and found others standing idle, so he said to them: "Why have you stood here all day idle?"
They said to him, "Because no one hired us." He said to them, "Go you also into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you."
When it was evening, the host said to his agent: "Call the workers and give them their wages, starting with the last ones and going back to the first ones."
At eleven o'clock, the owners of the hour came and took a dinar, a dinar.
When the first ones came, they thought they would take more. So they also took a dinar at a time.
And as they were taking, they complained to the master of the house
Saying: "These others worked for one hour, and they equated us with those of us who endured the weight of the day and the heat!"
He replied and said to one of them: "My friend, I did not wrong you! Did we not agree on one dinar?"
Take what is yours and go. I want to give this last one to you as well.
Or is it okay for me to do what I want with what I have? Or is your eye evil because I am good?
Thus, the last will be first, and the first will be last, for many are called, but few are chosen." Jesus foretells his death and resurrection.
And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside on the way and said to them,
"We are ascending to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn Him to death."
And they will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock him and flog him and crucify him, and on the third day he will be raised up." The mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, kneeling and asking a certain thing of him.
Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, bowing down and asking a certain thing from him.
He said to her, "What do you want?" She said to him, "Say that these two sons of mine will sit, one on your right and the other on your left, in your kingdom."
Jesus answered, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?" They said to him, "We can."
He said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, and you will be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with. And you will sit at my right and at my left, and I will give them to you, just as my Father has given them to me."
When the ten heard this, they became angry on account of the two brothers.
Jesus called them and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them.
Thus it is not to be among you. But whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.
And the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." Healing of two blind men in Jericho
As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed them.
And if two blind men were sitting on the road, and they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, saying, "Have mercy on us, Lord, you son of David!"
The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet. But they shouted all the more, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
Jesus stopped and called out to them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
They said to him, "Sir, open our eyes!"
Jesus opened their eyes and touched them, and immediately they regained their sight and followed him.
Entry into Jerusalem
And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
"Go to the village ahead of you," he said to them, "and you will find a donkey tied up and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me."
And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord needs them'; and immediately he will send them."
All this was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet:
"Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your King is coming to you, humble, and mounted on an ass, and on a colt, the foal of an ass.'"
So the two disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.
And they brought the donkey and the foal, and put their clothes on them and he sat on them.
And the most numerous group spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
And the crowds who went on ahead of him and those who followed were all shouting, saying, "Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"
And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, saying, "Who is this?"
The crowd said, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee." Cleansing of the Temple
And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of thieves!"
My uncle came to him and limped into the temple and healed them.
When the chief priests and scribes saw the wonders he was doing, and the children crying out in the temple and saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" they were indignant.
They said to him, "Do you hear what these are saying?" Jesus said to them, "Yes, have you never read, 'Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise'?"
Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and he lodged there. The fig tree withered
And in the morning, when he was returning to the city, he was hungry.
He looked at a fig tree on the road, and came to it, but found nothing in it except leaves. So he said to it, "Let there be no fruit from you forever!" The fig tree withered at once.
When the disciples saw it, they were amazed and said, "How quickly the fig tree withered away!"
Jesus answered them, "Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it will be done.
"And whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive." Question about the authority of Jesus
And when he came to the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, saying, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things:
John's baptism: Where was it from? From heaven or from people?" So they reasoned among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
And if we say, "From the people," we fear the people, for John is to all like a prophet."
So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." He also said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things. For just as you have two sons, the one named Son of Thunder and the other named Son of Peace, so also are there two sons of the woman, the one named Son of the Sun and the other named Son of the Moon.
What do you think? A man had two sons. He came to the first and said, "My son, go and work in my vineyard today."
He replied, saying: "I don't want to." But he finally regretted and left.
He came to the second and said the same. He answered and said, "Here I am, my lord." And he did not delay.
Which of the two did the will of the Father? They said to him, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you."
For John came to you in the way of truth, and you did not believe him; but the publicans and the harlots believed him. And when you saw it, you did not even repent afterward to believe him. Like the vineyard workers
"Listen to another example: A householder planted a vineyard, fenced it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, and leased it to tenants and went away."
When the time of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the vineyards to take his fruits.
The nobles took their slaves, and some were flogged, some were killed, and some were stoned.
Then he also sent other slaves, more than the first ones, and they did the same to them.
Finally, he sent his son to them, saying, "They will respect my son!"
And as for the nobles, when they saw the son, they said among themselves: This is the heir! Let us kill him and take his inheritance!
So they took him, led him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
"So when the master of the house comes, what will he do to those slaves?".
They said to him, "Those wicked ones will perish in a bad way, and the vineyard will be given to other vinedressers who will give it its fruits in their times."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"
Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation producing its fruit.
"And whoever falls on this stone will be broken; and on whomsoever it falls, it will grind him to powder!"
And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they knew that he spoke of them.
And when they sought to take him, they feared the multitude, for they held him as a prophet.
Like the wedding of the king's son
And Jesus also spoke to them in parables, saying:
"The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who made a wedding for his son,
And he sent his servants to invite the guests to the wedding, but they refused to come.
And he sent out other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.
But they were negligent and went their ways, one to his field, and the other to his trade.
And the rest seized his servants, and after treating them shamefully, they killed them.
When the king heard, he was angry, and he sent his soldiers and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.
Then he said to his servants: The wedding is ready, but the invited guests were not worthy.
Go to the crossroads, and invite everyone you meet to the wedding.
So those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all who they found, both evil and good. The wedding hall was filled with those reclining.
When the king entered to see the reclining guests, he saw a man who was not wearing wedding clothes.
He said to him, "My friend, how did you enter here without the wedding clothes?" He fell silent.
Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
"Because many are called, but few are chosen." Paying tribute to Caesar
Then the Pharisees went away and plotted how they might trap him in his words.
So they sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are a truthful man and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You are not swayed by anyone, for you do not regard the status of people. Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
"So tell us, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
Jesus knew their evil and said, "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?"
Show me the jizya transaction." They gave him a dinar.
He said to them, "To whom belongs this image and inscription?"
They said to him, "To Caesar." And he said to them, "What is Caesar's, give to Caesar, and what is God's, give to God."
When they heard, they were amazed and left him and went away. The question about the resurrection of the dead
On that day Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him
Saying: "O Teacher, Moses said: If a man dies and has no children, his brother should marry his wife and raise up offspring for his brother."
We had seven brothers, the first of whom married and died. Since he had no offspring, he left his wife to his brother.
And the second and the third to the seventh.
And the last of all, the woman also died.
In the resurrection, which of the seven will have a wife? For she was for all of them!”
Jesus answered them, "You are wrong because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God."
Because in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like God's angels in heaven.
And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God, the One who says:
"I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
When the crowd heard this, they were amazed at his teaching. The greatest commandment
But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
One of them, a Pharisee, asked him to test him, saying:
"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?"
Jesus said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind."
This is the first and greatest commandment.
And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
"By this commandment all the law and the prophets depend." Christ and David
And while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them
"What do you think of the Messiah? Who is his father?" They said to him, "The son of David."
He said to them, "How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,
The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.
"If David calls him Lord, how is he his son?"
No one could answer him a word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him anything.
Warning against the scribes and Pharisees
Then Jesus spoke to the crowd and his disciples
"On Moses' seat, the scribes and Pharisees sat,"
So whatever they tell you to observe, that observe and do, but do not do as they do, for they say and do not do.
They load heavy, difficult loads onto people's shoulders, and they do not want to move them with their finger.
And all their deeds they do to be seen by men: they make their phylacteries broad and enlarge the borders of their garments.
They love the first seat at banquets, and the first place at gatherings.
Greetings in the markets, and people calling out to them: "Sir, Sir!"
And you, do not call your teacher "Sir," for you have one Teacher, the Christ. And you are all brothers and sisters.
And call not another god with Allah, there is no god but He. And call not for another father on earth, for your father is one in the heavens.
And do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. Neither be called masters, for you have one Master, the Christ.
And the greatest of you will be your servant.
Whoever raises himself is humbled, and whoever humbles himself is raised. Woe to the scribes and Pharisees.
"But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You do not enter yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in."
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense you make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you go about at sea and on land to make a single proselyte, and when he is made, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.
Woe to you, you blind guides! Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the temple's gold, he is bound by it.
O ignorant and blind ones! Which is greater: the gold or the temple that makes the gold sacred?
And he who swears by the altar is nothing, but he who swears by the gift that is on it, he is bound by it.
O ignorant and blind ones! Which is greater: the sacrifice or the altar that sanctifies the sacrifice?
Then, whoever swears by the altar has sworn by it and by everything on it!
And whoever swears by the Temple, swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the sky has sworn by the throne of Allah and by Him who is sitting on it.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without leaving the others undone.
O you blind leaders! Who describe the mosquito and swallow the camel.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are full of extortion and excess.
O you blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, that the outside of them may be clean also.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.
So also you: outwardly you appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous,
You say, "If we were in the days of our fathers, we would not have shared their blood with the prophets."
You testify against yourselves that you are the sons of those who killed the prophets.
Fill you the measure of your fathers.
Oh serpents, sons of snakes! How do you escape the judgment of hell?
Therefore, I am sending you prophets, wise men, and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town,
For every righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
Truly I tell you, all these things will come upon this generation! Jesus weeps over Jerusalem
"O Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone the ones sent to you! How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!"
Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
For I say to you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'"
End of times signs
Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.
Jesus said to them, "Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be torn down!"
As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered them, "Be careful! Do not let anyone deceive you."
For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' And they will lead many astray.
You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See, do not be alarmed, for all these things must take place, but the end is not yet.
Because nation rises against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
But these are all the beginning of sorrows.
Then they will deliver you up to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name.
And then many will fall away, and they will betray one another and hate one another.
Many false prophets will arise, and they will lead many astray.
And because of the many sins, the love of many will grow cold.
But he who endures to the end, this one will be saved.
And he preached the gospel of the kingdom in all the country of the Jews. And when he had finished all his sayings in the audience, he said unto them, I will shew you whom ye shall resemble.
"When you see the 'abomination of desolation' spoken of by the prophet Daniel standing in the holy place - let the reader understand."
Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains.
And he who is on the roof, let him not go down to take anything out of his house.
And he who is in the field shall not return back to take his clothes.
Woe to the pregnant and nursing women in those days!
They arrived so that your flight would not be in winter or on a Sabbath.
For it will be a great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will.
Even if those days were not shortened, no flesh would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, those days will be shortened.
Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'There he is!' do not believe it.
Because false prophets and false messiahs will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so that, if possible, they would deceive even the elect.
I have already informed you.
If they tell you, 'He is in the desert!' do not go out. If they tell you, 'He is in the house!' do not believe it.
Because just as lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
Because wherever the carcass is, there the vultures will gather.
"And the time after the distress of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken."
And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. And then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.
His angels will be sent with a loud trumpet blast, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.
From the fig tree learn this parable: when its branch has now become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.
So also you, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the doors.
Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.
The sky and the earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. Always be prepared
"As for that day and hour, no one knows them, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone."
As the days of Noah were, so will also the coming of the Son of Man be.
Because as they were in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark.
And they knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left.
Two grind on the millstone, one is taken and the other is left.
"Watch, for you do not know at what hour your Lord will come."
And know this: if the master of the house knew at what hour the thief would come, he would not have let his house be broken into.
Therefore, you also must be ready, because the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. Like a faithful servant.
Who is the trustworthy and wise servant whom his master has appointed over his servants to give them their food at the proper time?
Blessed is that servant, who when his master comes, finds him doing so!
I tell you the truth: he will set him over all his possessions.
But if that wicked servant says in his heart, 'My mas
He begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with the drunkards.
The master of that slave will come on a day he does not expect and at an hour he does not know.
He cuts it and makes his portion with the hypocrites. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Like the ten virgins
"Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
But the foolish ones, taking their lamps, did not take oil with them.
And the wise women took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
And as the groom delayed, we all fell asleep.
At midnight, a cry went out: "Behold, the bridegroom is coming; go out to meet him!"
All those virgins then took their lamps and trimmed them.
The ignorant ones said to the wise ones: Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.
The wise women replied, "It may not be enough for us, but go to the sellers and buy some."
And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and the prepared ones went in with him to the wedding, and the door was shut.
Finally, the other virgins also came, saying, "Lord, Lord, open to us!"
He replied and said: "Truly I say, but I do not know you."
Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.
"As if a traveling man called his slaves and handed over his wealth to them,"
So he gave one five ounces, another two ounces, and another one ounce. Each according to his ability. And he left in time.
So the man who took the five gold coins and traded them made a profit of five more gold coins.
Thus, the one who took the two weights also won two more.
As for the one who took the weight, he went and dug in the ground and hid his master's silver.
After a long time, the master of those slaves came and accounted for them.
So the man who had received the five minas came and said, 'Sir, you entrusted me with five minas. See, I have gained five more.'
His master said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master."
Then came the one who had taken the two weights and said, "My lord, I gave you two weights. Behold, I have gained two more above them."
His master said to him: "Good, you good and trustworthy servant! You have been faithful with a few things, so I will put you in charge of many things. Enter the joy of your master."
Then came the one who had taken the one mina and said, 'Sir, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter seed.
I was afraid and I went and hid your weight on earth. Behold, this is yours.
His master answered and said to him, "You wicked and lazy servant, I know that you reap where you did not sow and gather where you did not scatter."
You should have deposited my silver with the moneychanger, so that when I came I could take what was mine with interest.
Take one ounce from him and give it to the one who has ten ounces.
For whoever has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.
And the wicked servant, cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. The sheep and the lambs
"And when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory.
All peoples will gather before him, and he will separate them from one another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He shall separate the sheep from the goats, placing the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those at his right hand, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."
For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you took me in.
Naked, you clothed me. Sick, you visited me. Imprisoned, you came to me.
The righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you a drink?'
And when did we see you a stranger and give you shelter, or naked and clothe you?
When did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?
The King responds and says to them: "Truly I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me."
"Then He will say also to those on the left hand, 'Depart from Me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels,'"
Because I was hungry, you did not feed me. Because I was thirsty, you did not give me water.
I was a stranger and you did not take me in. I was naked and you did not clothe me. I was sick and in prison and you did not visit me.
Then they also will answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?'
He will answer them, saying, "Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me."
"Then those who believe and do good deeds will be taken to eternal bliss, and the righteous to eternal life."
The plot to kill Jesus
And when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples, "You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."
"You know that after two days the Passover will take place, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified."
Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people assembled in the courtyard of the chief priest who was called Caiaphas.
And they consulted how they might secretly seize Jesus and kill him.
But they said, "Not on the Sabbath, lest there be an uproar among the people." They poured the perfume on Jesus.
And while Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,
A woman approached him with a carafe of expensive perfume, and he poured it over his head while he was reclining.
When his disciples saw this, they were indignant and said, "Why this waste?"
"Because this perfume could have been sold for a lot of money and given to the poor."
Jesus knew and said to them, "Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a good work on me. For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me."
For the poor are with you always, but I am not always with you.
So when she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.
Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.” Judas' betrayal.
Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
He said, "What do you want me to give you as I hand it over to you?" So they gave him thirty pieces of silver.
And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him. The Passover Supper with the disciples
In the first days of the unleavened bread, the disciples approached Jesus, saying to him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
He said, "Go to the city, to so-and-so, and tell him: The Teacher says, 'My time is near. Do you have room to celebrate the Passover with me and my disciples?'"
And the disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover.
And in the evening, he reclined with the twelve.
And as they were eating, he said, "Truly I say to you, one of you will betray me."
So they were very sad, and each of them began to say to him, "Is it I, Lord?"
He replied, saying, "Whoever dips his hand with me in the dish is betraying me!"
The Son of Man will go as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born!"
So Judas, the betrayer, answered him, "Am I it, Rabbi?" He said to him, "You have said so." The Lord's Supper
And while they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, "Take, eat; this is my body."
He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you,"
For this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
And I say to you: from now on I will not drink from this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."
Then they went out and came to the Mount of Olives. Jesus foretold that Peter would deny him.
Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble because of me this night, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'"
But after I go ahead of you to Galilee."
Peter answered and said to him, "Even if everyone doubts you, I will never doubt."
Jesus said to him, "Truly, I say to you, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."
Peter said to him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you!" So said all the disciples. In Gethsemane
Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
Then he took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him, and he began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed.
He said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
Then he went a little further and fell on his face, praying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?
Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
He went away again a second time and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cup cannot pass away unless I drink it, your will be done."
Then he came and found them also asleep, for their eyes were heavy.
He left them and went on, praying a third time, saying the same words.
Then he came to his disciples and said to them, "Now sleep and take your rest! Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners."
Let's go! Behold, he who delivers me is at hand!” The arrest of Jesus
While he was speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came up with a large crowd, with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
And the one who surrendered gave them a sign, saying, "He who accepts him is he. Seize him."
At that time, he came to Jesus and said, "Peace be with you, sir!" and kissed him.
Jesus said to him, "Man, why are you here?" Then they came forward, laid hands on Jesus, and seized him.
And one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place. For all who take up the sword will perish by the sword!"
Do you think I cannot now ask my father to provide me with more than twelve armies of angels?
How do you complete the books: is that how it should be?
At that hour Jesus said to the crowds: "You came out with swords and clubs, as if I were a bandit, to arrest me! Every day I sat with you teaching in the temple, and you did not arrest me."
And all this was to fulfill what the prophets had spoken. Then all the disciples left him and fled. They were terrified of the Jewish leaders.
And they who had taken Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.
And Peter followed him from a distance, until he came into the palace of the high priest; and he entered in, and sat with the officers, to see the end.
And the chief priests, the scribes, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death.
But they could not find it. Although many false witnesses came forward, they could not find it. But finally a false witness came forward.
They said, "This one said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.'"
The high priest stood up and said to him, "Do you not answer anything? What do these men testify against you?"
And Jesus was silent. And the high priest answered and said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God."
Jesus said to him, "You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, you have now heard his blasphemy!"
What do you see? They answered and said, "He is worthy of death."
Then they spat in his face and beat him, and others struck him.
Saying, "Prophesy to us, Christ, who is it that struck you?" Peter's denial
But Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him and said, "You too were with Jesus the Galilean!"
But he denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you are talking about!"
Then, when he went out to the vestibule, another woman saw him and said to those who were there, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth!"
And he denied it with an oath: "I do not know the man!"
Soon after, the Qiyam came and said to Peter, "You are also one of them, for your language shows it!"
Then he began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately the rooster crowed.
Peter remembered the words of Jesus, who had said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." He went out and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself
And when it was morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death.
So they bound him, led him away, and handed him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
When Judas, who betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
"I made a mistake by delivering an innocent man," he said. They said, "What do we have to do? You are the most knowledgeable!"
He threw the silver into the temple and left, then went and strangled himself.
So the chief priests took the silver and said, "It is not lawful to put it into the treasury, because it is the price of blood."
Consult and buy the field of the potter as a burial ground for strangers.
Therefore, that field was named "Field of Blood" to this day.
Then what was said by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the one who was appraised by the sons of Israel,
And they gave it to me from the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." Before Pilate
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus said to him, "You say so."
And when the chief priests and elders complained to him, he answered nothing.
Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?"
He did not answer him or even a single word, until the governor was very surprised.
The governor would release one prisoner to the crowd on Eid, whoever they wanted.
They had a notorious prisoner at that time, named Barabbas.
While they were gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Because he knew they had betrayed him out of jealousy.
And while he was sitting on the throne of the kingdom, his wife sent him a message saying, "Away with that barley, for I suffered greatly in a dream today because of it."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed.
The governor answered them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" They said, "Barabbas!"
Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said to him, "Let him be crucified!"
The governor said, "What evil has he done?" They shouted even louder, "Crucify him!"
When Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves!"
And all the people answered and said, "His blood be on us and on our children."
Then he released Barabbas to them. But Jesus he flogged and handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked him
So the governor's soldiers took Jesus to the governor's house and gathered the whole cohort around him.
Sell him and dress him in a crimson robe.
They wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. They knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They spat on him, took the cane and beat him on the head.
And when they had mocked him, they took the robe off him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him. Crucifixion
As they were going out, they found a Cyrenean man, Simon by name, and they pressed him to carry his cross.
And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which is called "The Place of the Skull"
They gave him a mixture of water and bitter juice to drink. When he tasted it, he didn't want to drink it.
And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, "They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots."
Then they sat and guarded him there.
And they put a sign over his head, saying, "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
Then the two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
The passersby were paddling at him while shaking their heads.
Saying, "You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"
And the chief priests also with the scribes and elders mocking, said:
"Others have been saved, but he cannot save himself! If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him!"
I relied on God, so let Him save me now if He wants to! Because He said: I am the Son of God!
And so the two criminals who were crucified with him also cast their lot in with him. Death
And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
Around 9 o'clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" which means "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
Some of the people standing there, when they heard him, said, "He is calling Elijah."
And in time, one of them ran, took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.
And the rest said, "Let him be. Let us see if Elijah comes to save him!"
Jesus also cried out with a loud voice, and gave up his spirit.
And the veil of the temple was torn in two, from the top to the bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split.
And the graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints which slept arose.
And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared to many.
And the centurion, and those who were with him keeping Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared greatly, saying, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
And many women were watching from a distance; they had followed Jesus from Galilee and had been serving him.
And among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. The burial
And when it was evening, a rich man from Ramah, whose name was Joseph, came; he was also a disciple of Jesus.
So he went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered that the body be given to him.
So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
And he placed him in his new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock. Then he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and departed.
And Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. The guards were at the tomb.
And on the day after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered to Pilate
Saying, "Sir, you remember that the deceiver said while he was alive, 'After three days I will rise.'"
So he ordered that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come at night and steal him, and say to the people, "He was raised from the dead." So the last deception will be worse than the first one!"
Then Pilate said to them, "You have a guard. Go and secure him as you know how."
So they went and secured the tomb with guards and sealed the stone.
Resurrection
After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the tomb.
And a great earthquake occurred, because an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it.
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing was white like snow.
Fear caused the guards to tremble and become like the dead.
The angel answered and said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who has been crucified.
He is not here, for he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where the Lord lay.
And go quickly and tell his disciples, "He has risen from the dead. He is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. Behold, I have told you."
So they came out of the tomb quickly with great fear and joy, running to tell his disciples.
And as they were going out to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Hail!" And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." The guards' words
And as they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that were done.
They met with the elders, consulted, and gave the army a lot of silver.
Saying: "Say that his disciples came by night and stole him while we were asleep."
"And if the governor hears about it, we will appease him, and you will be reassured."
So they took the silver and did as they were told. And this saying has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus appears to the disciples.
And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.
And when they saw him, they fell down before him, but some doubted.
Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
And teach them to keep all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age." Amen.
John the Baptist paves the way
The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the prophets: "Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You."
A loud voice in the wilderness: "Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
John was baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the country of Judea, and all they of Jerusalem, went out to him, and were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
John wore camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
He preached, saying, "After me comes one who is more powerful than I, to whom I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the straps of his sandals."
I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." The baptism of Jesus Christ and his temptation.
And in those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And when the time came, as he was rising from the water, he saw the heavens torn apart, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
And a voice came from heaven, "You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
And at once the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
And he was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild beasts, and the angels were ministering to him. The calling of the first disciples.
After John was baptized, Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.
He said, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel."
As he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, "Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
At that time, they left their nets and followed him.
Then he went on from there a little further and saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were in the boat mending the nets.
So he called them for a time. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired man and went after him. He cast out a foul spirit.
Then they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and was teaching.
They were amazed at his teaching, because he taught as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.
And there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit, and he cried out
"Ah! What do we have to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? You have come to destroy us! I know who you are: the Holy One of God!"
Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!"
Then the unclean spirit struck him, cried out with a loud voice, and came out of him.
They were all perplexed, and they asked each other, "What is this? What is this new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!"
So the news spread throughout the surrounding countryside of Galilee. The healing of Simon's mother-in-law and others.
And when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
And Simon's mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and they told him about her at once.
He went forward and held her hand, and the fever left her immediately and she began to serve them.
And when it became evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all the sick and the demon-possessed.
The whole city was gathered at the gate.
He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and he drove out many demons, and he would not let the demons speak because they knew him. The preaching in Galilee
And in the early morning he got up and went out and went to a secluded place, and he prayed there.
Simon and those with him followed him.
And when they found him, they said to him, "Everyone is looking for you."
He said to them, "Let us go to the surrounding villages, so that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out."
And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils. He healed a leper.
A leper came to him, begging on his hands and knees, and said to him, "If you want to, you can make me clean."
Jesus was moved with compassion, reached out and touched him, and said to him, "I want to. Be cleansed!"
At the time he was speaking, the leprosy left him and he was healed.
You scolded him and sent him back in time.
He said to him, "Look, don't tell anyone anything, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."
And he went out and began to shout and spread the news, so much so that he could no longer enter the city openly, but was instead outside in empty places, and they came to him from all sides.
Healing a paralyzed person
Then, after a few days, he also went to Capernaum, and he heard that he was in a house.
And many people gathered until it was no longer sufficient for them and the area around the door. So he addressed them with the word.
They came to him, presenting a paralyzed man carried by four.
And when they could not come near to him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "My son, your sins are forgiven."
And there were some scribes sitting there, thinking in their hearts:
"Why does this person speak like this with profanity? Who can forgive sins except Allah alone?"
At that time Jesus felt in his spirit that they were thinking this way about themselves, so he said to them, "Why are you thinking this way in your hearts?
Which is easier, to say to a paralytic, "Your sins are forgiven you," or to say, "Arise, take up your bed and walk"?
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"--then he said to the paralytic, "Rise, take up your bed and go home."
"I say to you: Get up, take your bed, and go home!"
So he got up at once, took up his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!" The call of Levi
Then he went out to the sea. And all the crowds came to him and he taught them.
And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, "Follow me." So he arose and followed him.
While reclining in his house, many tax collectors and sinners reclined with Jesus and his disciples, for they were many and had followed him.
And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with the tax collectors and sinners, they said to his disciples, "Why does he eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” The question about fasting
And the disciples of John and the Pharisees used to fast. And they came to him and said, "Why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
Then Jesus said to them, "Can the friends of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.
No one sews a patch from a new piece on an old garment, otherwise the new filling takes from the old one and the tear becomes worse.
Not one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the wineskins, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. No, they put new wine into new wineskins." The Lord of the Sabbath
And passing through the grain fields on the Sabbath, his disciples began to pluck the heads of grain as they walked.
So the Pharisees said to him, "Look! Why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "Have you ever read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and those with him?"
How did he enter the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and eat the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?"
Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
"For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath as well."
Healing on Saturday
Then he went into the synagogue, and a man with a withered hand was there.
So they watched him to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath, that they might accuse him.
Then he said to the man who had the withered hand, "Stand up in the middle!"
Then he said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life or to kill?" But they remained silent.
He looked at them angrily, saddened by their hard hearts, and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did so, and his hand returned as healthy as the other.
So the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against him how to destroy him. The crowds were following Jesus.
So Jesus and his disciples went back to the sea, and a large crowd from Galilee and Judea followed him.
And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, heard what great things he did; and came unto him.
So he told his disciples to follow him in a small boat for the sake of the crowd, so that they would not press around him.
Because he had healed many, all those who were sick came to touch him.
And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him and cried, saying, "You are the Son of God!"
And he warned them repeatedly not to reveal it. The selection of the twelve apostles
Then he went up the mountain and called those he wanted, and they went to him.
And he appointed twelve to be with him and to send them to preach,
They will have authority to heal diseases and to cast out demons.
And he gave Simon the name Peter.
James, son of Zebedee, and John, brother of James, and he gave them the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James, the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot
And Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. Then they came to the house of Jesus and Baalzebub.
A gathering also met until they could not even eat bread.
When his relatives heard, they came out to seize him, for they said, "He is out of his mind!"
And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "He has Beelzebul, and by the ruler of the demons he casts out demons."
He called them and said to them in parables: "How can Satan cast out Satan?
And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
