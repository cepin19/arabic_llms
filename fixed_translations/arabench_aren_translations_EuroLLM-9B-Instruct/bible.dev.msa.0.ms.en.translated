Azour Abu Sadouk. Sadouk Abu Akhim. Akhim Abu Alyoud.
Alyud Abu Al'azar. Al'azar Abu Matan. Matan Abu Ya'qub.
Jacob Abu Yusuf, Mary's husband. And Mary is the mother of Jesus, who is called "the Messiah."
There were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen generations from the exile to Babylon to the Messiah. Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, saying, "Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him."
The birth of Jesus Christ took place as follows: His mother, Mary, was betrothed to a man named Joseph. But before they were married, she learned that she was pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit.
But her husband Yusuf was a righteous man, and he did not want to expose her, so he decided to leave her quietly.
While Joseph was thinking about this, an angel appeared to him in a dream and said to him, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because the child she is carrying is from the Holy Spirit.
And she will give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”
This happened so that what the Lord said through the prophet would be fulfilled:
"For this reason the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel," which means, "God with us."
When Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did everything the angel of the Lord had told him to do and took his wife to his house.
But he did not know her until she gave birth to a child whom he named "Jesus."
Sages of the East
And when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,
They asked, "Where is the newborn king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed, and all the people of Jerusalem with him.
So Herod gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
"They told him, 'In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what is written by the prophet:
"You, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are not insignificant among the rulers of Judah, for from you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people, the children of Israel."
So Herod called the wise men together and secretly inquired of them the exact time when the star had appeared.
Then he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the child. And when you have found him, bring me word, that I also may come and worship him."
So the wise men listened to the king and then left. And behold, the star they had seen in the east went before them until it came and stood over the place where the child was.
They were overjoyed when they saw the star.
They entered the house and saw the child with his mother Maryam, so they prostrated on the ground before him. Then they opened their treasure chests and presented him with gifts: gold, incense, and myrrh.
Then, in a dream, God warned them not to return to Herod, so they traveled to their country by another route. They fled to Egypt.
After the wise men had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is going to search for the child to destroy him."
So Joseph took the child and his mother by night and left for Egypt.
And he remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: "Out of Egypt I have called my son." #Out of … my son. 15:2 From the book of Hosea 11:1. Herod killed the children of Bethlehem.
When Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him, he was very angry, and ordered the killing of all boys in the city of Bethlehem and all the surrounding area, from the age of two years and under, according to the time confirmed to him by the wise men.
Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:
"A voice was heard in Ramah, a voice of lamentation and great mourning. It is the voice of Rachel weeping for her children, and she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more." Return from Egypt
After Herod's death, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream in Egypt.
He said to him, "Go, take the child and his mother, and return to the land of Israel, for those who sought to kill the child are dead."
So Joseph took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. But after being warned by God in a dream, he went to the region of Galilee.
He lived in a town called Nazareth. This happened so that the prophets' words would be fulfilled, that the Christ would be called a Nazarene. #Nazarene. 23:2 Referring to the city of Nazareth. It is also a word similar to the Hebrew word meaning "branch" found in Isaiah 11:1, referring to the promise of the coming of the Christ from the lineage of David.
John the Baptist
In those days, John the Baptist came to preach in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near."
This is the one spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, "A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"
John wore camel's hair clothing, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
At that time, all the people began to come from the city of Jerusalem and the whole region of Judea, and from the area around the Jordan River to hear him.
And he baptized them in the Jordan River after they confessed their sins.
And when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Make fruit that proves your repentance.
"Do not boast, saying, 'We are Abraham's children.' For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones."
Here is the axe placed on the roots of the tree trunks. Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
"I baptize you with water for repentance, but the one who comes after me is more powerful than I am, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire."
He will carry his winnowing fork in his hand and will clear his threshing floor, gathering his grain into the storehouse and burning the chaff with unquenchable fire." The Baptism of Jesus
Then Jesus came from the region of Galilee to the Jordan River, because he wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to stop him and said, "I need to be baptized, so why are you coming to me?"
Jesus replied, "Permit it to be so now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he consented and had him baptized.
Jesus was baptized in the water. And when he came up out of the water, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.
A voice came from heaven saying, "You are my beloved Son. I am well pleased with you."
Jesus' experience
And the spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
After Jesus had gone without food for forty days and forty nights, he became hungry.
So the tempter came to him, #tempter. 3:4 That is, Satan. And he said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread."
But Jesus answered him, "The Scripture says, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.'"
Then Iblis took him to the Holy City and stopped him at the top of the temple.
He said to him, "If you are indeed the Son of God, throw yourself down from here. For it is written, 'God will command his angels concerning you.' And, 'They will bear you up in their hands, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'"
Jesus replied, "It is also written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
Then Iblis took him to a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their greatness.
Then he said to him, "I will give you all these if you prostrate yourself to me."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.'"
Then the devil left him, and angels came to serve him. Jesus begins his ministry in Galilee.
When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew to Galilee.
But he did not stay in Nazareth, but went and lived in the city of Capernaum, near the Sea of Galilee in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
This happened so that what God said through the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled:
"Land of Zebulun and Naphtali, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, the land of Galilee, where the foreign nations dwell."
The people living in darkness saw a great light; those sitting in the land of the shadow of death, light shone upon them."
From that time on, Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chose some of his disciples.
While Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, who was also called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the lake. They were fishermen.
He said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
They left their nets immediately and followed him.
Then Jesus went from there and saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, repairing their nets. He called them.
He left the boat and his father immediately and followed him. Jesus teaches and heals
Jesus traveled throughout the region of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom. He healed every disease and every sickness among the people.
The news about him spread throughout all Syria, and they brought to him all who were sick with various diseases and pains, possessed by evil spirits, epileptics, and paralyzed, and Jesus healed them.
He was followed by a large crowd of people who came from the region of Galilee, from the ten cities, from Jerusalem, from the region of Judea, and from the eastern side of the Jordan River.
Jesus' teachings
And when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up a mountain and sat down. Then his disciples came to him.
And he began to speak and teach them, saying:
"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
Rest in peace to the mourners, for God will console them.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. #Inherit the earth. 5:5 See Psalm 37:11. This may mean a future spiritual inheritance.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for doing God's will, #doingGodswill. 6:5 Literally: "To the land." Because God will satisfy them.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be shown mercy by God.
"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
Peace be upon those who work for peace, for they will be called the children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
"Happy are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. For that is the way they treated the prophets who were before you."
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven. For in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. Salt and light
"You are the salt of all people. But if the salt loses its taste, with what shall it be seasoned to become good again? It is then good for nothing, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot."
"You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden."
People do not light a lamp and put it under a bowl! They put it on a high stand so that it can shine on everyone in the house.
Thus also, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven." Jesus and the Law of Moses
"Do not think that I have come to abolish the law of Moses or the teaching of the prophets. I have not come to abolish them, but to give them their full meaning."
Truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law, until all is accomplished.
"Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be considered least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever obeys these commandments and teaches others to obey them will be considered greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
For I say to you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Anger
"You know that it was said to your fathers, 'Do not kill. #Do not kill. 21:5 Exodus 20:13, Deuteronomy 5:17. And whoever kills is worthy of judgment."
I say to you that anyone who is angry with another person deserves to be tried, and anyone who insults another person should stand before the council of justice. And anyone who says to another person, 'You fool,' deserves hell.
"So if you are offering a gift on the altar, and you remember that someone else owes you something,
Leave your offering there before the altar, go and make peace with that person first, then come back and offer your gift.
"Deal with your opponent quickly, while walking with him to the court. Otherwise, he will hand you over to the judge, and the judge will hand you over to the jailer, who will throw you into prison."
I tell you the truth, you will not leave there until you pay the last penny. Adultery
"You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' #Do not commit adultery. 27:5 from the book of Exodus 20:14, and the book of Deuteronomy 5:18.
But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
Therefore, if your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better for you to lose one of your limbs than to have your whole body thrown into hell. Divorce
"It was also said: 'If a man divorces his wife, he should give her a certificate of divorce.' #If he divorces her... Deuteronomy 24:1, verse 5.
But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. The oath
"You have heard that it was said to your ancestors: 'Do not take an oath falsely, but fulfill your oaths to the Lord.' #DoNotPerjure … to the Lord. 33:5 See Leviticus 19:12, Numbers 30:2, and Deuteronomy 23:21.
But I say to you: Do not swear at all.
Do not swear by heaven, for it is the throne of God, nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet, #footstool. 35:5 Meaning: under his authority. Nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
Don't swear by your head, because you can't make a hair from it black or white.
If you want to say yes, say yes. If you want to say no, say no. Anything more than that is from the evil one. #evil. 37:5 Satan. Resisting evil
"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.' #An eye... for a tooth. 38:5 from Exodus 21:24, and Leviticus 24:20.
I say: Do not resist evil. If someone strikes you on your right cheek, offer him the other one as well.
And if anyone wants to sue you to take your shirt, let him take your coat too.
And if someone forces you to walk with him for one mile, walk with him for two.
And if anyone asks you for something, give it to them. Do not refuse to lend to anyone who asks to borrow from you. Love everyone.
"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' #Love... your enemy. 43:5 from Leviticus 19:18.
But I say to you: Love your enemies, pray for those who persecute you.
You are thereby children of your Father in heaven. For God causes the sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
If you only love those who love you, what reward do you deserve? Do not tax collectors do the same?
And if you only live for your brothers, what makes you different from others? Do not even idol worshippers do the same?
Therefore, be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Giving
"Beware of giving your alms in front of people in order to be seen by them, otherwise your Father in heaven will not reward you."
When you give to those in need, do not announce it as if you were blowing a trumpet, as hypocrites do in assemblies and streets, seeking praise from people. I tell you the truth, they have received their full reward.
But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Even if your giving is in secret. And your father who sees what happens in secret, will reward you. Prayer
"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
But when you pray, go into your room and close the door, pray to your father in secret. And your father who sees what is happening in secret will reward you.
"And when you arrive, do not speak words without understanding as the idol worshippers do, for they think that their prayers will be answered because of their many words."
Therefore, do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
Therefore, pray as follows: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,
Let your kingdom come, that your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. #TheEvilOne. 13:6 The devil (Satan). For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.
Because if you forgive the people their mistakes, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their faults, neither will your Father forgive your faults. Fasting
"And when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites who disfigure their faces. For they disfigure their faces so that people may see that they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full."
But when you fast, anoint your head with oil and wash your face.
So that people do not notice that you are fasting. Your father, who you do not see, sees it. Then your father, who sees what is happening in secret, will reward you. God or money
"Do not store for yourselves treasures on earth, where they are spoiled by mold and rust, and where thieves can break into your houses and steal them."
But store for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
Because your heart will be where your treasure is.
"The lamp of the body is the eye. If your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light."
But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
"No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. #money. 24:6 Literally "mamona." It is an Aramaic word meaning "wealth," in its negative sense, representing here a god that people serve instead of God. The kingdom of God first."
"Therefore, I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; nor for your body, what you will wear. For life is more important than food, and the body more important than clothing."
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?
Who among you can add an hour to their life when they worry?
"And why do you worry about what you will wear? Look how the lilies of the field grow. They do not toil or spin."
But I say to you, no one has ever worn one like her, not even Solomon in all his glory.
If God clothes the grass of the fields that you see here today, and tomorrow throws it into the fire, will He not care more for you, you of little faith?
"So do not worry, and do not ask yourselves, 'What will we eat?' or 'What will we drink?' or 'What will we wear?'
This is what the people of the other world seek, and your heavenly father knows that you need all of them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you as well.
Do not worry about tomorrow, for each day has enough worries of its own, and tomorrow will have its own worries.
Judging others
"Do not judge others, lest God judge you."
Because he will judge you in the same way you judge others. And with the measure you use for others, it will be measured to you.
"Why do you see the straw in your brother's eye but not the big beam in your own eye?"
And how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when there is a large plank in your own eye?
O hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
"Do not give what is sacred to dogs, nor throw your jewels before swine! For swine trample them with their feet, and dogs turn to you and tear you apart. Persistence in asking
Ask and you shall receive, seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened to you.
For whoever asks receives, and whoever seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.
Which of you, if his son asks for a loaf of bread, would give him a stone?
Or if he asks for a fish, do you give him a live one?
You, despite your partnership, know how to give your children good gifts. Is not the Father in heaven much more worthy to give good gifts to those who ask him? The Golden Rule
"As you would like others to treat you, so you should treat them. This is the summary of the law of Moses and the teachings of the prophets. The way to heaven and the way to hell."
"Enter through the narrow gate. For the gate that leads to destruction is wide, and the road that leads to it is easy, and many enter through it."
The door that leads to life is very narrow, and the path to it is full of difficulties, and only a few find this path. Warning of false teachings.
"Beware of false prophets who come to you in the guise of gentle sheep, but inwardly are ravening wolves."
You will know them by their deeds. For no one gathers grapes from thorn bushes, nor figs from thistles!
Thus, every good tree bears good fruit, and every bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.
And every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Therefore, you will know the false prophets by their fruit.
"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven."
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name? Did we not drive out demons in your name? Did we not do mighty deeds in your name?'
Then I will tell them clearly: I never knew you. Get away from me, you doers of evil. The wise man and the foolish man
"Anyone who hears these teachings of mine and acts on them is like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
The rain fell, the floodwaters rose, the wind blew, and it hit that house, but it didn't fall, because its foundation was on the rock.
And anyone who hears my words and does not act on them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
The rain fell, the floodwaters rose, the wind blew, and it hit that house, and it fell down with a huge crash!”
And when Jesus had finished this discourse, the people marveled at his teaching.
Because he taught them with authority, not as the teachers of the law.
Jesus cleanses a leper
Then Jesus came down from the mountains, and many followed him.
A leprous man came to him and bowed before him, saying, "Sir, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I do want to. Be clean!" Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
Then Jesus said to him, "See that you tell no one anything, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." 4:8 For the priest was the one who, according to the law, decided when a leper was considered clean. He presented the offering that Moses had commanded, so that the people would know that you were healed." Faith of a Roman Centurion
And Jesus entered the city of Capernaum, and a centurion came to Him #Centurion. 5:8 Literally "a captain of a hundred." Repeated in verses 8, 13.
He said, "Sir, my servant is very ill and is bedridden at home. He is immobile and in great pain."
Jesus said to him, "I will go and heal him."
The officer replied, "Sir, I don't deserve that you enter my house. You just have to say a word and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man under authority, and I have soldiers who obey my orders. I say to this soldier, 'Go!' and he goes. I say to another, 'Come!' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this!' and he does it."
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who were following him, "I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.
I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take your places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
Those who should have inherited the kingdom will be thrown into outer darkness. There the people will weep and gnash their teeth!”
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go; it shall be done for you as you have believed." And the servant of the centurion was healed at that very hour. "He took our infirmities"
And when Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed, and she had a high fever.
And Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve him.
That evening, people brought to him many people possessed by evil spirits, and he cast out the spirits by the command of his mouth, and healed all the sick.
This happened so that what God said through the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled: “He took our infirmities and carried our diseases.” Following Jesus
And when Jesus saw a large crowd around him, he told his disciples to go across the lake to the other side.
Then one of the teachers of the law came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus said to him, "Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
Another of his disciples said to him, "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm
And Jesus got into the boat, and his disciples followed him.
Then a great storm arose in the lake, so that the boat was covered with waves. But Jesus was asleep.
So they came to him and woke him up, saying, "Master, Master, we are perishing!"
Then Jesus said to them, "Why are you so afraid, you of little faith?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
But they were amazed and said, "What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?" Jesus cast out a demon from two men
Then Jesus came to the region of the Gadarenes on the other side of the lake, and two men who were demon-possessed came out of the tombs and met him. The two men were so dangerous that no one dared to travel that way.
The evil spirits cried out, "What do you want from us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the appointed time?"
There was a large herd of pigs grazing at a distance from them.
The evil spirits pleaded with him and said, "If you let us out, we'll send us to the pig herd."
Then Jesus said, "Go!" So the evil spirits came out of the two men and entered the pigs. Immediately the herd rushed down the steep bank of the hill into the lake and were drowned in the water.
The shepherds fled to the town and told the people what had happened to those possessed by evil spirits.
So all the people of the town went out to see Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a paralytic
Jesus got into a boat to cross to the other side of the lake and arrived at his hometown.
Some people brought to him a paralyzed man, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, "Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven."
Some of the Sharia teachers said, "This man is insulting God with his words."
Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking evil thoughts in your hearts?
Which of the two is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
But I will show you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." He said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat, and go home!"
He got up and went to his house.
And when the people saw it, they were afraid, and glorified God, who had given such power to men. When will Jesus follow?
While Jesus was walking, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the place where taxes were collected. Jesus said to him, "Follow me!" So he got up and followed him.
While he was eating at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said, "Those who are healthy do not need a doctor, but those who are sick do.
Go and understand what the scripture means when it says: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." #I desire... animal sacrifice. 13:9 From the book of Hosea 6:6. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners." Question about fasting.
Then John's disciples came to him and asked, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them, "What man, having a hundred sheep, if one of them goes astray, doesn't
"No one patches an old garment with a new piece of cloth, because the new piece of cloth will shrink and tear the old garment, making the hole worse."
And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wineskins will burst, the wine will run out, and the wineskins will be ruined. Instead, new wine is poured into new wineskins, and both the wine and the wineskins are preserved." Jesus raised a dead girl to life // and healed a bleeding woman
While Jesus was speaking, a ruler of the synagogue came to him and knelt before him, saying, "My daughter has just died, but come and put your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus stood up and went with the ruler of the synagogue, and his disciples followed him.
There was a woman who had been suffering from a severe bleeding for twelve years. She came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his cloak.
She said to herself, "If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed."
Jesus turned around and saw her. "Be encouraged, daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at once.
When Jesus arrived at the synagogue leader's house, he saw those playing funeral tunes, and the people were in chaos.
He said, "Get out. The girl is not dead, she is just asleep." They laughed at him.
And when the people came out of the house, Jesus entered the boy's room and took her by the hand, and she stood up.
The news about Jesus spread throughout the region. Jesus heals two blind men and casts out an evil spirit.
After Jesus left that place, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Son of David, have mercy on us!"
And when Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I can heal you?" And they said to him, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes and said, "May it be to you as you have believed."
So the blind men regained their sight. Then Jesus warned them sternly, saying, "Do not let anyone know anything about what happened to you."
But they went and spread the news in all that region.
As they were going along, some people brought to Jesus a man who was mute, because he was possessed by evil spirits.
So Jesus cast the evil spirit out, and the mute man began to speak. The people were amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees began to say, "He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons, Beelzebul." #Beelzebul is one of the names of Satan, the leader of those demons. The harvest is plentiful.
Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
And when Jesus saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
Pray to the Lord of the Harvest that He will send reapers to the harvest."
Jesus sends his disciples
Jesus called the twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out and to heal all diseases and infirmities.
And the names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is also called Peter, and Andrew his brother, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother,
Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
Simon also known as "the Zealot," #Zealot. 4:10 From a Jewish political party that resisted Roman rule, called the "Zealots." And Judas Iscariot who betrayed Jesus.
And Jesus sent these twelve forth, and gave them his instructions, saying, "Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:
But go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
They proclaimed that the kingdom of heaven is near.
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. You have received authority to do these things freely, so give freely to others.
Do not carry gold, silver or copper coins in your belts.
Do not carry a bag, extra clothes, shoes, or a cane. The worker deserves his food.
"And when you enter any city or village, look for someone who is worthy of receiving you, and stay with him until you leave the city."
And when you enter a house, greet its people.
If the people of the house are worthy, your peace will come upon them. If they are not worthy, your peace will return to you.
If someone does not welcome you in a house or a city, and does not listen to your message, leave that house or city, and shake off the dust that has attached itself to your feet.
I tell you the truth, on the day of judgment, the people of Sodom and Gomorrah will be more tolerable than that city. Jesus warns of tribulations
"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves."
Beware of people, for they will hand you over to their courts and flog you in their synagogues.
And they will deliver you to governors and kings for my sake, and so you will bear testimony to me before the Jews and the Gentiles.
And when they arrest you, do not worry about what you will say, because you will give the right words at that hour.
Remember that it is not you who will speak, but the spirit of your father who will speak through you.
"The brother will hand his brother over to be killed, and the father will hand his son over. The children will turn against their parents and kill them."
And because of my name, all people will hate you, but the one who remains faithful to the end, he will be saved.
And when they persecute you in one city, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
"There is no better student than his teacher, nor a greater servant than his master."
Let the student become like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they call the head of the house "Beelzebul," #Beelzebul. 25:10 One of the names of the devil. Reference to Matthew 9:34. What will they call the other members of the house? Fear of God, not of people.
"So do not fear them, for nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing is concealed that will not be made manifest."
Whatsoever I say unto you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and whatsoever ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.
"Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell."
"Do not two sparrows sell for a penny? Yet not one of them falls to the ground without your Father's will."
Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
If you do not fear, you are more precious than many sparrows. Confessing Christ before people
"Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven."
And whoever denies me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven. Christ First
"Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth. I have not come to bring peace but a sword!"
I came: 'Let the man divide from his father, the daughter from her mother, and the daughter-in-law from her mother-in-law.'
His enemies will be his own family!›
"For whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."
And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
Whoever tries to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.
"Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me."
Whoever welcomes a prophet because he is a prophet will receive the reward of a prophet. Whoever welcomes a righteous person because he is righteous will receive the reward of a righteous person.
And whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who is my disciple, because he is my disciple, truly, I say to you, he will not go unrewarded."
John the Baptist and Jesus
When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he left that place and went to teach and preach in the region of Galilee. Jesus and John the Baptist
And when John the Baptist was in prison, he heard about all that Jesus was doing, and he sent word by his disciples and said to him, "Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?"
He asked him, "Are you the one we are waiting for, or should we wait for another?"
Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you have heard and seen:
They are the blind who see, the lame who walk, the lepers who are cleansed, the deaf who hear, the dead who are brought to life, and the poor who hear the good news.
"Blessed is he who does not hesitate to believe in me."
And when John's disciples had left, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
Why did you go out then? To see a man wearing soft clothing? Those who wear soft clothing are in the palaces of kings.
So why did you go out then? To see a prophet? He is one. But I tell you that you saw someone greater than a prophet!
This is what he wrote: "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way before you."
"I tell you the truth, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist. Yet the least person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
From the time of John the Baptist to the present, the kingdom has been facing violent attacks, and the violent ones are trying to take it by force.
Because the law of Moses and all the prophets prophesied until the time of John.
If you want to accept what the prophets and the Sharia say, John is the Elijah who was prophesied to come. #Elijah... his coming. 14:11 Elijah was one of God's prophets around 850 BC. The Jews were expecting his coming based on Malachi 4:5-6.
"He who has ears, let him hear."
"What is this generation like? It is like children sitting in the markets, calling out to their friends and saying:
"We sang for you, but you didn't dance. We sang funeral songs for you, but you didn't cry!"
John, who did not eat like the others or drink wine like the others, came. The people said of him, "He has an evil spirit."
Then the Son of Man came eating and drinking wine like others, and the people said, "Look at this man, he is a glutton and a drunkard, he is a friend of tax collectors and sinners!" But the fruits of wisdom prove that it is true wisdom." Jesus warns the wrong cities
Then Jesus began to rebuke the cities in which most of his miracles were done, because their inhabitants did not repent of their sins.
He said, "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
But I tell you that the fate of the people of Tyre and Sidon will be more tolerable than yours on the day of judgment.
And you, Kafrnahum, do you imagine that you will be raised to heaven? No, you will fall into the abyss! If the miracles that occurred in you had occurred in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.
But I tell you that the fate of the people of Sodom will be more tolerable than that of your people on the day of judgment." Jesus is the source of comfort.
At that time, Jesus spoke and said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children."
Yes, father, because you were pleased with doing this.
"The Father has given everything to me. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and all to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."
"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."
Take my yoke #yoke. 29:11 A yoke is a wooden tool placed on animals to help them carry heavy loads, and it is a Jewish symbol of the law. Take my yoke and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
"For the yoke I give you is easy and the burden I lay on you is light."
Jesus: Lord of the Sabbath
At that time, Jesus went out to walk in the fields on a Sabbath day. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pick heads of grain and eat them.
But when the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
Then Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of presentation, which it is not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?"
He entered the house of God and ate from the loaves of bread offered to God, although neither he nor those with him were allowed to eat that bread, but only the priests were allowed to do so."
Have you also read in the Law of Moses how the priests on the Sabbath do not keep the Sabbath Law? Yet they are not held accountable for this.
But I tell you that there is something greater than the temple here.
If you knew what the book means when it says: "I want mercy for people, not animal sacrifices." #I want... animal sacrifices. 7:12 From the book of Hosea 6:6. Why did you condemn those innocent ones?
For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath." Healing on the Sabbath
Then he left that place and went to their compound.
And a man was there whose hand was withered. So they asked Jesus, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" They asked this to test him, that they might have something to accuse him of.
He said to them, "Suppose one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
And man is more important than sheep. So doing good on Saturday is in accordance with the law."
Then Jesus said to the man with the withered hand, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and it was completely restored, just like the other one.
So the Pharisees went out and began to plot how to kill Jesus. Jesus: The chosen servant of God
Jesus knew their plan and left that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed them all.
And ordered them not to reveal who he was.
This happened to fulfill what God said through the prophet Isaiah:
"Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations."
He will not quarrel with anyone, nor will he shout, nor will anyone hear his voice in their streets.
It will not break even the curved reed, nor will it extinguish even the smoking wick. It will continue until it makes justice prevail.
And all nations will put their hope in him.” Jesus is the King.
Then they brought to him a man who was blind and dumb because he was demon-possessed, and he healed him. So the dumb man spoke and saw.
People were amazed and said, "Could this man be the son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons." (Beelzebul is also called the prince of demons in verse 27.)
And when Jesus knew their thoughts, he said unto them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth. If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? Because ye say, The LORD's temple, The LORD's temple, The LORD's temple, are ye therefore ignorant of the scripture, and of the power of God? For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be."
If the devil is casting out spirits and fighting himself, how can his kingdom stand?
If I cast out demons with the power of Beelzebub, by what power do your disciples cast them out? They are the ones who are judging you.
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
How can someone enter a strong man's house and plunder his belongings unless the strong man is first tied up? Then he becomes able to plunder his house.
"Who is not with me is against me. And who does not gather with me scatters."
Therefore I say to you: every sin and insult can be forgiven to people, but insulting the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
Whoever speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. The fruit shows the truth.
"To get good fruit, plant a good tree. A bad tree, however, will give you bad fruit. For a tree is known by its fruit."
Oh, you snakes! How can you speak what is good when you are evil? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.
The good person brings out what is good from his good treasure, and the evil person brings out what is evil from the evil stored in him.
But I tell you that on the day of judgment, people will be asked about every word they have spoken.
And your words will decide your innocence or guilt.” The Jewish leaders demand proof.
Then some of the teachers of the law and the Pharisees asked him, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He replied, "This wicked and perverse generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
Just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
The people of Nineveh will stand against this generation on the Day of Judgment and condemn it because they repented when they heard Jonah's warning. And now, before you, is one greater than Jonah.
"The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and indeed, someone greater than Solomon is here. The empty soul
"When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it goes through dry places seeking a place of rest, but it does not find it."
Then he says, "I will return to my house from which I came." He goes and finds the house empty, swept, and tidy.
Then he goes and brings with him seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter and dwell there. Thus the last state of that man will be worse than the first. So will it be with this present evil generation." Jesus' disciples are his family.
And while Jesus was speaking to the crowd, his mother and his brothers came and stood outside, and they wanted to speak to him.
Then someone said to Jesus, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you."
Jesus replied, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"
Then he pointed to his disciples and said, "These are my mother and my brothers."
"For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
Like a seed
On that day, Jesus left the house and sat on the shore of the lake.
A large crowd gathered around him. He climbed into a boat and sat down, while people stood on the shore.
And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying, "A farmer went out to sow.
And as he was sowing, some of the seed fell by the path, and the birds came and ate it.
Some of the seeds fell on rocky ground, where there was not enough soil, and the grains grew quickly because the soil was not deep.
But when the sun rose, it burned, and because it had no roots, it withered.
And some of the seed fell on thorns. And the thorns grew up and choked it.
And other seeds fell on good soil, and they produced fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirtyfold.
"Whoever has ears, let him hear." Hearing and understanding
The disciples came to him and asked him, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
Jesus answered them, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them."
Because whoever has #has. 12:13 Perhaps the intended meaning is "whoever has understanding." He will be given more, and it will overflow from him, but whoever does not have will be taken away from him.
Therefore, I speak to them in parables, because though they see, they do not perceive; though they hear, they do not understand.
And so Isaiah's prophecy applies to them: "You will hear and hear, but you will not understand. You will see and see, but you will not perceive."
The mind of this people has become dull, and their hearing has become heavy. They have closed their eyes, so they cannot see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their hearts, lest they return to me and I heal them.›
But you are blessed with eyes that see and ears that hear.
I tell you the truth, many kings and righteous people longed to see what you see and did not see, and they desired to hear what you hear and did not hear. The meaning of the parable of the sower is this.
"Listen to the explanation like the seed:
When a person hears the message of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one #the evil one. (also in verse 38) comes and takes the seed that was sown in his heart. This is the meaning of the seeds that fell by the wayside.
"As for those who fell on the rocky ground, they are like those who hear the word and immediately receive it with joy."
But because it has no roots in itself, it lasts for a short time, and when hardship and persecution come because of the word it has accepted, it quickly loses its faith.
"But those who fall among thorns, are like those who hear the word, but the cares of this life and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful."
"But he who received seed on the good ground is he who hears and understands the word, who indeed bears fruit and brings forth, one a hundred times as much, another sixty, and another thirty." Like the wheat and the weeds.
And he told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field."
But while people were sleeping, the man's enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.
And when the wheat grew and formed ears, the weeds also grew.
His servants came to him and said, "Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?"
The man replied, "My enemy did that." His servants asked, "Do you want us to go and uproot it?"
"The man replied, 'No, because when you pull out the weeds, you may pull out the wheat with them.'"
Let them grow together until harvest time, then I will tell the harvesters: 'Gather the weeds first, and bind them in bundles for burning. But gather the wheat and put it in my barn.'" For example, mustard and yeast.
Then Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.
"It is the smallest seed. But when it grows, it becomes the largest orchard plant, a large tree, so much so that birds of the sky come to it and make their nests in its branches."
And he told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a woman who took three measures of flour and mixed it until the whole dough was leavened."
Jesus said all these things using parables. He spoke to the people only in parables.
This is what God said through the prophet: "I will open my mouth in parables, and I will utter things that have been hidden since the world was created."
Then Jesus sent the crowds away and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”
He said to them, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man."
The field is the world, and the good seeds are those who have the kingdom. But the weeds are those who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sowed them is Satan. The harvest is the end of the world. The reapers are the angels.
"Just as weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will be the end of the world."
For the Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers,
Then they throw them into the burning oven. There, people cry and grit their teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear. For example, the treasure and the pearl
"The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. Because of the great joy he felt, he went and sold all he had and bought that field."
"The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for beautiful pearls."
And when he found a very precious pearl, he went and sold all that he had and bought it. Like a fishing net.
"The kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the lake, and it caught fish of all kinds."
When the net was full, the fishermen pulled it to the shore. Then they sat down and began to choose the good fish and put them in baskets, while they threw the bad fish away.
This is what will happen at the end of the world, when the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous.
Then the wicked are thrown into the burning oven. There people cry and gnash their teeth."
Jesus asked his disciples, "Do you understand all these things?" They answered, "Yes."
And he said to them, "For this reason, every scribe who has been made a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure new and old things." Jesus went into his hometown.
When Jesus had finished telling these parables, he left that place.
When he went to his village, he began teaching them in their assembly. Everyone was amazed and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these miracles?"
Is he not the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And his brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
"Don't all his sisters live with us? Where did he get all this?"
So that was a barrier that prevented them from accepting him. But Jesus said to them, "No prophet is without honor except in his own country and in his own house!"
He did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.
Herod hears about Jesus
At that time, Herod the Tetrarch, Herod the Tetrarch. 1:14 Literally "the ruler of the quarter." The Romans had divided Palestine into four provinces, so the ruler of each province was called the ruler of the quarter or the Tetrarch. See Luke 3:1. About Jesus.
He said to his servants, "It is John the Baptist, he has risen from the dead, and that is why miracles are performed through him!" The murder of John the Baptist
Herod arrested John and put him in prison, and this was because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
Because John said to Herod, "You are not allowed to have your brother's wife."
For this reason Herod wanted to kill him, but he was afraid of the people, because they considered John a prophet.
But when the day of Herod's birthday came, Herodias' daughter danced before him and his guests, and she greatly pleased Herod.
He even promised and swore to give her whatever she asked for.
But her mother had taught her what to ask, and she said, "Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter."
The king was sad, but he ordered her request to be fulfilled because of his oath and out of respect for his guests.
So he sent one to behead John in prison.
Then he brought his head on a platter and gave it to her, and she gave it to her mother.
Then John's disciples came, took his body, and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus what had happened. Jesus feeds more than five thousand
When Jesus heard this, he went away from there in a boat to a deserted place. But the crowds, knowing it, followed him on foot from the towns.
Upon his descent to the shore, he saw a large crowd, and he took pity on them and healed their sick.
In the evening, his disciples came to him and said, "This is an isolated place, and it's very late. Send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy themselves something to eat."
But Jesus said to them, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
His disciples said to him, "We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish."
Jesus said to them, "Bring them to me."
And he commanded the people to sit down on the grass. Then Jesus took the five loaves of bread and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. And he gave the loaves to his disciples to distribute to the people.
So they ate and were all filled. And they took up what was left over of the food, and there were twelve baskets full of broken pieces.
And the number of those who ate was five thousand men, besides women and children. Jesus walking on the water
Then Jesus told his disciples to get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd.
After he dismissed them, he went up the mountain alone to pray. When evening came, he was alone.
The boat was in the middle of the lake, and the waves were hitting it hard, because the wind was against the direction of the boat.
Just before dawn, Jesus came to them walking on the lake.
When his disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified and said, "It's a ghost!" And they cried out in fear.
Jesus said to them at once, "Take heart, it is I; do not be afraid."
Peter replied, "Lord, if it is really you, tell me to come to you on the water."
He said to him, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter noticed the strong wind, he was afraid and began to sink, and he cried out, "Lord, save me."
Jesus immediately reached out and took hold of him, saying to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
And when Jesus and Peter got into the boat, the wind stopped.
And those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God." Jesus healed many people.
When they crossed the lake, they reached the Genesaret area.
And when the people of that region knew Jesus, they announced his coming in all the surrounding region, and they brought to him all who were sick.
They pleaded with him to allow them to touch the hem of his garment only. And all who touched it were healed.
The law of God and the traditions of people
Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked,
"Why do your students break the traditions we took from our ancestors? They don't wash their hands before eating."
Jesus answered them, "Why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?
God commanded, saying, 'Honor your father and your mother,' #Honor... your mother. 4:15 Exodus 20:12, Deuteronomy 5:16. He said, 'Whoever curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.' #Whoever curses... shall surely be put to death. 4:15 Exodus 21:17.
But you say, 'My father or my mother said to me, "You cannot help you; for all that I have is given to the Lord." He is not bound to honor his father or mother.'
And you disregarded God's commandment because of your traditions.
O hypocrites, believe Isaiah when he prophesied about you, saying:
This people praises me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
Their worship is useless, for they teach doctrines that are but human precepts.›»
Jesus called the people to him and said to them, "Listen to me and understand what I say:
"It is not what enters a man's mouth that defiles him, but what comes out of his mouth. That is what defiles him."
Then the disciples came to him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard your words?"
Jesus answered, "Every plant that my Father did not plant will be pulled up by its roots."
Leave them, for they are blind leaders of the blind. If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a ditch."
Peter replied, "Explain to us the meaning of this simile."
Jesus said, "Have you still not understood?"
Don't you understand that everything that enters a person's mouth enters the stomach, and then goes out?
But what comes out of the mouth of man, proceeds from the heart. And this is what defiles man.
Because from the heart, evil thoughts, murder, fornication, adultery, theft, false witness, and insult come.
These are the things that defile a person; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a person." Jesus helps a foreign woman.
And Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman came to him and began to cry out, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed."
Jesus did not answer her with a single word. So his disciples came to him and asked him, "Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us."
He said, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
But the woman approached him, fell down before him, and said, "Lord, help me."
Jesus answered her, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
"She said, 'That's true, sir, but even dogs eat what falls from their masters' table.'"
Then Jesus answered her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you wish." And her daughter was healed at once. Jesus healed many.
And Jesus left that place and went to the region near the Sea of Galilee. He went up on a mountain and sat down there.
A large crowd came to him, and they had the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, the deaf, and many others who were sick. They laid them at Jesus' feet, and he healed them.
The multitude of people were amazed when they saw the deaf and dumb speaking, the lame walking, the paralyzed walking, and the blind seeing, and they glorified the God of Israel. Jesus feeds more than four thousand
Jesus called his disciples and said, "I feel sorry for these people. They have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I don't want to send them away hungry, or they might faint on the way."
His disciples said to him, "Where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them?"
Then Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said to him, "Seven, and a few small fish."
Jesus told the people to sit on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
Everyone ate and was satisfied. Then they gathered what was left of the broken pieces, and there were seven full baskets.
And the number of those who ate was four thousand men, besides women and children.
And when Jesus had sent the multitude away, he went up into
Jewish leaders test Jesus
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus to test him. They asked him to give them a sign from heaven as proof that he had God’s backing.
Jesus answered them, "When it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'
In the early morning, you say, "Today will be stormy, because the sky is red and gloomy." You are good at interpreting climate signs, but you are not good at understanding the times you live in!
This wicked, corrupt generation seeks a sign to believe. It will be given only the sign of Jonah." Then Jesus left them and went away. Unable to understand
Jesus' disciples crossed to the other side of the lake, but they forgot to bring bread.
Jesus said to them, "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
So the disciples began to talk among themselves, saying, "But we didn't bring any bread!"
Jesus knew what they were saying, and he said to them, "You of little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have no bread?
Did you not understand yet? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered from the fragments?
Do you not remember the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered from the fragments?
Why do you not understand that I was not speaking to you about ordinary bread, but warning you to guard yourselves against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
Then his disciples understood that he did not mean to warn them about the yeast of bread, but about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter declares that Jesus is the Christ.
And when Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that I am, the Son of Man?"
His disciples answered, "Some say you are John the Baptist, others that you are Elijah, and still others that you are Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
He said to them, "And who do you think I am?"
And Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven."
And I say to you that you are Peter, #Peter. 18:16 From the Greek "Petros" meaning "rock." And on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades #Gates of Hades. 18:16 Any power of death. You will not be able to defeat it.
"And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, so that whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
Then he warned his disciples strongly not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus speaks about the inevitability of his death.
Therefore, from that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised up.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "God forbid, Lord! This will never happen to you!"
So Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not on the side of God, but of men."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wishes to come after me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me."
Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
What does a man gain if he wins the whole world but loses himself? What can a man do to regain his life?
For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will repay each person according to what they have done.
Truly, I say to you, among those who are standing here there will be some who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
Jesus, Moses, and Elijah
After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and his brother John, and led them to a high mountain by themselves.
While they were there, Jesus' appearance changed, and he was radiant as the sun, and his clothes became white as light.
And suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was speaking, a brilliant cloud surrounded them, and a voice came from it saying, "This is my Son, my Beloved, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him."
When the disciples heard this, they were terrified and fell to the ground on their faces.
Jesus approached and touched them, saying, "Get up, don't be afraid."
And when they looked around, they saw no one except Jesus.
And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
His disciples asked him, "Why then do the experts in the law say that Elijah must come first?" #Elijah First 10:17 Elijah was one of God's prophets around 850 BC. The Jews were expecting him to come, based on Malachi 4:5-6.
Jesus answered them, "Yes, Elijah does come to restore all things to their original state."
But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they have treated him as they pleased, doing to him as they wished. So also will they treat the Son of Man."
Then his disciples understood that he was speaking about John the Baptist. Jesus casts out a demon from a boy
And when they returned to the crowd, a man came to Jesus and knelt before him.
He said, "Have mercy on my son, O Lord, for he is afflicted with epilepsy and suffers greatly. He often falls into fire or water."
I brought him to your students, but they couldn't heal him."
Jesus said, "O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and how long shall I bear with you?" Then he said to the man, "Bring your son here."
Jesus commanded the evil spirit to come out of him, and the boy was healed immediately.
Then his disciples came to him privately and asked him, "Why could we not cast him out?"
Jesus answered them, "Because of your little faith. Truly, I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you."
But this kind comes out only with prayer and fasting." Jesus foretells his impending death.
And as they were traveling together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men."
And they will kill him. But on the third day he will rise from the dead.” The disciples were very sad. Temple tax
And when Jesus came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help, and saying, "Lord, my servant
Peter answered, "Yes, he does." Then Peter went home. Jesus spoke to him and said, "Tell me, Simon, from whom do kings collect taxes and tributes? Do they collect them from their own people or from other peoples?"
Peter answered, "They collect it from other nations." Jesus said, "Then the children are exempt from it."
But so that we don't cause them a problem, go to the lake and cast your fishing line. Then take the first fish you catch and open its mouth. You will find a coin worth four dirhams inside. Take it and give it to them from me and from you."
