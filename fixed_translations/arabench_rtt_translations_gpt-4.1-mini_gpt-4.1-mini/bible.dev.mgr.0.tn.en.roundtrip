Her husband Youssef was a pious man. He didn’t want to disgrace her in front of people. That’s why he decided to divorce her quietly.
As for Joseph, when he was thinking about this, an angel from the Lord appeared to him in a dream. The angel said to him, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. The child in her womb is from the Holy Spirit.
When a boy is born, he must be given the name Jesus. This is because he will save his people from their sins.
All of this is about to happen as the Lord said it would. He said it through the prophet,
The virgin will give birth to a child. She will give birth to a son. And this son will be called Emmanuel. (Isaiah 7:14) The name Emmanuel means "God with us."
Sufyan woke up. He did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him. He took Mary to the house where he was married.
As for him, he did not have a romantic relationship with her until after she gave birth to a son. And Yusuf named him Isa.
The Visit of the Wise Men to Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened during the time when Herod was king of Judea. After Jesus was born, the wise men came from the East to the city of Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the child who was born to be king of the Jews? When we were in the East, we saw his star. Now we have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard, he got very upset. Everyone in Jerusalem was also upset.
Herod called together all the chief priests of the people. He also called the teachers of the law. He asked them where the Messiah was going to be born.
In Bethlehem in Judah," they answered. "This is what the prophet wrote. He said,
But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah. From you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel. (Micah 5:2)
Afterwards, Herod secretly called the wise men. He found out from them exactly when the star appeared.
He sent them to Bethlehem. He said to them, "Go! Search well for the child. As soon as you find him, let me know. Then I can go and worship him too."
After the wise men heard the king, they went on their way. The star they saw when they were in the East went ahead of them. In the end, it stopped above the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, their joy was complete.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But my Lord warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by a different route. The family of Jesus flees to Egypt.
When the wise men left, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, the angel of the Lord appeared to him. "Get up!" said the angel. "Take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return. Herod is going to search for the child. He wants to kill him."
Joseph stood up. At night, he walked to Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They stayed there until King Herod died. Thus, the word spoken by the Lord through the prophet was fulfilled. He said: "I called my son out of Egypt." (Hosea 11:1)
Herod understood that the wise men had deceived him. Because of this, he became very angry. He gave orders regarding Bethlehem and the surrounding area. All boys who were two years old or younger had to be killed. This was consistent with the time when the wise men saw the star.
In this way, the words that the prophet Jeremiah said came true. He said,
An audible voice in Ramah. It is a voice of weeping and deep sorrow. Rachel weeps for her children. She refuses to be comforted, because they are gone. (Jeremiah 31:15) The family of Jesus returns to Nazareth

The angel said, "Get up! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who were trying to kill the child are dead."
Joseph got up. He took the child and his mother Mary and returned to the land of Israel.
As for what follows, it is heard that Archelaus is the king of Judea. Archelaus was ruling instead of his father Herod. This made Joseph afraid to go there. In a dream, Joseph was warned and returned to the land of Galilee instead.
There lived in a city called Nazareth. This is what the prophets said about Jesus came true. They said, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way
In those days, John the Baptist came and preached in the Judean desert.
He said, "Repent from your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the person that the prophet Isaiah was talking about. He said, "A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord. Make straight paths for Him.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothing was made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People came out from Jerusalem and all of Judah. They also came from the entire region around the Jordan River.
To confess their guilt, John baptized them in Jordan.
John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You are like a bunch of poisonous snakes! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath of God?"
Produce fruits that show you have repented from your sins.

The axe is lying at the roots of the tree. All the trees that do not bear good fruit are cut down. To be thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, and I urge you to turn away from your sins. But after me, someone stronger than me will come. I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
He has time to clean the straw from his study place. He will gather his wheat in the store. But he will burn the straw with a fire that cannot be extinguished." Issa baptized
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to stop him. He said to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why are you coming to me?"
Jesus replied, "Let it be this way now. It is right that we do it like this. This fulfills God's holy plan." Then John agreed.
When Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the heavens opened. Jesus saw the Spirit of God descending on him like a dove.

Jesus is tempted
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert. There the devil tempted him.
After 40 days and 40 nights without eating, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said: "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to turn into bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city. He made him stand on the highest point of the temple.
"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. It is written, 'The Lord will command his angels concerning you, to guard you in all your ways; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'" (Psalm 91:11,12)
Jesus answered, "It is also written, 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
In the end, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"If you bow and worship me," he said, "I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan! It is written, 'Worship the Lord your God. He is the only one you must serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus. The angels came and took care of him. Jesus began to preach.
John was imprisoned. When Jesus heard about this, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus walked from Nazareth. He walked to live in the city of Capernaum. It was on the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
In this way, what the prophet Isaiah said came true. He said,
The land of Zebulun! The land of Naphtali! The Galilee, where non-Jewish people live! The land along the Mediterranean Sea! The lands east of the Jordan River!
"The people who live now in darkness to see a great light. Now living in a very dark land. But a light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1,2)
From that time Jesus began to preach. "Repent of your sins!" He said. "The kingdom of heaven is near." Jesus chooses the first disciples
One day, Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers. They were Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting nets into the lake. They were fishermen.
Come. Follow me, Jesus said. So I can make you fishers of men.
Meanwhile, they left their nets and followed him.
From there, he saw two other brothers. They were James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee. While they were mending their nets, Jesus called them.
Meanwhile, they got out of the boat and left their father, and followed Jesus. Jesus heals the sick.
Jesus went throughout all Galilee. There he taught in the synagogues. He preached the good news of the kingdom of God. He healed every disease and sickness among the people.
The news about him spread throughout all of Syria. People brought to him all those who were sick with various kinds of diseases. Some were suffering from severe pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were trembling violently. And others were completely unable to move. And Jesus healed them all.
He was followed by large crowds. Some people came from the Galilee, from the region known as the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan River.
Jesus gives blessings
Jesus saw the crowds. He went up on a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
After that, he began to teach them. He said,
Blessed are those who are spiritually needy. The kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
Congratulations to those who are sad. So they may find consolation.
Blessed are those without pride. So that they may be given the land.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
Blessed are those who show mercy. So that they may be shown mercy.
Blessed are those whose hearts are pure, so they may see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.
Congratulations to those who suffer because they do the right thing. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Congratulations to you when people mock you and hurt you because of me. Also, congratulations to you when they spread all kinds of evil lies about you because of me.
Be happy and joyful. Your reward in paradise is great. In the same way, people hurt the prophets who lived long ago. The salt and the light
You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it become salty again? It is no longer good for anything. It will be thrown out. People will walk all over it.
You are the light of the world. A city on a mountain that cannot be hidden.
Also, people don’t light a lamp and put it under a cup. On the contrary, they put it on a stand. Then it lights up the whole house.
In the same way, let your light shine before people. Then they will see the good things you do. And they will praise your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the full meaning of the law.
Don't think that I came to abolish what is written in the Law or in the Prophets. I did not come to do that. On the contrary, I came to complete the true meaning of what is written.
What I am going to tell you is true. The sky and the earth will disappear before the smallest letter of the law disappears. Not even the smallest stroke of the pen will disappear from the law until everything is completed.
You shall not break even one of the least important commandments. And people have not been taught to break them. If you do so, you will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. On the contrary, practice and teach these commandments. Then you will be called important in the kingdom of heaven.
Here’s what I tell you. You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.
Have you heard what they told the people who lived long ago? They told them, "Do not kill anyone. (Exodus 20:13) Whoever kills someone will be held accountable."
As for Hani, I tell you. Don't get angry at your brother. Whoever gets angry at his brother will be judged. Moreover, whoever says to his brother "Raka" must stand before the Sanhedrin. But whoever says "You fool!" is in danger of the fire of Hell.
Suppose you are presenting your gift on the altar. And you think that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift in front of the altar. First, go and be reconciled with your brother. Then come back and present your gift.
Assume that no one has a right against you and is going to file a lawsuit against you. Resolve the matter quickly. Do it while you are still on the way with him. If you don't do it, he can hand you over to the judge. The judge can hand you over to the officer. And you can be imprisoned.
What I'm going to tell you is true. Don't leave until you pay the last penny! Adultery
Have you heard what they said, "Do not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
As for Hani, I tell you. Don't even look at a woman in a wrong way. Whoever does that has committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. Your eye is just one part of your body. It's better to lose it because your whole body could end up in the fire.
If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is just one part of your body. It is better to lose it than for your whole body to go to hell. Divorce
They said, "Suppose a man divorces his wife. If he does this, he must give her a certificate of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
This is what we tell you. The one who divorces his wife lets her commit adultery. And the one who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. A man can only divorce his wife if she was not faithful to him. The oath.
Once again, you heard what they said to your people long ago. They told them, "Do not break the covenants you made with the Lord. Keep the oath you swore to Him."
As for Hani, I will tell you. Don't make promises like that at all. Don't make them in the name of the sky. That is God's throne.
Do not do them in the name of the earth. That is the chair beneath the feet of my Lord. Do not do them in the name of Jerusalem. That is the city of the great King.
And don't swear by your head. You can't leave a single hair white or black.
Let your "yes" mean "yes." Let your "no" mean "no." Anything more than that comes from the evil one. Be kind to others.
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
As for Hani, I tell you. Do not fight with an evil person. "If someone strikes you on your right cheek, show them your other cheek as well."
Imagine someone takes your hand to the court to take your shirt. Let them take your jacket too.
If someone forces you to walk a mile, walk two miles with them.
Give to those who ask you for something. Do not refuse those who want to borrow from you. Love your enemies.
You have heard that it was said, "Love your neighbor. (Leviticus 19:18) and hate your enemy."
As for Hani, I will tell you. Love your enemy. Pray for those who hurt you.
Then you will be children of your Father who is in heaven. "He causes the sun to rise on the evil and the good. And sends rain on those who do good and those who do not.
If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Even the tax collectors do that.
If you greet, you are a devout person; what is the difference between you and others? Even people who have no religion do this.
Be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
Giving to people in need
Be careful not to do "good deeds" in front of people. Don't do them so that people see you. If you do, your Father in Heaven will not reward you.
To give to those in need, don’t announce it for your own sake and let the trumpet sound. Don’t be like people who pretend to be pious. They announce what they do in the synagogue and in the streets. They want people to honor them. What I’m telling you is true. They have received their full reward.
To give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Then I gave you to be secretive. Your father to reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer
When you pray, don’t be like the hypocrites who pretend to be holy. They like to stand and pray in the synagogue and on street corners. They want people to see them. What I’m going to tell you is true. They have received their full reward.
To pray, go into your room. Close the door and pray to your Lord who cannot be seen. He will reward you. He sees what is done in secret.
When you pray, don’t keep talking a lot like people who have no religion. They think they will be heard because they talk a lot.
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need before you ask him.
This is how you should pray. "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Let Your kingdom come. Let what You love happen on earth as it happens in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, just as we have also forgiven those who wronged us.
We couldn't fall into sin when we were tempted. We were saved from the evil one.
Forgive people when they wrong you. If you do this, your Father in Heaven will forgive you too.
If you do not forgive people their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins. Fasting
To walk without eating, don’t spread your face gloomy like people who pretend to be pious. They keep their faces very sad. They want to show people that they are fasting. What I’m going to tell you is true. They got their full reward.
As for going without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
Afterwards, others won't know that you are fasting. Only God, who cannot be seen, knows. He is the one who will reward you. God sees what is done in secret. Hide your treasures in heaven.
Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth. Moth and rust can destroy them. Thieves can break in and steal them.
Know that you have stored up treasures for yourselves in heaven. There, moth and rust do not destroy them. There, thieves do not break in or steal them.
Your heart is where your wealth is.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are bright, your whole body will be filled with light.
But if your eyes are not good, then your whole body will be filled with darkness. If the light within you is darkness, then the darkness will be very great!
There is no one who can serve two masters at the same time. To hate one of them and love the other. Or to be loyal to one and dislike the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Don't worry.
I’m telling you, don’t worry. Don’t worry about your life and what you’re going to eat or drink. And don’t worry about your body and what you’re going to wear. Aren’t there more important things in life than food? Aren’t there more important things for the body than clothing?
Look at the birds in the sky. They do not sow or gather grains. They do not store grains in barns. But your Father in heaven feeds them. Aren't you much more valuable than they are?
Can worrying add up to an hour to your life?
And why worry about clothes? Look at how wildflowers grow. They don't work or make clothes.
As for Hani, I will tell you. Even Suleiman, in all his glory, was not dressed like one of these flowers.
If God dresses the wild grass like this, won't He dress you even better? This grass only exists today. Tomorrow it will be thrown into the fire. Your faith is very small!
Don't worry. Don't say, "What are we going to eat?" or, "What are we going to drink?" or, "What are we going to wear?"
People who lack piety chase after all these things. Your Father in heaven knows what you need.
As for the kingdom of my Lord, keep it as the top priority. Do what He loves you to do. Then all these other things will also be given to you.
Don't worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will worry about itself. Every day has its own problems.
Be fair when judging others
Don't judge people. Then no one will judge you.
You will be judged just the same way you judge others. You will be measured just the same way you measure others.
You see a little sawdust in your friend's eye. But you don't pay attention to the log in your own eye.
How can you tell your friend, "Let me take a little dust out of your eye"? How can you say that when you have a piece of wood in your own eye?
O hypocrite! First, remove the plank from your own eye. Then you can see clearly and remove the speck from your friend's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs. Do not throw your pearls to the pigs. If you do so, they may trample them. And then they may turn around and tear you apart. Ask, search, knock
Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Whoever asks will find. Whoever searches will find. The door will open for the one who knocks.
Suppose your son asks for bread. Which one of you would give him a stone?
And we do not assume that he asks for a fish. Who among you would give him a snake?
Even if you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
In everything, treat others as you would like to be treated. This is what is written in the law and in the prophets. The large and small gates
Enter the kingdom of my Lord through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to death and hell. Many people walk on this road.
The door is small and the path narrow that leads to life. Few are those who find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets. They come to you pretending to be sheep. But inside, they are ravenous wolves.
You can truly know who they are by what they do. "Do people pick grapes from thornbushes? Do they pick figs from thistles?
Like like, every good tree gives good fruit. As for the bad tree, it gives bad fruit.
A good tree does not produce bad fruit. And a bad tree does not produce good fruit.
Any tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down. It is thrown into the fire.
You can recognize every tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven. Only those who do what my Father in heaven wants will enter.
Many will say to me on that day, "Oh Lord! Oh Lord! Did we not prophesy in Your name? Did we not cast out demons in Your name? Did we not perform many miracles in Your name?"
Then I will tell them clearly, 'I never knew you. Stay away from me, you who do evil!' The wise building and the foolish building
So, everyone who hears my words and puts them into practice is like a wise man. He builds his house on the rock.
The rain falls. The water rises. The wind blows and hits that house. But it does not fall. It is built on rock.

I myself am a man under authority. And I have soldiers who obey my orders. I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes. I say to that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. He said to those who followed him, "I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with such strong faith."
We tell you that many people will come from the east and the west. They will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
As for those who think they belong to the kingdom to be thrown out, in the dark. They will cry and scream in their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman officer, "Go! Let it be as you have believed." And his servant was healed at that very hour. Jesus heals many people

Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many people possessed by demons were brought to Jesus. He cast out the spirits with a word. He healed all the sick.
His work was to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah said. He said: "He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed." (Isaiah 53:4) Following Jesus has a price.
Jesus saw the crowd around him. So he gave his disciples orders to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then came the religious teacher. He said to him, "O teacher, I want to follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have dens, and birds of the sky have nests. But the Son of Man has no place to rest his head."

But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm
Jesus got into a boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a severe storm came over the lake. The waves hit the boat. As for Issa, he was sleepy.
The students left and found him awake. They said to him, "Sir! We are saved! We were about to drown!"
He replied, "Your faith is very small! Why are you so afraid?" Then Jesus got up and commanded the winds and the waves to stop. The world became completely calm.

"Son of God, what do you want from us?" they shouted. "Did you come here to punish us before the time when we will be judged?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was grazing.
The demons asked Jesus, "If you cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" So the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank. They ran into the lake and drowned in the water.

Walk and learn what it means, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) I did not come to call the righteous to follow me. I came to call sinners to follow me." Jesus is asked about fasting
One day the disciples of John came. They said to Jesus, "We and the Pharisees fast. Why don't your disciples fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the bridegroom's guests be sad while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. Then they will fast.
People do not sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. The new piece will pull on the old one. This will make the tear worse.

Jesus got up and walked with him. And as they were, his disciples went.
At this moment, a woman came from behind Jesus. She was sick with a bleeding condition. It had lasted for 12 years. She touched the edge of his clothes.
She thought, "I'll just touch his things. Then I'll get better."
Jesus stepped back and saw her. "Dear woman, do not lose hope," he said. "Your faith has healed you." The woman was healed at that very moment.

He said, "Go. The girl didn't die. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After they kicked the people outside, Jesus went inside. He took the girl by the hand, and she got up.
The news about what Jesus did spread throughout that whole region. Jesus healed two blind men.
As Jesus went from there, two blind men followed him. They shouted, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I can do this?" They said, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes. He said, "So that it may happen to you as you have believed."
Now they can see again. Issa warned them strongly, "Make sure no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it all over that area.
As they were about to leave, they brought another man to Jesus. He was possessed by a demon and could not speak.
When they cast out the demon, the man spoke. The group was surprised. They said, "Nothing like this has ever happened in Israel."
As for the Pharisees, they said, "He drives out demons by the power of the prince of demons." So they were just a little bit of servants only.
Jesus walked through all the towns and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the good news about the kingdom. And he healed every disease and sickness.
Please provide the text you would like me to translate into English.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is very large. But the workers are few."
Please provide the text you would like me to translate into English.
Jesus sends out the twelve disciples
Issa called on 12 of his students to come to him. He gave them the authority to cast out evil spirits and heal every disease and ailment.
Here are the names of the 12 disciples. The first are Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. After them come James son of Zebedee and his brother John.
After them came Philip and Bartholomew, and Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. And two others, James son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus.
The others are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas is the one who will later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent these 12 with the following instructions. He said: "Do not go among the Gentiles." He also said: "Do not enter any city of the Samaritans."
Instead, go to the people of Israel. They are like sheep that have gone astray.
To go, announce with this message, 'The kingdom of heaven is near.'
He healed the sick. He brought the dead back to life. He restored people with skin diseases to being "clean" again. He cast out demons. You took by force, so give by force.
Do not take gold, silver, or copper in your belts.
Don't take a bag with you on the trip. Don't take extra clothes, summer shoes, or walking sticks. The worker should be given what he needs.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone willing to welcome you. Stay at that person's house until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet those who live there.
If this house welcomes you, bless it with peace. And if it does not welcome you, do not bless it.
Some people might not welcome you or listen to what you say. If they don't do that, just shake the dust off your feet when you leave the house or that city.
What I'm going to tell you is true. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city.
We send you forth like sheep among wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
Beware! The men will hand you over to the local courts. They will beat you in their temples.
So that they bring you to the rulers and kings because of me. So that you may be witnesses against them and against those who are not Jews.
As for when they arrest you, don't worry about what to say or how to say it. At that moment, they will give you the right words to say.
You won't be the one speaking. Go to your father to speak through you.
Brothers will hand over their brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their children. Children will take care of their parents and let them be killed.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But those who hold on until the end will be saved.
If they attack you in one place, flee to another place. What I am going to tell you is true. You will not finish visiting the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
The student is not better than his teacher. The servant is not better than his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for the servant to be like his master. If the head of the household is called Beelzebub, what can the others who live there expect?
Don't be afraid of your enemies. Everything secret will come to light. Everything hidden will be revealed.
What I tell you in the dark, say it in the daylight. What is whispered in your ear, shout it from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. On the contrary, fear the one who can destroy both soul and body together in hell.
They don't sell two birds for one penny? But not a single one of them falls to the ground without your father knowing.
He even counts every hair on your head!
Don't be afraid. You are more precious than many birds.
What do you think about someone saying it in front of people who know me? I will also say it in front of my dad in heaven that I know him.
Who would say it in front of people who don't know me? I would say it in front of my father in heaven that I don't know him.
Don't think I came to bring peace to the earth. I didn't come to bring peace. I came to bring a sword.
The boys will look for their fathers. The girls will refuse to obey their mothers. Kenana will be against her mother-in-law.
Enemies of a man will be those of his own household. (Micah 7:6)
Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me does not deserve me. Anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me does not deserve me.
And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
If anyone finds their life, they will lose it. And if anyone loses their life for my sake, they will find it.
Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me. And anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
Suppose someone welcomes a prophet as a prophet. That person will receive the reward of the prophet. And suppose someone welcomes a pious person as a pious person. That person will receive the reward of the pious person.
Imagine someone who even gives a cold glass of water to a child who follows me. What I am going to tell you is true. That person will definitely be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus continued teaching his twelve disciples. Then he went to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what the Messiah was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked about Isa, "Is he the one who was supposed to come? Or do we need to look for someone else?"
Jesus replied, "Go back to John. Tell them what you hear and see.
Blind people regain their sight. Disabled people walk. Those with skin diseases are healed. Deaf people hear. The dead are brought back to life. And the good news is proclaimed to the poor.
Congratulations to those who never stop believing in my cause.
Just as John’s disciples were about to leave, Jesus began to speak to the people about John. He said, "What did you go out into the desert to see? Tall grass swaying in the wind?"
If not, what did you come out to see? A man wearing expensive clothes? No. People who wear expensive clothes are found in the palaces of kings.
What did you come out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
It is written in the Holy Bible. It says, "'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way.' (Malachi 3:1)"
What I'm going to tell you is true. There is no one more important than John the Baptist to be born. Yet the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is more important than him.
From the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power. And strong people are holding onto it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you are ready to accept it, John is Elijah who was supposed to come.
Those who have ears, let them hear.
Who can I compare people today to? Like kids sitting in the markets calling out to people. They say,
We played the flute for you. But you did not dance. We sang a funeral song. But you did not grieve.
When John came, he neither argued nor drank like you. And people say, 'He has a demon.'
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank like you all. And people said, "This man always eats and drinks a lot. He is a friend of tax collectors and sinners." Those who act wisely prove that wisdom is right." Cities that do not turn away from sin
Jesus began to speak against the cities where He had performed most of His miracles. The people there did not repent of their sins. So He said,
How great a disaster you will be, O Chorazin! How great a disaster you will be, O Bethsaida! If the miracles that happened in you had happened in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago. They would have put on sackcloth. They would have sat in ashes.
As for your transfer, on the Day of Judgment it will be easier for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
And you, Kfar Nahum? Are you going to rise to the sky? No! You are going down to the place of the dead. Imagine the miracles that happened to you had happened in Sodom. It would still be around now.
"As for your transfer, on the Day of Judgment it will be easier for Sodom than for you." Rest for all who are weary.
At that time Jesus said, "Thank you, Abba. You are the Lord of heaven and earth. You have hidden these things from the wise and learned. But you have revealed them to little children.
Yes, Dad. This is what you used to love.
Dad gave me everything. Dad is the only one who knows the son. And the only ones who know dad are the son and the people the son chooses to show him to.
Come to me, all of you who are weary and carrying heavy burdens. I will give you rest.
Be my servants and learn from me. I am gentle and I have no pride. You will find rest for your souls.
My service is easy for me, and my burden is light.
Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath day
On Saturday during the day, Jesus was walking through the grain fields. His disciples were hungry. So they began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this. They said to Jesus, "Look! This is against the law to do on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did? He and his men were hungry.
He entered the house of my Lord. He and his men ate the holy bread. It was only allowed for the priests to eat it.
Didn't you read the law? It says how every Sabbath day, the priests in the temple must do their service on that day. But they are not considered guilty.
We tell you that what is more important than the structure is here.
The Holy Bible says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You do not know what these words mean. If you did, you would not accuse those who are without sin.
The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
After he left that place, Jesus went to their synagogue.
There was a man whose hand was weak and crooked. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. So they asked him, "Does the law allow us to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "What if one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath? Would you not hold it and lift it out?
The man is worth more than the sheep! The law allows us to do good on Saturday.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out. It became like new, just like the other hand exactly.
As for the Pharisees, they went out and planned how to kill Jesus. Abdullah Al-Mukhtar
Jesus knew everything about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
As for him, he warned them not to say who he is.
This was about to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah said. He says,
Haw Abdi. I chose him. He is the one I love. I am very happy with him. I will put myself behind him. He will announce to the nations that everything will be fixed.
He will not argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
He will not break a broken branch. He will not extinguish a weak flame. He will fix everything.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebub
A man possessed by a demon was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus saw him. Then the man was able to speak and see.
Everyone was amazed. They said, "Is this not the son of David?"
The Pharisees heard this. They said, "This man drives out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be destroyed. Every city or family divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil drives out the devil, it means he is fighting within himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebub. Now, by whose power do you cast them out, ascetic? Then, they will be your rulers.
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Don't even think about that. How can you enter the house of a strong man and take only what he owns? You must first tie him up. Then you can steal his house.
Whoever is not with me is against me. And whoever does not gather the sheep with me will scatter them.
Here’s what I tell you. Every sin and every evil word spoken against my Lord can be forgiven. But evil words against the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven.
Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. Such a person will not be forgiven now or in the days to come.
If the tree is good, its fruit will be good. If the tree is bad, its fruit will be bad. You can recognize the tree by its fruit.
O nest of poisonous snakes! How can you evil ones say something good? Your mouth says everything that is in your hearts.
A good man says good words. These words come from the goodness hidden inside him. An evil man says evil words. These words come from the evil hidden inside him.
As for Hani, let me tell you. On the Day of Judgment, people will be held accountable for every careless word they said.
With your words, you will be judged guilty or innocent." The miraculous sign of Younes
Some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
Answer, "Evil and treacherous people ask for a miraculous sign! But the only sign that will be given is the sign of the Prophet Jonah.
Jonah was in the belly of a big whale for three days and three nights. Something like this will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.
The people of Nineveh will stand on the Day of Judgment with the people who are living now. And the people of Nineveh will prove that these people are guilty. The people of Nineveh repented from their sins as Jonah preached to them. And now there is someone more important than Jonah present.
The Queen of the South will stand on the Day of Judgment with the people who are alive now. And she will prove that they are guilty. She came from very far away to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And now someone more important than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit leaves a man? It goes to dry places looking for a place to rest. But it doesn't find one.
Then she says, 'I will return to the house I left.' When she gets there, she finds the house empty. The house has been cleaned and tidied.
Then the evil spirit goes and takes with it seven other spirits more evil than itself. They go and dwell in the place. This man's condition becomes worse than before. This is how the condition of evil people will be today." The mother of Jesus and his brothers
While Issa was still talking with the group, his mother and his brother were standing outside. They wanted to talk to him.
They told him, "Your mother and siblings are standing outside. They want to talk to you."
Jesus replied, "Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples. He said, "Here is my mother! Here are my brothers!"
Whoever does what they want, my father in heaven is my brother, my sister, or my mother.
The Farmer's Story
On the same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
Large crowds gathered around him. So he got into a boat. He sat in it. Everyone stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things using stories. He said, "A farmer went out to plant his seeds.
Scattering the seeds on the ground. Some fell on a path. The birds came and ate them.
A little bit of the seeds fell on rocky places, where there wasn't much soil. The plants grew quickly because the soil wasn't deep.
When the sun rose, it burned the plants. They dried up because they have no roots.
Another plant was sown among the thorns. The thorns grew and overwhelmed the plants.
And some other seeds fell on good soil. They produced a crop 100, 60, or 30 times more than what was sown.
Those who have ears, let them hear.
The students came to him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
Answer, "You have been given the opportunity to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. It has not been given to outsiders.
Everyone has this type of knowledge to give more. In fact, they have a lot. And if there is someone who does not have this type of knowledge, even the little they have will be taken from them.
That's why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They see, but they don't really see. They hear, but they don't hear or understand."
In them, the words of the prophet Isaiah come true. He said, "You will hear but never understand. You will see but never know what you are seeing."
The hearts of these people have become stubborn. They barely hear with their ears. They have closed their eyes. Otherwise, they might see with their eyes. They might hear with their ears. They might understand with their hearts. They might return to the Lord, and then He would heal them.' (Isaiah 6:9,10)
As for your eyes, they are blessed because they see. And your ears are blessed because they hear.
What I'm going to tell you is true. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see. But they did not see it. They wanted to hear what you hear. But they did not hear it.
Listen! Here is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes and steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed sown along the path.
And others received the planting that fell on rocky places. They are the ones who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.
As for those who do not have roots, they only last for a short time. They quickly fall away from faith when problems or suffering come to them because of the message.
And others received the seed that fell among the thorns. They are the ones who hear the message. But afterward, the worries of the world and the deceitful promise of wealth choke it. They prevent it from producing fruit.
As for others, they received the seed that fell on good soil. They are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop that is 100, 60, or 30 times more than what the farmer planted." The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowd another story. "This is how the kingdom of heaven is like," he said. "A man planted good seed in his field.
But when everyone was asleep, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The owner's servants came to him. They said, "Sir, didn't you plant good crops in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?"
"An enemy did this," he replied. "The slaves asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull out the weeds?'"
"No," the owner answered. "When you pull out the weeds, you might pull out the wheat with them."
Let them grow up together until harvest time. Then I will tell the workers what to do. I will tell them: first, gather the weeds. Tie them into bundles to burn them. Then gather the wheat. Store it in my warehouse." The story of the mustard seed and the yeast
Jesus told the crowd another story. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. One took the seed and planted it in a field.
It is the smallest seed among all your seeds. But to grow, it becomes the biggest plant in the whole garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and sit on its branches.
Jesus told them another story. "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast," he said. "A woman took some and mixed it into a large amount of flour. The yeast spread through all the dough."
Jesus said all these things to people by using stories. He never told them anything without telling a story.
This is the word that the prophet spoke came true. He said: "I will open my mouth and tell stories. I will tell about things that have been hidden since the world was created." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the parable of the weeds
After that, Jesus walked away from the crowd and entered the house. His disciples came to him. They said, "Explain to us the story of the grass in the field."
Answer, "The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.
The earth is the world. The good crops symbolize the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to Satan.
The enemy who plants them is Satan. The harvest is the Day of Judgment. And the workers are the angels.
The grass is uprooted and burns in the fire. This is how it will be on the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man will send his angels. They will cleanse his kingdom of everything that causes sin. And furthermore, they will get rid of all who do evil.
He wanted to throw them into the blazing oven. People will go to cry and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in their father's kingdom. Those who have ears to hear. Stories of the hidden treasure and the pearl
The kingdom of the sky is like the treasure that was hidden in a field. When a man found it, he went back and hid it. He was very happy. He went and sold everything he had. And he bought that field.
Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls.
There was a man who was very precious. He went and sold everything he had. And he bought this pearl. The story of the necklace
Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net. It was cast into the lake. It caught all kinds of fish.
When it was full, the fishermen caught it and brought it up to the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish in the baskets. As for the bad fish, they threw it far away.
This is how the Day of Judgment will be. The angels will come. They will separate the people who did wrong from those who did right.
To throw the evil people into the blazing furnace. Those evil ones will cry and grind their teeth.
Jesus asked, "Do you understand all these things?" They replied, "Yes."
He said to them, "Every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old." A prophet without honor
Jesus continued telling these stories. Then he left from there.
He came to his hometown of Nazareth. There he began teaching the people in their temple. They were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? And where did he get this power to perform miracles?" they asked.
Isn't this the son of the carpenter? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers Jacob, Joseph, Simon, and Judah?
Aren't all his sisters with us? When did this man bring all these things?
They were not happy with him at all. But Issa told them, "The prophet is not honored in his own country. He does not receive any honor in his own home."
It was like a little miracle because they had no faith.
The head of John the Baptist is severed.
At that time, Herod, the ruler of Galilee and Perea, heard reports about Jesus.
He said to those with him, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That's why he has the power to perform miracles."
Herod imprisoned John. He tied him up and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was the wife of Herod's brother, Philip.
John was telling Herod, "This is against the law; you are taking her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he was afraid of the people, because they thought that John was a prophet.
At Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced for Herod and his guests. Herod liked her very much.
He promised her by oath to give her anything she asked for.
Then she told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a large platter."
The king was very upset. But he thought about his promise and about his dinner guests. So he told one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod beheaded John in prison.
His head was placed on a large plate and they gave it to the girl. Then she took it to her mother.
The group of John came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus feeds the five thousand.
Jesus heard what happened to John. He wanted to be alone. He went in a boat to a quiet place. People heard about this. They followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus came down to the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt a great deal of concern for them. He healed their sick.
By around evening, the students came to him. "There is nothing here," they said. "It's getting late. Dismiss the group. They can go buy some food in the villages."
Jesus replied, "They don't need to go away. You give them something to eat."
They said: "We had five loaves of bread and two fish."
"Bring them here to me," he said.
Then Jesus called the people to sit on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish. He lifted his eyes to heaven and thanked the Lord. He broke the bread into small pieces. Then he gave them to the disciples. And the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and relaxed. The students collected 12 baskets of the remaining pieces.
The number of men who ate was about 5,000. Women and children also ate. Jesus walks on water.
Immediately, Jesus let the disciples get into the boat. He let them go ahead to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. Then, he dismissed the crowd.
After he paid them, he went alone to the side of a mountain to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
The boat was already very far from the shore. The waves were hitting it because the wind was blowing against it.
In the early morning, Jesus walked to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were very scared. "It's a ghost!" they said. And they screamed in fear.
At that moment Jesus called out to them, "Be brave! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"O Lord, is that you?" Peter asked. "If it is you, tell me to come to you on the water."
"Come," Jesus said. So Peter got out of the boat. He walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Boutros saw the wind, he got scared. He started to drown. He called out, "Oh my God! Save me!"
Meanwhile, Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. He said to him, "Your faith is very small! Why did you doubt me?"
When they got on the boat, the wind calmed down.
Then the people in the boat worshiped Jesus. They said, "You really are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and landed in Gennesaret.
The men who lived there got to know Jesus. So they sent a message to all the nearby countryside. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
They asked him to let the sick only touch the edge of his clothes. And everyone who touched it was healed.
What makes people "impure"?
Some Pharisees and some teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,
Why don’t your students obey what the sheikhs teach them? Your students don’t wash their hands before they eat!
Jesus replied, "And why don't you obey the command of my Lord? You want to follow your own teachings!"
My Lord said, "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) And Zada said, "If anyone curses his father or his mother, he shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
As for you, you allow people to say to their parents, "Any help you may have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
This way, they don't have to honor their parents with their gift. You leave God's words useless to follow your own teachings.
O hypocrites! Isaiah was right to prophesy about you. He said,
These people honor me with their words. But their hearts are far from me.
"Their worship means nothing to me. They only teach human rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Issa called the assembly together. He said, "Listen and understand."
What enters your mouth does not make you "unclean." What comes out of your mouth is what makes you "unclean."
After that, the students came to him. They asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees got angry when they heard this?"
Jesus replied, "There are plants that my Father in heaven did not plant. He will uproot them from their roots.
Let them be. The Pharisees are blind leaders. If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
Don't you understand yet? Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it leaves the body.
As for the things that come out of the mouth, they come from the heart. These are the things that make you "impure."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. Likewise, murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. Also theft, false testimony, and lying to others.
These are the things that make you "impure." But food without washing your hands does not make you "impure." "Iman, a woman from Canaan"
Jesus walked from Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
Once a woman from Canaan who lived near Tyre and Sidon came to him and cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on me! A demon is controlling my daughter. She is suffering greatly."
Issa didn't say a single word. His disciples came to him. They sought his help, "Send her away. She is always screaming behind us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep."
Then the woman fell to her knees in front of him. "Oh my God! Help me!" she said.
He replied, "It's not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Yeah, my God," she said. "Even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their owners' table."
Then Jesus answered, "Woman, you have great faith! Let it be done for you as you wish." And her daughter was healed at that moment. Jesus feeds the four thousand
Jesus walked from there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain and sat down.
A large crowd came to him. They brought with them blind people and people who couldn't walk. They also brought disabled people, people who couldn't speak, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.
People were amazed. Those who couldn't speak began to speak. The disabled regained their health. Those who couldn't walk began to walk. The blind began to see. Thus, people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to come to him. He said, "I feel great concern for these people. They have been with me for three days. They have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry. If I do that, they will become very weak on their way home."
His students answered him. "There is nothing here," they said. "Where can we find enough bread to feed this large crowd?"
Jesus asked, "How many loaves do you have?" They replied, "Seven, and a little bit of small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks. Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples. And the disciples distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were full. After that, the students gathered seven baskets of the remaining pieces.
The number of men who ate was 4,000. The women and children also ate.
After Jesus dismissed the crowd, he got into the boat. He went to the area near Magadan.
Jesus is asked for a miraculous sign
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a miraculous sign from heaven.
Answer, "In the evening, you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'"
In the morning she says, "Today there will be a storm. The sky is red and cloudy." She knows the meaning of what she sees in the sky. But she cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
An evil and treacherous people ask for a miraculous sign. But they will be given only the sign of Jonah." Then Jesus left them. The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The students crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring the bread.
"Be careful," Jesus said to them. "Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students talked like this among themselves. They said, "He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said to them, "Your faith is very small! Why are you talking among yourselves about there being no bread?"
I still don't understand? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many pieces the basket collected?
Don't you think the seven loaves are for the 4000? Don't you think how many baskets of pieces were gathered?
How come you can't understand? I wasn't talking to you about bread. But watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
Afterwards, the students understood that Jesus was not trying to warn them about the yeast used in bread. He was warning them about what the Pharisees and Sadducees were teaching. Peter says that Jesus is the Messiah.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered, "Some say John the Baptist. Others say Elijah. And others say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
"What about you?" he asked. "Who do you think I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ. You are the Son of the living God."
Jesus replied, "Congratulations to you, Simon son of Jonah! It was not an ordinary person who showed you this. My Father in heaven showed you this."
Here’s what I tell you. You are Peter. On this rock, I will build my church. The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.
I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. What you lock on earth will be locked in heaven. And what you open on earth will be opened in heaven.
After that, Jesus again warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus talks about his upcoming death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples what was going to happen to him. He told them he had to go to Jerusalem. There, he would have to suffer many things from the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law. He had to be killed and on the third day rise from the dead.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. "Never, my Lord!" he said. "Such a thing must never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are standing in my way. You have no concern for the things of God. On the contrary, you are thinking about human things."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself. He must take up his cross and follow me.
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for me, he will find it.
What’s the use if someone gains the whole world but loses himself? Or what can he possibly exchange for himself?
The Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father. His angels will come with Him. And He will reward each one according to what they have done.
What I am going to tell you is true. Some of the people standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
The Appearance of Jesus Changed
After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John the brother of James with him. He led them up a high mountain. They were completely alone.
In front of them, his appearance changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became white like light.
At this moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will make three tents. One for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
As Boutros was speaking, a shining cloud appeared above them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my son, and I love him. I am very proud of him. Listen to him!"
When the students heard this, they were very scared. They fell flat on the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said to them, "Get up, do not be afraid."
When they went up, they didn't see anyone except Issa.
They came down from the mountain. On the way down, Jesus told them what to do. "Don't tell anyone what you saw," he said. "Wait until the Son of Man rises from the dead."
The students asked him, "Why do my Sharia teachers say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "True. Elijah is supposed to come and renew everything anew.
As for me, I tell you, Elijah came before. People do not recognize him. They did everything they wanted to do to him. In the same way, to torment the Son of Man.
Afterwards, the students understood that Jesus was talking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus healed a boy who had a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man came to Jesus. He knelt before him.
"My Lord," he said, "have mercy on my son. He shakes violently and suffers greatly. He often falls into fire or water."
You brought it to your students. But they can't cure it.
O people, unbelievers and wicked ones! Jesus replied. How long must I stay with you? How long must I be patient with you? Bring the boy here to me.
Jesus commanded the evil spirit to come out of the boy, and it came out of him. He was healed at that very moment.
Afterwards, the disciples came to Jesus privately. They asked, "Why can't we cast out the demon?"
He replied, "Because your faith is very small. What I am going to tell you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there.' And it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."

They gathered in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men."
They were going to kill him. On the third day, he will rise from the dead." Then the disciples sank deeper into sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived in Canaan. There, the tax collectors came to him and asked, "Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax?"
"Yeah, he works like that," he answered. When Peter entered the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Where do the kings of the earth collect taxes and fees from? Do they collect them from their own children or from other people?"
"From others," Peter answered. "So the boys don't have to pay," Jesus told him.
As for those we don't want to anger. Go to the lake and cast your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. You will find exactly the coin you need. Take it and give it to them for my taxes and yours.
