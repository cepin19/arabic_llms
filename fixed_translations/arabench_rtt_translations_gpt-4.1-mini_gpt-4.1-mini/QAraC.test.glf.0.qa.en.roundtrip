If you don't want, I want.
Oh! Sultan, what are you saying?
What a loss! This is an opportunity we must not all miss.
Also, I do not interfere. This is my right to take, and you really have the right to take it before me.
Sultan, may God bless your parents, don't bring us problems.
Saleh, don't be....., may God forgive me!
Man, seriously, is there a brother who advises his brother with the words you’re saying?
If you are hungry
I found a big feast.
Determination is not exclusive to anyone
Say it to yourself
This feast will never be in front of us again.
Don't be a stranger, oh! Saleh
And you missed the opportunity from us.
No no no no, don’t try to convince me, this is impossible, impossible, I won’t do that.
The problem is that he is afraid.
What are you afraid of?
This is a government project! Everyone takes
This is the rule!
Even the people who don't participate benefit from it.
He is the Chairman of the Board of a major project.
This means that he is dominant.
The International Beaches of the Third Millennium, more specifically, the first phase of the infrastructure
This person is very stupid.
Here we can loot!
If he refuses to take it
Who gave you the right?
You have no right to exploit her.
When his car wasn't working
Who used to take him to the project site? Wasn't it me?
No, if that is the case, you are right.
Who gives you the money to fill up your car four or five times!
Leave it to me
Don't be stupid and be stubborn.
Take a little benefit
Look, Uncle Khamis
And now, as you say, they call him a millionaire.
One third of the project,
The third is the commission,
Who plays in a folk band,
They say he was at a national celebration,
And he bought a hundred lanterns
Do you know what they did?
Guest of the zero.
It's no use, Aunt!
No, may God guide him if He wills.
Let's eat with him,
I spent last night trying to convince him.
It is an opportunity.
For good to prevail.
God willing, good will prevail.
This is common.
Let's keep it between us.
Don't talk to anyone about the matter.
Should we be worried?
Just my friends
Neck pain.
The man began to change his mind.
I spoke to him today
Morning for two hours.
He began to be convinced.
We have a meeting with him in a little while.
And we have to convince him.
He is cutting off our interest.
They actually let him change his mind in the meeting.
Brother Ali, Brother Othman.
I don't know.
Since today is my first day at work.
Count on me
However you can get it!
Sure. But are you sure I will get some?
Dad, I want to ask you.
If you are hungry and walking in the street
Are you eating or not?
I am a person who eats a lot.
Don't worry.
The plate is big.
We are still working on the first article for the meeting.
If you are not good,
If you have any inquiries
What I want to know exactly is what.
It is legitimate.
May God guide you, Saleh!
This is reasonable because you are a chairman of the board for the first time in your life,
The matter is very simple.
I will add our share.
In the project budget?!
What do you think?
So that no one suspects what we are doing
Let's put our share as a separate article!
This amount of money was stolen.
By the persons responsible for the project.
It can't be
No no no oh! Saleh!
You know how these things happen.
It just seems like you have a few concerns.
This is their right.
First and foremost,
Everything is in our hands.
I told you he is lying.
What's wrong with you?
He says that the new car belongs to his friend, and you believe him.
He said it!
Let's say it's his car.
In a very special place as well!
Except for a very rich man.
I haven't heard this from people,
He told me that he bought the land for him and registered it in his name.
He said please
He has the money now.
Now he will start lying.
Aren't we his family?
Is that all?
Aren't we going to get anything?
We pay and we won't get anything!
He wants to eat it all by himself, a bite.
Don't shake your head!
And not your brother either
Sit down and everything will be fine.
I talked to him all night.
I told him, no matter what, they are your relatives.
And finally, he agreed.
This is how things are supposed to be.
God willing, you won't get it all at once.
These are the beaches of the third millennium international.
And more specifically, the infrastructure.
After that, they start the second phase,
And you continue with him.
May Allah reward you with goodness.
Good thing you persuaded him to agree.
You are no different from them.
That's okay.
I hope you explained it to him.
We want a percentage
They all take a percentage.
He said even after I convinced him.
They want their friends to attend the meeting to determine the project budget.
They must follow up, this is their money.
We put it in, and we are sure about it,
Submit it as soon as possible for approval.
Take your time.
Who is this? Do you know him?
He is my brother-in-law who shares with me.
Do you mean that it is him?
Responsible for doors, windows, and everything related to finishing.
Good, good
How much do you want to finish?
How much will you get?
It is that we take the money.
Let's give ourselves a week to think about it.
And specify the amount of money we will receive.
There are people waiting and they want a little bit.
Abdulaziz is right.
If a person decides to take half a million,
During this week, everyone will think carefully.
And specify the amount they want.
By next week, they will decide and determine how much they want.
It's not your right.
Then, the decision is up to you?
Ignore him
Hello my friend, what's wrong? What's the matter?
I don't know what he's doing here.
Hello! Who invited you to this project?
This is a government project.
Saleh, is your brother's name Sultan!
This is our neighbor's driver.
Sometimes he drives us around because our car won't start.
Write.
Abdullah's document
No, no, there are three extra people.
What else can I do, I'm tired of him.
I told him, enough, man, let's present the budget and finish.
No, no, this requires an amount of money.
How much should I wrap for him?
May God help him, does he have children?
Yes, he has it, let it be twenty-five thousand four hundred.
And four hundred
They add it by force.
How much will you give them!
%pw This is too much.
This is my mother, just as we were talking about her just now.
Yes, Mama.
Yeah, no no no, this last one oh! My son
No, my son, she wants to go to Thailand for treatment.
Wait, wait, what's going on?
Why are you upset?
Just from the first phase, specifically the infrastructure.
Not used
Add three thousand
Buy me watches from Thailand with shiny rhinestones.
Did you add it?
Yes, Mom.
No, Mom, I added it, but I just wanted to make sure about the name.
My darling, Mama
Let's make the feast bigger.
Yes, but the budget must be set; it can't be open-ended like this.
Tomorrow is the last meeting, and everyone must decide the amount they want.
I am with her.
Is one million enough!
This is too much, my dear.
Oh! Guys, oh! Guys, wait, there's a commotion, give us a chance.
The committee is currently in a meeting to approve the project budget. We will not discuss financial matters now. That's all.
I want more
We told you not to embarrass us, we are in the ministry square.
Oh, we're screaming, don't attract our attention.
If someone comes and asks: What are you all doing here?
We tell him that the electricity is cut off or he got shocked.
Don't make a fuss, this is the ministry's courtyard.
%pw Shut up %pw Shut up
Thread it! Do you hear me!
%pw I was with them, how much is the budget now?
Without counting, my brother
Completely, 50 million %pw
Fifty million just for the first phase
How much is it now?
What’s up, Saleh?
Participation means caring, man!
In any case, bon appétit and get well soon.
%pw Come on quickly, let's get to work, all the beneficiaries are waiting for us %pw
No problem.. The most important thing is, we don't want any discussions, just let them approve the budget and that's it.
And the execution started from tomorrow.
And it serves a very large segment of society
God bless you, this is the International Beaches Project for the Third Millennium.
This is the first stage.
More specifically, the infrastructure
It is for future generations
Certainly, on behalf of our program team, we would like to welcome you and congratulate you on the opening of the project, which is tomorrow as far as I know.
Which took us about a year and a half.
A year and a half
Once again, on behalf of the Future Achievements Program,
This project
And future generations
May God preserve the blessing of oil for us.
The second, third, and tenth stages.
The delegate
Welcome aboard the plane
Why did they gather us here? When will the cars arrive to take us?
What? Where do they have to take us?
Praise be to God, I have grown old and become senile.
Let's sit down, the sun is hot.
Yes, a good girl
I just don't see anything.
Anything but the sea
Why are you alone?
Iman told me that my sister Munira is here.
About my father's land in the desert
I was wondering who lied to her and gave her false information.
Isn't this the land?
I saw a farm in the desert and thought it belonged to your father.
By the way, why are you asking about these things?
Do you have siblings?
Those who work hard, invest in land, real estate, companies, and make an effort
Headache-free.
I am upset with you, Iman!
And also, my sister
How do you not know?
They must give it to me.
They are your brothers.
And there is nothing better than the truth.
For the money
Now let's help her and take her to the hospital.
I don't know how many years she spent fighting with her brothers in court.
Nineteen years, if not more.
No problem
The brothers of Umm Sulaym are thieves.
Poor thing, she was telling me yesterday that she
She wants to build a mosque before she dies.
You don't know
What I mean is that your brothers are like her brothers, God willing, no.
How many years have passed now since my father died?
Why is she asking now?
And she saw the farm
What more do you want?
Is the check paid to her every three months?
Saqr, calm down, let's understand the story first.
It's not her right.
If it were someone else, his siblings wouldn't even take a single riyal.
I understood it.
From where
As if it’s not my money
Look what, Munira
Please take a look at it.
It becomes fifty thousand.
Because I had the courage and asked about my father's land, which is in the desert.
I am sure my share is more than this.
Everyone lives in a villa like this one.
Their children are in the best schools,
What can I say, oh! Munira
I won't stop fighting for my right.
Take my right
It's better to invest your money in the company! No, thank you.
Everyone is fighting with each other.
People no longer have mercy.
Don't think that your brothers are better than my brothers.
Look at me
Twenty years
I used to go to the court a lot.
And in the end
I didn't benefit from it at all.
Why are they doing this?
That's why I keep telling you, my dear, be kind to them.
Treat them kindly
And you will get tired of them.
And why do the courts take so long?
We are four hundred thousand in total.
If we reach a million like the other countries
I really doubt it, my dear, that he will issue an order.
Look, my brothers
I swear I do not want all this.
What can I say, my dear!
I can only say that God alone is sufficient for us, and He is the best to manage our affairs.
Sufficient for us is Allah, and He is the best disposer of affairs.
Didn't you have a court session last week?
As usual, my dear!
The judge asked us to write a memorandum.
We've been through this many times.
My love, they are going to invest millions, and you are just watching them.
As I told you, you will get tired of the courts.
And he does not take your right.
That's why I'm telling you, if I were in your place
I will be satisfied with whatever they give me.
Because the woman
We don't owe you anything.
The men are asking you!
A little while ago
Just some questions regarding her share and
She just wants to know something and then leave.
If you can't find it
I'll drag you and show it to you.
He will find his way.
I signed a waiver document.
Two hundred and fifty, and this is more than enough for her, her husband works.
Take it or forget it
Why is she asking now?
But he is greedy.
As if it’s not really mine
This is my father's inheritance, and he is the one who decides how much I should take. I either take it or leave it.
Neither mine nor his, we decide.
This is the command of God
Why do they torment my father in his grave?
I wasn't expecting this from them.
The reason is the money
It was inaugurated thirty years ago,
I don't know what to do, Nasser!
Land, buildings, and real estate are easy to understand
I don't know how much they charge.
Even the company,
You have the right to go and ask about everything.
And I will not leave them alone.
How will you return to them?
It's not your right.
And as for you, I have the right to know everything.
* *
Your sister gave him an official power of attorney.
The one who makes him check almost everything in the company
Saqr, Saad
He is shouting at us.
Saqr, enough
Brother Nasser
Sorry, I will take it.
Yes, sir
Go away now
Sorry, go away
Don't give him a reason to attack us.
Now, if he goes and files a complaint against us,
And he said that he hit him.
So, do we allow him to do whatever he wants!
He has an official document.
Official! We can't stop him.
He has the legal right to examine everything.
If he had seen the budget and the accounts
We give her forty thousand every three months.
If he reviews the budget,
Multiply twelve by eight
Divide it into three.
Thirty-two
Do you know how much?
This is how much I owe her.
Except for lands and projects
We are free to do whatever we want.
We have nothing to fear, we are not afraid.
If he agrees, this is what we have, and if he agrees, then welcome.
Let them go and deal with the matter.
They only give their sisters enough money to live on.
She is married
She has a husband she relies on.
What do you want to do with the money?
This was supposed to be from the beginning.
Yes, Mr. President
As he pleases
Even my office
My brother Rashid, this was supposed to happen earlier.
As you wish, sir.
File by file
When she discovered her true inheritance,
, villas, and lands she did not know about
Seven of them came out
They turned out to be sixteen
She did not know.
Poor thing, she was shocked.
Not fair
Don't leave them alone.
Come on, my son, I don't want to hear about the courts.
The more interested you were,
The less the judge was
One minute text
And then he says his usual phrase,
To the seventh, the fourth, the two thousand, I don't know how many
They will be very happy, my son.
You should never get out of your bed, Mom!
May God heal you,
No, no, please come.
*Nasour* and my sister *Manwar*
After we knocked on the door and kicked him out of the company
He is sending one of my classmates from school days.
His name is Abdullah
And now
I won't allow him.
Does that mean he can influence them?
God willing, he will go.
Yes yes yes
Do not rely on the judiciary
The courts only produce reports.
Delays and quarrels, idle lawyers
The years pass
And life goes on
And you won't get even one riyal.
May God have mercy on Umm Sulaym.
She advised me a day before her death.
Never go to court
Our courts said
She died without taking any of her inheritance.
She died and the judge still hasn't resolved her case.
If we were like other countries,
Hello Abdullah
Brother Abdullah
The years passed
This is my brother, Saad.
May God grant you an increase in blessings.
The most important thing
He is the brotherhood
Brother Rashid
You are my brother
Don't let money problems and
Do you have anything else you'd like to talk about besides my sister?
Sorry
Why do I have to ask him to stop talking?
He is correct
They don't even want me to take my share of my father's inheritance.
My mother told me yesterday that my brother Saad's wife,
Her father is a messenger in the ministry.
It's all from my dad's money.
We had been waiting for a long time,
We are trying for the last time.
You sent them your friend, Abdullah
They did not respect him and even expelled him.
Let's see what Sheikh Abdul Rahman is doing.
He is a very kind man.
He definitely said, Nasser.
*Don't worry*
Their fear of the law
Did you forget what poor Umm Sulaym said about the courts?
Maybe, maybe brothers of Um Salmeen are not afraid of the courts.
Just my brothers
He might be afraid of gossip.
They might be embarrassed to go to court.
We wait and see what will happen after Sheikh Abdul Rahman visits them.
God bless you
Is this the Friday sermon?
If you don't have it, get out.
What are you saying, my son?
He is telling the truth
Walk, %pw walk
I will go to the court tomorrow morning.
And why do I have to postpone it until the day after tomorrow?
I am the one who decides, not you.
What happens if you wait until the day after tomorrow?
Hello, my brother Rashid
This is a promise
I told you before.
Let's scare them with the law.
Now, he is begging me to go to court.
Because they knew you were serious about the matter, my dear.
It is important to visit your sister Munira.
What is this?
Oh, you asked me what this is, this is it.
God bless you all.
It is a small model of the courthouse building.
God bless you
And all of you
May God have mercy on you
Didn't I say?
I told you not to go today.
And I postponed it to the day after tomorrow.
So that %pw can get this sample %pw from the courthouse building
I'm ready for you to show you the way.
You enter through that door, this door.
When you enter through the door,
Put all your stuff there,
The phone and any metal objects so that they do not make beep beep beep beep beep sounds.
The case is recorded, they ask you to go to the eighth floor, one two three four five six seven eight the elevator you go
Look for the offices
Look, judge, if you really need a specific judge, for example
Also, these
You want to file a lawsuit against us,
We are here to show her the way.
We'll see when you get your right.
Either take the six thousand
As he said
Goodbye
We will have dinner today at my sister's house.
Oh, did the ministry approve his project?
My sister told me he was very happy, he didn't believe her.
He said if they agree to the project, I will invite you to dinner at my house.
Praise be to God, luck comes in pairs.
Oh Farhan, oh Abu Walid!
Lucky is he
My sister told me that he was so happy that he couldn't sleep last night.
Praise be to God! Oh Manal
He is not familiar with the work, but some good men helped him.
Okay, tell your father.
God willing, you liked the food.
Thank you, Walid!
Thank you, Abu Walid, God bless you.
May God fill your life with sustenance.
Very delicious food, mother of a boy
Hire an accountant and a secretary to organize your work.
They told me I just need to rent an office and they will take care of everything.
Please move a little, uncle.
Oh my beloved, my son
I want a BlackBerry
We want a bigger house
Look, it looks better now.
Dad, didn't we agree that you would give a speech after lunch?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the project owner, my father, Abu Walid.
*Please excuse us*
Congratulations, Abu Walid
You deserve it
Well, honestly, you're not an expert in business and commerce.
Hey man, there's a story behind this project.
I'll tell you how!
Praise be to God, %pw
Last year,
When the Japanese team played against our national team
I was at Souq Waqif.
I don't know about him right now.
This is a catalog of a factory for multipurpose halls, our ministry is visiting them, present to them
Any contractor can build it for you.
He does not understand.
Any contractor
Japanese people are amazing
When you open it, the computer says computer computer computer computer
Cinema, if you want
If you want a kitchen, press Kitchen
When I presented the catalog to the ministry committee,
And how is your contract with the factory?
I pushed a little,
Deposit
Most importantly, your contract with the factory
I have signed it, praise be to God.
And give me a little time until I place the first order.
What are you waiting for?
It is true that they agreed to it,
But we are still waiting for Abu Fahd's signature.
What did the secretary say?
He said that Abu Fahd did not attend.
Do you want to drink tea?
%pw Hey Walid, tell me, what did you do!
You don't know Abu Fahd, he might come, or he might not.
A day will come,
*He doesn't have time*
%pw Let's go,
You are the manager here
Do you want to kill me?
No, he must sign.
Look at all these files on my desk, they all need Bu Fahd's signature.
So, what should I do?
May God help you.
Fifteen minutes left until two o'clock, oh! Bo Walid
It's time to go back home.
I don't think Abu Fahd will come.
May God help you, come tomorrow.
You said that you have known the manager for a long time and that he is your friend.
What's wrong with you?
He is a useless manager.
A very silly manager, they do nothing,
It's a shame that they act like they're wise when they're not.
They don't do anything useful.
Do they do anything? Never!
They do not move the chair without Abu Fahd's permission.
The manager did not ask about you yesterday.
People's issues are pending
It seems like you're going to them the day after tomorrow.
I am in trouble
I face problems every day
Because the factory gave me limited time
No, God willing, no.
And if he asks about you
You're not the only one waiting for Abu Fahd,
Look at these files,
They all need Bu Fahd's signature.
I think he will come today,
Please, have a seat,
Or walk
I'll talk to you when he comes.
If anything happens, I will call; don't scare them.
%pw Goodbye
Sorry if I scared you, this is my wife.
Hey boy, they agreed to my appointment two months ago,
I just need him to sign, what is this?
Oh my son! This is the registration period, my daughter is going to miss the university scholarship, her papers need to be processed.
My problem with the factory, the deadline, the deadline
Just wait
All your cards will be predicted
He is drinking his coffee; when he finishes, you can come and see him.
Please, he asked all of you to be quiet.
Yes, Mr. President
Goodbye
Wait, wait, everyone!
Wait, where are you going, wait
I know what happened first.
What happened?
He has an urgent trip.
He has a private exit.
*I am tired of this*
Our business has been stopped, my brother.
We wait for Abu Fahd every day.
What can I do, we wait for Abu Fahd
Peace be upon you, Dad
He has no blame.
Everything is deteriorating
The factory in Japan,
Inform him that the deadline has expired.
And your aunt has another story.
Poor thing, she lent him money.
*He is facing problems from every direction*
Mom, I am very worried about my dad.
Don't leave him alone
Who are you going to call?
Yes, who is this?
Abu Walid
To talk about the factory and your brother's wife's money
Wait for Abu Fahd
Dad, how long do you want me to wait?
They always say,
And we are waiting for Abu Fahd
Oh! Dad, you tried as much as you could.
But all my friends are joining the university next week.
What are you looking for?
The phone, my love
Don't worry, just give me a little time.
Okay, who will you talk to?
Wait for Abu Fahd
I don't know what to say, my sister.
You were very patient with us.
May God help you.
Bou Walid is in a miserable situation
He is trembling like a leaf because of the fever.
This is because the specified time is about to end.
Five days left,
He will lose all his money.
God is sufficient for us
What's better! It drags me, it drags me, it drags me
I hope to get better, I feel
I have a strange fever.
The top part vibrates
The second part is completely fixed.
Fifty percent of my body isn't working because of the fever.
She is an opponent
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
My sister helps
She is waiting until we return her money.
May God reward her with goodness.
We're not worried about your sister right now.
My manager again, may God help me.
It seems he heard,
Only God knows what He intends to do.
*I am upset with him and with Abu Fahd*
He attracts me, this is a problem.
Tomorrow is the last day
My wealth will be gone.
Don't pull us away
Exactly in the brain, in the brain
How will you be able to speak?
Give it to me, let's see who calls.
Mr. Bou Walid
I am reaching out to you because I feel for you and I am hurting for you.
Stay on standby mode
Goodbye
You have been a committed person throughout your life.
I was a role model
Don't think that I don't know you leave work every day.
I can deduct from your salary.
What's wrong with your phone?
Instead of deducting from you
I'll keep you on the stocks committee
Are you going to the market with them today?
Never leave work during working hours.
If you do
Don't blame me later.
Today is his last chance.
What you see is confused, holding his phone and waiting for a call from them?
I'm afraid he might get fired from his job.
This is my phone. Oh! Abu Walid
He is poor (unfortunate).
Let him go, poor thing.
Oh! Abu Walid
Yes, hello
What's wrong with you, Abu Walid? I'm talking to you, not the phone.
Get your paper done quickly.
Don't worry.
Thank you very much
It seems that Abu Fahd is here.
What can I do for you?
He is a very important officer.
Where are you going?
Let's go to Uzbekistan
Brother, where is Uzbekistan?
It is the third office on your left.
Don't cough
Wait, Abu Fahd
Don't sit down
Don't look at me.
Or do you want?
House by house
Walk ahead
Guys, this man is crazy.
Do you know how much was spent?
All these years, you
Taking the papers, and bringing the papers again
The stirrup base is weakening now.
Going back and forth between all these ministries
We were just kids.
I used to carry bundles of rice on my back just like children's bags of chips.
Then, by the will of God, I learned to ride a bike.
Especially the bike that I learned to ride and bought
* *, olive green,
They were trying to flirt with me while I was riding this bike, oh God.
It is our daily bread, raising our children.
The manager has arrived
We need to celebrate after it ends.
Praise be to God, praise be to God
So, are you planning to quit the job?
I testify that you are truly a good citizen.
Now I want to rest, my brother, %pw goodbye
We are all at your service.
Don't you want me to give you a one-year extension?
Enough enough
May Allah reward you with goodness
You have already given me an extension for four years.
I was supposed to retire a long time ago.
All my kids have jobs now.
The last one, yesterday was his first day at work.
And now, Abu Abdulaziz,
I want to rest.
And you're just a delivery driver.
With Khanforoush
Do you believe that
I haven't eaten khanfroosh for four years.
Very delicious
I can smell it now.
We will do everything you want.
Transfer me to the Human Resources department.
Have you finished all the papers?
Yes, since yesterday.
Your papers will be delayed.
I am bored
Okay, I'm done.
Stay in touch
My son, Khalid
From this moment,
God willing, I will rest, %pw yes
Great, great
I am at work and I can't leave.
Can you stop by the General Administration of Human Resources?
I have some papers there.
I want you to take them to the Civil Service Department.
Thank you, thank you, my father
Where are you going?
I need to go to the bank.
And she calls us all
Yes, now
I need to go to the bank.
Send it with another person.
No, my sister, I can't leave work.
Okay, okay, goodbye
It seems he didn't agree, right?
He said he can't leave work.
What are you planning to do?
I will go to the bank tomorrow morning.
He is used to going to work every day.
I'm sure he's feeling bored.
This is good for him.
Are you going to let him rest?
Poor thing, he's happy that he's coming home early.
He called and said that Khalid
I sent him to finish his papers.
Fear God
Everyone must rely on themselves.
My mother regrets the nonsense.
Mom, it won't break.
I do not regret Khanfurush, oh! My daughter,
But I say, ever since he resigned from work and left
And Khaled was given tasks to do.
He is sleeping in his room.
Those who got lost in their sea (singing)
Good morning, Dad.
Hello, my daughter
Dad, please.
They just called me and said the manager is upset.
Let me see your papers.
Yes, Umm Saeed
I told you to let the children rely on themselves, why don't you listen to me?
As if you never left.
Poor me
I am waiting for you, and the khanfroosh is in front of me.
We are eating it today.
Goodbye
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
Sorry, dear dad
May God help you
Yes, the one next to the market
Get out of here quickly
I went, my daughter, I went
O Allah, in the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
God willing
It's good that you found a house.
Sit, sit, sit
I told you to stay at home.
Let your children learn to rely on themselves.
What can I do, Umm Saeed?
They are going through a tough time, I need to help them.
Enough, enough, rest.
And I'll bring you a glass of water.
And the scorpion stings him.
Poor thing, very tired.
And from the taxis
He is naive.
The market branch is gone
And they want its identity.
She hasn't taken her car yet.
And he gave him the papers.
I am feeling better, thank God.
Rely on yourselves
I told you,
I want you to rest.
Take a chair and sit with us.
The lunch is very delicious
I used to move from one ministry to another.
I run from one ministry to another,
Finishing my children's paperwork
You took care of them when they were little, and now you take care of them, you spoil them.
My children are in good positions at work.
They are busy all the time, what can I do?
There are meetings every day, either with the manager, or with the president, or with the minister.
They have good jobs; when they are needed, they must be there. This is %pw work.
* * So that you can go and finish your work, other people stop you and force you to stay all the time, what were you thinking?
I'm coming now. May God reward you with goodness.
I'm coming now, goodbye.
Sorry now, oh! Oh! Bu Shaheen
They called me and said it is ready.
If you sell your father tomorrow, your work will be done.
If that's the case, I will be late for work.
Fear your Lord
Impossible, especially tomorrow, I can't.
This is because he loves you.
Even though he is upset and tired of your bad behavior towards him.
You don't even respect Omar.
He is sick and has been sleeping in his room for two days.
Due to wandering in the streets under the heat of the sun
Let him give you the papers,
And go finish it right away.
Committee, starting from early morning until the afternoon
Did you hear that, mom?
Do you want to delay the construction of a building?
Since you have a deadline and a committee tomorrow,
Your papers must be finished by tomorrow.
Among them at night
He has a committee tomorrow, he must be there.
What's wrong with you, sir?
He held back his tears
In truth, I did not lie to my father,
The committee changed its mind
They said they would come by the end of the week.
Okay, why didn’t you tell him?
Oh! Dad, don't go.
I'm leaving because the committee didn't come.
Instead of sitting in the cafeteria with these girls
I tricked him.
Enough is enough
I apologize
I will do
Thank you
Oh! Dad, it's Khulood
He is wrong.
And also selfish
When he found out that the committee was not going to come
We are blessed through you
From now on, Dad!
We do our personal tasks ourselves.
Stay at home
Let me kiss your head.
Hello, hello my son!
Good morning
Ah! My dearest father
The whole world is worthless to me.
I don't want you to be upset.
And not upset
As I told you,
After I finish this research
I wanted to do it myself,
He asked me to come immediately.
I have a meeting
With His Excellency the Minister
It is my pleasure
You meet important personalities.
I feel happy when they say that my children are with that one or with him.
Don't worry and go to your work, (singing)
Where is Abu Saeed?
Please, Dad,
The envelope is with me, I will send it with the tea boy.
Just pass it to me, I'll send it with the tea boy.
Dear Dad
Do you mean it didn't happen?
He might have forgotten.
Because the committee will meet in an hour
No, God bless you.
My son has a meeting with the minister today, %pw
Give me the papers
This is my daily routine: work, home, work.
I don't see anyone.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, hello
Yes, no, I didn't say anything to him.
He is taking a week off and going to the beach.
They said he enjoys himself on the farm.
He goes early in the morning.
He is really enjoying himself there.
And imagine what
They say he is a skilled cook.
And he will go to him.
Goodbye
What's the problem?
What's wrong with you, sir?
May God guide you,
No, no, my son, I am fine, nothing is wrong.
Your papers are scattered.
He is on the farm
And it is
Her friend's papers to
I am thirsty, I want water.
Give me water, water
My dear children
No, no, remove this, I don't want it.
Do not write this
I want to leave them confused.
Thank you, my sister
You are right
No no no, I told him.
You are right, my sister.
Sorry, my sister
They call it the league and the cup
He spoke about the referee's decision in the match.
He started talking nonsense.
And they gave him the title "He who stopped corruption."
People started inciting him.
And prepare for him some words he can say on television and radio.
And also
Put him in prison.
Believe it or not, my sister,
These days, everyone only cares about themselves.
Why is he looking for trouble?
Now, I will never go,
Let him speak, and say his famous quote "Stop the corruption."
Praise be to God, he is well.
We are blessed by your coming
Goodbye
I'm late for work, Mom.
Listen, my son
I was warning you.
Last night
Right now, I just want to remind you.
Yes, Mom.
I will never call.
The radio or television, and I will not call Q-tell
Your sister, Aisha, was
And your fiancée cries all day long.
May God have mercy on us, may God have mercy on you.
As I said
Stop the nonsense.
Because I don't want you to be upset
Your uncle, Abu Munira
I came here two days after you were imprisoned.
And he said, the matter is settled.
It will be canceled.
After many attempts, he finally calmed down.
But next time he'll take you to court to divorce his daughter.
Yes, Mom.
I promised you
You won't see any good if you call a TV or radio show again.
I told you I won't agree.
Sorry, I have to go now.
I'm just telling you, stay calm,
The manager told me that
He doesn't want you to work here.
Because you might talk about management
And they started to get us into trouble.
How is the manager going to justify this decision?
He has millions of excuses to say.
Where are you going!
Are you serious, resign
What did I tell you before?
Hello, yes
Goodbye
I told you
You know, due to public interest
We need to reduce the number of correspondents in the ministry.
You are right, but
Please, just once, tell us "Stop the corruption."
This is amazing
Stop corruption
Correct, yes
You're still here!
We have work to do.
It is a disaster
Until this problem is resolved
What did I tell you?
I told you they were going to fire him.
Muneera was standing here and heard me say this.
Yes, Dad, I did it.
I heard them say that myself.
Please, leave us alone so I can talk to your father by myself.
Let me talk to your father.
He went to prison; we considered it a slip and forgave him.
We can't forgive him after they kicked him out.
Just because we are relatives,
Did you hear that?
Calm down
God willing, everything will be fine.
May God guide you to the right path.
I didn't come to drink coffee.
I know you
I am feeling bored.
Your uncle gave you two weeks.
I swear to God, he will forcibly take you to court to divorce his daughter.
Even if I go out,
Why do you want to get involved in problems?
Just be careful
Even if someone asks you,
Ignore him
Isn't he the man who stops corruption?
Yes indeed, exactly the same.
It seems he's not doing well these days.
We want to hear it, at least once, please let us hear it.
No, it's fine.
Are you police officers?
No, no, mom, you didn't understand.
I asked him to speak on a radio program about a problem my cousin faced.
He was hesitant.
We felt that he was hesitant because we spoke to him in front of people.
I told my cousin that we should go to his house and talk with him alone.
Did you feel like he agreed?
He was hesitant.
And stay away
Enough enough enough
I'm upset and I won't talk to you ever, do you hear me?
Are you Saleh Saad,
No, God bless you, no more, I have gotten rid of this habit, thank God.
You have a strong sense of responsibility.
The ideal employee
But unfortunately,
Even though I tried
Peace be upon you
Why did you come, you shouldn't have come.
I was about to call the secretary to tell you not to come.
Shaheen, what's wrong with you?
You don't know it.
Is there anyone living in Qatar who doesn't know Saleh stopped corruption?
Are you Saleh, also known as the End of Corruption?
Stop corruption
Yeah, work
There are no vacancies, you know.
Good thing you didn't hire him.
Am I crazy if I hire him here?
I went everywhere, Munira.
Not a single one of them told me that five minutes before I arrived there was a vacancy, but they rented it out, meaning they gave it to someone else.
My sister, Aisha, got divorced yesterday.
I am responsible for them now.
I have a big responsibility right now,
I don't know what to do.
He is trying to gain the minister's approval.
I just didn't feel like it was the right thing I had to do.
I'm afraid this man is taking my place.
Enough, stop it.
Who said I’m going to be quiet?
I just want this to happen in a way that doesn't affect me.
I am thinking of a way to get rid of him.
I finish him off.
But how
I know him.
Is he the one talking nonsense on the radio?
I will bring it to your house.
Just give him the information.
You are loyal, patriotic, and
A very enthusiastic citizen
Thank you
I really quit this.
I consider your voice the voice of truth.
This is Fahd, I talked to him.
Believe it or not, Saleh
He says, it's been a long time since we heard his voice saying stop the corruption.
He wanted to meet you.
This is natural, Saleh
I am diligent in the tent
Forward, forward, forward
You are one of a kind
For your beautiful words
Your speech on the radio is even better.
Let's hear "Stop Corruption" once and for all.
Yes, please, just one, he calls her Abu Fahd, listen, listen, listen to him.
Stop corruption
This is the original, sir, this is it.
Keep going, I don't want you to stop.
I can't
And then leave
Although I want you to continue solving people's problems and issues.
Leicester Saleh
I'll give you one problem.
You are the voice of truth
Dad, I want to talk to you alone.
He is a very important person.
You can't say no to him, you have to say yes.
Yes, correct
This is your chance
Opportunities don't come twice.
No, it is %pw
Don't you understand?
Wait, my brother, please.
From these issues and problems
Dear Minister
The ministry requested eight thousand tubes in its latest project.
The one that withstands a quantity of one hundred and twenty units of poison = pressure poison
But this employee
To approve the pipes that
Because he wants to take the balance
Stop corruption
Thank you, thank you very much, my brother Saleh, stop the corruption.
No, God bless you.
This call is a special request
I hope you listen to it.
The last stop of corruption.. Stop corruption
Know
Need forced him to do this.
This is the last one
The Sultan is decisive
Did the minister immediately fire him?
He said accurate information,
Now, Abu Fahd can do whatever he wants.
I will do all the tasks.
Yes, sir
Sure, Minister
Goodbye
Stop corruption
The last time, for sure, I’m not going to do it again.
And here is my job application, sorry, I was joking
They got what they wanted.
Listen to me
Because he is afraid that one day
And exposes his bad deeds
To critique and expose corruption,
They are afraid of you.
They deceived me, my sister, Aisha
You are kind,
Your uncle, Abu Munira
I assure you that I will find a job.
People who criticize are ridiculous.
They are spiteful, they hate our country.
Do we have any problems?
We have no favoritism at all.
I haven't heard this word before.
In our government circles,
We do not have bribery.
What we know
The employee
Does the foreigner get more than the citizen? No, never.
We produce everything locally.
No matter which family you belong to, we never have these problems at all.
If the manager or supervisor is upset with you,
We are the best people
Our country is the best country
There are no problems.
And thank you.
What did you say on the radio yesterday?
Mom, I want candy.
There are no sweets until dinner.
It means, there is no sweetness.
Why is your shirt torn?
Mom, we were playing, Adol and I.
I know you were playing
But what tore your shirt?
May God suffice you, O just ones!
Come and see what your evil nephew has done.
I told you it’s expensive, we don’t need to buy it, and you said don’t worry, it will look good on Walid.
Look what he did
The shirt is not suitable right now.
That's why he's not afraid; no one can stop him.
Mom, where is the candy?
Look how he intended to remove it, it's clear that this was deliberate.
And the poor hand
He was happy wearing this shirt for the first time.
He will go see
Where are the others?
In the garden
Why, what happened?
Something between me and him
Do not tear it.
You have a little bit of shame.
Do not argue with a child
The child should not be allowed to do whatever he wants.
He hasn't changed.
Don't ask me to watch my words.
Are you a mechanic?
We will fight them
Discipline yourself
Don't argue with him.
Why are you fighting like children?
Stay away from this mother
Do not interfere
He raises his children well.
He is a boy
You can't tell the difference between a child and an adult because you're crazy.
Know
It's not your fault.
Let's go upstairs
They don't deserve it.
We waste our time responding to them.
What one should not
Where people used to love each other
Okay, okay, I'm coming, goodbye, goodbye
Just, sir, there are some papers you need to sign yourself, the minister wants to see them.
Okay, okay, I will talk to the minister, don't tire yourself.
Did you see the disaster, the catastrophe?
It's new, no oh! Aisha
This is not the behavior of children.
You are right
He ruined the clothes.
Look, look
This is not worn.
Look at Adol's pants, he can wear one leg, the other will be exposed.
It’s clear that this one can’t be torn by hands.
It seems to have been torn apart using a power saw.
I can only say that God is sufficient for us.
I'm telling you
Who wants candy? Come here.
I also know
If you know, take a lap around the villa.
I love you, not just because you know how to ride a bike,
Also for another reason
You are telling the truth, right?
Okay, do you want some candy?
Yes, I want two.
I'll give you four pieces.
Who tore our clothes in the closet?
How did your father cut them?
He has a big pair of scissors to cut the car.
Under the bed, take all the sweets.
Not to that extent,
No one else can do this.
Why do we have to be silent?
The most important thing
It is that we insist on what we say.
Who tore the clothes? Walid is a child.
Which computer?
What is he talking about?
These cracks are impossible for a child to make.
Why don't you believe me?
Go find your friends.
Give me a second
You are always like this
We fight every day, boy!
The past days
I ask for God's forgiveness and good health.
May God guide you.
Who can hold scissors this big?
Go and look for friends.
Such a liar, oh mom
He went and brought that big pair of scissors.
Behave well, Zain! Sultan, Awsh
Come and find a solution for this, come on, boy!
How am I going to start?
Each one of you
You are fathers
A child is born,
When the child is born,
You are my brothers
Listen to me and make peace among yourselves.
Okay, tell me, what do you plan to do now?
So, I tore their clothes.
It's nothing compared to the disaster he caused, I lost all my papers and information, he ruined everything.
I will not leave him.
He speaks very formal Arabic, like the kind spoken in museums.
Ignore him
He babbles until he gets tired, then he walks.
He is crazy, my brother and I know him well.
And you shook hands with each other
He is full of hatred and jealousy, *
He is upset because I broke the computer.
Oh, Fahd
Solan, hit him, hit, hit
Fear God, boys.
Hit him, hit him, [silence] watch out, [silence]
Take your cousins and play outside with them.
May God guide you.
God bless you
Elderly men
What did you leave for the children?
Present, mom
Your brother, Abdulrahman
This might be the last time, boy!
You know it's the older brother, oh! The girls
He knows how to talk to people.
And he argues
Don't be upset with me.
You are supposed to
He plays a role
May God guide you.
Even you, you have become like them, my son!
My mother, they hit my son, this is a conspiracy against us, and you say, %pw, stay away
Stay away
There is blood coming from my son.
You embarrassed us, guys!
The children were the ones who were throwing them.
He doesn't want to believe.
I saw them
We told him they are children, but he didn't believe us.
He said from his window
He saw children throwing (stones), and because he was far away, he thought they were grown-ups.
I am not crazy
You can go
You might be tired or dizzy
Do you know who they are?
And you tell me that they are throwing stones at them.
They %pw
Oh! My dear
I’m telling you, go home and rest. They made a promise, what more do you want?
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
What is this, oh God, God
May God protect us from the enemy
Mother, mother
All of this is because of you.
Because of you
Your men, but they act like children, their minds are very sick.
Take me to the hospital, I'm going to faint, I'm going to die.
Yes, and it's the first time I've seen him.
And I noticed that he never takes his eyes off you, *
He is not registered in the business class,
But he has been attending the lesson with us since last week.
It's clear that he's eager to get to know you.
Don't be like that just because he loves you that much, don't be too controlling of yourself.
No, my sister
I don't want him to think I'm easy.
I ran after him.
Let's keep it normal.
Right now, he's running after you, dying to know you.
It's true that I still love him.
That's it, I don't feel like it's the right time.
One hundred percent
She is staring at you and*
Are you waiting for her to come and say, "Excuse me, may I introduce myself"?
Take the initiative
You are right
I'm just waiting for the right opportunity.
The right opportunity
What are you waiting for, are you registered with her in the same class?
What did the teacher say?
Ask her, please, miss.
Oh, what's it called?
We have been exchanging glances for three months.
But we never get to know each other.
You are very old.
It means that you have to go and say "Sorry,
May I get to know you?
Not to that extent
I have to wait for the right opportunity.
A quiet and polite girl
I don't know what you're looking for.
We finished filming all the episodes yesterday.
Yes, indeed
Never forget us
As long as I am free
He is buying the villa behind our villa for Walid.
When he gets married tomorrow, he won't live far from us.
There's no use now.
You are late
You did not know
I saw it empty a few days ago, who bought it?
They purchased it through a housing loan from the Development Bank.
May God bless their home
Hello, hello, boy, good morning
Uncle, start the engine
Thank you, my son, may God reward you with goodness.
Hello Noura, come outside, the car is running now, come, by yourself
And peace be upon you too
What do you want?
The neighbors are talking to each other, what do you want?
It's better to leave us alone.
The neighbors are talking to each other, you eccentric.
The guy parked his car behind mine, I can't get mine out.
If you don't mind, give me your car key.
Even the car key
I'll leave you with this Titanic atmosphere.
See you
Goodbye
Now you know a lot about me.
I just know that you are Walid.
Walid Rashid Abdullah
Surely, when they hear your father's name, many people think you are the son of the famous actor.
The same name, God willing.
In fact, my father is Rashid Abdullah, the actor
Rashed Abdullah, the well-known actor, is your father?
You’re just eating biscuits! Why didn’t you have dinner with them?
Tell me,
How did you find out that the famous actor, Rashid Abdullah, is our neighbor?
Yeah, right
My friend at the university, I know them, and she told me this.
He loves his acting, just look at his works.
He finally said, "We are living next to a famous and valuable person in the community."
My heart, what a happiness
He is very charming, he has a sense of humor.
And his son is a good man, he helped me, may God reward him well.
They said that
Do you know what?
Do you know why I want to take a picture with him?
Mom, call my cousin, Abboud
I can read an interview with him in the newspaper.
He said they are going to film a series about diving.
Lucky, he brought you sheep, a gift for your new villa.
It is registered that he is a good neighbor.
Hello Saleh, is there anything new?
In fact, we have very many names.
They told me, O Abu Saad, God bless you, that my name is on the (list).
This will be determined based on the need and the employees' experience.
We don't know
Maybe we won't transfer you.
You have to excuse me, I won't be able to do anything for you.
*Thank you*
We wanted to move and settle first, and then when God blesses us with money, we will buy the furniture.
I did the right thing
Oh! Abu Ali
Don't consider me a stranger
Anything you need,
I am ready to help.
Neighbors help each other.
But now I heard and saw it.
That's great, God willing, you are an expert in furniture.
So I go with you
Don't worry, my sister,
Whenever you want to choose the furniture, just tell me.
My love, your father applied for a loan; if it's approved, we'll change all the furniture.
And I repeat it once again,
Don't hesitate to ask me anything.
We are like family now.
Can't your sister study without your help?
I just want her to be independent.
I'm sure you were talking to her!
Do you want me to lie and say he was my friend?
Oh! Boy, oh! Ali
I have nothing against this.
As long as she loves me, and I love her, I will solve the problem.
You are dreaming
Let me introduce you to your cousin.
Leave it to me
As you wish
They will reject you.
We see
Good night
Good night
What's wrong with you, Abu Ali?
Brother, the car broke down.
From time to time, this matter bothers me.
My daughter, God bless you, she has a lecture.
And this car always breaks down.
Your daughter is our daughter
Don't worry
You don't need to tire yourself, my brother Rashid.
No, God bless you.
The car is parked in the yard, and the driver is sitting idle.
It seems that the Development Bank bought you a house and a car.
Not our car
Our neighbor's car, Rashid Abdullah
I see the relationships are developing.
We will discuss matters that concern both parties and will be in the interest of both.
Oh, this is a very huge development.
Let's go
Mom, this is embarrassing
She did not agree.
She said that Noura is like my daughter, and the driver will take her to the university every day.
Did you tell her that my dad's car will be in maintenance for a week?
I swear, no
The driver said he would take her every morning.
God is witness, O Umm Ali
They are good people.
No no no, man!
There is no initiative or ability except from God.
What a problem, what a problem, what should I do now?
What can I do? I have responsibilities.
Who will take my daughter to the university?
Oh! Abu Ali, since Mr. Rashid Abdullah referred me to you
We cannot refuse your request.
Bu Saad, Bu Saad
Sorry, Abu Saad
Bu Ali knows how much we love him.
Thank you, may God reward you with goodness, Abu Saad.
They love you, God willing.
This one is sweet
Guys, Mr. Rashid is busy, let him go.
Sorry, sorry, Mr. Rashid, if we wasted your time.
No problem
Lucky, you have good connections.
We are your friends and brothers; take care of us when we need something.
Just tell me where you want it, I'll bring it to you*
What happened, what's wrong with you, why are you holding me?
You are going to propose to me Manal.
They agreed, Mom, they agreed.
Manal talked to her mother about me.
Why don't you believe?
Umm Walid
Dresses later, do you have a party?
I don't understand
I hope Walid gets married soon, my light of my eyes.
She called me, poor thing.
She takes some accessories.
Not accessories! Jewelry
Is this my mother?
She will also go in a fancy car.
God willing, God willing
God willing, I can't take my eyes off you.
This is very genuine kindness.
In addition to all this, she gave you the car.
With the driver
If I went with you looking like this, they wouldn't believe that this shabby man is the husband of this queen.
Oh God
Are you going out in these clothes?
What! No no no no no, don't worry
I change my appearance, you won't be able to recognize me.
They will be shocked and think that I am a sheikh.
Bring him some coffee, may God prolong his life.
Abu Ali, I swear I didn't recognize you. I thought you were an important person, not Abu Ali. You're not Abu Ali.
What do you think?
Even your walk is different
God bless you all, the people I am going to suggest to are on me.
They are VIPs.
I arranged everything from the head cover (igal) to the car,
I am sure I will find it with you.
In the last series I acted in
There was, if I recall correctly, a wedding.
I was wearing shiny black shorts.
And my father, after that, taught me how to wear the bisht.
Because, God bless you, I have never worn boots in my life.
God willing, you look very beautiful.
Something like this, so when you enter the guest room
This is not right
My brother, Rashid,
Do you have cufflinks?
Good evening
The one who is always with me and with Kholoud
That's why
You are my beloved.
We are family now
And we don't want our daughter, Noura, to be far from us.
Noura suits Walid
He told me that he sees her at the university, and he won't find a better wife than her.
We are blessed with this
I conveyed it to her father, and may God bless us with goodness.
Why was he rejected, for what reason?
Because his father is an actor
Ask your father to come.
Quickly, tell him Rashid wants to see you.
Where are you, oh!
I am screaming from sadness
Because his father is an actor
Aren't you ashamed?
I am an actor
Nevertheless, I act honestly.
I act on stage for several hours and my part ends.
When the acting ends
You play roles
I act
I convey a useful vision
But you
I wear costumes to play roles,
On the stage
But you
Packed in the guest rooms
The Role of the Wealthy and Affluent Woman
Who is the actor?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be upset, Walid!
Hold your head up
This is a disgrace
You missed the scene
I heard her screaming at him, "Don't beat around the bush, don't beat around the bush." Poor guy, he broke my heart.
And walking straight ahead
Exactly like the horse
It's Thursday, man, Thursday.
It is Thursday
His wife is crazy
She is jealous of other women.
That's why he is going this way.
So that he doesn't see women, and no woman sees him.
You see how his wife is sitting and bothering him.
Stay straight, don't turn your face.
Puree in front of everyone at the office tomorrow
Thursday, please, please, show them what downtown looks like.
Thursday, show me what downtown looks like.
Isn't your wife calling it Downtown Look?
Let's go, Thursday
I'm going to see what Salem wants.
Poor thing
When will you change!
What they say about you suddenly comes to your ears
Even in front of me, they say more than that.
Why are you doing this?
She is jealous of the women around me.
Why is she so jealous to this extent?
Sometimes when I sit in front of the TV
She, she
I swear by God
No, no, no problem.
Hello, peace be upon you, my sister
You see that,
I just spoke to her in front of you, I heard a man's voice.
I swear, sometimes I throw my clothes in the street.
Respect yourself and divorce her.
I find it difficult to divorce her.
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't come near me, stay there.
What's on your mind!
There is nothing bad.
Who are you talking to?
You are spending your time with these useless people.
Especially this fat man, he is the one I hate the most among your friends.
Who has chubby cheeks and hair like baby plants
That rude person has no shame.
Do you want to torment me in my grave?
Let me talk to her.
Tell me, how are you?
Who are you talking to!
I can't see anyone here.
Salem, what's wrong with you! What happened!
Our friend Khamis is crazy.
After a while, the wall faced him and he began talking to himself.
He burst out laughing
Khamis is a poor man.
He always imagines his mother and pictures himself talking to her.
God is sufficient for his wife
They say Khamis is with you.
He is busy right now, he has an international call, very far away, the call keeps dropping.
What does the speech say?
May God help you, Khamis!
Why are you awake!
I can't sleep, I am not able to sleep.
Regarding tomorrow's meeting
With the women's delegation at the ministry
Is it possible if they
May God guide you, Khamis!
These names are selected from the office of His Excellency the Minister, the Minister's office
Okay, let's go
Why are you afraid of her?
If you were talking to Salem, why were you hiding afterwards!
Tell the truth
Why are you hiding behind the water tank then?
That's it.
I saw the number you called last time, I read it, it’s with you.
The final number!
You asked for the last number after you deleted the number of the woman you were talking to.
Tell me, what's her name!
I told you, I told you, I told you
I told her that I was talking with Salem.
My friend at work, Saloom
She didn't believe me.
What are you wearing?
Are you going on a diving trip?
I swear to God, brother, you didn't let me change my clothes.
Who do you want me to call for him?
Call my wife
Call my wife
Tell her, my brother, give me %pw, a pen, call, I will give you the number.
You help each other.
You men are always like this.
You are exactly like him, a liar, I will show you.
If you intervene again, I will go to the minister's office.
She cursed me.
She threatened to report me to the minister's office.
She is very brave.
She intends to ruin my professional career.
The fault is mine for listening to you and getting involved.
Listen, Khamis!
She complained about me at the minister's office.
You will come with me and tell the whole truth, leave me out of this matter.
This has nothing to do with me.
You are a coward
Sisters and brothers
Good morning, everyone
I am happy that you attended the meeting.
Where is the rest?
He ran away
Where is Khamis?
He is coming,
Turn off your phone
Okay, don’t turn it off, leave it in the office.
The meeting is only for one hour.
This is not my mobile.
The war has begun
Oh my, since that day he has been sitting with you.
Where can he go?
He can't go.
And since that day, his condition has not changed.
Jealous, he is jealous of the presence of women around him
This is not jealousy.
He is sitting alone here in the living room at night.
He says she is my mother.
Mom! Mom died
That's why you invited me, so I could find a solution for myself.
She asked you to move from the section that has women.
Is it a military decision?
Look, the signature is very clear at the bottom.
Bro, excuse me, I have moved to the Social Care Department.
Social Care Department! Are you sure they transferred you there?
Why is it strange?
Thank you, God bless you.
Are you Madam, sorry, Mr. Khamis?
The minister's office called and informed us.
Have you gone to your new department?
Who is with you in the office?
Article, Saleh, Jassim,
Oh! Khamis, the minister decided to transfer you just yesterday.
And you just transferred to the new department today.
I explained my problem with my family to you.
The minister decided to transfer you.
So I have to go to the minister.
His annual vacation started today.
He will return after a month and a half.
This is a big problem
If you want my opinion,
The minister is telling you the same thing.
Work there until I find you another place, this time he will transfer you because many have told him about your problem with your wife.
I am telling you the truth
What can you do!
Don't talk when your wife is calling.
You never know, they might agree with you, beg them.
I asked them to put the abayas in the car; I had placed them in your box.
How many?
I put ten because there are five of you in the office, which means two for each person.
It seems that he is very afraid of his wife.
Imagine that he gave us all male names
And he calls me Abdul Qadir
What is his name?
He is charming and handsome, that's why she is afraid that other women will like him.
In the name of God, what's wrong with it?
Who called me?
Yes, Abdelkader, the one sitting next to Hassan, over there behind Khalil.
These abayas, each one can choose the one she likes.
Look at this one
How much is this?
What's wrong with you, what happened?
Sorry
Where is the social welfare office?
There are supposed to be five employees.
What is your name?
I am handsome
I am crazy, my wife has driven me crazy.
I am crazy
The project is open in front of us.
And I met them
What did they say?
They said
Lit up, come make some tea for a bit
I can't
Do you want me to go back to the kitchen and ruin my outfit?
Go now, go make us some tea.
Come on, come on, nonsense talk
Spirit, listen to what the men are saying.
Don't forget that we are the sons of the scorpion (sons of the scorpions)
Come on, come on, and bring me tea without sugar, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
The bank said the project is complete.
I called him many times, his phone is busy.
Poor things, they've been waiting for you for a while.
These guys are my brothers as usual.
One of them took a month off, traveled three months ago, and hasn't returned.
God is generous, goodbye
And all the changes are in our favor.
Pour us
Yeah, but if you build a garden
It will take up space for at least two or three villas.
The garden is a place for the residents of the complex to relax.
Men do not need women's opinions.
Leave him to yourself
Put the tea down and leave.
There is no garden.
Just one moment
My sister, you know that I love football.
Your uncle and brothers would kill you if they found out you play it at school.
What are you planning to do, kill yourself?
See, I told you.
I advise you to forget the matter.
Do not harm yourself
No no no no, I am upset with you.
I was busy
Forgive me, you are one of our blessings.
Oh, Uncle Shaheen is here.
God willing
Is this Thursday?
Elderly
Rashed has become
I am tired of searching for a woman for him; I couldn't find one.
From a deeply rooted family
You know,
Leave his marriage matter to me.
Is this from the Human Resources department?
Yes, may God prolong your life.
Put it aside
I have a few comments on his suggestions.
Present, may God prolong your life.
Anything else?
No, may God prolong your life.
I take care of them and meet them when I find time.
What did you do regarding the employees I sent to you yesterday?
What's the problem?
I'm leaving now, I'll call you later.
What happened?
Are you crazy?
We are your big sister.
And we were tormented by them
Did you know they asked me about the game I play at school?
I told them that you play table tennis.
It's good that they didn't kill you.
This was just the beginning.
Do you know who we are?
What is our origin?
Do you know what this means?
This time we smashed your face.
Leader of the Scorpions
Small scorpion
Uncle, let me slap her in the face.
That was enough.
Keep it for next time
Changed your mind! Didn't you say you wanted architecture?
Are you crazy?
A Scorpio woman cannot work in the streets with men.
Engineering and Construction
You will embarrass us.
Let me break her head.
No, no Sultan, no
Sure, boss Scorpio
I just beat Fatoum.
Let your brother take his chance, Saqr.
This is a shame.
No problem, Darkng, at least you got slapped in the face.
Look at my face
Why do they want you to go with them tomorrow morning?
What do they want?
Come here
Walk in front of me.
Where are you going?
Don't say a word
Where are you going?
I told you to be quiet, don't say a word.
And write education instead
Or even nursing, we have no objection.
What else do you want?
You have two options
So you know we are open-minded
Never say that we forced you to change
Nursing, or education
Go away
Bring us a copy of the application.
Soul, leave.
Scorpion Leader! Oh my son
The Big Scorpio is the one who suggested you.
Thank you, uncle, but when is the engagement?
Miss Munira
What you ask for is difficult.
I can't travel, oh! Abu Khaled
I have personal circumstances.
Recommended by the minister
Difficult
Think about it again.
Don't decide now, think about it until tomorrow.
How do they even allow you to work afterwards!
That's why they don't say anything.
I have a suggestion
Ask one of them to travel with you.
Girls must not travel.
This is nonsense.
No shame!
You should be grateful that we let you go to work.
Go tomorrow and tell them that you can't travel.
Be quiet, don't argue.
Listen and be silent
Khamis, son of the scorpions
He is connected to us.
It's true that he's stupid and doesn't have a degree.
But he is a scorpion.
What are you planning to do, my sister?
What can I do, Fatima!
I am weak and broke.
What can I do?
There is nothing I can do.
What can you do?
The engagement is next Monday.
I will call you to come whenever the sheikh arrives.
What a beautiful laugh!
I'll bring you some new clothes.
Get up and come up with new ideas, boy!
I love this laughter
My brother, I beg you
I don't want to hear a word.
Prepare tea, coffee, and cake for us.
So lucky! Aisha, you’re the minister’s friend now.
I'm afraid it's a rumor. Oh! Abu Khaled
Munira is a candidate to be a minister in a new ministry within the new ministerial structure.
Munira deserves all the best.
I hope it's not a rumor.
Are you going to work tomorrow?
We all must cooperate to serve this country.
Through the efforts of each person in their position, thank you.
I wish you all success.
Thank you, Your Highness
Thank you, Your Highness
Thank you
Hello, please come in
Peace be upon you
Yes, with soap as you requested.
He is the general supervisor of the women's football league.
Ask him about Fatima's game
God willing
Captain Fatima scored two goals like professional players.
Captain Fatima is talented, brothers!
Captain, what do you think of Fatima's playing?
She is a good forward player.
She is going to travel to China.
Captain, isn't China a bit far?
May God grant you success
Your sister is going to play an important match.
She was studying education, but I went today and submitted a transfer request for her.
She is going to study architecture.
There is no difference between a man and a woman.
Really? Go serve the coffee.
Where are you going?
I am tired of waiting.
Stupid, are you stupid?
Spirit, greet your mother and tell her that you have been expelled.
Soul, *
You idiot
The coffee in the dallah you have has become cold.
They don't call all year, but as soon as they find out you have a series, they call.
Hello, how are you, how are the kids!
What did you tell her?
I told her that you will be in the series with us.
Sure, and she will be the main character.
Look, Ali, Shaoula will play the role of Nouf
There is something called makeup that can make her look younger.
Maryam's role is only for twenty-six or seven episodes.
Let Shola benefit
He will give us endless lectures.
I'm afraid it will be a headache for us.
The most important thing is that he doesn't know the producing company belongs to you, you and Hamed.
I hope I'm not late.
Rashed is still here.
The director and the actors are ready.
For the sake of time, everyone, let's start the meeting.
Please tell us your opinion.
Hamed, do you want to say something?
Honestly, I think it's the best.
You see when the maid committed suicide
The most impactful part for me
It was when the maid committed suicide
When she hanged herself from a fan, she spun around and bled until she died.
She found him and cried over her son; the matter is very disturbing.
He continued kicking it until he reached the courtyard of the house.
Is it excitement?
The police come, inspect the house, and arrest the mother.
Indeed, a very wonderful series.
I had almost finished the chain here on this table.
It is, in fact, blackmail of the artistic conscience.
My community
They are all about extraordinary events,
This is not charity.
Seventy-two murder cases
What's the deal with crying?
You are known for obstructing people.
No problem, Mr. Hamed, let's keep an open mind.
Let's take a majority vote.
Mr. Nasser, do not claim openness and use the majority as an excuse; these things do not work with a critical evaluation of art production.
You are involved in this because of your government job.
Goodbye
I heard the doorbell ringing.
There was an Indian man with a bag in his hand.
He asked me, "Are you Mrs. Hessa?" I replied yes.
The bag opened
The ring was worth approximately seventy to eighty thousand.
I'm afraid the Indian man brought these things by mistake.
No, not by mistake.
She is Samira
Hamed's wife, the supervisor at the company
This is a gift from her to you, may God bless you.
Yeah, this is for you.
The ring is a very luxurious ring.
I have never dreamed of owning a ring like this.
God bless you now, my dear.
Yeah, that's it, I call it the Blessings series.
Ali and Hamed own the production, but they are employees there, so they cannot present it under their own names.
What more can we get from the ring?
Don't share this with anyone, keep it just between you and me.
Am I crazy if I do this?
Your genius husband
Who is called a magician?
Only five percent, a little.
No, fine, they also agreed to four million for them.
Your husband will get two hundred thousand riyals, no problem.
I think we will give the university girl role to Nada.
A wonderful role, she fell in love with a man and ran away on a bicycle.
The series we are going to produce is called "Blackmailing the Conscience."
They talked to me about the role in the series.
I really want to know,
Gulf TV series are always like this, this year's trend is blackmail.
Okay, tell me, Bold One, what is my role?
You too, my love, your turn is guaranteed.
Don't embarrass me.
I'm coming, coming, right now
I made all this breakfast, don’t leave and leave me.
This is Omar, the director's secretary.
May God protect us
He is the one who asked to see me at this time of day.
And he told him that it was going to be a weak and silly series.
Don't waste your money on him.
Okay, what happened next?
God protect me, what can I say, I'm afraid Rashid told them something bad about the series.
Don't be afraid
Leave it to me
A mentally ill person
It is a social drama.
I just saw her on TV.
No, may God prolong your life.
The TV series currently airing is called "Blackmail of a Young Flower."
Well, I guess the budget they're asking for is really high.
Needs a high budget
Just don't forget that the producing company is local.
We need to support him.
Don't worry
Did you read the art page?
We heard that they are going to start filming the series "Conscience Extortion"
A huge budget has been allocated for it.
However, it was said that the series is weak.
Another said that the series consists of a school that teaches immorality.
They might stop the filming.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Hello. Hello, please have a seat.
Good morning
Good morning, hello
I am Elie Mounir. A journalist, and I have an appointment with Mr. Hamed, if you don't mind.
Yeah, okay, please have a seat for a bit, because he is in a meeting.
Mercury, this will allow us to use a design for the universe
By the way, we will contact all the journalists around the world so they can get in touch with us.
This is your task.
Mercury Media Production Company
And discusses its problems in a way that makes it one of the best productions in the history of the world.
Can you believe who wrote this?
He has no shame.
Do we have a journalist like this?
Do we have a journalist like this?
A journalist must have a sense of ethics.
They work
You think they are here to*
I met His Excellency the minister, do you know what he told me?
This is very tragic and its events are extraordinary.
The first episode is tomorrow, I will watch it with people.
What do you think, mom?
No problem, Mom, this is just the first episode.
I've seen people talking to themselves, only in Gulf TV series.
Have you ever seen a mother who wants to kill her children, except in your TV series?
My son! Art is taste; it's not normal to generalize it to people and society.
Mom, this can be done in the visual arts, but theater is something completely different.
Don't give me a headache
It seems like they are imitating Turkish people.
Don't judge now, at least watch the first five episodes.
This series is a failure.
We can't let our kids see it.
Not to that extent, my brother.
There are worse series that are aired on television.
In fact, not just anyone
The fault is yours
For everyone, in every home
Spirit and gather the people who understand these hidden dimensions and lines.
And see it for them
Not ours
Tell me, what happened?
The minister passed by with some guests.
I stood to welcome him.
We agreed to produce the series.
How does the minister love him?
Okay, let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleague wrote this
I only post messages that say something good about the series.
No, no, don't worry.
Read the newspaper tomorrow, and I will publish praise messages from me and say that the viewers are the ones who sent them.
God willing
You are happy
For this year
Okay, if they have an agreement with him.
It is the best series in the history of Gulf drama.
They all agree with them.
Okay, let's say they all have an agreement,
I just read the translation.
I hope they remake the series Conscience Extortion
Thank you, Minister of Culture, for this series.
I hope they bring it back again.
When the minister's office called me for the first time
So that we can come and take the last installment of the money for the series.
They were right when they said you are a magician.
That was not everything
The profits were rewarding and we took our money.
And the serial is a failure after all.
The writer himself told me that he regretted writing.
I am here to suggest a second part of the series.
The minister believed the press trick that I invented.
He used to believe in the illusory success we achieved.
He is not satisfied with the series.
This means that it is impossible for him to agree to the second part.
I assure you that the minister himself will ask for the second part.
I just appreciate it
Say thank you
For all people
Who worked on this series?
And we congratulate them on his success.
They all deserve it.
In fact, winning those awards at distinguished festivals
It proves that there is
This is what you're thinking about.
You are a genius
You will definitely win the gold prize.
What was he saying?
He said, "If the readers and the press lie about me."
Yeah, why don't we make a second part?
As long as Arab and Gulf television festivals are a wash of arts
Whitening art!
I heard about money laundering.
Not a fan
Illegal money
The series are the same
What can I do with "One Two"?
What do you mean?
Didn't we sign a contract with them? They must be committed.
Write them down
Our products are exported worldwide: bread of all kinds and shapes—flat, large, small, triangular, and assorted.
How much did we agree upon in the contract?
Two million dollars
What did you do with the Australian baker?
He is the inventor of bread
Did anyone tell you about his product?
Not exactly, they just told me it’s bread, but I don’t know what’s in it.
It is pull-apart bread
She calls it (Sosta)
Instead of cutting the bread, (Samoon) as it is called = (semolina bread)
The inventor tried to make it easier.
Bread Jeans
This is the secret
You eat bread with the zipper (zip).
These people do very strange things.
This halva (cloud) is amazing, made in a way that as soon as you put it in your mouth, it melts instantly.
It can come in different flavors: strawberry, ketchup, coffee.
Do you know how much money I invested in this project?
Three million dollars, with patent rights
Here you go, Sameh.
Yes, Abu Nasser
Yes, sir, I am at your service.
We delivered it today, sir.
Stop it! Forgive me
We were with your son, Nasser, yesterday, playing football on his team.
I agreed with him.
To form his team of drivers and security personnel,
And we are still a short-handed team, we only have one goalkeeper, if he gets injured we will be in trouble.
I'm supposed to have fans too.
When I took seventeen players,
We came to you.
The people who are important in the company
Those who are indispensable
He took the pastry bakery at the hospital.
Why is the man upset?
He said he can't, he's from a well-known family, he can't run after a ball and make a fool of himself.
He can do whatever he wants.
Just don't take the essentials.
What can I do, Mom? My team has a match and I needed four players.
No more excuses now.
Okay, what happened, happened.
Hamdi, the work didn't come today, sir.
I went with him.
Al-Bass said
And they left me standing in the goal area.
The match has started
Then I didn't feel anything.
They told me the ball hit me while I wasn't paying attention.
Have you ever worked as a goalkeeper before?
I played just because Nasser asked me to play.
There is no power nor strength except with God.
We are tired from our love for football.
From now on, Nasser!
There is no football.
You need to cancel your team.
And all the bakers must return to their bakeries.
What do you think?
Fateh, is he
I don't want to hear anything.
Please, Abu Nasser.
Listen to what he wants to say.
Alright, just because you asked me.
Speak, what did you want to say?
Tomorrow we will have the last match in the tournament.
Don't upset him, Abu Nasser, please, I beg you.
Okay, oh! Guys
Congratulations, congratulations
Zain, Zain, Zain, congratulations
Oh! Mr. Nasser, I want to talk to you for a minute, please.
Thank you, my team was on time today
Professor Nasser, I must n
She promised us a party
Do you want me to call and book a hall at the hotel?
I call on the press and journalists to come there.
No, Rashid! We'll keep it in our house.
So that when my father sees the players and their success, he might not cancel it.
They won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup,
God willing
No, no, I saw him filming with the players and he was with them talking to the press.
It seems that Sami, the sports page editor, is sitting and meeting with him.
Photograph
Keep him close to me.
Take a good shot
He is happy
Your comment on your children’s victory, the bakers, made them
Very excited
And effort
Loyalty to the bakery
Sorry, Bu Nasser, we saw the team playing in a four-four-two.
Loyalty to the bakery and the coach's plan
Thank you, Uncle Abu Nasser
May God have mercy on you
Hello, goalkeeper
League and Al Jazeera journalists are coming to meet you.
No, they are not entitled to the council.
They sent their representative to conduct the interview.
They brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup
You know, we encourage the youth
I expect a bright future for them.
Yeah, goodbye
God willing, may your phone always ring, and your pictures be in the newspapers. You are blessed with this football.
Do you know who was talking to me on the phone?
Lowering the price of engines, Tamam said
Yeah, I'm famous now, under every picture of you in the newspapers, they write "the first player in international bakeries."
Weren't you interested in football?
What are you saying?
Since the day I was in school
The one who used to sit next to me loves football.
You say that I was never close to football.
Since the person next to me plays football, I am close to football.
Being close to sports means that I am an athletic man.
We are no longer the international bakeries; we have become international football.
I heard him yesterday saying that he was going to make it a sports club.
Today we meet the first athlete from the international bakeries, Bu Nasser.
To promote football
Before the match, tell us about your expectations before you go on stage.
The game is difficult today
The team that will control the midfield today will be the one from *..*
Yes, God willing, we are in contact with professional player agents to develop the International Bakery team.
His name is Saud, listen, we want commitment.
Yeah, he wants the previous deal for the players.
It was of no use.
When I gave you the prices
I gave you the international price.
So is the Gulf not part of the world?
Of course not
This is none of your business.
But you have to tell me once if a buyer comes from the Gulf.
Open your fax line.
Two of them are defenders, one midfielder, and the other a center player.
Look, these four players
Three of them cost
Two hundred thousand dollars per player
Take them all in one bouquet.
It will be six hundred thousand, I'll give it to you for five hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Zain, this is regarding the African players, now, concerning the Brazilian player
He is the player of the season, he alone is worth one million and two thousand dollars.
They set this price, but then I received a fax, I'll show it to you, it's here. Wait, look, look, I received it from a club in the UAE.
The decision is yours
Thank you
God willing, check his thigh muscle.
How are you?
The knee, the knee
The knee is fine.
We don't want to get upset, God willing, there is no cruciate ligament injury.
Oh! Bu Nasser
What is this connecting muscle?
Butcher! Make Maftooh (rice and meat, a traditional dish)
Honestly, you are lucky to have Brazilian and African players, congratulations, congratulations.
Thank you
To the shop, the shop
God willing, do you have another business?
No no no, just the players
I see that they are lowering the boxes.
Young players! Yes indeed, we want them, from the jungles of Africa.
Yeah, why is that?
Karim, open one box for him.
He is a human being like anyone else.
He said quietly, did you hear that?
He said they are young men.
As long as we are
Why don't you give us this little boy as a free gift?
Listen, Abu Nasser, if you take care of him and raise him well, he will be beneficial to you later.
They go and take him out onto the field.
Come come come come
Make it easy for him, he is still young.
Put him in the annex, let him be raised there.
Don't hesitate if you need anything, all the players are with me.
Your coach must understand
We won 2-0, we dominated the match.
My father is the coach of Spain.
What I love
Successful coach
He must control the game.
And this one, the opposite, Al Wakrah Road
You must not let your coach do whatever he wants.
He spent less than two months with the team.
We need to stop this.
If he were a football expert, he would have activated the corner players and not attacked through the middle.
Yeah, he relied on the offside trap.
Oh, Mom, don't give me a headache.
He has to fire Kakuno Malawai.
And replaced him with Shinamo Hababu Hitawala Hatawa Hawawa
No no no no no, I don't want him to play.
Forget Shlolo, Habouba Taba Lawah
Which line?
Execute the plan
And forget Hololo
What is supposed to happen is between the coach and the team manager.
Game star, team star
Do you mean that we are not experts in football?
Listen, Sultan!
Let him go home.
Don't take him in the bakery's car, let him go by taxi.
None of your business
Stay informed
Do you see what my father did exactly?
Expel the coach and bring him back.
What is he doing?
The team is falling apart.
Say goodbye to our team
Mama Mama
No, he is crazy. That means he said you are divorced, tell me the truth, what happened between you two?
From the first day I saw him, I told your mother, I don't like this man.
I feel like he can't handle the responsibility.
Forget the nonsense and talk about the past.
You need to go to her father and find out why your daughter is divorced.
I don't know what to say! Oh my brother Rashid.
Why did he divorce her later?
Not fair, Abu Abdullah. We need to know, we have the right to know, why is she divorced?
Please, do not interfere. This is none of your business.
What do you mean, I shouldn't interfere? And the man is sitting in the living room waiting to find out why his daughter is divorced?
She doesn't know how to appreciate her husband and respect his feelings.
Who is Barcelona?
It's not your fault. You don't know the Spanish league.
Barcelona now
This is Guardiola's team.
It means that I am going now to the man who is waiting for me in the living room.
If you go, I'll go. Okay, stay here and leave it to me.
She must go out and not nod her head.
It wasn't enough for her to insult Barcelona,
Messi, the magician of football, who scores a hat-trick in every match.
Maradona himself said that Messi would be better than him.
And your rude daughter mocks him. Listen,
Your daughter is not a Barcelona fan and doesn't suit us.
What do you mean!
Listen, may God guide you.
Don't tell me you want my son.
He apologizes and pleases her.
Damn.
And praise be to God, we have a lot of money.
What’s the use of our money if we don’t make our child happy?
Oh, stop it.
Most importantly, I will look for a Barcelona fan.
Mom, I'm not upset.
She's crazy! Man, forget her.
Drink the tea, boy!
You know, boy, they are the losers.
A thousand girls wish to marry you,
Drink, my son.
I feel sorry for her.
Poor thing, she divorced just two days ago.
One month after the wedding.
What's wrong with you? Do you want me to intervene with him?
I don't want to be in trouble with him.
Who told you these illogical stories!
Don't listen to her.
Does she know who he is?
What more do you want!
Her wealth only.
Do you remember the building I want to buy and turn into hotel apartments?
Those in Mansoura.
Owned by his father, and when his son marries our daughter, I will ask him for this building.
If I can't.
He spoke to her brother.
Listen well,
The son of a millionaire proposed to you.
Do you know what it means to be a millionaire!
The opportunity comes only once.
They are so rich that they bought a palace in Spain to spend the summer there every year.
%pw Okay, and what about the Barcelona story?
It could be the girl's family who spread this rumor to prove that their daughter is innocent.
Let's say the story is true and the man loves Barcelona and is loyal to Catalonia.
His wife is supposed to respect this.
And what we mock about the team
If we assume that this story is true.
God bless you, they used to call his father "Abu Burjain" because he has two towers on the corniche.
They are designed in a strange way, like twisted ropes.
When people see them from afar, they think it is a single tower.
What do you think? All the luck is yours.
%pw Hello
God bless you. Come on, have something, everything.
Thank you, my love
Just tell me, my dear, my son Abdullah is waiting for your reply.
No, don’t worry, my dear Noor, Umm Abdullah.
If I searched all over the Gulf countries, I wouldn't find anyone better than you.
%pw Tell them to give us their estimates for building the building.
I'm done, Your Highness. Is there anything else?
Yeah, the family will call you.
Check their wedding needs, prepare the check and I will sign it.
In the name of God, God willing, in the name of God, God willing, with your permission, Your Highness.
Abdullah got divorced again!
I wish the children from you and the money from him (like)
God bless you, my aunt!
He wears it because of the cold.
Yeah, but I don't know where my mom booked for us?
Where did you book for us, Mom?
My mother says she has booked us a trip to Malaysia.
What's the problem with Malaysia, then?
Have a nice trip
What's wrong with you? Have you ever heard of someone coming back from their honeymoon crying?
What's wrong with you? Hey girl, tell me?
Tell me what happened, girl!
Mom, she is very arrogant.
Why is it like this?
She is arrogant, forget her.
I did the right thing when I kicked her out.
I feel sorry for her.
This is her mother.
Why is she sad?
What happened to her?
God bless you. Don't forget to bring us olive oil from Spain.
Yeah, Spain. Where are we going?
All right.
My mother says she has booked for us to the Maldives.
Okay, okay, oh! {Girl} Maldives is still beautiful.
And after you enter %pw.
I thought you would come back happy from your trip.
What really bothers me is why they took the children?
Come! Take the bag.
What's wrong with them?
Why are you upset, my light of my eyes?
Be quiet! May God grant you health, you are telling me about my son's face.
Oh! Boy! Why are you upset?
When I see the scales, I will feel depressed.
May God kill whoever upsets you! Oh boy
Forget her, divorce her, divorce her. Your father has a lot of money and many daughters.
Be quiet, and I know my son—anything small that upsets him, why should he have to live unhappily!
Oh! Boy, call her and divorce her.
God damn her.
%pw Tell her three times.
You are divorced. Wait, wait, don't interrupt, you have two more chances left.
Absolute (masculine), absolute (feminine).
Very nervous %pw.
Oh! Boy, come on! Oh! My dear, calm down and don't worry, there are plenty of girls as they say, come on, boy!
Oh, a problem.
Just because they saw you at the disco.
Call him, call him, let me talk to him.
I'm asking who, Mom? He divorced me a long time ago, he told you that you're divorced, divorced.
Why did he divorce you? He has no shame.
Now if someone goes to a disco, what will you do!
And one if necessary %pw.
What's wrong! The world has turned upside down!
You see, I go to his house and despise him while he doesn't know who you are?
I, I, my daughter is divorced, Abu Abdullah!
My daughter is divorced!
Your daughter is different.
You buy and sell them at Toys "R" Us stores.
It's like you taste something bad in your mouth right now because of your daughter and you're frustrated.
And they did nothing.
%pw If she doesn't bring you the peeled apple, divorce her.
No problem if you want to call them however you like.
She is still married to a man.
Is this suitable for you? Let him go to hell!
And he felt the same thing that I did for the other people.
What you do not accept for yourselves
Do not accept it from people.
Do you know who owned the land of this mall?
And in a strategic location?
%pw Leave it to God.
And also at a low price.
Out of service.
I need to get Abu Saqr's approval.
Yes, I went to the library and didn't find it.
I went to his office last week and they told me that he had traveled.
He has a meeting, come tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, I am out of work and the problem is that I have to get Abu Saqr's approval, it's necessary.
Go to his council.
No, no, no, no, this is official business.
The right place for him, may God protect you, is the office, not the house.
Also eat?
What makes Abu Saqr full?
Everyone has a key
Tell me, Abu Fahd
Do you know him?
What I know, I only see it on TV, and you told me that you met him during Umrah.
But we don't know each other well.
Enough nonsense.
May God guide you, you came straight away, at least ask about the reason for this celebration.
There is no occasion for this, may God guide you.
The month is thirty days long, and he holds fifty feasts.
I suggest, Your Highness, that they include you in the Guinness World Records.
As the world's largest banquet maker.
By the way, who is this brother with you?
Hello, this is a blessed time.
We are honored, Your Honor.
Awesome! Abu Falah
You say that Abu Saqr prepares a feast every day.
This is what we see.
Wow! Tonight's dinner at Abu Faleha's for a special occasion.
Today, may God protect you, your son Saqr
God willing, you deserve your honor, with blessings.
He is here, hello boy!
Peace be upon you.
Why?
For this occasion, my son Saqr needs to stop by the agency tomorrow and pick up the car he wants.
I was waiting a year and a half for approval.
I was out of work.
But when I reached him
And give him money
May God guide you, Abu Saad.
Things don't work this way.
I told him, "Okay."
He needs to go to the showroom and take the car he likes.
We will buy him three.
He took you!
Take me to him.
You told me that you met him during Umrah last year.
Today, his little son Shaheen
His game is feasts.
This is your chance.
He passed by him and blessed him.
He deserves to be well. Oh! Your Highness.
%pw Shaheen Oh! Abu Saqr.
God bless you, thank you, everyone.
Praise be to God, Shaheen is well, Your Honor.
God bless you %pw
By the way, who are you?
Your Honor
You didn't get to know me.
I can't lie to you.
Your Honor, I was with you on the Umrah last year.
I remember that you bought a red rosary.
God bless you,
I was in the hospital
Visiting a relative
It is an honor to meet you.
So, Saqr, are you still hesitant to enter the field of commerce, or have you decided yet?
I'm fed up with him.
Why, son of Saqr, is trade good?
You have to start, open an office, and then see.
Abu Saqr,
Sir, please say yes.
Why?
I have a gift, Saqr.
Entire floor
And if trade wants you and is coming to you, it says no.
Who has everything available today like you? Since the day you got the license, everything has become easy for you: a free car and the best office on the Corniche.
Yesterday, Abu Abdulaziz was telling your father that if Saqr wants to get into the business, he will make him a partner with fifty percent.
Mom, how can I balance between business and university?
Mom, don't force me to do something I don't like.
And you are lucky because agencies, offices, and cars are thrown at you for free.
This is an opportunity, kid. Who can start a project at this time without capital?
Your only capital is the love people have for your father.
Be smart and invest it.
Believe me, boy! This is your chance in life.
Today, I prepared lunch quickly.
%Pw also reached the pickles and peppers.
He didn't leave anything, he didn't leave anything, he's afraid of taking the samosa agency.
Your son has a good appetite for work.
This is what I was excited to see, do you know what he told me today?
He told me, "Mom, I want to expand in investment."
He wants to enter the Caribbean Sea and invest in the islands there.
May God keep him far from envious eyes.
Abu Sultan was telling me yesterday, your son has just started in business.
He has twenty agencies, six restaurants, and is a partner in two banks.
* *
I believe, and God knows best, that they still haven't opened it.
Yeah, the one in the northern area of our office, what's up with it?
No, but I love him.
Thank you, God bless you, congratulations Abbas!
In the name of God.
God bless you all.
Now there is no need for regret.
What are you saying, man! A whole year of hard work and suffering just to get the supermarket ready.
What's the problem! I think he passes by the shop every day.
He saw her and sent me his secretary, named Samer.
He told me, "This is Saqr, the son of Abu Saqr, who wants to be your partner instead of taking the place from you."
Does he still want to be your partner?
There is no power nor strength except with God.
You started talking to him, right?
He asked me, "Who are you, my brother?"
I said business!
Why did you tell him that you have an Iranian bakery?
When we were walking beside this bakery, there was a small sign. What was written on this sign? What was the name written on the sign?
It was written "The Neighborhood Bakery."
No, I want another name.
And peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.
How's work going for you?
Welcome, Your Honor. God willing, we will finish the worker housing drawings for Al-Mustaqbal Company tomorrow or the day after.
No, no, Mr. Saqr, this is my wife Elissa. Let me introduce you to Mr. Saqr, the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?
Let her take one of the company cars.
Thank you very much, you are very kind.
Even cooking now relies on science and study.
Today, there is someone who says he wants to work in the business field, he has some money and wants to invest it.
But he does not have sufficient knowledge, nor understanding, nor study of economics, nor even commerce.
A person like this
Do you think he will succeed? I don't think so, he's wasting his time and losing.
Did you hear? Oh! Abu Nasser!
Did you hear what these parrots are saying?
What is this?
You have my son, Saqr.
See him.
See him today.
Your Honor, we are not talking about your son, Saqr.
We are talking about the base.
Your son is a hawk, God willing, and I don't want to envy him; he is an exception.
Thank you, he is talking about the base.
You scared me, my son Saqr is building himself up on his own.
He gave a car as a gift once.
He sold and invested the money on his own advice.
Wow, mashallah, look at him now.
Oh! Falcon, we are talking about ordinary people,
One of them was a falcon, and this is what Abu Nasser did with it; he took it and placed it on the road.
Saqr has business talents.
And strong economic preferences.
We need to ask whose father he is?
I swear I am surprised.
Masha'Allah
Al Khaleej Money Magazine in the Economic Referendum
Here you go.
And peace be upon you, hello hello Salim.
What's wrong?
I swear, I don't know what to say, oh wow.
Yes, I remember.
The story was true.
They say the company sent a fax to my father.
And they said to him
Poor thing, he couldn't bear it.
As you see.
They say when he heard the news,
He fell in the office, and the fax was in his hand.
And he has done him many favors.
As they say, I taught him archery, and when he became strong, he started shooting at me.
What did the doctor say?
Pray for him, Salem.
I am shocked.
I can't believe there are people like this in the world.
The man who gives to the poor without letting his left hand know what his right hand is doing.
The donations of this organization are distributed to all Muslims in Asia and Africa.
I just want you to explain to us your goals and your future steps, God willing.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, our goal at Saqr Charity Association is to achieve solidarity in this nation.
In addition to sixty blankets for our brothers affected by the Pakistan earthquake.
And last but not least, we now also support seven poor families.
With a monthly salary of one hundred and thirty-two riyals only.
We won't be late.
Then we come straight to you.
Who is this beloved?
This is Khaled and his wife, they invited us tonight at the hotel.
Anywhere, anywhere, you and I together, I am happy.
My love, (may God keep you for me) is an expression.
Ah! My darling.
This is not fair. This is my source of income.
This bakery
And you took money from him for the interest, not for yourself.
Fava beans for five riyals, hot bread for three riyals.
Two chickpeas.
%pw Five beans, okay, okay.
Cook six large fava beans!
Let's go, divers!
The captain is here and brought breakfast.
Men need.
Please, for your honor.
What's up?
No, no, what I'm asking you about is that I want to hear "yes" ringing in my ears.
Hello, Noura.
Anoud is upset with you.
Can I bear your anger?
So what's the problem?
Why are you upset?
Noura chose a simple and plain dress.
Don't say that Anoud will get upset.
Oh God, these Lebanese speak very well.
And you don't have to talk to him much.
Me too, I am jealous of her.
The sweetest dress for the most beautiful Nawara.
He flirts with her and calls her Nawara.
Let your blood boil, how long will it take?
I paid twenty thousand and twenty thousand riyals remain.
May my Lord compensate you, congratulations!
God be with you.
Hello, O Sharaf Umm Saleh.
Hello Fadi, you look busy, I don't want to keep you.
I am at your service
Hello, hello.
Did you receive the text message yesterday?
I received it, you idiot!
Did you like the joke?
Did you bring the design with you?
I didn't have time to make them, show me your designs and I'll choose from them.
Honestly, your taste is better.
They will leave us, envy is starting to work.
When he realized that my project was good and started generating income,
They say he is going to do a project like my project.
Design and Tailoring Boutique
For women's clothing.
This is Abu Nasser; he has nothing to do with trade.
There are banks.
He is going to harm his cousin.
These days, in this way.
Yes, yes, my cousin.
You know I was sleeping and suddenly they woke me up and told me that your cousin wants to see you.
Everything is fine! Ask me anything you want!
Everything is fine, everything is fine.
God willing.
You have no intention for any project, for example, like, like
Are you looking for a partner or something?
I heard you're a designer, so I thought I should definitely stop by.
You are very welcome.
If you need an increase, we have it.
Thank God, work is going well.
What should I do, Abu Saleh?
But we are late, they rented it last week.
Yes, they did.
Okay, God willing, goodbye.
He is he.
Are you sure?
And with haute couture, do you know the major disaster!
What is it?
He rented a shop next to your shop.
(Announcement) O spiteful one (Announcement) O resentful one!
Before you know that the market is open to everyone,
You need to know
Your heart opens to your cousin.
I'm not here to ask you,
You deny, lie, and mock me, and you said to me, I,
I wanted to do my work secretly.
You take it from the shop next to us, you want to disrupt my work.
They just didn't say come and be like a pain in the neck next to the wisdom molars, you're driving me crazy.
This is envy and hatred, and I swear to God I will slap you, this is hatred, leave me alone with him.
Come on, are you relatives or what? People?
Shame on you, Abu Saleh!
Leave him alone, I swear I'll hit you! Oh! You with your chirping voice, you.
By hitting me the way you hit me, you stole my heart.
Let's go, everyone!
Say peace be upon him, O people.
I swear, I swear, I didn't do anything.
He advised me to get a designer from the Philippines.
Don't let anyone lie to you.
Why, why specifically the Lebanese?
They chat with him, joke and laugh, and feel very comfortable.
That's why Abu Saleh brought a Lebanese.
He started saying nice words to me and trying to convince me.
He enchanted me, he enchanted me with his words.
He convinced me and made me pay twelve thousand riyals.
And after two days, I went to the auction market and found the same wardrobe, its twin, for nine hundred riyals.
I earned money,
Lebanese designer bag.
Can I meet the gentleman? Yesterday you told me it was difficult, and today it’s still difficult?
Yeah, today is still very hard.
I feel like Abu Saleh has changed these days.
What's wrong with him?
No, I don't know? What's the problem?
Abu Saleh is very psychologically exhausted after his cousin opened a shop and brought in a Lebanese designer who looks exactly like him.
For the past two weeks, the store's sales have been declining.
This is the problem here in Qatar: no Qatari opens a shop, unless another Qatari comes and does the same project and opens the same shop next to it. Can I compete with him?
No, no, no, no, he is with Fadi the designer now and they are thinking of a solution.
What are you doing now?
We are sitting as if we have eaten poison.
If we stay like this, I think we won't even be able to cover the rent for the place.
A place far from them.
This means that we will leave the field to them.
Okay, thank you. And how much is the discount?
Impossible, why don’t you give an evening dress for free with every wedding dress?
Impossible, let's go.
What's the problem? What happened? We're going to the shop next to you. Today, they have an offer: with every wedding dress, you get two evening dresses for free, plus a 25% discount.
Let's go, let's go.
And now I wait for two weeks, they will announce the same offer: buy a wedding dress and get two evening dresses for free with a 25% discount.
They are fighting us.
I think the same thing, if we leave them, they will destroy us.
Don't worry,
What did he do next?
It is definitely a challenge.
Of course, this is a challenge.
Bravo, he deserves this, he is not kind, he doesn't want anyone to earn their living.
If it happens, you will hear the news within two or three days, I will close his shop.
Excellent work.
Wait, wait, close, close, I'm coming to you now, goodbye.
What's the problem?
Saad says the place is unbearable and no one can stay there, and he says he doesn't know where this bad smell is coming from.
The smell has nothing to do with this air conditioner, impossible.
Its smell will not leave the place for at least six days.
One hundred percent sure.
Go at night.
He is cutting the electrical wires from the shop.
Is this fair?
So now should I expect a commitment, or will we start a case and open a file?
Don't do anything to him.
I stop this life of his.
Oh! Abu Nasser has become something strange, no one comes to our shop.
Abu Nasser, hang up, hang up, there's a customer coming, I'll talk to you later. This is strange.
He is moaning in his bed.
He says it's a psychological condition, and I was afraid to tell him that the bank called and asked for the installments.
He accumulated debts because of his despicable cousin.
What happened to him this time?
Poor things, if they accidentally enter and see Saad the designer, they scream at him and run away from him.
Sleeping! Poor guy, he never sleeps, his eyes are open and he's staring at the ceiling.
I don't know what he did to me.
Happy in the shop.
He put a spell on him, I don't know how he did it.
When women see him, they are afraid of him.
I don't know, how did he let it happen!
He made me lose, he made me lose.
I have many debts,
I'm afraid they will imprison me.
And I don't have any evidence against him, so I can file a lawsuit against him.
I don't know what he did, I don't know what he did.
Forget him, he deserves it.
Please, tell me what kind of magic you did to him, you made his designer turn into a monster and women get scared when they see him.
A rumor was spread
All set! Guys, tell him that the archery team urgently needs him.
Guys, may God bless you, may God protect you, tell him that they need you urgently, urgently.
I swear they are raising my blood pressure, killing me, paralyzing me. This is not fair, Mr. Abdullah.
No problem, dear Ahmed, don't be upset, you suffer from heart diseases, this is not suitable for you, man!
%PW I swear I called him several times, my head hurts, but he’s no good. These additions are driving me crazy, driving me crazy.
You don't do anything, I am responsible for everything!
Listen to me, %pw, I’m going to tell you a lot.
Episode twenty-five, scene sixteen, Ahmed Nabi, let's finish.
So, I will stop filming because the extra actor did not show up.
What a production!
What do I have to do with this! Mr. Abdullah, why is he yelling at me?
My love, if you don't want anyone to shout at you,
What happened, Abdullah?
The assistant is late and they are in trouble.
Oh! Ahmed, I don't need anyone, my dear.
Look for someone who has prestige and charisma, someone who can truly convince people that he can be a millionaire and billionaire, not just anyone.
Please, sir, come in and take a photo, and your order will be ready within half an hour.
Not just anyone! Oh! Alaa, not just anyone, I was just clarifying to him.
Okay, I can manage with two scenes instead of one,
You are responsible and you are the production manager, you are in charge.
What are they planning to do now?
They will do everything, look the manager is nervous and the situation is chaotic, but they will handle it.
He needs someone with special qualities. Where can I find him now?
Are you serious?
Did you hear what the manager said?
I know someone, may God help you with him, I hope he is suitable.
%PW Saudi Seaweed!
Saud Kanz! I remember him as Saud the Cow Whip.
Yeah, when he was little they used to call him Saud Shouk, and when he grew up they started calling him Kanz.
Why the boxes?
I'll tell you why. Poor guy, he used to walk the streets collecting cans and selling them by the kilo.
Oh! My rich and esteemed brother, not frustration.
His appearance is decent; what I remember is that he is chubby and a bit fat, neither tall nor skinny.
Are you sure it is suitable?
God willing, but you have to do good makeup for him, and I guarantee it will be suitable, and he is still charming.
Okay, what are you waiting for, call him!
I don't have his number.
I take Amir with me and go to him.
Where is Saud Kanes' house?
What is he saying?
Shut up, shut up.
Saudi boxes
We don't have anyone in our neighborhood named Saud Kans.
Yes, I’m sure he’s from this neighborhood, but I forgot which house.
This house belongs to a person named Saud, and he lives with his mother.
Yeah, that's right.
But this is not Saud Kanz.
This is Saud's laptop.
Exactly, it is, but it develops over time because the laptop is like boxes.
He is tall, fat, and a bit dark-skinned.
He canceled the boxes and started collecting the old laptops. Come on, come on, come on, oh! Man
He went to the vegetable market to buy it for me. Am I special? Where is the other one?
I don't know, my son.
This is what you always wear.
I have another one, where is the other jotra, where is it?
For the holiday.
This is what I'm looking for.
Vicks and Axe brand oil.
Iron it a little before you wear it, because it’s wrinkled.
But these days I feel like I'm worse.
Mom, may God guide you, since yesterday I've been insisting on taking you to the emergency room, but you refused.
Yes, mom, they said they are going to pay me.
Praise be to God, you are working now instead of being unemployed.
Okay, Mom, goodbye.
She argues with her, gets upset, and goes upstairs.
You are sitting and slowly, slowly moving, and the camera with you will move beside you.
Yes. Jafar! Yes.
Whose laptop?
Any Abboud, this is a very famous actor, Abdullah Al-Lamma.
This is for you, for me he is your son %pw, Abboud how are you?
How are you, servant?
Behave well, you need to behave a little better in front of people.
Yes, we are from the same neighborhood.
Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, stay calm, stay calm.
I love acting, and I hope they give me a role where I can slap you.
Not like you know, my brother.
Very sick, you know she didn't sleep last night! Oh man!
Asthma, my brother, may God heal you.
May God heal her.
Your life is just a cherry pie.
Oh! Sir, oh! Sir.
Does he have asthma medicine for my mother?
He is a director, not a doctor.
Look at yourself, listen to what he says, he doesn't have any point.
What is his mother's name?
Do you want to spray on you, what do you think?
Did you hear what she said about you?
She says that you are reckless; you need to be more composed.
Give me, give him, give him, give him, give him half a million so he can fix the tires of my broken car.
And he gave him three million to bring me dinner.
I was about to ask you why you speak like that.
Because I am awake based on the requests of some people.
Look at Mr. Ghafil, a local production, represented by high-level actors.
Now it's excellent, he is suitable for the role.
Alright, I will help you, I have no senses, I don't have any, right?
Did your family buy this?
Your whole life is sweetness and comfort.
Take the man to the makeup room, put makeup on him, and tell Salman to bring you the clothes and come to you.
Come on, come on, come on, this is sweet.
Okay, okay.
Listen, my brother, stay with us and keep the car until we finish filming, I'll call you to come get it.
No problem, but is there anyone who can give me a ride?
I'll lift you! Okay, I'll have our driver lift you. Alright, thank you, brother, thank you, thank you, wait.
Okay, call your friend, the extra person, call him.
Oh! People are calling Saud Laptop from the makeup room.
Let him clean my teeth later.
It is already written in front of me.
Okay, shall we review?
This means me!
I didn't expect this from you.
We will fight, for what!
We will fight for our rights.
Yeah, wait.
You should know who you are talking to, Abu Abdulaziz.
Why did you divorce her, brother?
He divorced her, and that's it.
And we do not marry the daughter of a thief.
No need, what do you think?
He cleans it, but later. The most important thing is to get ready because you're going to enter the dressing room to change your clothes, and we are ready for the photoshoot.
My teeth, the toothpaste is expensive.
Oh! Everyone, the filming of this scene has been postponed.
Why is it like this?
I don't need tea! Brother, I'm bored and my stomach is full of tea. What is this, I've been waiting for an hour, how long am I supposed to wait?
%PW I didn't see anything, this is very normal.
May God give you strength.
They are fast.
Thank you, Your Honor, may God protect you.
Give my regards to your ascetic.
Tell them Abu Abdulaziz sends his regards.
Yes, Your Honor %PW.
It was fun, wasn't it?
People like you greet you and then kiss your nose.
The first time someone kissed me on my nose.
How do they kiss them on their noses?
This is a problem.
My anger is like an ice cream stick, it hurts your lips. That was funny, that was funny.
I didn't laugh!
No thanks necessary.
Can I be an actor?
There is something wrong, what's with your voice?
My son, my son, I am very sick, I am waiting for you.
Come quickly.
May God greet you, Sheikh, may God greet you.
See it here or there by yourself, man.
Listen to me, hey!
Right, go now.
I see a lot of admiration.
What happened, my son?
Peace be upon you, what's wrong with you, Your Highness?
Vinegar, vinegar, vinegar, vinegar
And don't tire yourself, God willing, it will be, Dr. Hassan, come here, come here.
Yes, oh! Doctor Hani, what happened?
Let your honor rest in the office.
Don't worry.
She is the mother of everyone, God willing she will be well.
Welcome, welcome, Your Highness, welcome.
Be quiet or I'll slap you in the face.
Here my name is Abu Abdulaziz.
Call me, my lord!
How are you, sir?
God damn you
Yes, Your Honor.
Welcome! Please, sir, have a seat.
God bless you.
With such an ugly face (expression)
Go with him, Mr. Rashid.
I swear, if I do something to you, just tell me and you'll see what I'll do to it.
Oh! My friend, could I find a doctor quickly, please?
Doctor, my mother is sick!
Wait in line, your turn.
Listen to me, hey!
Can I ask you, my friend?
Oh! Boy, quickly, I am sick.
You go to the hospital a lot, you take your mother every week, I didn't find any of them, they are kind and accept anything.
Unlike the citizens.
Don't forget the female citizens.
Okay, look for a wife in the hospital.
I love her.
But, my brother! She is ignoring me.
Okay, try to be close to her, smile at her, look at her, give her your number, and have good intentions.
There is nothing wrong.
Behave politely.
Get out, get out, if you don't get out, I will call security so they can teach you a lesson.
No, no, I don't need anything.
Why, sir, you have to drink.
Ali, please.
No, no thank you.
You can take it and leave the hospital.
The one speaking with you is Faleh Al-Marzouq.
You will marry him means you will marry him.
No, no, I need the bisht, the clothes, and also the car, I will rent it from you.
So I can give you your money.
No, no, no, wait.
Let's go.
What is this %PW nonsense, Al Marzooq!
May God greet you, may God greet you, welcome and easy for you.
The light of my eyes got married yesterday.
I wish you had come.
They were shocked by what I did to them; it was a very elegant and private party.
One is regular and the other is diet.
Now you have no excuse.
What is this?
Mom promised my friends tomorrow at work
Are you going to take this to them!
Yeah, what's up?
Noura, come here!
What is this?
He’s going to take this to his friends, because of the scandals.
Don't even think about taking it, everyone will be talking about you.
Give me money, tomorrow I'll buy you something fancy.
Yeah, but I just promised them now.
And I have to take it tomorrow.
Don't worry, the stores are still open. Go and change your clothes so we can get something that will please everyone.
What's wrong with you! Let's go.
And it has a reasonable price and very good quality.
Above average, not the best!
Of course, there is high-end chocolate, but sorry, I thought you were looking for an affordable price.
This is very expensive, why are you looking for the most expensive?
This is unbelievable, look at this artistic touch.
This is called royal chocolate.
The same chocolate that they always order in the Spanish court.
Give me this.
Congratulations, and by the way, it comes with a warranty certificate.
Welcome, welcome, rejoice!
Come here, brother, give us some of this chocolate, brother.
What's the occasion for this, man?
No, Saleh Abdelkader, the one in accounting.
With God's blessing, he deserves this. Give me another one.
And bring the coffee quickly.
Aunt, did you go to their wedding?
Yes, my dear, I went to their wedding, it was awkward, disgusting. Can you believe it, my sister!
Did you hear what your aunts said?
That's why I want to throw you a wedding like no other.
There’s no time, you only have a month and a half.
I arrange everything,
But he doesn't let me do anything.
You don't live in the community; you don't see how people put everything they have into their weddings.
And you saw it yourself,
When you buy something nice, you see how they praise you and praise your taste.
Didn't they tell you it's awesome and amazing?
Right, but how much did we pay?
The money we spent on chocolate could buy four sheep for the wedding.
Please don't interfere, your mother knows how to do everything, just give her the money and that's it.
This means that they will accept anything we choose.
Yeah, your taste is really bad.
What do you think about this stage?
But excellence costs a lot of money.
Why, why, the one before was nice!
What do you think about this?
This is the first time in Qatar that someone thinks of making a theater like a computer mouse.
Sorry, one minute.
Look, talk about everything except the theater and the arrangements, this is the place where women who have nothing but gossip sit, but be quiet.
The man is waiting for us.
We will go to the mouse stage.
It is a very strange phase.
The latest model in the year two thousand and eleven.
We have already chosen the mouse.
You can sit aside; this is all for your own good.
So you have to choose: if it's Noah's Ark, you have to pay an extra twenty thousand, and if it's the mouse, you pay one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Decide, and we are ready.
You're not the first one to get married.
What do you think of yourself, would you marry in the Comoros? This is how things work in our country.
And we're still just at the beginning.
If you don't need a platform, where do you put the bride? In a box?
Iron, paint, and some wood
And the people are happy.
They exploit us and lie to us; in fact, they are scammers.
What's wrong with you now?
Are you upset and annoyed?
If you don't want to get married, that's fine.
I will call the bride's mother and tell her that Saleh's situation is very difficult.
He doesn't want to get married? He can't afford the wedding expenses? No problem, I don't mind. You want me to call her? I'm serious, I'll call her.
We received a shipment of flowers from the Netherlands.
In my opinion, if you put them on the tables at the wedding,
Are you sure it's the first time in Doha?
And also the Middle East!
Put it on the bill.
How much will it increase?
One hundred and seventy-two, okay then,
Just Samir, I don’t want to see this group at any wedding.
You know people's gossip.
Okay, they are booked.
Your salary is more than mine.
You are going to start a problem we cannot handle.
May God help you, Saleh.
But may God guide you, you should have tried to resolve things.
As for me, thank God, I have decided to look for a wife in any Arab country.
They say the wedding will cost you two thousand dollars and you'll have a great time.
God bless you, my dear.
God willing, his wedding will be next month.
You need to tell me how many cards you want and let me know.
If the invitations are sufficient, that's good. The most important thing is that people know they are invited, where and when, and that's all.
Just care about him, don’t care about what people say.
People know the level of the wedding from the invitations.
Tomorrow, when they see these invitations, I know what the girls will say.
Look at their wedding, if these are their invitations, they haven't seen the invitations of so-and-so.
We didn't say that, we order it online.
He has a cover made of fabric, made from panda leather, and it has a silver shine.
No one can blame you, you can't stop me.
I won't be an attractive topic for the girls, we're asking for prayers, I mean we're asking for prayers!
I feel sorry for him, man!
Poor thing, of course his family pressured him a lot.
Man! He is scamming money from everyone.
What do you say, he even sold his car.
He looks like he's twenty years older; this morning I saw him talking to himself.
Don't blame him, my brother, poor guy, I don't know when we will develop.
Close the door, please.
Sorry, my brother.
Have you tried to convince them to have a wedding according to your budget?
What do you mean by "depending on my budget"?
Why am I living alone?
The problem that our society suffers from is the disease of appearances, boasting, and showing off.
It forces you to be sick with the same illness,
If you want to live in it.
Once, I gave a hint to the bride's mother.
I was attacked by her words (figurative expressions).
Put your trust in God.
By the way, tell me,
How did you get married?
I don't want to get married, I'm not crazy.
And even if I decide, my brother, to get married,
I'm thinking of marrying a foreigner or even an Arab.
And he says, your country!
We decided to bring a DJ for the songs,
Just because Nasser's mother brought a famous singer to her son's wedding.
He is a very famous singer, but I forgot his name.
Why are you so upset?
It seems like you don't like what I'm doing!
It's enough that he sold his car and every day one of his friends gives him a ride.
A little while ago, I entered the room and found him talking to himself.
I understand, now you have changed your mind.
Because my brother Saleh is sick, Mom just stopped him.
What matters to me is neither in you nor about you.
I am no less than others.
Don't make us a laughingstock.
Come on, Mom, enough. My brother spent everything he had and took money from everyone.
Please, be quiet.
My mom has new requests for the wedding, and my brother said he doesn't have money, so she yelled at him and said, "Is he going to cancel the wedding? I don't want to get married."
Where is she now?
She is unconscious, and they are giving her first aid.
He said she is much better now and they will find her a room in the hospital.
What a scandal!
Rest, my sister.
The doctor told you to stay calm and gave you an injection that will make you sleep.
How can I relax when he wants to play a prank on us for better or worse?
I used to tell him to bring Abdullah Al Ruwaished, and he told me he had no money.
I pity your mother.
He was afraid for her.
Go to her, go to her and kiss her on the head.
And tell her that I will do whatever she wants,
I will bring you Abdullah Al Ruwaished.
Abu Yusuf is kind, I don't think he won't help me.
Not right, I didn't find anyone except Abu Yusuf.
What's up!
Are you crazy, Saleh?
But the minister kept him because he is an important man and, more than that, he is disciplined and honest.
Want my opinion? If you say to him the same thing you said to me, there's a good chance his heart will stop.
Yes, I did.
This is because of the damn crisis he is going through, and he wants to ask Abu Yusuf for some money, of course from the ministry's funds.
Only God knows when he will return it to him.
And when the people who came to review asked him about the money,
Of course, there could be a problem.
No one will know, and he will know how to deal with the matter.
The matter is up to you, the man is in his office and you must be responsible if anything happens to him.
I am stealing in my last days!
My uncle doesn't call it theft,
On the first floor.
There is, there is a white box wrapped with a blue ribbon and it has a circle with a picture of a dove's wing, get it, get it.
Okay, Uncle Uncle Abu Yusuf, me me, if I have no difficulties,
I will pay it all off.
They call me Abu Yusuf,
And I came in my last days
And you corrupted me, Khamis.
Righteous, righteous.
Hassan, listen to what I'm saying, if it was someone else, they would have been hit or something bad would have happened to them. Oh! Oh! Oh! Khaled.
Righteous, righteous.
All the methods I tried didn't work, Uncle Abu Yusuf, I'm drowning.
I can't back out of the marriage.
And you know them, they are all bald.
What's wrong with you?
No, no, the second one, the pill that scares, the pill that scares.
In the drawer, in the drawer.
Uncle Abu Yusuf, the stairs are full of tablets, which one do you need?
The box with the picture of a scared man on it.
We booked two rooms for hair and makeup just for us.
And we will be there from tomorrow.
Jabna Abdullah Al Ruwaished and his band.
You see, my dear,
No, I’m not going to tell you.
Will the willpower be the hit of the season?
We are the first people in the world to use it.
Wax wax,
Goodbye.
There is no god but Allah.
My son, don't forget to recite the Mu'awwidhat when you enter the banquet hall.
The women here have the evil eye.
I told you before that he is awesome.
The best groom ever, may God protect you, I don't want to be jealous of you.
Mama, mama, the police are knocking on the door.
I was wrong to obey you, O God.
Not fair, today is my wedding.
The people who came for the experiment,
And now I solved it, I’m going to be imprisoned, oh God.
Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf!
It's still early.
But this isn't fair if this happens!
The company offered a contract worth three million, with only two million for materials.
He wrote a memorandum for the minister.
We know there is corruption, but corruption doesn't reach this level.
It seems like you're not living in this world.
Tell me, what did the minister say to Othman?
And why didn't our manager object? They say he was with him!
I don't know about him, honestly, I don't know.
Where is the morality?
Right became wrong, and wrong became right!
Oh! Saad, are you sure the minister fired him? Oh! People, what is happening in the world?
I just kicked him out!
What else?
It is owned by the minister's sister.
This girl is having an affair with the minister.
Oh, what a strange world (expression)
What's wrong with you guys, didn't you know who she was?
This is the new employee that the minister hired instead of Othman, who was unlucky.
Come on, come on, come on.
What do you want me to do, Saleh? Should I protest against the minister!
Are you crazy!
Listen to me, man,
We have kids, we want to live.
We want to live.
What happened?
Here he is, standing next to the elevator.
This is the reward for sincerity and honesty, my brother Saleh.
I hope we can do anything for you, my brother!
Praise be to God, praise be to God for everything.
What's wrong with you, Saleh?
These are some of the strange things we see in front of us in this world.
We see unbelievable things.
I am at your service.
I want to stop by the supermarket after work to get some vegetables for the salad.
I'm trying, okay, goodbye.
Who will take my sister home?
It is a rule to laugh and talk in front, who is it?
This is my classmate at the university, and what's the problem if he takes me home? No problem.
Oh God, I can't believe it, why do you look old-fashioned!
What are you saying?
Don't you hear what I'm saying?
You are old-fashioned.
This is old and new about right and wrong!
Right is right and wrong is wrong.
Life has evolved, and we are living in the age of technology.
The era of international changes that unite the world and no one can keep up with.
The more you live, the more you see!
Don't blame me, Munira, it's against my nature to be nervous and angry.
This is something he sees in his day.
Tell her he is sorry.
Life does not always go the right way.
Don't be upset, come and have lunch.
Let me sleep so I can rest,
The president is not upset with you,
Is the president not upset?
No, he’s not upset, go wash your face and all the lunch.
Present, my dear.
I am very excited to meet you on my first day at work.
We are honored, Your Honor.
Of course, of course.
Of course, I know you don't need anyone to remind you of the principles of work.
However, at the same time, this is very important.
To retrieve some values and principles that work
For the public interest.
This is supposed to be your honor.
We all must
The division is very important, Your Honor.
They are thieves.
Thank you, thank you all.
And what I want to say next
And to warn you about my first day at work,
There is one employee among you.
Who is honest, sincere, and dedicated, and who is like these bad things,
Just doubt
He is a loyal employee.
So that we can take the necessary legal actions against him in our ministry.
No, things will be just the way you like, Your Highness.
Praise be to God, we are all thieves.
As you wish, Your Highness, I will say it in front of and behind my colleagues.
Where is Khalid?
Yes, Your Honor.
Khaled, you were very, very praised, may God bless you.
Yes, Your Honor.
Ah! Your Highness, you know how to choose.
May God guide you, God willing.
Why did you let the devil control you?
You should thank God it was only about honesty.
Mom, why is Dad in prison?
Be quiet, girl.
No, no, I will never do it again.
Mom, why is my dad in prison?
Stop it.
This means he has become honest.
It is unfortunate to say that your father is honest.
Is this the confusion!
Your whole body is covered.
What do people see?
God willing, you are looking for a job, no one will hire you in this condition.
Is there a respectable girl who covers her body and her beauty?
She is covering her chest, dressed up to here, and she is choking herself.
I'm tired of her, boy.
I bought her a top and pants that show half of her stomach above the navel.
It's just a hopeless case; she doesn't want to follow the right path.
Here I am sitting, telling you!
You will only blame yourself.
To ask for the hand of your daughter Sarah for our son Rashid.
These days, one of us is just looking for the right man for his daughter.
Let me tell you, Rashid, my son.
He is a very kind man.
He never stops drinking.
He has been drunk for twenty-four hours.
Drunk, intoxicated, and sluggish all day long.
And do not ask about the noise.
He is well brought up.
And let me also tell you that he is a hypocrite.
And how is the theft?
This is what I expect from you, and how about the medications?
Clear, it's done. I'll give you five riyals if you can find the pupil of his eyes, I'll hold a contest for it.
By the way, Abu Sara, we’re just here to ask for her hand.
You know how to chat and hang out with the guys.
We know she comes from a good family.
With blessing, boy, with blessing, this is life, with blessing
I am drunk.
I can't walk.
Okay, come,
Okay, goodbye.
Okay, call your father to come pick you up.
Why do I have to call him?
So that he can come and deliver it to you.
Where is he?
Look, he is there, standing with Qatra and he has a blonde girl with him.
Honestly, your dad is walking straight ahead, he is enjoying himself.
Hello my dear daughter Mona!
Majid! His name was Abdulaziz.
Yeah, that's right.
You confused me, girl.
And you know since the establishment of the State of Palestine with its capital Jenin in the year two thousand and ninety, after signing comprehensive peace with the State of Israel,
And Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure, and siege against him.
The latest accusations against the Palestinians were made by the Israelis and their Arab allies.
They smuggle plastic knives through the tunnels.
Especially the second article, paragraph A, which says that the Palestinian people must trim their nails every day.
Let's move on now to the crucial meeting.
Mr. Cheap,
When Israel agrees to establish the State of Palestine,
Hey man, what are you saying, man? You're ruining our reputation, leave me alone!
Please!
Excuse me, Mr. Al-Nimr, excuse me, Mr. President.
Can you give me a chance to speak?
We have fully complied with the comprehensive international agreement.
What does the Israeli representative say?
To find something solid, stone or plastic as a commitment
Oh man, even our homes
What do you call it, people of the Gulf?
In Palestine, they are all made of wood.
According to the agreement, American companies manufacture wooden cars for us.
All the doors of our houses are made of thermally treated wood.
We do not need letters.
Don't change the subject.
Mr. President,
This is a very important point, and I would like to voice my opinion about it because growing nails is considered a breach of the agreement.
If you agree, raise your hand.
I just had a very strange dream.
So that you can control the students.
I'm tired of telling him.
This is the fourth school that you will start working on tomorrow.
Because I established my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The kids follow him and tear his clothes, and he does nothing.
How many times did he come to me without Jotra?
The school principal told me.
Rashid is kind, and we don't want to explain it.
The children throw chalk at him.
And they pull his guitar in the lounge in front of everyone.
They said this teacher is very hesitant and will ruin everything.
Should I tell them the story of ketchup?
Come on, Maryam.
What's the story with the ketchup? This is new, no one told me!
They poured a whole bottle of ketchup on the chair.
Sit down.
He didn't know anything.
Only when he saw the children laughing at him in the schoolyard.
Stop it.
By the way, the school principal you will start working with tomorrow called me.
However, no problem, we will give him a chance.
Because I am waiting to tell you
The era of kindness and weakness is over.
Ah! Oh my cousin, ah! Abdullah
You will see a different Rashid.
And there is no need to remind you of the important educational quote,
You are an education graduate, and I am an education graduate.
And we all know the quote,
The teacher is the son of the first grade.
You will see Mr. Rashid Al-Qawi.
And if someone makes a mistake,
There will be a problem.
When you start talking, he said just be quiet.
You see what I'm telling him.
Who among you laughed at me and said just be quiet? Who?
You’re the one who told me just to be quiet!
No, not me.
So the person next to you, you!
Stop, and go to the manager,
Tell him that Mr. Rashid kicked me out.
I don't want to see your face here, do you hear me!
What do you think of my Twitter?
You don't have to be just like your first day, you have to be like that all year long.
Be aware of the consequences.
If you hear someone's voice
While I am explaining or speaking.
You know what it means
It means nervous, do you know what nervous means?
It means nervous.
Did you hear what I said or not?
I heard it too.
Get out of the classroom.
Go to the manager.
Take your things and get out now!
Take your things.
What matters to me.
It is clear that he is still looking for him.
No, sir, we haven't seen it.
By the way, milk ice cream with strawberries inside is really delicious.
Dear Abdulrahman.
Everyone makes mistakes, and humans
I'm joking with you, kid.
But the most important thing is that your father doesn't know the story!
What I want is the chocolate that's in my bag.
Okay, and =Where is your bag? =Where is your bag? Where is your bag?
In class.
I am at your service.
You say he is happy with you.
You can't tell the difference between the rich boy and the ordinary boy.
Bad luck, how does bad luck appear? Green or red?
Come here, where are you going?
In the bathroom.
Are you still in the bathroom?
Knock on the door quickly and tell him that the first class started half an hour ago, quickly.
I was before them all, one juice and one potato.
I took it before all of them, I annoyed them. My friend Abdulrahman, and by the way, this is very healthy.
Okay, now go to Saud and get the PlayStation CD from him.
So, what do we learn from this story?
That man
He must have good manners.
This is for the PlayStation, he told me to bring the whole PlayStation all at once.
Okay, do you want anything else, my friend Abdulrahman, my buddy?
There is nothing right now.
We learn from the story
You all know that I will be leaving this week because I have been accepted into graduate studies.
I thought I should submit the event file before I travel.
How can I pick you up in the afternoon? Abdulrahman told me, but I don't know where he wants to go, and he didn't tell me at what time!
As long as his father came back and didn't say anything to him, thank God, I felt secure and relieved.
Let's say I didn't take it this afternoon, and he got upset and said to his father, no, no, no, this is a disaster, no, no.
Hello my friend Abdulrahman.
May God help you.
What can you do, this is a command.
Do you love him, love him this way?
Today, children, we will have a new lesson in science.
And peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.
Thank you.
I need water.
I didn't ask, I didn't ask anything, I am at your service.
Teacher, teacher. How can you ask the teacher for water?
Is there a teacher who brings water to a student? Are you his tea server? This incident will not just pass like that, I will write it in the report.
And you, you mock, you mock me.
Don't raise your voice or shout at me, can you hear me or not?
Is this enough for you?
Okay, how many cars is this for?
Four to five cars.
Excellent, this is excellent, beautiful, excellent.
What is he doing?
As you can see, he will stand in front of our houses at the expense of our comfort.
Don't tell me "in the days of Abu Nasser,"
Abu Nasser is finished.
He is studying abroad.
Zain, you broke the table.
Don't be nervous, my brother!
Why is it like this?
Are you different? (expression)
Change your behavior with me.
Me or you?
We didn't say anything! Oh brother!
What is this?
Listen, leave everything as it is, it's better for you.
I'm not threatening you! Brother?
What do you mean when you say there's no need while I want to make things easier for you?
What are you saying?
Badge, what do they call it?
It seems like you want the.
You want this, as you wish.
Faster, faster.
Is this good?
Not the way he likes, this is not fair!
He is not the owner of the neighborhood.
We are coming to Uncle Abu Nayef to discuss, not to shout.
Who is this Rashid to do whatever he wants in the neighborhood?
Did you give me the chance to speak?
Okay! Everyone, be quiet and listen to what Uncle Abu Nayef has to say?
Now, this worthless loser is playing with your nerves!
Leave it to me.
If I hadn't slapped him in the face, he wouldn't have stuck to what he did.
The game is played by its players (figurative expression).
Is this okay?
%Goodbye.
I haven't seen anything yet.
He owns a jewelry store now!
That's why I see here wearing all these rings and necklaces.
May God compensate us.
Just walk, do you intend to stay in the heat?
I can't believe that Rashid, who was simple and poor, has become like this.
He became the Vice President of the Global Educational Center.
Let him tell you, let him teach you. You are a teacher and he is a teacher, but look where he is now and where you are now.
No thanks necessary,
Don't thank me, Abdullah.
I'll tell you the secret.
The teacher has come, the teacher has come.
Professor, I didn't do anything!
Teacher, do you know who he is?
Yes, my love, I know who he is.
Here I am telling you, we won't get a good opportunity like this.
I am looking for a job! This is funny, really, this is funny.
No, my brother, the work is in my pocket.
Thank you for everything you have done, thank you, thank you.
Give him my regards.
Your mother sends you her regards. May God protect you, I will tell her, he sends his regards.
Alright, goodbye dear, may God protect you.
What more do you want? Your brother is going to be a minister, but believe me, boy!
Oh! Mom, we are working, we are working at a high level.
But my son, if you work with him, won't they say anything?
He just gives it to you like that.
This is fine, right?
Okay! This is automatic, without any doubt.
So, my love, please let my dream come true.
Before your dream, my dream
It is the construction of a tower between the Corniche towers.
Come on, what are you waiting for!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You can do it, Abu Saleh!
It seems like your friend is upset.
It doesn't seem like that, oh! My brother.
You can do it, Abu Saleh!
Believe it or not, he stood up, took the mobile phone, and gave it to Abu Saleh.
Look, there’s something behind this, and there’s a million percent chance that Abu Sultan holds a grudge against him.
His relationship with Abu Saleh was not good.
No, Abu Sultan won't do this unless he intends to do something else.
Seriously, that much?
He opens the car door for him!
And finally, he works on opening the minister's car doors.
Oh! My son, do not break my heart, do not break my heart.
For your information, all the stories we hear in cafes happen in the country.
I just can't believe what I'm hearing!
My heart stopped, my heart stopped.
I'm afraid, my daughter, that the women are starting to talk about the matter, and don't mention Latouf, the dish collector; she spreads rumors about me among the women, my daughter.
Say something, Abu Sultan, speak. I'm shocked, I'm going to faint.
Please, I know what I am doing.
What concerns you.
Munira, I am working at a slow pace.
By opening the door for him, this is the beginning of the plan in my mind.
I deserve to become a minister, not him.
Let me work, I have a plane.
So that they make him fire him,
Yes, a plan.
He must trust me from the beginning.
They told me that we appointed him minister because he was appointed two months before me.
Because I am very sure that he will be fired from his job.
Magic can be nullified,
What is it?
What is this now?
And at every event he attends, the photographer takes many pictures of him until his photo becomes widely spread in the newspaper.
And its smell rises until it floats to the surface.
Are you sure?
Just wait. Let me work against him and you'll see.
On the contrary, Your Honor,
Of course, Your Highness.
So tell me,
Did you thank him for the sheep? By the way, the meat tasted really delicious.
The man is outside, go see him.
Don't be stupid, people want to raise your value and you want to insult yourself.
Only the minister, please, please.
No, no, no, no, don't imagine me saying no. Just Your Excellency the Minister, a picture, a picture with Your Excellency.
Take one more after.
Oh! Brother, I swear I liked your plan.
I want you to take it to him.
Picture, picture, picture.
Yes, he is a minister, he also has one.
Okay, I'm telling you, wait!
Go to the penultimate page.
Look how big his picture is with the groom.
Say, "There is no god but Allah!"
Yes, every day he has one or two pictures.
As you say, he is a social activist. Okay, okay, goodbye.
Everyone loves you, but I don't know what's wrong with you.
He is everywhere (expression)
They envy you, they are jealous of you. But the tree that bears fruit is the one that gets stoned (proverb).
Take me to the market!
Are you ready?
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, hello.
You are very famous.
Yeah, your name is Abdulaziz Abdullah, right?
This is my husband.
How many times have I told you?
Three hundred and fifty.
For this famous person,
Are you home today, is something wrong?
Leave me alone, my head hurts today, my head is aching, I feel pain all over my body and my colon is getting worse.
I am tired, really tired. It's been a month and he's still with him.
Let me rest today.
Hello, Umm Sultan.
Can I say something?
Oh! Woman, I just want him to take me.
I started to love him.
You saw for yourself what fame does!
I know. Thank God you are convinced.
Honestly,
Your minister is worried, and it seems he likes this story.
I sent it to you, my brother Saad.
No, I didn't follow any activity and I didn't read the newspaper, I don't know.
We are at your service, goodbye.
If God intends to destroy an ant, He gives it wings.
Hello, sir, do you have a conference here at the hotel tonight?
Wedding?
Don't mention it, do you have any events like a party, birthday, or wedding?
I don't know, but you can see the hotel behind us.
Ah, there's a hotel behind you, right?
Can I leave you in the car and go into the hotel to ask?
Come on, come on, come on, and take your time. Go ahead, ask, go ahead.
May God help everyone.
Does this minister let us sleep or rest?
This means he didn't find a party, wedding, or any problem to throw him into.
He took him to a hotel for sixteen thousand and found nothing for him. His luck is as miserable as his face.
Just be quiet, now.
I didn't find a birthday for him, nor.
Come on, you might catch the second half!
In every issue, it has one hundred pictures.
He doesn't sleep! He doesn't get tired! Oh my brother.
Man, the newspaper editor says the first thing is to prepare his photo, then I'll prepare the newspaper.
She said that my children participated in a contest about a picture of your husband, the minister.
One asks the other, how many pictures of the minister are in the newspaper?
And the winner takes the prize.
The story isn't like that, you have to come to the café and hear the comments every day about his picture in the newspaper. I mean, the whole thing is nonstop gossip.
Wow, his death is very close.
As they say, if death is destined for the butterfly, it approaches the light.
People leave you and then greet you.
He became one of the most famous people in the country.
Don't thank me, and who is he?
She ruined my reputation.
May God bless you and bless her.
She said that we all got married except poor Amal; she is the only one among us who hasn't married.
This is my destiny.
I'm not destined to get married.
And I forget about the topic of marriage.
God alone is sufficient for whoever is behind that.
Do you see those spoiled kids sitting over there?
Yeah, what's wrong with them?
Do you see the one playing with his hair?
Is this a boy or a girl?
After my father died, I mean I killed him.
You saw it, it grew, right?
No, let's not make it dependent on the maid.
Go make some tea.
I'm tired of talking to my mom. But she doesn't have just one maid, she has two maids.
I told you a hundred times not to interfere, Khaloud is my son, not yours.
You only have the problem of Kholoud and the maids, the maids and Kholoud.
Mom, this is not good, Kholoud is with the maid 24 hours a day and doesn't want anyone else.
Get out. I want to rest, I want to sleep. How?
Oh God, Saud, your brother Khalood has become a girl.
Wait a moment, or else I won't tell my dad about you.
Let me tell you something, what's the problem with Kholoud?
Saud says that Khulood wears makeup and acts like the girls. What's the problem? What's the problem?
Oh Protector, oh Protector, oh Protector! Oh Saud.
Kholoud put makeup on his face! Just a little bit of makeup. A child saw the makeup palette and played with it.
I saw a very small dot, and it’s not even clear.
He is kind, gentle, and compassionate.
I feel upset about Saud.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
Last time I asked you, Saad, what do you want to become when you grow up, and you didn’t tell me. Now tell me, what do you want to become when you grow up?
And you, my dear Khuloud, my dear Saad is going to become an office worker, and what do you want to become?
This year we are going to London like last year.
Yes, call the vibrator in Bahrain.
The summit brings Susan, Khalooda, and Fahooda.
And say hello to Samoura.
I seek forgiveness from Allah.
Today my father told me to choose.
Do you want to build on the land that overlooks the sea or the nearby land?
I said I don't want to choose,
I can live with you, my love, anywhere.
Thank you, my love.
And fishing taught me?
Wow oh! Amal, I want to open my eyes and be told that you graduated from university.
It seems like it's not a men's perfume.
I don't know, but its smell is really strange.
Oh my God, what's wrong with me?
Your way of speaking has become feminine.
I forgot that you are a man.
And God willing, do you speak to people this way outside?
How unbelievable! Oh! Khalid.
Please, get out of my room!
What a pity, Khalood!
You disappointed me.
Come on, don’t make me upset, I swear I’ll tell my mom.
This is my son, and I know him well.
Oh poor thing! Khaled is the light of my eyes, I wish all children had his tenderness and emotions.
And when you see someone kind and calm, you say that he is like me.
Shame on you, shame on you for saying such things about your brother.
Stop, you made a big fuss over nothing.
Poor thing, he just sprays a really nice perfume. Now, what's the difference between men's perfume and women's perfume?
Here I am telling you, don't say this in front of your father.
I have it.
I'll bore him, but stay calm so Muhammad doesn't feel anything.
How do these girls get together?
It's bad that a beautiful girl would do something like this!
Do not look at it, do not look at it!
I'm afraid he felt there was something concerning him.
Take it easy.
I know you're following the Bluetooth trend that's popular these days.
I am waiting for Saad, let him come.
How are you, Saad?
May God protect you.
We were waiting for you, we didn't play cards.
Yeah, why?
Do you want to drink something?
I see you've been sleeping here in your apartment for two days!
Because of the Bluetooth story.
Yes, his older brother threatened him.
He is afraid of him.
Don't try, I told you don't try.
I seek refuge from the devil, my son! For my sake!
Already booked
I'm going away. How can I face people? I can't!
What should I say to your father?
Tell him anything.
Oh, these kids only bring trouble, oh.
This is the end, Mom.
I remember when Khulood was little,
Of course, this will be the result.
Stop, please get out.
The right thing always hurts.
The jar broke.
It's impossible for me to live in Doha.
I can't face people.
My phone was off for a while.
And you blame me, Amal?
You are a girl and you spend your whole day at home.
What can I say, I’m a man who meets people outside all day long.
It's difficult, Amal.
I can't live while I spend my day, my life, and my mind always looking down.
The father feels for a while that something is wrong in the house and that there is a change.
How long will my father be absent from the events that happen here at home?
Sometimes I blame Dad, and sometimes I don't.
I don't blame him, Amal! When I remember his dedication and sincerity in his work, so that we can live with dignity among people.
And I blame him.
When he leaves the house, the responsibility for the children is on the mother.
We don't want to dig up the past now.
Does my father know about the matter or not?
But I am ready
Turn on Bluetooth for him
I just won't give it to him.
I don't want to see my father's shock in his eyes.
I will be very broken.
Woe to you, Amal,
He knows how to throw at us.
Much better than knowledge from someone else.
What a shame that our house has come to this point.
Because a dirty bomb called Khulood exploded in it.
Customs and traditions.
You find them rude.
They plug their ears against it.
And they do not want to hear it,
They hear only one voice.
Which is dirtiness and alienation.
And they trample on all that is good.
What comes to your mind?
You suddenly decided to study abroad.
All I can say is, may God help you, my son.
May God help you.
The people who are returning are the ones who bring the gift, not the people who are going to travel.
You are right.
This is a rule.
But every rule has
Hope, come with me quickly.
Did he see her, girl?
I can't hear anything.
Abu Saad!
Abu Saad
Abu Saad, what's wrong with you?
Dad, what's wrong, Dad?
Dad!
Don't be upset,
You are a great person.
And any man who wants to marry you.
I didn't divorce you because there was something wrong with you.
I divorced you,
Because it is impossible
I accept to be the uncle of my children.
Like me, like your brother.
F. Salouh,
You are here every day.
Before you ever come,
I was hidden underground.
This was before when we were underground.
These are very strong words, can you handle these words?
You get one thousand two hundred, you earn a lot of money!
Say "Masha'Allah."
Come on, come on.
You just came seven months ago, so keep quiet and give me a ride home.
What an embarrassment and what a scandal! Every time he takes me to someone's house, he asks their driver, "How much do they pay you?" Nothing satisfies him, and today he asked to raise his salary.
This driver is laughing at you.
I am less than seven months old.
He upset me, my son, he upset me.
Send him back, so we can get rid of him.
Hurry up and bring another pocket!
Tell your son, he doesn't know what’s behind this word! He doesn’t know how much time and money it costs,
And driving training. Return it and let's get rid of it!
The first time I came here to my house was six months ago,
Okay, then I'll tell you something new,
Gasoline now costs one hundred and fourteen dollars, before a kilo was worth half a riyal, maybe five riyals, everything has become expensive, boss.
Open your mind and listen to what I'm saying!
When I first came here, what was the salary you gave me?
You gave me seven hundred.
You are still new, new. You came six months ago and this salary of eight hundred is a lot.
I need money.
The drivers you’re talking about are ahead, ahead, and you’re new.
This seven hundred has now become eight hundred.
Let's go!
He said, "I'll give you an extra one hundred riyals only."
And there is no benefit in three hundred.
What I told you is the right thing?
No, no screen. It will cause me problems if I run away.
No, I'm scared, screen.
Those who flee from their shepherds.
Why are you afraid?
Because before the shepherds of these people
They give them a salary from six hundred to seven hundred. Do you know how much they take?
How much is your salary?
So why are you afraid?
I'm not afraid,
God is sufficient.
I woke up, took a picture, and told him to go see it.
There was no one.
He even stole the phone that I bought for him.
What did you do?
What did you do!
They did everything they could, took his passport, and kept it with them.
You may go! Sir, you are excused.
We search for him everywhere.
This is the problem, this is the problem.
And after all this, they run away.
They put us in trouble and harm us.
I told you to send it back.
You think I would leave him?
I find him no matter what.
He comes back, I mean, he comes back.
For me, I prefer to pay for his ticket and send him back home rather than let him stay here and make money.
I have reached this point; I hope to find him.
The man is coming in now, no one is going to buy now.
At the beginning of the match, it was clear to me that you were nervous because I noticed.
But what are we afraid of? We were afraid that our team wouldn't score goals.
We need more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were scared, you were terrified of the opposing team.
I'm not afraid of the opposing team, I'm afraid of our team. I'm afraid they won't score more than three.
This is the level of our team, I know it. I am talking about the level of our team.
This is a great trust from you.
The opposing team has nothing.
Great! The foxes have just scored a goal, you are leading with the first goal.
Where are you going?
I am going home.
Do you have a car?
Come with me, I'll give you a ride.
Thank you, man.
Why try, you can't beat our team!
Your Honor, the match has just started and the league has just begun.
Did you hear what he said?
He said, this has many problems.
Mahmoud, bring the tea!
My friend is coming to pick me up for the stadium now, quickly.
Take it, my friend Sajid!
Take it, Pasha!
What did he do to himself?
Yes, he is the Indian man.
Yeah, man, he's crazy about football.
Don't say such things about my team, the Foxes.
They will win, they will win.
Come on! Sajid, come on! Sajid, faster, faster, the match is starting, faster. Take some water with you, the foxes are playing today.
Dear viewers, with us today is one of the most famous fans of the Foxes club named Tha'loob.
They say you defeated them because they were lacking.
What they say, what they say is not true.
What's missing? Each team has twelve players.
If there was one or two people not there, it wouldn't change anything.
This fox is very smart.
This is the best fan we have.
Okay, on the occasion of Oh! Thaloub's victory, any last words you want to say to the foxes?
All words stop,
When they say the name of the foxes.
His name is high in the sky.
This is the decorative fan.
Listen to me, my brother,
You can find him this excited.
Let's go, oh! Wasim.
Where is the Indian man who loves football?
When did I see him last?
Man! He's a big star now, he doesn't come here.
I saw the man a few days ago and didn’t recognize him. He was sitting in a coffee shop in Villagio called Starbucks or something like Starbucks.
I remember this boy; he came and sat with us in the café and didn’t have money for a cup of tea.
He gave the boy a tip of twenty riyals in front of me.
What made him become like this?
Oh! [The man], sitting with the senior executives at the club, they help him and do everything he wants.
Can I say something, Thaloub?
Yes, man.
My uncle says: Whether you go or come,
I don't know why you support a weak and bad club like this one.
This team, the Foxes, is my heart.
When you open my heart
You can catch a lot of foxes there.
I haven't heard the poem, Your Highness, that he wrote about the rule.
Since we have a match with them.
Please, please, hey! Tha'loob, read, read this poem, read, read.
My uncle. Oh God, who knows my secret.
My soul hurts a lot.
I never sleep at night,
You know that we are the Foxes Supporters Club
You can't tell me the winner's name, so I have exclusive news.
We will hold a press conference, and God willing, we will announce the name of the winner.
Whoever spends.
The famous Thaloud, this fan who was honored today by the Foxes Club management with a kind, rare, and very surprising gesture.
Seriously!
Congratulations Tha'loub on this beautiful honor and, of course, this wonderful gift.
What do you think, is this a pen or a watch?
Here it is, Dad, really.
This is a move.
I am telling you that it is him.
We need to report to the police.
Don't go wherever it is!
All the fans, all of them, all the fans.
No, no, no, oh! Boy, this is not him, this just looks like him.
I am telling you this is not it.
I was late.
I don't know the match times, my brother.
So how can we catch him now?
But we have to wait until the Foxes team plays their next match.
Here it is, here it is, I saw it.
Okay, let's follow him.
Oh! Brother, you're late..
Here it is, here it is, here it is, here it is.
Go after him, follow him, follow him, go after him.
The problem is that we're not sure if it's him or not?
I tell you, Dad, this is it.
I speak the truth and wisdom: we go to them, ask them, and say to them, "The driver you have, where did he come from? How did he come to you? When did he come to you?"
Dad, you always complicate things.
We are reporting him, I am sure of it.
The land, may God protect it. Yes, it is mine.
Yes, registered in my name, yes.
And also the second land next to it
Tell your father that Abu Abd al-Rahman al-Subki sends his regards. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
No, no, God bless you, but I think we are mistaken. Oh! Boy. We came to a friend and thought it was you.
God Almighty creates many people who resemble each other.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Your Highness, thank you.
No, no, God bless you. Sorry, sorry, and thank you, thank you.
Present, with your permission. Sorry, I am here to help you. Goodbye, may God honor you, goodbye.
And you say that you are sure!
I don't know what your father is doing! I'm really worried.
What did you do, Walid!
Why, why, why was I walking, holding the bag, it got stuck.
And try to solve things now!
Go to your room, go.
I hope nothing bad happens.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Now, try to make your dad understand this!
Before my father knows?
It broke into a million pieces.
Okay, Mom, let's buy something similar as soon as possible.
Before my father comes.
Please, Mom.
You know your father, when he gets angry he becomes crazy.
Go to your room and don't come out.
He did nothing.
He accidentally hit the vase with his bag, and it fell and broke.
Mom, I'm worried about him.
I don't know where he is?
No, no, no, no, his father is crazy.
Why are you doing this to the boy, my daughter?
You scared him and left him terrified, do you want the boy to go crazy?
Can I say something, girl?
Where do you think the boy went?
Okay, if he comes, I will call you.
I hope nothing bad happens.
My aunt, I know where Walid is.
Come with me, I'll take you to his place.
Let's go. Oh God.
Here it is.
Come on, Grandma, I don't want to go home.
Hide me at your place.
I didn't see the situation.
I swear I know.
This is how your father, may God guide him, scares you.
Come with me, boy!
Don't be afraid, boy, as long as I am at home, don't worry, boy!
I have the solution.
We didn't say anything, Abu Walid!
Please, I beg you, Abu Walid.
This time, I'll forgive him for you.
Didn't you find it at home?
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where is he? Where?
Okay, my son. Oh! Walid, your father is not going to do anything to you.
Are you sure, Dad?
Yes, oh! Boy, yes.
Are you leaving it here? I'm afraid one of the kids might hit it and it will break.
He asked me and told me that you need to bring me one like the one you brought me, and the hand is broken.
He wants exactly the same thing. I went and found only this, the last one in the store. He is very lucky. Where are the kids?
In the room, he is studying.
Alright, take care of it.
Just this game and I stop.
Oh wow
Okay, then study!
Dad, just this game and then we'll study.
Please, Dad, don't tell my uncle.
Dad, don't tell your brother, Dad, this is the last time, I swear.
I will call him.
And you especially. You insulted me, am I your friend at the café?
You’d see if I didn’t tell my brother about you!
Okay, I won't call. This phone is in my pocket if you want to study, so this is fine.
My daughter, why don't you take him to the doctor?
May God guide you, Mom.
He is afraid of death because he is beaten all the time.
Poor kid.
Be patient.
Mom, where is Amoula? I don't see her with you today.
And she goes with her.
My sister does not accept wearing abayas.
Oh oh! My daughter, didn't I tell you the story of Munira and her son Naif?
He gave birth to him at the age of Walid Allah bless him.
And the same length.
Yesterday she was telling me that she doesn't know what to do with her son.
She wants to take him to the hospital, but her husband Youssef
I found out about the story yesterday.
He was arguing with her and yelling at her.
He says, why didn't you tell me?
This is a psychological condition.
This is against the boy's will.
His father must take him and tie him up in the middle of the backyard.
Then he told him to do it again and pee in your bed.
There is a big fuss over nothing.
What did you say, Umm Munira?
I used to tell her everything, everything.
Eat well and enjoy your meal.
Oh, my luck is bad.
Mama, mama.
Praise be to God that your father did not find out about you,
Otherwise, he will beat you to death.
Okay, go to the bathroom and take a shower before your father wakes up because he will cause you a big problem.
I won't listen to what you say,
Poor things,
They are crying and trembling.
I am afraid something bad will happen to my children.
I need to take them to their uncle so he can punish them.
I am nervous.
They did not fail, they succeeded.
Why are you taking them to their uncle?
Nasser scored forty-eight out of fifty.
Why don't they take fifty out of fifty?
Their uncle warned them.
And honestly, I agree with his point of view.
Forget the feelings,
And my brother must punish them.
Okay, I’ll bring it, I’ll bring it.
This is the last time, this is the last time.
Fifty out of fifty.
He is wasting our time while I assure them that he is our son.
Why don't you get fifty out of fifty?
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I warned you, but you didn't listen to me.
You’re not listening to what I’m saying.
Impudent boy!
Hit him again, let me punish him.
Hey! Stop, man.
So that next time you review well, review!
Okay, that's enough.
Do you know what I'm going to do?
I'll make you jump one after another and you'll become falafel.
Be careful when you go with your family to public places.
He creates misunderstandings for us.
The teacher, Walid is crying.
Why are you crying?
This is an excellent sign.
It's strange that you are crying.
You’re supposed to be happy.
Hey boy, everyone has left and even the buses are gone. You're just sitting waiting for someone to come pick you up.
At the school entrance, it means he is waiting for the bus. The bus arrived and the children got off.
Did you hear about the boy who committed suicide today?
Give him his certificate.
And his father threatened him if he did not get a perfect score.
Walid, Walid. Come back! Walid, come back.
Hello and welcome, live, to our new episode of our program "Without Borders"
Oil constitutes more than thirty-five percent of the total different energy sources.
While the rest goes to natural gas, coal, and hydropower.
Therefore, oil is considered the primary source of energy in the world.
The Gulf countries and Iran alone possess six hundred and eighty-six billion barrels.
It was followed by Iran at twelve percent, then Iraq at ten percent, then Kuwait and the UAE at nine percent.
Each one of them then goes to Venezuela at a rate of seven percent.
Then Russia by five percent
The Gulf countries and Iran constitute two-thirds of the world's reserves.
Unprecedented prices exceeding one hundred and nine dollars for the first time in history
In this episode, we try to understand many of the complexities related to oil.
And the problems facing oil-exporting countries
Despite its prices rising to an unbelievable level
Also the problems faced by citizens and residents in these countries
Due to inflation and the unprecedented rise
What appears later on the screen or they can write to us through our website "www.Aljazeera.net"
Because the market today is the main factor
And what are the producing countries?
The day that determines the price is the strength of the market.
No, not OPEC.
Of course, supply and demand naturally play a role.
But the other factors are
Other factors are political tensions
In the world
Real estate markets
The stock market and other markets
And move on to prices in speculation
From "commodities" such as oil, for example
And tomorrow it will reach one thousand dollars, God knows best.
Oil in the year 2004 jumped from forty-four dollars
And today we also see the gasoline prices.
He changes from day to day
Oil prices fell to below ninety dollars.
And increased in the second quarter
Especially with the arrival of spring, and secondly because most of the world's filters are under maintenance.
Always,,, for the second quarter
Seasonal demand for oil decreases
In winter, the temperature drops below ninety.
And all of this indicates that speculation currently has power and control over the market.
A lot has changed when we go back to the traditional market in the past.
The market was influenced by supply and demand.
Seasonal supply and demand
Today we see that economic growth is
Today or yesterday, General Fallon, the commander of the central region in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
His resignation sparked a major reaction due to its connection with the so-called anticipated American war.
Political or geopolitical effects
It may affect the oil market either negatively or positively in a rapid manner.
The impact definitely comes and it will have its effect.
Even speculators are affected by political influences.
This may confirm, he says, some of them tell you that the American war on Iran is coming.
What happens here in the market? The market is optimistic in a certain way.
This question, Mr. Deputy, now in light of what the White House
This has returned the region to an atmosphere of tension.
This is the mystery
But maybe Fallon saw this scenario.
He has a quick look at the oil market.
Today we are here, and we have proven with numbers that there is no shortage.
Let me give you an example: in the past seven weeks
In the United States of America, their oil reserves have increased to more than half of what they were in the past five years.
I mean today... no, I mean to say...
Not even for the next war, because today I tell you even the world has profitable storage.
Even with the world's consumption today, you can choose any country and you'll find long lines in front of gas stations.
This is something else
What risks does this problem cause?
What number do you expect it to be? I don't know.
Two hundred or maybe three hundred dollars, it could be less though.
It may lead to real tensions if these tensions become actual.
Because, as I said, the Gulf represents sixty percent.
In a country far even from oil-producing countries
You will see how the effect comes in the opposite way on the oil market.
It may reach up to three hundred dollars.
And he moved from stocks and other things to the oil market. Today you will see more than two trillion dollars or trillions of dollars.
Today we see printing
The speculation in it is more than a hundred per day - I mean -
These tensions in the region and the anticipation
April, as previously mentioned, will be the decisive month of this war
God knows,, I didn't do it,,, I mean,,, the Chinese
In the area because now
This year is the year of elections.
The current American administration only has a few months left.
George H. W. Bush launched a war on Somalia and sent thirty thousand Canadians in his last days in the White House.
We see but do not expect the events.
I just don't think this scenario will happen.
Because this scenario is very expensive
America will not pay anything; you are the ones who will pay along with Iran and the consuming countries.
America Today
Now he depends on African oil and has many other alternatives.
Look, there is nothing, let's speak clearly.
You said in your introduction that sixty percent
From oil reserves
But now they are issuing twenty-two...
Their oil from West Africa
From West Africa and anything they export from any other region in the world.
Oil production
Because this is a fixed number and fixed reserves and reserves
What is called deepwater or deep-sea production from great depths of the sea
Therefore, the Gulf will remain a tough number.
And Caspian Sea oil
And I consider them dreams because they are neither true nor real.
They ruin it and destroy it.
The important thing is, I mean, there
Today, Qatar is the largest energy exporter in the world.
Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is why these countries are considered a tough number.
Energy needs of countries
It definitely means that there is something called secure supply.
Despite internal opposition within the United States and even at the level of public opinion
But there are still some concerns.
About President Bush, if possible
Try to notice how political risks do not come from the Gulf countries.
It means he didn't come, no no no, the issue is not about generosity because none of us deal with generosity.
No, there is a lot of generosity in the interaction.
But not "in the current field"
We are not part of a charity work.
Or be generous
But Karim is with the Westerners and not with anyone else.
Exactly with America
Where is the market?
Where can I find economic returns? Let's go.
We won't do it.
Like oil and gas
He puts it in as an act of generosity.
I have the evidence.
I have the evidence.
No more than sixty to seventy dollars
Price increase season
But the decline of the US dollar that you insist on
You are primarily, as the Gulf people and the OPEC organization
The export must be in dollars and you refuse.
The currency changed despite the currency collapse, and therefore
Even though the return is not in your favor.
No, I didn't say it had to be 70.
This is the experts' talk, not mine.
Okay, the dollar dropped by thirty percent and oil rose more than this decline.
So if we take the year of measurement as two thousand and four
We see that oil prices range between thirty-five to thirty-six dollars.
This, of course, means
That oil has increased in price.
It's just a small increase, honorable deputy.
It means if we take it.
We now consider him.
Even these prices
I mean, if we compare it with two thousand and four.
It even surpassed the depreciation rate of the US dollar.
The exciting thing is
Interaction with dollar reduction
Whenever the dollar falls, oil prices rise.
This is also something; the market has started to give it its feeling.
Our current focus is the discount
No, the situation has changed. Maybe at the beginning of the reduction two years ago they used to say that, but the situation has changed now and it has become...
The dollar began to lose its value against other major currencies such as the euro and the British pound.
So the question is, why do you peg your currency to the dollar?
Weak currency and no backing
This is a historical period
Oil and its derivatives in dollars up to European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway
He says that America was in the mid-seventies.
The gold backing that the US dollar had was abolished.
This is not correct
Okay, tell me what’s right.
OPEC Organization includes
Four Gulf countries
Qatar, Kuwait, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia
Today is OPEC's share of the global market.
Forty percent
Today, if we say that the world consumes eighty-five million barrels
Those who deal in dollars in oil pricing
If you set a price in another currency, everything will go away.
You can't
All oil-producing countries must agree.
You, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf countries are very smart.
Those who own 66% of the world's reserves are the big people.
The reserves, but I see them as exports.
Including Venezuela, Libya, and Iran
Cameron, Angola, and all those countries organized under OPEC.
Its share in the market does not exceed forty percent.
Manufactured and sourced from outside OPEC
And this can be related to forty percent.
He can't do it alone unless...
There are some countries that have tried, but only.
Not a real attempt
You are the one refusing because of the American links.
From the dollar to another currency
All oil-producing countries
Previously, only one barrel was produced.
It is a loss if they import it.
And its value rose very high once.
And he sells his oil in dollars
At the entrance or reception desk, he received it, got his money in dollars, then converted it to his local currency.
His work is not tied to the dollar.
That's true, but he is...
But this is also your problem; you sell in dollars, but if your currency is not pegged to the dollar, then you have no problem.
My main question now is
What are the concerns and impacts behind pegging your currency to the dollar amid the dollar's devaluation?
It has been connected for many years.
Especially in the seventies when the dollar was a very strong currency and had great power
This separation is not that easy.
Divorce is easy
No, it's not like that here.
Divorce has its expenses.
This works in favor of these countries and not against them.
In profit and loss
Dow Jones announced yesterday that there are 4 countries, including Qatar.
But there is also a report on Gulf funding that says there are four Gulf countries, of course, because Oman left the unified Gulf currency.
I read a statement on Dow Jones, and I don't think it's a real statement.
The Governor of the Qatar Central Bank has been exiled.
He said yes and said that there will be a study, but all Gulf countries must also participate.
Profit and loss must be examined very carefully, away from emotions.
Leave the matter for inspection until they arrive.
Look, I can get you other economists who can come up with another study.
This contradicts this study.
Global House said something simple and very organized, and it was issued in a report dated March 8, meaning
Only four days ago
The global identity of the home is the simple solution and requires a non-political decision.
The political decision can be summarized in two things.
Not three, first thing
Its intention or the five with Kuwait, regarding its intention in 2010 to issue the currency or study the issuance of the unified Gulf currency.
The second point is to issue a decision to get rid of the dollar.
First, regarding the unified currency
From my personal point of view
To see the unified Gulf currency
This currency will be strong.
It will be
It could be one of the strongest currencies in the world, as I said.
What comes from the reserves and huge revenues?
That's why this is what the Prime Minister focused on when he said
The Gulf countries because no country can do it alone.
Unless it has strong economic content
And economic growth today, we even see it in the euro.
Of course, don't forget that the central bank has a major role.
In evaluation
Profit and Loss Account
From all this news
Tense situation
Two thousand and eighteen, as the observers said, the World Bank said that this inflation will continue.
For a long time in the Gulf countries, but the solution is in the hands of the governments
Some countries have raised salaries by seventy percent, such as the UAE.
To stop the inflation process that
And here is my question now, when will you raise the salaries of these poor people?
I will listen to your answer after a short announcement.
About today's episode: Oil reserves and daily production of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries Saudi Arabia
He has two hundred sixty-four billion in reserves.
Two out of every ten barrels
Nine out of every ten are produced daily.
One million, Kuwait one hundred and one and a half, production one billion, and production two and seven-tenths million
Qatar fifteen billion and twelve billion and produces eight hundred and fifty thousand Oman five point six billion and produces seven hundred and seven thousand
Bahrain one hundred twenty-five million and produces thirty-five thousand
The total revenues were thirty-three billion per year.
From two thousand three to two thousand seven
Europe one hundred billion
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion
In Asia and other countries
While the total domestic production of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries in 2006 was seven hundred and seventeen
The total in 2007 is expected to be seven hundred ninety-nine point seven billion.
It is in two thousand eight hundred twelve and one-tenth of a billion.
While the ongoing inflation is devouring the salaries of employees and the people working in this area
But it will rise in 2008 to 3.8.
Kuwait represents fourteen percent, but in 2008 it is expected to be eight and nine-tenths for the UAE.
It will be ten while Saudi Arabia was six and a half and it will reach six.
Eight out of ten
Salaries are usually eaten up.
So what are the amounts and percentages that you will give to the poor people here?
If we want to solve the problem
Real solution
Salaries always increase Salaries always increase
What is the solution?
I am not against raising salaries.
This is not true, me, this is not true
We are always
Of course, there is faith.
In the case of an increase, an increase without controlling inflation will cause inflation to consume all these increases.
To solve inflation, which is a high-level committee including all experts and specialists
And now this committee is putting
Because of the increase in salaries worldwide
And of course, the golden economic rule says
It never ends.
And whatever it is
Significant salary increases, no matter how much they increase
Inflation will increase significantly
The solution is necessary and essential.
With a scientific study here, the institute bait.com specialized in recruitment conducted a study with the help of the British Yougov siraj.
They conducted a survey of fifteen thousand employees working in the Gulf countries across twenty major sectors.
Especially the experts and those who have jobs, there is no satisfaction with the work.
Because inflation here has begun to devour
Especially those who have experience
You are thinking about moving from these countries where inflation is continuously eating away.
Now you are going to lose
This is the easy concept, take the easy concept and try to apply it.
The solution to inflation is increasing salaries.
The balance is available
Is he there?
We are worried, and the state is worried, and we are doing our best to work hard.
To solve this problem with a real solution
Temporary solutions never solve the problem; on the contrary, they make it worse.
Yazid means
We hope to have more time for this committee to put together
All requests
This is boredom, Your Highness.
Boredom is always there
That's true, but the government tried and addressed the increases by forty percent.
No, here is an important point regarding the increases.
Regarding the increases, you only want Qataris as if non-Qataris work in Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
You take into account the Qataris and do not take into account the non-expatriates.
While the highest percentage in it
You, Ahmed, live in Qatar and not in Germany.
And everyone is talking about this and feeling pain.
Salaries much higher than the government sector
On the contrary, we saw
In the government sector
On the contrary, the government sector has become
Because the best units and competencies have begun
I also read a report, and as you know, we are in the oil sector.
Work
Like our experts
Engineers and workers who come from outside Qatar
Because we also deal with the global market
For all these things, what is the average salary increase?
Hope is with God, the Exalted, but we say
The government has a plan
I say that controlling inflation is more important.
Temporary solution
And we will see, and I am sure.
There will be
Positive results
It will be around fifteen percent.
Okay, the second good report says that twenty-two billion from oil will come to you and thirty billion from gas.
I have no comment, this is not the spraying operation.
The procedure, and of course, we are
But the talk about economic growth must also reflect on the people.
Contrary to any economic growth today, Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world.
And vice versa
The country's huge "carriers" are also part of it
And if it weren't for these huge "carriers" and big projects
In this country, it will no longer be part of the inflation.
Led to some inflation
This also led to a lot of liquidity in the market.
First, regarding the linking of the dollar to oil
Pledging oil for protection
From the United States of America and thus stability in power
Thank you
Saad Al-Ghamdi from Saudi Arabia, your question Saad
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Honestly, a nice episode and its title is good.
What I really want to talk about is that the region is now under American policies.
The American policy in its current war, in addition to the cultural war it is trying to wage against Islam, there is a global economic war.
Now in China
The American deficit with Japan also reached sixty-one billion dollars.
And Japan has already invested in two thousand.
With America up to the equivalent of nine
One billion, while now investing with the European Union more than twenty-seven billion dollars.
To keep up with American policy and make the dollar the inevitable currency for the entire world
Bro, I’m saying buy it now.
And the Gulf region will become
As a place
Thank you, my brother Saad
Mohamed Al-Waseef from Egypt
Hello to the honorable deputy who is with you
O esteemed Arab rulers in the Middle East, you remind me of
When there is
When there are demands to adjust prices
Adjusting salaries in revenues according to prices, as I said, Your Highness.
In Qatar, we considered you a prototype.
He continued not to promise an increase; this is a very Arab style.
We want, we consider Qatar Abu Turka
He has the right to say whatever he wants, do you have a question? Surely this is his right, he is responsible for this policy.
The question first
His Highness must take into consideration
This is the second unit that must respond to public opinion.
With the poor, as I said, because they are people from countries that need special care.
Arab leaders who do not care about the poor
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Good evening to you and good evening to His Excellency
I want a raise as well.
Salaries are excellent and good, this is good
Okay, thank you for the topic that we need and struggle with.
I am with the poor and always by the will of God, and we know that there are no poor people in Qatar, and we are certain.
And the ruling is as Qatr said: the money goes to the ruling family and the ruler.
And this is the important question now
Let's respond to the brothers first.
I can't judge.
What happens to the wealth?
Now there are almost new cities like The Pearl and Lusail and other places, meaning even Qatar is expanding.
This is not the same situation.
A suitable urban plan
In short, since we have two minutes left, tell us what you will choose, Qatar.
Qatar now, there is a Qatar beyond oil and gas
There is a clear policy of the state.
Because he is
Non-renewable resource
Because it is a non-renewable resource
That's why today the trend in the State of Qatar
The Middle East Capital in Education
Today we see the Education City
Today, this educational city includes the best colleges in the world.
Building medical cities, media cities, and financial cities
Because today is oil and gas
No, of course we don't imitate anyone.
Other satellite channels
Not just Al Jazeera, they make a hundred Al Jazeeras and of course, we don't stand with Al Jazeera.
Because my brother, these countries are our countries in the Gulf now
In the seventies, the boom—now everyone remembers the boom in the seventies.
Now when we look at what growth Qatar has
This requires a special episode about Qatar in the post-oil era.
Regarding our vision of oil, its future, and its resources in the region, especially in Qatar. In conclusion, my regards to the program team.
I am Ahmed Mansour and I greet you without limits. Peace be upon you.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Direct greetings this week from the capital of Qatar, Doha
Welcome to a new episode of our program "Without Borders"
At the same time, Qatar hosts the largest American military base outside the United States, which is Al Udeid Air Base.
With the enemies of the United States in the region
Like Iran and Syria
Its doors are open to leaders
In fact, Hamas leaders have special connections with the Qatari leadership.
Also, the Emir of Qatar was the only Arab leader
Whoever visited the southern suburbs of Beirut that were destroyed by Israel during the Lebanon War in the summer of 2006
There is still unlimited support to restore what Israel destroyed in Lebanon.
And at the time when Qatar reconciled
With her older sister from Saudi Arabia about two years ago
At the same time, clashes with the regime in Egypt
Like the Lebanese file, which succeeded when others failed
To gather the Lebanese leaders in Doha where they safely signed their leaders' agreement
To the final elections
Also difficult files
The one who cares should be the engine for these files, not Qatar.
The smallest Arab country
In today's episode
We are trying to understand the foundation and the rules from which Qatari foreign policy began.
And for whom is the benefit?
Qatar, the smallest country geographically and demographically, plays these major roles.
What qualifications enable her to do it?
And that will be in a direct dialogue with the Prime Minister of Qatar and the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
And for the viewers who would like to participate, they can contact us through the program numbers that will appear shortly on the screen.
The visit made by the Emir of Qatar
Al Jazeera's artillery roar for improving relations with Saudi Arabia
From the past, such as Saudi Arabia's attempt to control the Qatari government with the help of the Al Murrah tribe.
In its version published on the twentieth of last June
What is the nature of the secret deal?
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Many things that are not
What I think is accurate
In many interviews here on this program, I have always said that the correct thing is that
And we consider it the backbone
From the Gulf Cooperation Council countries
There was a misunderstanding.
Moreover, the
Different perspectives
It is true that the border issue was addressed and was a major obstacle.
The historical ties between Saudi Arabia and Qatar were distinctive.
These links, if we notice them
Between the two countries and the two families
Damaged due to misunderstanding
Neither from our side nor from their side
Because there are no conditions between brothers
And now the relationships are in a state that I can guarantee is very excellent.
For the Cooperation Council
But how was the relationship between Al Jazeera and Saudi Arabia improving while Al Jazeera was the obstacle and the reason that led in the year 2002
There is an important point.
And I repeat, if you go back to all the programs, I was always saying
Not only the older sister, I used to say that our reliance in the Cooperation Council on
Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
And we value our relationship with her.
There was a sharp media exchange, and that was clear to both parties.
These countries find themselves
Unsuccessful when the brothers agreed
Especially the Saudi-Qatari house
But they found themselves in a struggle
Where there are no camels
And I don't think it was a strategy from anyone in this conflict.
Just excuse me, Sheikh, let me put things in order or the dots over the letters.
Many observers find that Al Jazeera in the past two years
At a time when the situations you criticized on Al Jazeera's screen still exist
What is happening inside Saudi Arabia
Whether the detainees, the opponents, or others, they are still standing.
Al Jazeera has stopped dealing with these issues.
Al Jazeera's coverage of the Hajj has turned into
Praise for the regime and what the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is doing at a time of difference
First, you can ask Al Jazeera management about this matter, don't ask me because I...
That which unites the two countries
For the stability of the region
This strategy continued and strengthened the stability of the region.
The area you mean is the Gulf region.
Gulf region
There are many cases around the Gulf region.
Also, the call of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Kuwait
He had an impact on all the listeners and on the entire Arab world.
He spoke from his heart about settling Arab disputes, overcoming them, and burying them.
Not just in terms of perspectives
No, it is in policies, and policies are viewpoints.
In the Arab world, it is considered
A kind of war
While in the developed world
We are talking about the same interest.
Now you have remained for many years.
The current situation
Listen first
There is a difference between this matter and the other matter.
The idea of a small state confronting large countries and making them feel weak.
Any disagreement or misunderstanding
He had his reasons.
And its reasons have ended.
It ended because of the judgment of our two leaders.
Are there insurances for the future relationship?
There are guarantees between two parties.
On the basis of love, brotherhood, and the interest that unites the two countries
And the leaders, their words are considered more than just a document
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship
We greatly hope that this Saudi-Qatari relationship will develop.
For the best, and there will be more fields.
This relationship is like the one we have with other Arab countries and other Gulf countries.
Because Qatar is an important country
Okay, Saudi Arabia is an important country.
What is Egypt to Qatar? Because the bad thing is that at the same time it reconciled with Saudi Arabia
And three organizations, including Hezbollah
Which is Al Jazeera channel
Or against the regime in Egypt, the largest Arab country
The first thing I want to start with is this.
The Egyptian people
And we respect the Egyptian nation
And its benefit
With many Arab issues and the sacrifices of the Egyptian nation
And this case
Can anyone believe that through this issue we are trying to reach an understanding with our brothers in Egypt?
In light of what you say about respecting Egypt and the Egyptian people
And we believe that he is a good person.
Our disagreement with Egypt is on two points
Or one point
They accused us of planning to overthrow Gaza, and I don't think so.
And we don't get involved
In cases concerning other countries
He does not believe in interfering in the affairs of any country unless there is room for reform.
Does this mean that you intervened in the coup carried out by Hamas against the authority in Gaza?
Of course, I don't deny it; in fact, we didn't know about this as much as others knew from the media.
We have relations with Hamas and we have relations with others.
What made Egypt different, or is there a disagreement between you on this point?
I come to this
Hezbollah Conspiracy
Hezbollah and
But I am speaking on behalf of my country.
We were very surprised by this matter.
Shook in favor of Qatar
What did the pyramids say?
The pyramids said
To attack Egypt and put it
Can I answer?
Let's get back to the conspiracy they mentioned.
Time will reveal this matter.
The beginning was not from the Gaza conference.
And I absolve the Egyptian people and President Hosni Mubarak of that.
If we go back far to the MENA conference
After the Madrid conference, do you remember the port that was held in Doha?
This was an agreement, and when the conference was scheduled to be held with us.
They said we don't want to hold the conference.
Guys, we know that you are coordinating with Israel.
Towards Qatar, and this is it
And we try to understand why
We sat and talked, and the conversation was always good.
I have two parts.
What are they?
There is a disagreement.
In the political orientation
If we look at the Gaza conference that was held
His Highness the Prince spoke with all the presidents, including his brother President Hosni Mubarak.
We have been informed by a foreign country.
The brothers in Egypt have the viewpoint that it should not be held.
And people are being killed while we are just sitting and watching.
If you don't want to hold it in Doha, we can hold it anywhere in the Arab League.
And it would be inappropriate to discuss the issue on the sidelines of the Kuwait conference.
In Israel and the Western world, they stand and watch what is happening.
When we all said, okay, now this is something normal and there is no power except with God, we as Arabs cannot stop it, nor has any big country stopped this fighting.
Egypt requested a declaration to cease hostilities in Gaza, and after an hour the fighting stopped.
Even us later
We must not underestimate the Arab street with this innocence; our disagreement with the brothers is on one point only.
This is within international standards.
And there are not enough hospitals, and doctors are arrested at the borders.
You were the ones standing at the border.
There, and no one can enter.
The brothers did not take the matter well.
Because Gaza is next to Egypt and is considered part of the national territories.
When we talk about any humanitarian issue anywhere in the world, we are simply talking about a humanitarian issue.
And we respect sovereignty in Egypt
We know his position, but this does not harm the Egyptian stance.
And we hope for a lot from Egypt
It is the largest Arab country.
And we believe that he can convey our voices and the voices of others from the Arab world.
For all other parties
Even the rescue mission after Gaza
The Europeans tried to save her.
What happened in Gaza?
Whether it is a conference being presented and so on, I consider it a rescue for the government.
We were not invited to a conference; we were summoned to coordinate among the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
And we were gathered in the Cooperation Council.
These amounts will not be issued to any party.
But it will be issued to
Affected parties in Gaza
Directly, and this was
Because entry is prohibited from all directions
I am happy for Egypt, and all the people in Qatar are happy for Egypt because Egypt
Egypt's victory in political cases is very important to us.
But you expect it
Just give me two minutes.
One minister was boasting about something that was denied and said
Whoever harms Egypt, we will cut off his leg and break his arm.
Honestly, I see that this official has insulted his country.
In fact, they did not fail and did not talk about anything except themselves only.
What helped them in this, and I said this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia, the Saudis intervened because the king has wisdom in this matter.
To summarize matters in the Arab world
Agreed
The king will decide that this is in the best interest.
We accepted King Abdullah's decision because we respect him and trust him.
But for someone to say that we stopped them, that is even an insult to those who actually stopped them.
As if they were students in a school
I think this is it
The limit has been reached
He believes he must impose his strength.
We are sorry, we are sorry about this
If you think that a small state has no rights, its rights are taken away from it.
And you suddenly enter and raise your voice in Darfur
This is an Arab decision at the Arab League.
An African decision and a decision from the United Nations
I believe the main problem is
Hezbollah's conspiracy in addition to Qatar
A conspiracy of I-don't-know-what in Qatar
If there is a possibility after the swine flu that it appeared somewhere, Qatar will be the reason behind the spread of this epidemic.
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and capabilities.
But Qatar has a point of view.
Qatar has a secret policy
If Qatar can solve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor for us.
Because any Arab dispute
We believe that any Arab conflict could weaken our position regarding our main issues, which are Palestine and all the other issues we face.
The Arab world has become a future.
Even our analysis has become like theirs.
Western analysis
But there is a topic we know and understand what happened in Pakistan.
I want someone to welcome me and roll out the red carpet for me in Washington.
Is there anyone who blames Qatar?
Has Qatar annoyed any Arab country?
He tried to contribute money.
These contributions are controversial.
I appreciate that you come by and greet me, and you say: You greet me just to provoke me.
This is a second case, meaning that you have a problem or a deficiency.
This situation doesn't concern me, it concerns you.
But only if you have internal problems
We always say it
Especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah
In Kuwait, and I know that this man is honest.
A man speaks his mind
My heart always says this.
I always say this
I always say that even in the midst of our conflict with Saudi Arabia, I used to say that.
And you can only go back to all the documents you have on the island.
The issue is different, no no
On one hand, we said no, we will stop at this situation.
We tried as much as we could.
I don't want to get into this topic.
They look at their own matters and where their mistakes are.
And if we see our mistakes, it does not mean that everything we have is correct.
Do you mean this, Your Highness Sheikh?
Due to internal problems in Egypt
And they want to get out of it.
Do you deny that Qatar contributes in any form to a conspiracy against Egypt externally and tries to break its relationship with Turkey and any other country?
It seems like we have superpowers.
And they are seventy million if we can manage, not eighty million.
They also have a problem that needs to be solved.
You played a role in the case of soldier Shalit despite knowing that this file is important to the Egyptian government.
And you asked with the French.
We received a call from a friendly country.
This is a case we must deal with. We said, brothers, this case concerns the Egyptians. They said...
We want to see this case as a request.
From Israel and another country, we want to see a second part to see this.
When we saw this, we told them that if the circumstances are the same, the brothers should speak with the brothers in Egypt.
And we announced this, meaning is there an official who can say that we, in essence, deceived the Arab League?
This means he is a poor man.
How did she let her get past us?
To allow President Mahmoud Abbas to remain
And we supported this
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is with you
I believe this is a healthy phenomenon.
I do not own the island as they accused me.
Al Jazeera must enter the media competition because there are many media outlets in the West.
There are many media outlets, and at the same time, they all insult each other.
But after a while, they will reach the stage of maturity.
It might be or it might not be
First, we have a different stance with Saudi Arabia.
And even if we concede for the sake of Saudi Arabia, we accept that in Qatar.
Important relationships
Egypt is an important country, but there is a special nature to the relationship with Saudi Arabia.
There is also a special relationship between Egypt and any other Arab country; Egypt is the largest country.
This is true, but we have a history with Saudi Arabia and the relationship is different.
It is a personal dispute between some officials here and there.
We respect the President of Egypt
I hope it is limited to just differences in policies and viewpoints.
I told you the problem started when there was an attack on Gaza.
The second problem is that they have issues with us, and until now we don't know what Qatar did to cause this problem.
Why don't you try arranging a meeting now between the Egyptian president and the prince?
Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter.
As it was leaked to the newspapers, they initially said it was a secret meeting, then we found it the next morning.
There was a meeting between me and Omar Suleiman.
In Saudi Arabia
Irreversible tear
And I can't tell you that we agree on everything.
Let's say it so that no one misinterprets it and says, "No, you are comparing yourselves."
But dignity is dignity, whether with the young or the old.
The minister said if Egypt obtains the appropriate satisfaction
Contentment Among Children
I don't think so, Egypt is bigger than that, I think he just didn't find the right expression.
Do you have a vision for how to solve the problems with Egypt, or are you like the Egyptian people waiting for divine intervention?
Please, I don't want to talk about divine intervention or anything else because only God knows who will live and who will die.
And I claim
Someone tricked him and told him there would be a way.
And our pride in Egypt
There must be a specific way.
Either he stands with me or against me.
And any pain felt by the Arab citizen
In the Arab world, we suffer with him, and this is the policy of His Highness the Prince.
States derive their power from sources of strength
The United States has sources of power like China, sources of power like France, and sources of power like a small country such as Qatar.
Our faith in God
What is clear is that
You are trying
But we are a small country, and I took this into consideration.
And I will repeat it a hundred times.
So that no one says we have any allergies
No one takes from us.
For Israel, you are now ridiculous.
Okay, before I go to Israel
How can you solve the problem with Egypt?
What's the problem now?
And every day they file a complaint to America, if I may tell you about the big countries you were talking about.
They deal with us based on interest, and so do we.
All complaints and everything
To ruin the relationship
I believe that any great country that does this will affect its image.
It will negatively affect our Arab pride if we start complaining about each other.
Everything will come, and we will know everything.
Our solution is based on the Arab interest.
And we are here for them if they need anything.
Are there any upcoming steps to repair the relations?
I just know that there are good relations between the president and His Highness the prince.
If someone is pulling the strings
Against documenting the relationship between the two countries and the two leaderships, he will find himself a loser.
No, it could be tomorrow, it could be in ten years, honestly I don't know, but on our side, if someone invites us to a conference, we will be there.
Anyone who invites us to a conference, we will attend, and if we have an opinion, we will express it at the conference.
We can't
Because Egypt is our big sister, but we have different viewpoints and we discuss them together.
This is all that is required, and when the time comes, we will be very happy.
This was canceled due to this policy.
As I said, we respect the Egyptian people.
Of course, you ask about how many contracts were canceled; ask how many Egyptians came to Qatar at the same time.
But as a state policy, as I told you, the Egyptian people in Qatar are very close to our hearts.
Now, on the past fourth of June, it stirred the feelings of the Arab countries when the Israeli office was closed, and this was published in the arts on the fourth of June.
Why do you say that we started them? If we wanted to start them, we would have shut it down twelve years ago.
When everyone had a campaign before reconciling with Israel and before secret meetings took place between the Arab countries and Israel
And after reconciling most of the Arabs
With Israel, whether under the table or on the table, or they talked to it in any way.
If we wanted to play with people's feelings, we would have done so at the previous Islamic conference.
At the United Nations, Abdel Nasser's ally held a banquet at the residence of Israeli Ambassador Gabriela Shalev.
He was one of the many guests who attended this feast, and I don't know for what reason the ambassador organized it.
Because at the United Nations we sit next to Israel, and no one can deny this.
Or we find a glimmer of hope that drives away the pain from our Palestinian brothers.
Now the management has changed, and I had a small opportunity regarding the Egypt topic, but unfortunately.
I was not me, I was you.
My question is about the United States and the new administration and its impact on your (the Qataris') relationship with the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
There are differences in points of view.
Serious in solving many issues in the region
If they are serious, we will help them as much as we can.
We expect a special relationship or a solution to the problems that existed between you and the Bosch management.
Many of these cases have been resolved.
The Emir of Qatar spoke yesterday in Paris about what is happening in Iran.
And you have special relations with Iran, even though its relationship with the United States is bad.
First of all, we must place it within the framework of internal affairs because we must respect every country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said in this program that the Doha Agreement ends with holding the elections.
Is this also your view, or do you think the agreement is still in place, or will you have to reach a new agreement?
The Doha Agreement was for a phase that would allow them to hold peaceful elections.
A year and a half has passed since the Doha Agreement.
We were following it day by day, minute by minute, until they reached the elections according to the Doha Agreement.
We recently intervened in one of the electoral districts to correct some misunderstandings that occurred.
But do you still have work with the arrangements in Lebanon?
We are always close to Lebanon; you know how much Qataris love Lebanon and love to go there.
The first country I visited after a Western country is Lebanon.
Quick Questions and Answers about What is Happening in Yemen
You intervened in a Houthis issue, and there are some accusations saying that you supported them.
Or they involve you, let them confront the state, and now there is a greater danger, which is the danger of the south.
We have suffered a lot, and this indicates why we are standing here and not there in Qatar.
And truly, we faced many pressures, but this was our vision and this was His Highness the Prince's stance.
The topic of the Houthis
Its stability affects us positively, and its instability affects us negatively.
We intervene as an impartial mediator between two parties
And we signed an agreement
I just want to understand if this is intended to be used for other reasons.
We are with them and have always stood by them in all situations.
And what is based on the truth
I see that we don't need to.
We sell it
I say this with an apology because I know there is a large Arab audience that disagrees with me.
Dear viewers, thank you also for listening, and we hope that we have clarified some aspects of Qatar's foreign policy for you.
In conclusion, greetings from the program team, and this is Ahmed Mansour sending you regards from "Without Borders."
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Dear viewers, peace be upon you and welcome to this special meeting.
Bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar
Of course, why do I say a special and exceptional interview? Because
Qatar, and this man was exactly the main sponsor.
Sir, one simple and direct question.
I think it happened because there was an Arab consensus from the beginning.
We tried that when we went to the United Nations.
The Arab consensus was important, and the Lebanese administration from both sides was also important.
To reach some conclusions
It is very important that external intervention
Many opinions and suggestions from Barra
Lebanese and international Arabs if you want to say
He went through stages, but it was like...
There is nothing unless it means that these stages existed.
Does this mean that there are complications in Lebanon?
From the time of truth
I mean, when you were gathered and you immediately went straight to the Lebanese issue and the Lebanese file.
Did you discover that the Lebanese complex is huge?
The Lebanese Arabic dialect is an international regional dialect that requires significant decoding.
Is it not a simple compound but grows due to external intervention?
Because we know that Lebanon is a beacon of journalism, a beacon of culture, a beacon of tourism, and a beacon for many things.
Lebanese must not allow it
To influence peace and security in Lebanon
Problem number one
Are these the external repercussions in Lebanon?
Suddenly, after twenty-four hours, she decided to take everyone on one plane.
Directly from the plane to meet the Emir of Qatar
They didn't even expect it, they couldn't rest for a single minute unless you were generous and let them.
The secret is that you don't let them rest or think too much.
And I made many calls.
We are thinking of bringing them to Doha because we need an atmosphere.
Otherwise, you will gather them with many difficulties.
In many circumstances
Let them get out of these conditions to conditions where they can find a solution.
If we want to succeed, we have to get them out of this atmosphere.
And quickly
God made us succeed with a Venetian statement or a Beirut statement
We succeeded because they agreed to go to Doha.
The parties decided to go to Doha.
Some people believe that Qatar tends to favor one side at the expense of the other.
And from Beirut only
His Highness's Policy If We Are Mediators
In this process
Well, honestly
Did you consult seriously?
With the main parties involved, at least regarding what is happening here in Lebanon: the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Syria.
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud
He expressed his support for the idea.
We benefited from Prince Saud that we are
Everyone needed a solution
His justifications are weak.
If we rely on logic
His justifications are weak.
He had to be removed because there is tension in Palestine.
In the case of the Iranian nuclear program
The Arab League must have a mechanism to resolve issues.
Is the African Union better than us at solving issues?
And try to gather the parties.
They organized conferences to find solutions; why can't the Arabs who have old ties do the same?
Gather the Arabs or gather the parties if they exist or intervene to support the oppressed.
This must be under study.
If we want to send a notification to the Arab League, not to the university, but to the Arab world.
The Arab League is merely an execution tool.
One of the officials who was here is President Nabih Berri.
s-s requires
It looks like the Lebanese have agreed now.
Okay, listen, we...
And above them, Qatar
What never led to a result
For the Arab interest
He will be considered a force for the Arabs
We tried it.
At the United Nations, when we went to the Doha Agreement
The schedules are designed for the solution and not for other reasons.
There is no doubt that
And a more important role in the entire Arab world
lands
We stopped it by our agreement
Others come and help us.
Because this is a serious topic, but...
Why have we reached a stage where everyone is playing in our yard?
In our yard
It is very important to put the interest of our people first.
Now we need the Arab League after this agreement to see what we will do with our Palestinian brothers.
What are we going to do about Somalia?
What do we do about Somalia? Isn't it a member of the Arab League?
Sudan is not in the Arab League! Iraq is not in the Arab League! Why don't we try?
We are part of the Arab world and a small version of it.
I hope this idea is not just a suggestion.
Qatar has good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia.
I think the first thing is that if they ask us to do something, we will do what we can.
But I am sure that His Royal Highness King Abdullah
King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
And his brother, President Bashar
Because historically, Saudi Arabia and Syria had an agreement.
It is just a passing phase.
And God willing, we will find it.
Nevertheless, I insist on asking if this is acceptable to you, could you take a role in this part?
Even if not in front of people right now, you kind of have the confidence.
Any rapprochement between Arab countries that we seek
This has been His Highness's policy from the beginning, but this matter
What happened in Lebanon? Does this indicate that the region is on the verge of radical changes?
What happened in Lebanon is local and Lebanese affairs, and regional issues are still ongoing.
Not related to this situation
I wish the opposite, I wish this were so
The beginning of a new phase in the Arab world
We can create
It happens in another place
In other words, Your Highness, are you afraid of the escalation that has been present for some time?
At least from now until the end of George Bush's presidency
There is no doubt that I still have concerns about Palestine, especially the situation in Gaza right now.
I want to ask
We don't need anything else.
I request to take charge of the humanitarian aspect in Palestine
We cannot deliver the medicine to them.
And no eating
Electricity for the patient in the hospital
Those who die when the electricity goes out
I hope
The Arab League agrees on the amount for this topic of food and medicine; we call it food and medicine.
We don't want the Red Crescent to deliver it.
Let the Red Cross deliver it.
Just excuse me, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli blockade.
I don't want to go into details, but I'm just saying that we as Arabs must deliver medicine and food even if we don't agree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made great efforts and promised at the Holy Kaaba.
Because this dispute will only benefit the second party.
Saying "Don't deal with this party because we'll find a solution for you" is not correct.
And I
So far, I have no signs of a solution.
Are you afraid of an American-Iranian confrontation in the near future, or do you expect it?
This is possible, of course.
At least I am talking about Qatar
Iran is an important neighbor to us.
We may not agree with all their policies, or they may not agree with our policies in Qatar.
For example, they tell us that we do not want you to have relations or contacts with Israel.
There may be people who necessarily see you as part of it because of the American rules that exist there.
We know how to deal with this
Some people said that after the Emir of Qatar's visit to Saudi Arabia
He might have met, consulted, or spoken with the Saudi host.
In Istanbul, negotiations between Syria and Israel
I can say it was a coincidence.
The second topic, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was keen on finding a solution and I was in contact with Prince Saud.
What happened in the last few hours?
Change the tactic Change negotiation tactics
From your side or from other parties
We are responsible for
From all sides, we locked the room on ourselves.
And finally, we found ourselves... then His Highness's intervention was very important.
From it, the intervention work emerges.
Without mentioning it now, it is over.
And his message was clear when he said, "We know our size, our location, and our role," and so on, as if he...
I wanted to take a role without involving any third party.
Whether you are Arab, national, or regional
But still
They became responsible
Did you want this or not?
We try to prevent some jealousy because we are a country.
These countries
He can do or
I think this will be the winning combination.
The last question: Is your relationship with Washington long-term? Is it normal or special?
I can say that our relationship with Washington is good.
This means that we do not have different perspectives in the cases.
But this is our right; if they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How good is it? How can you explain it on the ground?
If we talk about the economy, it is excellent, and if we talk about education, it is excellent.
Also health, but if we talk about politics I can say it is good.
In your opinion, and make it clear in the next stage.
In my opinion, let's set aside the confrontation with Israel.
And if we want to stop the play in the Arab court
Reconciliation of the enmity among the Palestinians
We agree on one opinion so that we become a respected force.
I don't think we have it.
Something effective
Thank you, dear viewers, for watching, and we will meet again, God willing. Best regards.
Welcome to our viewers in this interview with the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
In this dialogue
We are trying to explore the political reality of the Arabs and the Arab efforts.
His Highness Sheikh, welcome
To investigate what is happening in Gaza
And I hope that through this dialogue we can achieve
Clarify some of your questions
The Israeli entry into Gaza in a brutal manner
Our goal was to have a unified Arab stance.
Dealing with friendly countries
And the brotherly countries
And how do we find a clear and strong Arab stance for the Arab countries?
And then, we find areas for reconciliation.
From our site, we know that more than one Arab country has been violated.
In an offensive manner
And no one was punished while
We take turns with everything, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
We are the specialists.
In the world, the only ones who are always the target
Always disciplined in a certain way
I think
Until we can't anymore
To gather at the leadership level
To stop the disciplinary campaign
We didn't want to create a rift in the Arab world.
There were five other verbal approvals.
By a two-thirds majority
But the purpose of the meeting is not
Those who wish to be right and for our perspective to be wrong because the goal
He is the solution to the problem, not a summit.
But will it be resolved at the expense of Palestinian blood?
What we are requesting now is that the ministry does not cancel Qatar's request.
And what His Highness emphasized afterwards
In the speech he gave, he said that we do not insist that the summit be in Qatar if it causes any embarrassment; we do not insist that the summit take place in Qatar, it can be anywhere.
An Arab stance in which others respect us
Yes, and for Al-Wazari
We want to tell them that the Security Council resolution has been issued.
And Israel
He was not involved in the decision and continued the killing and bombing in Gaza, and it is still ongoing.
And I need to ask the Arab: What are we going to do about this?
What shall we do?
Is it for when Israel ends?
To implement the rest of the Security Council resolution
Or it will become a standstill because Israel did not stop.
Shooting, we do not hate our brothers
The decision is considered final
How many days ago?
We will talk about the ministerial meeting.
In the end, you will support this.
Of course, we support holding an Arab summit, and this was our idea. Some other countries also requested the summit, including Syria and Yemen.
There is a proficient Arab there already.
Or arrange us for the moderation camp
And the camp of the extremists
What do they mean by not mediating?
That was arranged by the West.
As Arabs, observers and non-observers
You will not find a monitored state or an unmonitored state.
We want to know what moderation means and what lack of moderation means. Does moderation mean following Israel's plans?
And ended the case in a humiliating manner
Or do we just need to leave the case open?
I mean, this is an important question.
Are they the countries?
They follow Israel's plans and want to solve problems through methods
I don't want to say that he follows Israel's plans, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say
If we call the camp moderation
What does moderation mean in the eyes of the West?
Do we agree to slaughter a specific group of Palestinians?
Of course, the elections have taken place.
I am neither a supporter nor an opponent of Hamas, but I speak from an existing reality.
The existing truth is that there is
Idea
What some people call a radical movement
But we must ask ourselves: What is this radical movement demanding?
Is it for something other than his rights, or is he not seeking his rights?
Or should we arrange them?
And he also created other masses
Against because we are
An introverted and cultured Arab
And it becomes a rule
That's why we don't want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, Your Highness Sheikh, in brief.
Who prevented the Arab summit?
I can't say it was prevented; there were some efforts, and the matter was somewhat known.
The topic of prevention
But like I said, we could have been
Make a vote and get two-thirds.
But that was not the goal because the problem is not a challenge as much as it is an urgent matter, that is what we are thinking about.
While some thought it was not an urgent matter.
We went to the Security Council.
Or is there a decision in the Security Council?
But the decision is up to the Security Council. Israel said it will finish first and then look into the matter.
All I want to focus on one more time
We will not exert efforts to enforce the decision on the weaker party.
What makes it different from the first meeting?
In disputes, conflicts sometimes occur.
As much as
Will we be ready to have a clear Arab stance?
Humanitarian aid
We strongly support our brothers.
Also, to address the Israeli side and inform them
I don't think everyone is ready for this, we should investigate this matter.
Why don't we freeze it?
Eighty-four, and we have been committed to the truce; eighty-four, and the Israelis were not committed.
It is natural for disputes to occur in meetings, but in reality, these disputes
They represent the attitudes and what is in their hearts.
One of the fights that used to be reported was
There was a person who described Hamas's movement as fragmented.
Not even a little bit
This situation happened, and we responded to it, and I was with one of the ministers.
And I think this is what the West is saying.
These are radical movements, disintegration, and other names.
And we don't want to be men other than ourselves.
And that's why always, I mean, and I don't mean anyone specifically by this.
Any foreigner they find him
Either a Western country or Western countries you find
Among the Arabs
His Highness Sheikh is present now
Invitation to the Second Ministerial Meeting
His agenda must be one thing.
Where are you, Arabs, from all this, and what is the stance of the nation of the three hundred and a little?
One million Israelis marketed
That was issued after decision number one thousand and sixty-eight
The issued decision
Israel hasn't carried it out; it will carry it out after completing the mission.
There is no doubt that the Arab delegation exerted effort
This is something one must be grateful for in this decision.
To invoke Chapter Seven because Israel is above the law, Israel
And if asked, they will say we understand.
It is not the Arabs' fault if they are...
If that is the case, Israel will not be held accountable.
It is above international law
This is a fact
Why did you go to the Security Council, and why did you link the Arab summit to what will be issued by the Security Council?
At the summit, the Security Council will try for us.
A difficult decision is needed
Decision to...
He can cause an official to lose their position.
We were afraid of the West.
We work hard after they make their decision.
I don't want to get involved in the matter.
Those who carried out the attack to completely rebuild Iraq at their own expense because they are the ones who destroyed it.
We do not demand from the Iraqi government, nor do we demand for the people who died.
There are no compensations.
Exactly the same thing in Sudan when they started talking about prosecuting Bashir.
His Highness
His Highness Sheikh
A major Arab diplomatic victory in the Security Council
Listen, they had some difficulties in the Security Council because the first speech was about a presidential statement.
Consequences
Israel did not commit to it.
He will commit to it after two days, after a week, after he finishes the task.
Because they did not gather with him
Sorry, but people need to gather.
Because Israel agreed after the mission was completed
Do you have an alternative to the decision now?
All we did
Some brothers, unfortunately, with some efforts
Participate in the siege of Gaza
I am a friend of the West and I have no objection to having any relationship with the West, and I am not...
Against the West, not against America
But these people understand the language of interests.
Your friends if you are strong
Or if you have a point of view
And in the end, they take one percent from our perspective, and we say we have won.
What is victory?
What it contains
I can't say anything about the precautions right now because the decision hasn't been made.
The council is master of itself.
You participated in the training.
Yes, we participated in the training to some extent.
But you were invited to the meeting with the Arab ministers and the US Secretary of State.
I just think that the brothers who left are enough.
You returned to the Arab parties for a specific interest.
In this regard, His Highness Sheikh
For two years until now
Listen, I don't want to talk about the accusations.
I can't pretend that we knew everything.
If they were people who...
There was Israeli rejection and international rejection, and we also contributed to this rejection.
And from here, the disputes began and the siege started.
Last month, Israel killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the truce.
And we let them die of hunger until they burn because we don't want them to be in power.
These parties are His Highness Sheikh
Clearly explain that the Palestinian conflict
I mean, if there was any
Who created the Palestinian conflict could have been in a Palestinian dispute.
She tells the other party no, you are one hundred percent right.
I'm not saying that Hamas is one hundred percent right.
I don't say this nor do I claim that.
However, the median is usually in the middle, at the same distance from all.
And not just the Mediterranean, we as Arabs are equally distant from everyone.
But we don't want it to exist, so we must end it by any possible means.
Once training the soldiers right and left
And sometimes by surrounding them and not giving them money or salaries.
And whenever we establish a positive model in the West Bank
So that the people in Gaza can see how people are living
Luxury living
While the opposite is true in Gaza
I was invited to a second ministerial meeting, an Arab ministerial meeting, but at this time
Is there still any talk going on about Hamas through Turkish mediation?
This meeting you were invited to attend seems like it wants to be skipped.
It would be deceitful if we made a second initiative.
We have no initiatives.
In this case
Because Egypt is an important Arab country
A role is requested, and we support any Egyptian effort made to reach an understanding.
But important
Don't come
Tomorrow there's a party that looks like it outdid another party.
Nor the path to harmony
A Balanced Egyptian Initiative
Between international demands, Arab demands, and humanitarian demands
And the requirements of Egypt's role, which is an important role
It is a leading Arab country that we all respect and appreciate.
In your opinion, is this what is required of Egypt?
The current suggestions and the current initiative do not meet these requirements, Your Highness.
I have a vision for the initiative
We hear some information here and there.
I can't comment on something I don't know.
With all due respect to the government or the Palestinian presidency, which must exist, and we all acknowledge the Palestinian presidency.
But there are also people
Those who were affected on the other side, we must also take their point of view into account.
To do these intermediate tasks
By the way, to take the point of view
Hamas's position was clear that this decision did not take our point of view into account, so how could it be issued?
A decision in which Arabs participate in its formation without communicating with or consulting the primary party concerned in the matter.
We only want, and of course, we deal with the Palestinian state as a state.
And we deal with the authority unilaterally.
But now there is a split in one party in one place and another party in another place.
This means that if we deal with people from Gaza, we must stop dealing with people who are either in the bank or in the Palestinian presidency.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
They are asking for someone from Gaza to be with them.
And now we begin coordinating with each other.
What has been announced about it?
First, regarding the decision, he did not mention a mechanism; he welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiative.
Some saw it as a mechanism.
This is an explanation, but what I understood from reading this decision is that it welcomes the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative will succeed in performance.
This stops the fighting
I have no doubts about our brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the Security Council resolution
It is considered that this decision is no longer valid because Israel did not accept it.
Even if he accepts it later, things will change on the ground.
Yes, Your Highness Sheikh, in the discussion about the Egyptian efforts
In cooperation with the Turkish efforts at the same time, which is
Or an Arab excuse
Or the Arab conflicts that cannot reach a solution, that's why it came to fill the void.
It is supposed to be filled out by the Arab parties.
I welcome Turkey's stance
A platform that Arabs and Muslims should appreciate
Turkey is an Islamic country
That's why this is a normal role.
And that people must follow it.
There is no Arab conscience that can resolve the situation.
One says, let them finish the task.
There must be a clear Arab stance and a clear separation regarding all this aggression, its continuation, and the procrastination.
There will be an opposing Arab stance.
Israel can postpone the decision, I am not talking about a war between the Arab Israelis, and we are the people who always call for peace.
We are a country that loves to live in peace.
I do not pray for an Arab war, I pray for
A clear Arab stance
In the context of initiatives and proposals, of course, you are following what is happening.
And the proposals and conditions set by Hamas
You think?
Now as an on-site observer
And the political situation resulting from the military operation will now allow Hamas to impose its conditions.
Does it have to be him who is right?
We agree on this point and disagree on this point.
The second thing
I don't know about this negotiation, like I told you, they are not there. Oh, now they are negotiating.
The second thing
Okay, in the sites required for Arabs
This is the Arab reality
He witnessed it after those operations began.
It seems that there is a very advanced stance being adopted by the Arab street.
We have like governments
Of course, I feel sorry that there are people who describe the gift of the peoples.
They keep telling me about this problem again.
Representation of people's opinions
The presidents now
I mean, if they want
At least they see what.
The request, of course, has a high ceiling and a modest ceiling.
To stop normalization and diplomatic relations with Israel
Qatar to
The office of the Israeli representative in Doha has been closed.
Qatar, who takes this position?
I believe that the Arab side must be radical and take radical positions.
Anything agreed upon by the Arabs will be a collective agreement.
Not at all if we had an Arab agreement
A treaty is one thing, and relations are another.
We are ready
To share with our Arab brothers
If only there were a clear Arab decision and credibility.
They deal with others, not just countries that have relations.
But also countries that have nothing at all
This is very important
Do not become agents for others.
He says, why not let Qatar be a role model in this field?
So if this is the only model, we are ready to be in it.
But we still want
Qatari Arab model committed to part of her Arab commitment
Like
And one does not sell to the other.
Our problem is that trust between Arab countries is missing.
And unfortunately, I don't want to say our secret, I don't want to say the intermediaries.
That's why it is very important.
For official invitations anywhere, because we must rise above this.
Some of them named the ambassador, some organized protests, and some expelled the ambassador like Chávez.
This is part of the dispute.
But some of them summoned the ambassador, and those who summoned the countries with permanent membership, and all of this is just movies about our people.
We talked about the modest ceiling of people's demands
Regarding the high expectations, some are demanding the opening of fronts, and others are demanding that Syria open its fronts with Israel.
Listen, I told you that we pray for peace and we do not pray for fighting with Israel.
And we do not want to clash with Israel.
A conflict with Israel is ongoing
And how will they agree?
This is also a problem.
What makes us talk to each other and overcome our differences
What you said, Your Highness, caught my attention.
Provided that countries do not sell to each other.
What do you mean?
I mean right now
The street will not have mercy on us.
His Highness Sheikh
Is what is happening today a continuation of a project that started in 2006 during the Lebanon war?
Or is there a disagreement?
No, I think there are differences in the goals.
Lebanon had liberated land.
Some parts of the course are still supposed to be a deposit for the United Nations.
Or something like that
Lebanon, I mean our dealing with the Lebanese issue to a great extent
Israel, of course, needs weak countries around it.
To dominate and have the upper hand
Of course, there are countries that support it, and they are foreign.
That's why he wants to remain the sole power in the region.
And now they want
To change this example with Ghaza
In Lebanon, how many sects do you talk to?
And how many sides are there?
While in Palestine there is only one side
I can only confirm to you once again that the problem in Palestine is that they have listened too much to the Arabs and foreigners.
And from here the gap began, and everyone thought it would control the second part.
In your opinion as an observer and viewer
As planned, it will end with broken bones.
As Arabs, do we accept this because it may happen again to those who disobey?
Or express his opinion
Whether Israelis or others in the future
And we gave a high example.
In obedience and assistance in breaking bones
We have an ethical proverb that says: My brother and I are against my cousin; my brother, my cousin, and I are against the second one.
Now we are supposed to be in any dispute with Hamas, and I am not saying that Hamas or others are immune from making any mistakes.
They all have mistakes.
Now we have to leave this topic.
Made the part kneel
Because here failure is not the failure of the group.
His Highness Sheikh Qatar, usually I mean some time ago, was trying to come up with proposals.
And the initiatives to find solutions have become in Lebanon
It happened in Darfur, we'll talk about this a little later even if we're in a hurry.
We are
We don't want to rely on our brothers because sometimes there are some sensitivities.
That country is carrying out all these initiatives; we have no objection as long as there is a solution.
Our goal now is not to keep Qatar in the headlines.
One of His Highness the Prince's goals was
One of his goals was how to stop the bloodshed.
And the control stopped
What happened was beyond imagination
And we are in Qatar
Do we know something they don't know? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is to have a good intention.
To reach a solution for honoring
When talking about initiatives, it is useful to know what was stated in the initiative related to the Justice and Equality Movement to resolve the Darfur crisis.
The Sudanese government in Khartoum
And it will mainly be about solving the Darfur problem because the Darfur problem is in its early stages.
The Arab helped
But let's not make it a big deal because we made it international.
Based on revenge against the regime, and now we want to solve the problem but we don't know how.
And we always strive, as I mentioned before, to implement decisions. We are the best people at implementing decisions.
Remove the issue from the competition, is there still any competition regarding the Darfur matter?
I don't want to deal with this matter.
Before we summarize the discussion, Your Highness Sheikh, there is an economic summit.
Will this summit be held? Are you planning to attend it?
No, I will attend the summit.
We wish it had been held in an atmosphere different from the Arab atmosphere, but it was scheduled.
It will be a shame
Okay, if the Arab leaders attend this summit
When the blood of the Palestinians in Gaza was shed while they were gathering there for financial and economic reasons
Assistance with heating
It just seems like no one is afraid of this street.
You don't know the circumstances, I mean of course I hope nothing happens to us, but safety comes first.
And for safety
Just don't let anyone take advantage of someone with a small pocket.
Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, thank you very much.
Dear viewers, wherever you are, peace be upon you.
So what is the point of this celebration and the truthfulness of the statements of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights?
People with disabilities are the most neglected in the world.
What is the situation of our Arab region and to what extent are they interested in this issue?
These and other questions will be asked to our guest in today's episode.
Former Special Rapporteur for the United Nations Conference on Disability
He holds a Bachelor's degree in Arts, Social Work, and Sociology from Qatar University.
Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policy from the Egyptian University in Helwan
He held several positions in the field of disability.
She was a founding member and the general coordinator of the National Committee for Persons with Disabilities.
In two thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Vice President of the National Committee for Persons with Disabilities since 2999
Until two thousand and three
He also contributed to the establishment of the Shaflah Center for People with Disabilities.
For persons with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest has overseen the launch of numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
And activities related to persons with disabilities in the Arab world
Also contributed to delivering lectures and participating in meetings, conferences, and forums.
Hello, Mrs. Hessa, with us in this episode
The term used is persons with disabilities
At the very beginning, we used the term "people with disabilities," perhaps in the eighties and before.
A more educational concept when
Among those who are provided with such education
An important document at the United Nations appeared in ninety-three.
About the term and before we get into the details
From other regions, despite the existence of areas that are not or are not classified as developing countries and are classified as poor.
And Latin America, especially Latin America, in fact this trend there is the strongest compared to any other region.
But the statistics proved otherwise
The trend towards legal rights exists in the Arab world and is present in many countries.
The resources might be available, and the political will as well.
Okay, let me tell you about some statistics you might know.
Eighty percent of poor countries
UNESCO says that about ninety percent of children with disabilities from poor countries do not attend school.
Ms. Hessa, how would you comment on these statistics?
He is largely real.
I have seen in Darfur, in Gaza, and in areas exposed to such events, which are wars and conflicts.
There is something that allows you to distinguish between a disabled person and a healthy person because they are in large numbers.
In fact, children suffering from illiteracy among females, for example, are approximately fifty-two or fifty-three.
And in other countries
There are many obstacles preventing these children from reaching school, even without disabilities.
In fact, the city has no infrastructure even if this child finds the school.
He can't reach it.
For children and other residents
These schedules and projects are excellent, but we rarely hear about them.
Except when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated a few days ago. What is the purpose of this celebration?
The situation in the world
Better than people without disabilities
There are organizations that have arrived and established many projects.
Implements a very important health strategy
Through this strategy
There is an overlap between humanitarian affairs and working with marginalized groups such as people with disabilities.
There is now a degree of awareness in the Arab world, and it has become better.
At the point of awareness, we pause to receive calls and continue our conversation.
Thank you
I have two questions I want to ask her because she was at the United Nations some time ago.
The second point
United Nations laws that call for combating regimes that cause obstruction to society for the sake of the child, such as the Syrian intelligence system now.
Is there a law that allows demanding the trial of the regime because there are many in Syria?
Yes, Suleiman, your question is clear. Suleiman Karaw from Syria, thank you very much. With us is Naif Saeed from Kuwait. Welcome, Naif.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Peace be upon you too
Good evening
Good evening and welcome
If you allow, I am one of the people who have intellectual and mental disabilities.
I hear the Arabs say that a free man understands by hints.
And in the Quran, there is a verse that says: In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, Allah has given us speech, praise be to Allah, who gives speech to everything.
I spent thirty years without speaking a word or just a word or two a day.
So glorify the Lord, for He has made me speak.
I was referring to the Quran and found
People attack me because I use the Quran as a reference, and they consider me a hypocrite.
They attack me without realizing that they are in the depths of hell.
I only received slander.
And he does not tell the truth
If your house is made of glass, do not throw stones at others.
And of course, psychological disabilities
Regarding brother Suleiman's inquiry, it also falls under the same definition.
United Nations programs or their responses regarding the causes of disability, such as political objectives or others
Go to various agencies and organizations
To discuss with them and convince them, and to find out to what extent
There are topics and disability cases on their work agendas.
UNESCO, the international organization for work, UNICEF, and the fact that these organizations have indeed established disability
He is one of the programs that tries not to overlook children with disabilities.
With good opportunities and good schools
From various environmental aspects
UNICEF as well
But there are shortcomings, and we must acknowledge the existence of shortcomings in the United Nations as well.
What are the main weaknesses and inefficiencies you talked about?
For the United Nations
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
I was in my country, the State of Qatar.
But there was routine and bureaucracy that hindered things.
My work, especially sometimes during restrictions or shortages afterwards
People with disabilities struggle or try to fight for recognition.
Until it reached a somewhat satisfactory level, unless it was placed in a separate article as the global disability movement wanted.
But it occupied a fairly reasonable part
Unfortunately, there is no coordination between them.
This is one of its main drawbacks.
The survey, which was conducted by the Special Rapporteur and applied to the countries
Among the employees or the people working in those programs
Unfortunately, we received only three responses out of forty-eight organizations and agencies, and they came to us with only three replies.
Don't put down
The issue of disability is permanent, stable, and ongoing for many years, even though this issue is fundamentally a matter of human rights.
Recently, thank God, for two or three years.
The issue of disability has at least been raised through events such as seminars and other activities.
Peace be upon you
Dear Madam, why are there no binding laws and decisions for the Arab countries, and who is responsible for enforcing these international regulations?
For Arab countries and salary allocation, for example, allocating a salary for people with disabilities
Are there funds allocated by the United Nations?
Do this money go to governments or to offices affiliated with the United Nations, and do these aids actually reach people with disabilities?
The final observation if there are binding decisions for the Arab countries
Thank you very much, Ahmed Al-Halabi from Greece
With us is Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia, welcome Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you
And upon you be peace.
She adopts this proposal
It is to write directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
To be transferred to this box
Or a manufacturing plant
Allocating only one percent of the annual net profit
I'll get back to our guests to answer the callers' questions.
He said that the doctors advised him to undergo surgery, but
His expenses are a lot and he cannot afford them, so where can he find help?
He is from Algeria
I believe it is important to meet the needs of Brother Naji.
Like any other rights, the rights of persons with disabilities
All these rights and duties must be obtained by the citizen.
To join the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this agreement is legal and binding.
Meeting the rights and needs of people within the national framework
Or even at the non-governmental level
Binding on all countries and should be limited to ensuring the implementation of these laws
At least at the level of officials, there must primarily be awareness.
It must be at least if we work on these agreements in this way.
Even if there isn't a big commitment towards him.
Is there any response to the monitoring reports that you make, and was there any interest?
But do not forget the rules; it is a document that is morally binding in reality, not legally.
You have an obligation and it is legal
And understand that these cases will be resolved or discussed or will be within the context of a community suffering from many problems.
Naji Zakharna, Director of the Qatari Center for Sign Language for the Deaf, Expert at Al Jazeera
First and foremost, Mr. Ali would like to extend sincere thanks to Al Jazeera.
Those who are currently broadcasting this episode live
Now Ali is speaking and saying that he is very proud.
She was a servant to all the people with special needs in the place where she was, and still is.
We support her and stand by her always and forever.
And I also say that many people have special needs.
Some of them are not aware of this agreement because there were no training courses.
About them, especially in schools, hospitals, or in public and private institutions
It is necessary to publish this agreement.
As a law dealing with people with special needs in all countries of the world
And I used to emphasize and insist to these countries that
This agreement was approved and signed.
Like the State of Qatar, some countries have signed this document with the aim of serving people with special needs and serving us.
Thank you very much, Naji, I am speaking on behalf of Ali.
Thank you very much
Your opinion could affect the decision.
The former UN Special Rapporteur on Disability, we can start with the proposal submitted by the caller Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Establishing a Support Fund
A donation box and acceptance of any contributions from countries
This means that the fund is supposed to be spent on the activities that the special rapporteur carries out when they are engaged in them.
Even the Arab countries did not make donations, except for one country: Syria.
Addressing these obligations is a problem present in the United Nations, therefore
The box
Unfortunately, a lack of commitment from member states, and a lack of interest
Unfortunately, many people boldly say that this means we do not care about the current situation.
In fact, it is a matter of commitments.
About Human Rights
In its broad and general form
Especially the marginalized
Just because of this reason in these times
These countries must fulfill their obligations, and yet it is a good idea proposed by the brother.
Above all this, it is essential that there is no single independent fund in the full sense, but rather the organizations that already exist in the region.
From those who have it in their budgets
Special projects were presented for people with disabilities in Gaza
Assistance for people with disabilities
The problem is always related to political factors.
His state or government has largely guaranteed its support.
Unfortunately, reducing the number
For nominal amounts
The father is disabled
Of course, the citizenship was revoked.
Take his daughter, she is.
Sometimes from
Teaching problems
Traveling or going out, we hesitate
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
And peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.
And we appreciate
They rebuild themselves while they know
I hope that Arab countries allocate from their budgets
Thank you very much Bahjat Karwan from Kuwait
Aisha Mohammed from Qatar, hello
Peace be upon you
And peace be upon you too.
Good evening to you and to Sheikha bint Khalifa
I just want to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In recent years
With our best wishes from us; the parents of children with special needs
For the continuous support from Sheikha Hessa to them
A noble flag bearer from Tunisia, welcome
There is a second level, which is genetic.
I believe there is interest at the genetic level that reduces the rate of disabilities.
In our Arab customs, the cousin always marries his cousin's daughter, and so on.
In this way, at this level, the level of disability, thank you.
Can you comment on what the viewers said?
In fact, as I said at the national level
I know that there are programs for guidance and support.
It falls within healthcare services
Those who also fall under the umbrella of Hamad Medical Corporation
I think inside the psychiatric clinic and also the programs at the Supreme Council for Education
Special Education Department, honestly, I don't know if it still exists or not.
But definitely within healthcare services, yes, there is support and there are medical services.
Rehabilitation was provided for these cases.
Prevention is better than cure, and it refers to the genetic factor and consanguineous marriage. Are there any campaigns?
For example, to raise awareness
In this area
This is definitely a very important and serious point.
And one of the things that I and others have discussed with a lot of talk and many posts
Yes, there are awareness campaigns and they are not targeted only.
It was implemented by the World Health Organization
And also for UNICEF
Now in many Arab countries, including Qatar
And certainly Tunisia
There is now a binding decision for early screening.
And what has been implemented in many countries
All of this is on the preventive side.
And do such campaigns receive any positive feedback?
Especially when it goes against customs and traditions
Of course, its difficulty arises when it clashes with the collective culture.
So that he has a decision, has strategies, has the will to deal with this, and commits.
The issue of early screening, for example, is a very important matter before marriage.
I ask you if there are statistics about people with disabilities?
Especially people with disabilities from the Arab region
For the Arab region
Especially
With the recent events that happened in the region
In the regions and in places of conflict and in wars, especially wars and conflicts, and so on.
For every person killed, there are three disabled.
What happened in Lebanon, Darfur, and many other places?
Not enough at all, and first of all, the problem.
With the principles of human rights
There must be something for people with disabilities, their programs, and their plans.
Agendas within existing institutions in ministries in the government and non-governmental sectors
In circumstances such as war or unrest
Only for your words, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay
In the world, and the strangest thing is what the International Committee for Monitoring the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said about the census.
To this extent, people with disabilities are not included in the statistics conducted for the resident population.
They are always announcing.
For example, in the State of Qatar, when the census was conducted, I believe it was more than five years ago.
But honestly
In cooperation with the Planning Council and with the...
Prepared by the Council as a fait accompli and with our participation, such as the Office of the Special Rapporteur
To add more classifications for disabilities
The needs that should be present
Types of those needs All these important details that should lead you to a result
Is there a disabled person or not?
But at least
Statistics are somehow ongoing in this regard.
Peace be upon you
Thank you, Madam, for this program, and thanks to Sheikha Hessa.
But I thank God that I am Qatari and receive all this attention from my country.
My daughter is currently a student in independent schools and is receiving a good education, thank God.
And I want to thank Mrs. Hessa.
Its motivational role and its role that made us neither fear nor worry about our children.
Praise and thanks be to God, and thanks to her and to those who rely on this group.
Thank you very much Fatima Al-Dosari from Qatar, we are still with Qatar with Latifa.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too
My dear sister, the reality, the expectations, and what we are waiting for is the solution to our children's problem.
Where is the role of the sheikha for our Qatari children?
I hope she can answer this question.
Hello, peace be upon you
I bear witness to the special services provided by the State of Qatar for individuals with hearing disabilities.
We had a program for the early detection of hearing loss.
There is a Supreme Council for Persons with Disabilities.
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability
Until the gathering of civil society, non-governmental organizations, or other communities
Because reality and what we wish for, if compared after five years
What was provided for people with disabilities five years ago and now?
Thank you very much, Karim Naseem from Jordan, now we return to our guest.
Of course
The society as a whole with its individuals, especially with its families who have
Children with disabilities have great ambitions and expectations from
Whether at the planning level or at the operational level
But regarding one of the points you mentioned, which is a very important point
Children who do not have identification documents or others, whether in Qatar or elsewhere
The international agreement is very similar to many international documents.
And committed to translating it into plans and strategies
To provide those services automatically
Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights regardless of religion, race, color, sex, or sexual orientation
Okay, Sheikha Hessa, you were previously a special rapporteur and you were involved with persons with disabilities at the United Nations after six years of work.
Did you wish?
Maybe the time wasn't enough or the financial aid wasn't sufficient.
There are many achievements that have been accomplished, and I am proud of them.
Through my participation, or through existing organizations and through government institutions in many countries
Especially in the Arab region
There will be more research and larger studies.
We started with a global survey and had more than one report.
Raising awareness is an ongoing process that we must work on continuously and fundamentally.
Coordination among Arab countries
Among the people themselves are people with disabilities and their organizations because they
But they have a duty they must fulfill.
They have to fight because
Thank you very much
Thank you
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode, I thank everyone who shared their opinion and comment with us.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will meet a new guest.
Stay with us with your messages and correspondence in a new episode of "Live" Goodbye
Good morning
I am very happy to have you with us here.
First, before we start, we ask you different questions and chat this morning.
Thank you, Shaimaa, maybe I was just congratulating.
The entire Middle East deserves this international achievement.
Qatar has truly made its mark on the global football map.
Thank you, Qatar
Also Ali, please go ahead Ali!
First, I would like to say good morning to the viewers.
I express my congratulations to him and to all Qatari citizens on the hosting.
And God willing, just as Sheikh Muhammad said,
It was a dream, and God willing, it will become a reality, and the work starts from today or the announcement period.
Did you expect Qatar to host the World Cup in 2022?
Despite the presence of strong files like America, Japan, and Australia, I wasn't afraid in this field, especially on this topic?
No, look, honestly with you, I said there is a seventy percent chance that Qatar will get it.
Very strong
He has global and competitive plans.
We were competitive
Why should we be afraid?
But thank God, the Qatar file was really strong and deserved this.
It is true that the 2022 file, the World Cup and hosting in Qatar
So, what do you think, how do the players feel?
They are in the field, of course they feel great happiness, God willing.
I love %pw, we used to talk off the air, but we want to hear her on the air,
Moment of announcement
Where were you, how did you get the news, were you surprised, tell me, and tell the audience.
On the radio
Then everyone joined us.
They heard about the announcement
How did you find the international media?
At the level of sports channels, everyone was supportive, especially the Arab channels. Thank God, everyone provided us with support.
As soon as they announced Qatar's victory and that it had been awarded the hosting,
All Arab countries have declared their full support for Qatar, through the media, human resources, volunteers, in the future.
The Arab countries are known for their generosity.
Even at the level of international media, Shaimaa
That time I went to celebrate at Souq Waqif.
Even Agence France-Presse was filming there.
We had interviews later.
Everyone cooperated, Qatar is now mentioned daily.
A hundred times a day, considering it is the smallest place on Earth
I assume everyone knows Qatar, even on the internet.
To host the 2022 World Cup
I mean, any football player dreams of serving his country by being on the team.
Of course, any player, whether in the Qatari league, wishes to represent the team.
This is a positive thing, that one works very hard in order to
Be in the league, even when he is in the league he dedicates all his efforts.
Whether in training or matches, because he carries the league's emblem on his jersey, and for this reason, he must dedicate his energy.
Look, the responsible people have made a great effort in nurturing young players, and they teach them professionalism from a young age.
Eat, sleep
Tell me about your experience. You played in several age groups; how was your experience, and what was the most important stage for you?
It was, of course
I progressed step by step in the league, from the youth team to the first team.
Camping with the club and with the league is known
Each stage has its own special sign.
Yes, Lana, God willing, you were moving between
We are now both used to you, the athlete.
We always see you as a sportswoman, we wanted to see you and follow sports news through you, so how is sports going with you?
Honestly, I don't see it as different from talk shows. In talk shows, we used to do interviews with famous stars in their fields, and also in sports, we would do interviews with stars as well.
Like Ali and the others in their playing field
On the contrary, the sports field is active.
Especially since we are the capital of sports
And now Qatar has become the global capital of sports and football.
Instead of offering various talk shows—social, economic, and cultural
There are different courts, volleyball, basketball, different champions
But still sports
Wonderful, excellent
Honestly, I wished
I wish I were ten years old now, not twenty-five.
I believe that the young players got a very big opportunity.
I hope they take advantage of this opportunity.
This is excellent, Ali. What would you like to say to the players?
God willing, the young players who have a bright future in the coming days, God willing.
Of course, I told you it's an opportunity, they have to take advantage of it.
It is a golden opportunity
They have a big advantage from it.
Tell us, what are you doing, what new programs are you planning to offer? I know we asked you to come during your vacation.
So tell us about what's new with you, God willing.
We always follow the events, and we are preparing for the Asian Cup that starts in January.
A few days ago, we finished the Gulf Cup, and by the way, we would like to say congratulations to the Kuwaiti league.
The newsletter is also available to cover events
My first appearance in the media was through Qatari television, and of course, my roots are from Qatar TV.
I am grateful for their kindness
To transmit the media message on different channels
Whether private, sports, or other channels
Thank you, Qatar Channel
We wish you all the best, we are still on the same topic.
First, I would like to thank the management of Al Wakrah Club
And its fans, I have been at Al-Wakrah Club for a long time.
My childhood,
The sheikh was here with us yesterday, Sheikh Nasser was with us.
Still at the club
I am still a boy from Al Wakrah.
That's it, like I told you before the program started, professionalism.
This concerns every individual in Qatar.
We know that young people really love sports and are addicted to it.
How to make sports a social topic
Media awareness comes first; the media plays an important role in promoting sports in all different areas of life.
I said that young people are addicted to it, and also schools have become aware of the importance of sports in school.
For example, they celebrate any sports occasion.
Also in Qatar, you see signs on the streets, this reflects people's awareness of sports.
Allocating seats for women in stadiums and any place
This also indicates the awareness and participation of women in the field of sports.
And now we have a Qatari women's league, for female players.
I believe that sports are evolving.
I also believe that this time period
To produce massive projects and increase awareness of sports, I assume this time period is sufficient.
If it is carefully considered and implemented
This is enough and at the same time must be used thoughtfully, as I said.
Also, there is one point, which is how the new generation exploits the league.
Everything is available: capabilities, expertise, and equipment.
Also, there is something important. Thank God, we are in Qatar, and as all Arab and Gulf communities know, we are known for our passion for sports.
How do we attract this audience to follow sports news and football matches in Qatar?
And attending matches at the same time
Most of the Qatari people love sports and football, but the problem is that they do not attend.
When you browse web forums, you find great interest, especially in most club forums.
There is great interest in my football career.
You, as a Qatari citizen, what do you think is the best solution to attract you to attend, regardless of whether you are an athlete or a player?
What is the possible way to attract the audience to attend, for example, your friends?
It depends on the person themselves; there is no general concept.
Some people like to watch it on TV at a gathering at home.
For example, Japan, Japan made a great plan to attract a large audience.
When you attend matches, collect points, or anything, they are looking for solutions, so God willing.
And Arabic
The most important point is that every player is here in Qatar, especially in the year 2022. Lana, what do you think we need?
Apart from financial support, what do you really think we need?
Providing the means that make them ready like the Qatari League and participating in the big World Cup, the World Cup.
Time flies with good people. When the producer told me that time was up, I said, "By God, hopefully."
We always achieve the impossible, we achieve the dream that we thought was impossible, thank God we are living it in reality.
As Sheikh Muhammad said, there were moments of celebration, but the hard work had begun.
God willing, the year 2022 will be an event worthy of the name of Qatar.
I congratulate everyone living in Qatar, and honestly, Qatar has become a global brand.
For hosting in the year two thousand and twenty-two
Thank you, Lana, for the wonderful introduction. I wish you success, and I will always follow your programs to stay updated on sports news.
Thank you, definitely happiness
Young Qatari talents
And they are singing a new type of music that has become popular these days.
But in a repetitive way with fast music and rhythm.
And also the Hawin rap group, God willing.
Stay with us, we'll start now, and good morning
We try to take a quick look at it.
We can define rap briefly as fast music.
It is a repetitive performance, but not fast rhythmic singing of the song's lyrics.
This consists of many rhymes and addresses a number of different topics and issues.
Sometimes it can be personal,
Social, emotional, or political.
Often controversial,
And largely free.
Rap performance, our viewers do not sing the lyrics of the song,
But he repeats it.
He flirts with his voice, which is considered a secondary element.
In general, the voice is not important in rap songs.
For this reason, what is called a singer is just a rap performer or rapper.
Singers care about the following elements in songs:
For example, flow, flow of sounds, synchronization, and connectivity.
They have followers, an audience, and fans.
They have a unique style of rap,
And I think they give you a better idea than I do personally.
Good morning, hello.
The first thing, it was a period when we wanted to do something new.
To be distinguished by something.
So we said, why don't we rap?
Rap is an art form present in every country in the world.
So why isn't it available in Qatar?
So we said, let's invent something new.
We gave him an idea that includes a message,
We talk about the advantages and disadvantages that occur in society.
So, first we deliver the message, and secondly, it is an art.
It is an art among many arts; for the viewer's information, it has addressed many social and psychological issues among youth in a radical way.
Time changes, and I think this has to do with the change of time.
Before, there was little acceptance.
We have been singing since around 2005; the acceptance was limited at first.
We can say about ourselves that our new beginning was in 2010.
It has more acceptance and popularity.
People like to sing and perform in a style similar to rap these days, have you noticed that?
Yes, of course, a large percentage of people.
And also, there is something we want to talk about: you were the founders in many teams.
A beautiful band, and I believe you have concerts. Can we talk about this band?
How was it founded, how did the idea come about that someone could form a band, and how many of you are in this band?
In the beginning, before the band was formed,
Rap reached Doha starting from the year 2005.
It means that anyone who loves the concept of rap and can rap, can sing and upload it to the website.
I can carry, Salman can carry, someone can carry, so there was a competition.
We got to know the people.
So we started competing with each other.
After a while, after all these years, we reached the year two thousand and ten.
Before the year 2010, it was a group system, meaning this group alone, and every three or four were together.
So we said, why don't we all unite as one group under the name Qatar Rappers,
Or in English Q Rappers.
We agreed on this, so we said under one name, and we are all united as one hand together.
And we come to present this thing and say the same idea.
About twenty-five people.
Twenty-five, wow! God willing, a large group.
Is there anyone among you who raps or, or, or do you all sing rap?
Organize and assemble.
You could say it's a personal matter.
Excellent, how are these twenty-five organized? How is this number organized in the group?
Everyone has their own abilities.
It means that everyone in the band can make a complete song.
Without any help from a second person.
But the abilities might be different, for example, if Salman is better than me,
He listens to it and tells me, change the words here, change something.
It is possible that each one turns into the other.
Let's help each other a little.
Or a company sponsors you, so that an official entity adopts these works,
And there will be the appropriate distributors.
So that the work comes out in an elegant style and becomes something official for you.
Honestly, we hope to receive support and backing from Jat Company to adopt us in producing an album for us.
We have no problem.
Some things are a bit difficult.
So why don't you think that the first initiative should come from you?
So that the individual gets to know the first CD.
By doing this, you can later attract companies. What do you think?
Around the year 2007, I made a CD.
I distributed it among my friends.
How was the order?
I think.
It's normal because in 2007, rap might not have been dominant in the Gulf.
But not as famous as now.
We used to talk before the broadcast, for example, in great groups like Balenciaga and Castro.
Shall we talk about the topic?
They said they will organize the party for you.
They covered all the costs and procedures, coordination, and work; honestly, we didn't expect this level.
Honestly, we were surprised and it was a great job,
There was just a bit of pressure because there were no ads and nothing before the concert.
There were no advertisements, nor anything two days before the concert.
We assumed that no one comes because of the short notification.
When we were inside, before the party started
This was a good point.
It means that our voice reaches the families as well, not just the youth.
We thought the idea would attract young people, but...
But at this stage, we discovered that there are many age groups listening to us.
Is there a particular song that the audience likes?
The audience interacts with most of the songs.
Yeah, most of the songs, but there were many songs and we were many.
The whole group
What are words, and how do they address different issues?
We are talking about the current situation.
At least, even if it was *
Even if they spoke, before *
It must be this way.
I mean, there is a rhyme.
We think about every word and try to find better synonyms.
Okay, how many songs do you have? Let's listen to one of them.
One of the songs that you produced
Let's listen to it and see the audience's opinion.
I hope they like the words.
Thank you Ali, I liked the introduction because it includes the name of my program.
This is a KD and DJ MREldoha program
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen
This is KJ Madam Bobo with SKT, very hot on the body.
Don't forget, the show airs at 9:30, everyone must watch.
Produced by Hassan Naama, presented by Shaimaa Al Hammadi
The director is Nasser Al-Maliki, and the guests are the Qatari rap singers, of course.
Because it actually contains the program's name, thank you guys!
I have to applaud you and the people in the control room.
We broadcasted it last night.
And who wrote the words, or are they
Everyone writes their own words themselves.
Because if I had written to Joseph
I don't just write this out of love for singing and passion.
I assume you have to write about the 2022 World Cup, and the Asian Cup, and I assume if you can.
Yes, personally, we are producing a song about this topic.
Well, I don't think he can be official at this stage.
So I assume there must be some national songs.
Through the art of rap
Yeah, actually, today, everyone
We are currently watching the live broadcast.
The cup has arrived and the streets of Doha are decorated.
For the viewers, as we have seen, Doha is decorated to celebrate the Asian Cup.
The relevant authorities have completed all preparations for hosting.
And there will be more crowding.
I assume they will gather on the side of the corniche.
I am sure they are ready to host this important sporting event.
Are there any parties in the coming days?
There is an offer from an official party, and they promised us that they will organize a party for us.
But, nevertheless, there are some complications.
The procedures and some problems, so we are not sure.
Let's try, if I meet Youssef and see
Some of them, I have a song topic,
If we find that it suits the song
And the possibility of implementing it
When I am at home
And then send it to Youssef by email.
This part of the song is for Youssef
Is there also something else, are you traveling abroad?
In this field, they have millions of fans.
Don't try to imitate, but listen to the people who are advanced in this field.
We just try to be competitive.
So why don't we take some ideas and imitate certain things?
But on the contrary, I take the idea and apply it in a different way in my song.
The one who founded a band and has more than one CD
A person named Abdullah Al-Daleel
He has the experience and ability to discover groundwater.
This talent is the ability to discover groundwater reservoirs.
One of the residents of the city of Marat
There are many experts.
Those who determine groundwater before drilling
This requires or it might be possible to dig some wells in places where there is no water.
With the help of copper rods and pomegranate branches
Or the fig, through which he can determine the locations of water tanks
What tools are used?
To discover groundwater
That was in ancient times.
But now, it has been replaced with copper rods.
So we put the two sticks side by side.
And he walked slowly
We notice, when we walk along the watercourse
The sticks will open.
Now, we are passing over a flowing water stream.
It opens this way
When we pass it, it starts
Right now we are in the middle of a water stream.
And here, it will be the middle
In this way, we can determine the path of the water, or the groundwater in the earth.
The process is repeated multiple times in more than one location to find the most intense site.
Abu Ibrahim confirmed
Reaching an advanced stage in this profession
So that his discoveries are very accurate
In Marat, outside Marat, in Shaqra, Huraymila, and Athitha
More than one hundred and fifty wells have been discovered.
The error rate does not exceed five percent.
It requires training, experience, and a talent from God.
It surpasses modern equipment and laboratories.
In a short time
Abdulrahman Al-Murshid
Doha Morning Program
Marat Town, northwest of the capital of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh
We watched this report and promise you more reports from Arab and international countries.
And the Gulf countries, God willing
We have reached (()) and different titles but they have
Meaningful
I assume there is a large group of Gulf youth in the Gulf.
Are there specific people you follow, for example?
You follow instead of imitating.
There is generally a connection among all Gulf rappers.
Not a contest, I mean if I produced a song
Who addresses a specific topic
We can call it a meaningful competition.
We have relationships, but there is no one like me.
In Saudi Arabia, there is Qusai, God willing. He is
He has fans and a CD.
Many companies want to rely on him.
Do you wish to reach this stage, perhaps even surpass it more and more, God willing?
We wish you all the best through this band.
There, upon receiving the cup, let's watch some footage of the corniche.
In addition to a group of Qatari youth
This, even if borrowed from the West, is in the Gulf style.
There are also love rap songs and a distinctive band consisting of twenty-five people.
It's important that we follow up with you to know how you're doing.
So suppose you have an email, a website, or a forum.
How can people get in touch with you?
We had our own website.
But there were some problems with the hosting company.
He would sometimes shut down without clear reasons.
We faced many problems and eventually shut it down.
There's no use, the site will definitely shut down.
So, what should we do, what are the alternatives, to solve this problem?
The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and even Morocco and Egypt
You need to contact them to know the latest news and the songs that are released from time to time.
So what's the alternative now?
Currently, we rely on special pages such as
Under what name
Okay, when you search for our name on Google
Qatar rapper or Qatar rap singer
You can make your own special music video.
As for the program, I worked on it yesterday.
We uploaded many videos on YouTube.
Songs with pictures
Song and the same thing, with pictures
I think we need to see you improve more.
You need a place that brings you all together instead of each person having equipment at their own home.
Mixer, piano, computer, and guitar
Honestly, I hope we find support.
For example, a company
CD Production
And he allocated a special place for us.
We work on our own account
At the end of the day, we are still working on ourselves.
We don't want this.
It is different from what Youssef said.
We need a video clip
And album
Videos make the song spread quickly
Conveys ideas faster
If there is support, everything else comes in the end.
And your beautiful voice is everywhere
It is a type of art that deals with various issues and problems.
Thank you, Youssef Al-Nuaimi and Salman Al-Abdullah, for your attendance.
Let's watch it and wish them all the success in the name of our program, guys.
These projects were, yes
There is also a project that is almost ready but needs some technical development.
Expiration date
When you go to the checkout, you already have the total and all the details.
It recognizes the goods, instead of reading the components of each item.
And you walk with the cart
It is attached to the cart, so that one can choose the material they want.
Most projects reflect the children's sense of the problem.
He has many activities and goals.
The center offers a range of programs and activities that focus on a single main idea.
We have ten goals set by Her Highness Sheikha Moza when she founded the center.
Maybe later, what?
The one who transfers directly to the underground train from his home
But the idea is that it is intended for clothes.
All the shops in Qatar that sell t-shirts will appear
It could also be with the car key, press the button.
He identifies the things I lost and takes me to the key.
Yes, let's get back to the projects that the center will be working on.
Which is early childhood education
Skills Development and Talent Adoption
Therefore, depending on the different skills of the children, the means, and research skills vary.
Personal skills, such as public speaking, persuading the audience
Skills vary, and we have developed a special program to serve them.
We started with Future Media, we were excellent in this project, we reached the end, the project graduated.
We also obtained numbers of children and young speakers.
And their creativity...
Do you have young presenters?
For television, it is important that they broadcast programs for children.
We prepare them for television.
Through their television, Qatar Television
We prepare them so that they reach the age of eighteen years.
We welcome them wherever they are.
And this is the national television.
We need to attract, discover, and develop these talents.
Whether media or research
Intellectual Dimensions
Reading and various other fields
Is there cooperation? Do you exchange ideas?
In all fields, such as the Promising Orators Program sponsored by the Ministry of Awqaf
Our exhibition, the Generation Exhibition is also
The Scientific Club played an important role in improving projects as well as in technical support.
The main role was played by the Higher Education Council, through supporting schools and partners.
Professor Abdullah, moving to a building like Katara,
Which also includes a variety of activities and clubs
Do you consider this a step forward towards more success?
Next to moving to a separate building
Regardless of the very large place
And it makes dealing with the public easier
They are pioneering and excellent projects.
Welcoming the guest and introducing him to the programs offered for the child
This is our main project for the next three years.
National Reading Development Project
Under the patronage of Sheikha Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
She adopted this project and supported it.
This is a big project, focusing on developing reading, story writing, and child development.
Different cultural skills specifically related to reading
Because it is definitely in different programs
We moved recently.
And we are reorganizing some activities
Designed and optimized to suit Katara visitors
We wish you success through this center.
The one that contains very important ideas
First, I would like to thank you for the hospitality.
The most important thing is, the more we interact with children, the more we discover that
Today's childhood is different from our childhood.
They need more care, attention, and time.
Listen to his interests and imagination
Mentally communicate with him
They .. %pw, the way they treat their kids like a hotel, providing them with accommodation
Or like the bank, it provides money
Children really need someone who listens to their ideas and imagination.
In the past few days, they transported us to two thousand and thirty.
In this exhibition
I wish success to the winning projects
Thank you for being with us, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. We wish you success.
So that these projects come true and do not remain a dream forever
Welcome ladies and gentlemen, the Children's Culture Center launched last night at the Diplomatic Club.
Closing Ceremony of the National Future Generations Dreams Exhibition under the slogan "Generation Dreams, Realities or the Nation of Tomorrow"
Organized on the occasion of Qatar National Day, with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar
There were many activities and several competitions at the exhibition.
Creative projects for children
We welcome Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. Good morning and welcome.
Good morning, my dear sister
First of all, I would like to thank you for the time you dedicated to us.
Let's talk about this exhibition; it is truly one of a kind.
We are happy to have you with us in the program to cover as many events of the exhibition as possible.
This is the National Exhibition of the Generation's Dreams
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, this exhibition
With the contribution of the Children's Cultural Center
To celebrate National Day
Who was*
In an attempt to stabilize the children
Living a dream
With the project
This project or dream
Children's imagination is very vast.
We set it for twenty thirty.
And other key areas in Qatar National Vision 2030
We started training the children in four stages.
Then, when you think about the brainstorming mechanism and the tools that expand the scope of thinking
What exactly do you mean by this sentence?
Is it the facts or the nation of tomorrow?
I mean, no matter what the child dreams today
It grows with the growth of the project.
In fact, this was the true interpretation of the vision: the children will live from today.
With a big dream
Whether environmental, health-related, human development, or any other field
Those who serve the country
I think when we know that there are children somewhere
Or in a specific exhibition
All that was available through
At the exhibition, there were also guest of honors.
Children learn from them, like old models.
Yesterday, two or three days ago, there was the *
There were also winners of various awards in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a schedule to showcase their projects.
Yes, and the pictures are the best proof of what you are saying.
This is a collection of photos of the exhibition and various activities.
Here is the last project owner, the forest
And also, we want to talk about the colored ball.
This is a very smart idea, we can simplify it for the viewers, this is one of the children's innovations.
What exactly is this topic, the colored ball, let's talk about it
Suddenly, there are four or five projects addressing this topic, one of which is the colored ball.
And they call it the smart stadium after
As soon as the ball goes out of the field
Colors differ
I assume in the future, this will help a lot in matches.
And what else, after all these dreams?
And it is related to things concerning his field of interest.
I especially assume this when there are responsible people who take these small projects from small minds into consideration.
We just don't know at all, maybe these projects will benefit us. What does the head of the Football Association think?
Think about the idea of the colored ball
Does he like it?
He often visited projects related to football.
We supported and adopted these projects as soon as we saw them.
He also adopted these projects.
What our children did, people also voted on many projects.
Okay, what were the projects that were present in the place and that people voted for the most?
There is an evaluation committee that has a method for assessing projects.
The first, second, and third projects that won the awards
The forest, won the first prize
He was very precise in the project details, and the project was ready for submission.
Of course, it requires many administrative elements,
There were very detailed specifics in the booklet that was distributed to the visitors,
Surely these are the pictures we see now
These are some of the big projects.
Maybe they are trying to do what they see in movies and cartoons.
Actually, part of it is approved by the institutions.
For example, let's call them projects, what are these projects?
Collects, uses, and recycles it
From two hundred and forty-seven students
Qatar University celebrated yesterday the graduation of two hundred and forty-seven students from the thirty-third batch.
His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, Minister of State for International Cooperation
A large number of residents and faculty members
The university is celebrating today the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen female students.
We would like to thank our colleague Salman Al-Mujaddid and remain in the same artistic atmosphere. Today we have a very dear guest.
From the Silsila Tasaneef family, the actor Abdel Hamid Al-Shershani
He established himself through many works such as Hearts for Rent,
They put in their utmost effort to establish themselves in the artistic field.
Especially since the field of art does not tolerate flattery.
Which means
Thank you and good morning, and I would like to say good morning to the viewers.
No, I admire the program's crew and
We will watch a very short scene from one of your works, and then we will start talking with you.
Are you mocking me?
Take the fake bisht and bring the original.
Spirit and pocket.
You have the cloak, you will return it.
What? Give me the best, return it to me! How can I return it?
The goat has already ground it in her stomach, damn it.
I am a member of a committee consisting of five members.
In the Higher Committee of the Conference.
I will not agree with you.
I have no objection.
This is a quick glimpse, a very short part of the Tasaneef series, of which we will see the second part.
We would like to ask you about your participation this year in the second part.
Can you tell us about your segments in the anthology series, where each episode has a different topic?
What is your participation? Can you tell us about it?
Of course, later.
I was passing by a mart at that time.
Marat Mashhoor is also known for the mountain.
The quantity that poets have celebrated throughout time.
When history is a witness and remains in the memory of cities,
It shows how ancient its history is.
Which is located one hundred and seventy kilometers north of the capital Riyadh.
Some believe that it was named after Imru' al-Qais al-Tamimi.
It is characterized by its ancient ruins, the sweetness of its water, and the purity of its air.
The poets were inspired by him and were fascinated by him. He was famous for the renowned Mount Komit.
They call it the Valley of Kameet.
Of course, Marat is an old city.
Founded before Islam
There were old things with unknown dates, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
What we are in right now.
The companion of the Prophet, Khalid ibn al-Walid, may Allah be pleased with him, ordered the digging of this well during the time of the Ridda wars.
Still remaining until now.
The proverb says "A guarantee is a handful," and I guarantee you times over.
If you see a comet, you might see it twice.
Among the other landmarks is the Kemit Valley.
What I have done streaming over the years.
It was enough for the city for a whole year,
From the beginning of the rainy season until the next rainy season.
The date of establishment of these monuments is unknown.
There is also the bride, and there is.
Jabal Kuimat is one of the landmarks of the city of Marat.
There was a lot of proverb built on this mountain, poetry and poems.
Many people from different regions in the kingdom visit it.
One of its important landmarks is the Walidi Well.
This is because he stayed several times during the Ridda wars and was on his way to Yamama.
He camped there and ordered the men to dig this well.
Some people still drink from the water and wash with it.
Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned in the Dictionary of Countries that Khalid passed by Marrah.
It is an old house made of clay and has been restored in a manner similar to its original state.
It consists of different sections that reflect the architecture, heritage, and monuments of the region.
The poet once said about her: "When we reached the water, the water of Majan"
We encountered the Kemit Valley, not the Angel Valley.
Mr. Ayman, God willing, there will be cooperation between the family, the guardians, the center, and also the child.
And I believe there are different ways he can be with you at the same time.
In general, to run the training process.
Since anyone who comes to us, whether the trainee, the student, or the child,
This record contains his complete personal information.
Even his monthly grades, for example, every month he has an evaluation.
We were responsible for the Minds program.
There is a report every four sessions.
The guardian through a password and username,
We gave it to him, can he reach it?
Yes, he can see the level he has reached, from the day he registered at the center until now.
Yes, we have different models that we look at.
We have a daughter
With Mr. Ibrahim who will join us later,
We see different models; I wish we had enough space.
Nevertheless, we brought a girl model.
He tries different tests before going on air.
We will ask her questions in mathematics and different types of questions.
We will take a short break and then come back to you to see this smart girl, stay with us.
%Pw The actor's performance, the audience has become very smart now.
If any show caught his attention from the first, second, or third episode, and if he feels he is not interested in the show, he will use the remote.
He won't bother himself, he has twenty thousand second series.
Correct, twenty thousand chains, that's right.
Twenty thousand episodes. Some people don't focus on just one job.
He can see the other works.
That's right, this is the majority.
He says that I only watch TV during Ramadan.
Of course, we warmly welcome you with us, our dear and highly honored guest, Abdel Hamid Al-Sharshani.
Do you want to say something to the viewers, or to your fans who love you? Of course, I am one of your fans.
Do you want to say something?
And I say to them, may you find each year in good health and well-being.
It's true that we don't go out much, we don't appear much, and we don't act much, and the reason I mentioned before.
What’s coming will be better.
God willing, we wish you all the success in your work this year.
God willing, we will have a second interview with you so that we can talk about these plays.
Everything leads to the other.
Because fashion shows are very popular among many people and are eagerly anticipated by trend enthusiasts.
Welcome, dear viewers, to Doha Morning, and we are live with you.
Of course, today we are talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of students who have been registered at this center.
This center offers a diverse range of different sciences,
Of course, they focus on developing the other capabilities,
And also to make their minds work fully.
Ms. Nesma and Mr. Ayman Khalajli, Executive Director of the Skills Development Center.
Hello and good morning.
Welcome to us.
And with us today is the beautiful Omnia, good morning Omnia.
Good morning.
How old are you, dear?
I am in the seventh grade.
Masha'Allah, we wish you all the best.
What are the things we provide for our sons and daughters?
This was clarified with Mr. Ayman and Ms. Nesma and was specifically directed for the benefit of the children, our children.
Mental Arithmetic Minds Program,
Through fingers and abacus.
To achieve some specific goals, we tried to present a small part of them.
Did you feel, Mr. Ibrahim, that there is really a difference in the student during his first two days?
And after it is completed, maybe three or four months?
Whether he teaches in public, private, or even independent schools,
Basically, the program operates scientifically on specific methods.
After you pass the first level of the program,
Those that show lost potentials or that need to continue being developed
Has he reached a certain level, or what updates have happened to the child?
So we work in a scientific way, a scientific program
Not some methods and mechanisms that are applied in a usual way;
But in a scientific and systematic way.
Before the start of the program and after completing this course or the levels he succeeded in.
Mr. Ibrahim is now with us, as you can see, our viewers, Omnia is a student who registered at this center.
We wanted to do this directly today, to show you, our viewers, the importance of these things.
If the cloak is returned, I have no objection.
This is a very quick paragraph and a small part of the series of classifications, of which we will see the second part.
But as we have seen, this is part of the series of classifications of the first part.
Can you tell us a bit about your roles in the series "Tasaneef," where each episode has a different topic?
This year, focus on what will happen.
Negligent, virtuous
Those who encourage by giving opportunities
Sixteen episodes in two categories.
There will be a director in one episode, an episode that will feature an old man, and an episode that will feature a baker.
It is a collection of episodes.
Mr. Ghanem Al-Saliti from Qatar.
We have actors from Qatar.
Many actors I can't remember right now. Of course, we have actresses from Bahrain like Zahra Araft, Ibtisam Abdullah.
We have
Factions of Rashid and Muhammad Adel.
Tara, of course
Without Tara, the young actors will not perform.
Currently, we have little work in Qatar. There are two jobs per year.
Qatar TV also produces drama works; can we say a bit more as well?
Qatar Television provides an executive product.
Qatar TV channel made an effort, but there was only one job that year and all the actors in Qatar want to work.
And this was the reason.
I replied to you. It's just one series and all the Qatari actors want to work on it.
If someone visits a shrine, they must thank God.
Praise be to God for everything.
So let's go back to your beginnings.
Of course, I want to thank him a lot.
I consult him on various matters.
Of course, the actor Abdulaziz Jassim is one of the judges of humans, after the confusion even yes or no.
In his plays, we started working with him in theater when he became the first executive producer. Abdulaziz Jassim, we worked with him in television and theater.
He is the one who conceived us, taught us, and made us.
Then, Mr. Ghanem got into the story of his life and did his best in Faiz Al-Toush 2000.
Because it gives us opportunities as young people.
They have between thirty and thirty-two working days per year.
We have two jobs a year, so thank you, thank you, Tara.
The Killer Feeling is also produced by Tara Arts.
The series director is Mr. Munir %PW.
We are back, dear viewers, and today we are talking about reflexology.
The message is on the palm, the palm of the hand.
This treatment was indeed practiced since ancient times.
We have a guest.
The inspection method is as follows.
Swelling, pain level.
You can feel inside the hand that there is something like sand or broken veins inside the hand.
Extend your hand.
My friend's nerves are tense.
You feel pressure and a little = tension, tension.
The left side.
Now, dear viewers, we are examining the left side of his body.
So they know what we are doing.
Any health problem that is clear, we now know about the headache and dizziness that he experiences.
Is there pain here?
Pain means a problem.
Problem! And what does problem mean in this case?

Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of the Public Health Department at the Supreme Council of Health, will talk more about that.
Good morning, Sheikh.
Let's start with a look at these activities.
Healthy Steps Program Towards Qatar
Is the program part of the national strategy for the treatment and prevention of obesity?
About four of the top countries in the world in terms of obesity are from the Gulf countries.
We started a strategy at the Supreme Council of Health, of course in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and other authorities to combat obesity.
They are afraid of it spreading more and more soon.
One of the programs for protection against obesity is Healthy Steps Towards Qatar.
We can organize this competition together, so it becomes an international competition.
The program consists of six weeks.
Every week is different from the next week.
To raise awareness among seventh and eighth grade students about the importance of health at this age,
Because this is the first stage in which they become self-aware.
In the first week, as you remember, the topic was about what your favorite fruit is?
The second week is walking.
You have to walk! Every time you walk, he gets points.
This is a map of Qatar, and every time someone earns points, they move forward and their schools move ahead, and their recipe moves.
A beautiful competition arises among the students.
In the second week, Mai drinks, we don't want him to drink soda.
We tell him to drink water, there's no need to drink all that soda every time he feels thirsty, drink water!
After that, in the fourth week, your favorite sport.
There are some games at school that some of them do not like,
We are looking for a sport he loves,
So that we can force him to exercise.
The child is eating a healthy meal
And his family knows that they must make their child eat a healthy meal.
Al Jazeera Academy is an academy for girls and boys, so that we can take.
Of course, this is a prototype, and with its success, God willing, we will gain more experience in the coming years.
The students are happy and feel more energetic,
We need more games, we had a lot of fun with our colleagues.
The girls say their skin has gotten better now, the pimples have decreased.
That's right, that's right, and it becomes awareness.
Parents know about their children.
And their classmates in the different grades ask them, "How are you?" and they learn from their classmates.
Praise be to God, it is starting to spread that many schools are excited to participate next year from now.
God willing
Qtel was the official sponsor in supporting this.
We had the Aspire Zone, which provided sports competitions and awareness.
On on on on the dining table.
So praise be to God for the presence of many official bodies, some of which I have mentioned and some I have forgotten.
But thank God everyone contributed a part.
And secondly, the brothers used to do it in the form of separate lessons, a curriculum, or
There was diversity.
We tried to make different types and involve as many people as possible.
It is the next generation.
To spread this experience or expand it as much as we can in Qatar.
When you settle down, there are things you must fix,
After it has now spread and achieved satisfactory results,
God willing, we will spread out because some people are asking us why we weren't present.
You eat, all healthy food and you get it, you have no problem.
When it happens at this age, when it starts from a young age, he will reach what he wants by the age of twenty or twenty-five.
Your happiness mentioned a group of titles, each group had a title.
If we go back, we will try in our paragraph today to be about the conclusion of the events,
And when we mentioned the people a second time in our program, we had more than one presentation.
Let's review what the information was for each week that we want to convey to the student.
Okay, the first thing, of course, the first week is your favorite fruit.
Each lesson was about fruits and their benefits.
What are the benefits of fruits that contain vitamin C?
He began to like some fruits, not all fruits are his enemies.
He might be allergic to one or two, but why doesn't he eat the rest?
The second week is walking. People think that walking is only for the elderly and wonder why young people walk.
It means when I grow up, I will walk;
On the contrary, you walk because it puts your mind and thoughts at ease.
It relaxes the individual, meaning it clears the mind and improves it.
I took the students on outings.
Yes, they were all required to walk whether at home or at school.
They record their points through the class teacher.
Which they used to walk daily.
There was an event, some people organized a procession, and the girls' school organized a procession.
Their prophet would like this, creative with unique ideas.
The spirit of competition and teachers need to think differently; we don't want them to give ideas that they must strictly adhere to.
Everyone has their own skill in this matter.
Of course, the third week is about drinking water. All the time, we try to make them drink water so they don't feel thirsty and don't crave soda.
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite sport.
If we could find out his favorite sport and support him in it,
He is interested in sports.
Their love for sports through practicing it; he plays sports unconsciously.
We previously said that we are talking about the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Society.
Let me welcome our guest for today's episode who is with us in the studio.
Thank you.
We are happy to have you here at this presentation.
And part of it is this disease that some of us may not have heard of.
At the beginning, as the Egyptians say, we will go straight to the point.
It is a chronic disease
That which affects the nervous system in a person's body.
The period between twenty to forty years.
This disease still has no cure, and the cause of suffering from this disease is unknown.
It affects the active segment of society, which is usually the youth.
Treatments used for cancer patients, may God protect you from any harm or other diseases.
This disease is an infection of the brain nerves and spinal cord nerves.
What is the central nervous system in the human body?
The body assumes that a foreign object enters the body.
A nerve cell is
Insulation of this wire.
White blood cells or leukocytes begin to kill or dissolve this insulating layer.
Which leads to the failure of the nerve signal to reach, weakness, or interruption.
Leads to paralysis, may God protect you.
No, despite the development and progress in medicine, there is still no treatment for this disease.
Okay, change the solution, we want to know how to get it.
Also, the person must have protection from this.
Is the main reason for this the quality of life, the nature of the food, or the pace of life?
Or what is the exact direct cause that leads a person to suffer from this disease.
Everything we have now are just theories.
Even through marriage.
They try to solve the health problems that humans have.
Yes, yes.
All these topics can be somewhat controversial in society.
Until now, we do not know the reasons.
Okay, the age group that might have this disease, multiple sclerosis.
Of both genders.
Of course, after forty years, the illness begins to calm down with the person.
Until now, we haven't been able to find a cure for this disease.
Is this evidence of the presence of many people in the Gulf, the Arab world, or let's talk about Qatar.
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, statistics say they have twenty-five thousand cases.
And also Qatar.
Recently, just last week, I was told about three to four diagnosed cases.
Currently, we have one hundred and twenty-five patients; this is recorded in the files.
Many people, when they are diagnosed with this disease, go to other countries for treatment.
Okay, Mr. Abdulaziz, are there any symptoms like those experienced by someone with this disease?
Are there any signs that indicate to the patient's family or the patient themselves that they have multiple sclerosis?
And this virus, for example, kills.
We need to be clear about this, this is not a virus.
Due to nerve disease, the nerves control the entire body.
When giving a specific reason for a particular place, type of food, or lifestyle.
