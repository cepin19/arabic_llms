After this, the family lineage continued. Yakinia was the father of Shaltiel. Shaltiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud. Abiud was the father of Eliakim. Eliakim was the father of Azor.
Ishor was the father of Zadoq. Zadoq was the father of Achim. Achim was the father of Eliud.
Eliud was the father of Eleazar. Eleazar was the father of Matthan. Matthan was the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was Mary's husband. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
There were 14 generations from Abraham to David. There were 14 from David until the Jews were forced to go to Babylon. And there were 14 from that time until the Messiah. Jesus Christ was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about. His mother Mary and Joseph were engaged to be married. But before they began living together, it became clear that she was going to have a child. She was pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit.
Her husband Youssef was a pious man. He did not want to disgrace her in front of people. Therefore, he decided to divorce her quietly.
But while Joseph was thinking about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. The angel said to him, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary into your home as your wife. The child in her is from the Holy Spirit.
He is going to have a son. You must name him Jesus. Because he will save his people from their sins.
All this happened to fulfill what the Lord said would happen. He said it through the prophet,
The virgin will give birth to a son. She will bear a son. And they will call him Emmanuel." (Isaiah 7:14) The name Emmanuel means "God is with us."
Joseph woke up. The king of the Lord's command came to him. He took Mary to his house, his room.
But he didn't talk to her even after she gave birth to a boy. And Yusuf named him Isa.
The wise men visited Jesus
The birth of Jesus took place in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened while Herod was king of Judea. After Jesus was born, wise men came from the East to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the boy who was born to be the king of the Jews? When we were in the East, we saw his star. Now we have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard about this, he hurried a lot. Even all the people in Jerusalem were upset.
Herod summoned all the chief priests of the people. He also called the teachers of the law. He asked them where the Messiah was going to be born.
In Bethlehem in Judah," they answered. "This is what the prophet wrote. He said,
But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah. From you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel. (Micah 5:2)
Afterwards, Herod secretly called the wise men. He learned from them exactly when the star appeared.
He sent them to Bethlehem. He told them, "Go! Look carefully for the boy. When you find him, bring me news. So I can go and worship him too."
After the wise men heard the king, they went on their way. The star they saw when they were in the East went ahead of them. And in the end, it stopped above the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt and worshiped him. Afterwards, they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by a different route. Jesus' family settled in Egypt.
The wise men left, and Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel from the Lord appeared to him. The angel said to him: "Get up! Take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return. Herod is going to search for the child. He wants to kill him."
Joseph stood up. At night, he walked to Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They stayed there until King Herod died. And those words that the Lord spoke through the prophet were fulfilled. He said: "I have chosen to bring my son out of Egypt." (Hosea 11:1)
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. He became very angry. He gave orders concerning Bethlehem and the surrounding area. Children who were two years old or younger had to be killed. This was in accordance with the time when the wise men saw the star.
In this way, the words that the prophet Jeremiah said were fulfilled. He said,
You hear a voice in Ramah. It is the sound of weeping and deep sorrow. Rachel is crying out for her children. She refuses to be comforted, because they are gone. (Jeremiah 31:15) The family of Jesus returns to Nazareth
After Herod died, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel from the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Get up! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who wanted to kill the child are dead."
So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother Mary, and returned with them to the land of Israel.
But later he heard that Archelaus was the king of Judea. Archelaus was ruling his father Herod's place. This made Joseph afraid to go there. And after they came in a dream, Joseph returned to the land of Galilee.
He was a resident of a city called Nazareth. And this is what the prophets said about Jesus came true. They said, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way
In these days, John the Baptist came and preached in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent from your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the one the prophet Isaiah was talking about. He said, "A messenger is calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord. Make straight paths for him.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made from camel hair. He was wearing a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People came out from Jerusalem and from all of Judah. They came even from the entire region beyond the Jordan River.
They confessed that they had committed sins, and John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath of God?"
The fruit of repentance has resulted, so be certain that you have been forgiven for your sins.
Don't think you can say to yourself, 'Ibrahim is our father.' I'm telling you, God can create children for Ibrahim even from these stones.
The axe is now under the tree roots. All the trees that do not produce good fruit will be cut down. And they will be burned in the fire.
I baptize you with water, and I call on you to repent from your sins. But after me, one stronger than me will come. And I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
He holds the fork in his hand to clear the straw from his study place. He will gather his wheat in the store. But he will burn the straw with a fire that never goes out." Issa baptized
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan Valley. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to stop him. He said to Jesus, "I need you to baptize me. Why did you come to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be this way now. It is right for us to do this. You are fulfilling God's holy plan." Afterwards, John agreed.
When Jesus was baptized, he came out of the water. At that moment, the heavens opened. Jesus saw the Spirit of God descending upon him like a dove.
A voice from the sky said, "This is my son, and I love him. I am very happy with him."
Issa is boasting
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert. There the devil tempted him.
After 40 days and 40 nights without eating, Jesus was hungry.
The devil came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to turn into bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city. He left him standing on the highest point of the temple.
"Unless you are the Son of God," he said to him, "throw yourself down. It is written, 'The Lord will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'" (Psalms 91:11, 12)
Jesus answered, "It is also written, 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"Unless you bow your head and pave the way for me," he said, "I will give you all of this."
Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan! It is written, 'Worship the Lord your God. He is the only one you must worship.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
After the devil left Jesus, the angels came and took care of him. Jesus began to preach.
John was imprisoned. When Jesus heard about this, he returned to Galilee.
Christ came out of Nazareth. He went to live in the city of Capernaum. It was near the lake, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
In this way, what the prophet Isaiah said became a reality. He said,
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! The Galilee, where the non-Jewish people live! The land along the Mediterranean Sea! The soil east of the Jordan River!
The people who are now living in darkness will see a great light. They are now living in a very dark country. But a light will shine on them. (Isaiah 9:1,2)
Since that time, Jesus began to preach. "Repent from your sins!" He said. "The kingdom of heaven is near." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers. They were Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake. They were fishermen.
J. Follow me, Jesus said. I will make you fishers of men.
Immediately open their window and follow him.
From there, he saw two other brothers. They were James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee. While they were preparing their nets, Jesus called them.
They immediately got out of the boat and from their father’s place and followed Jesus. Jesus is healing the sick.
Jesus went throughout all Galilee. There he was teaching in the synagogues. He was preaching the good news of the kingdom of God. He was healing every disease and sickness among the people.
The news about him spread throughout all of Syria. People brought to him everything, those who were sick with various kinds of diseases. Some were suffering from severe pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were trembling violently. And others could not move at all. And Jesus healed each one of them.
They were followed by large crowds. Some people came from Galilee, from the region known as the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region beyond the Jordan River.
Jesus gives blessings
Jesus saw the crowds. He went up a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
And then he began to teach them. He said,
Blessed are those who are spiritually needy. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Congratulations to those who are sad. They will be comforted.
Congratulations to those who are free of arrogance. They will be given the land.
Congratulations to those who are hungry and thirsty for the truth. They will be satisfied.
Congratulations to those who show mercy. May God have mercy on them.
Congratulations to those with pure hearts. They will see God.
Congratulations to those who make peace. They will be called the children of God.
Congratulations to those who suffer because they do what is right. The kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
Congratulations to you from me when they laugh at you and hurt you because of me. Even when you are blessed by me, they say all kinds of bad lies about you because of me.
Be happy and joyful. Your reward in heaven is great. In the same way, people harm the prophets who lived long ago. The salt and the light
You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything. It will be thrown out. People will walk over it.
You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden.
And people don’t light a candle and put it under a bowl. On the contrary, they put it on its holder. Then it lights up everything in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before people. They will see the good things you do. And they will praise your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the full meaning of the law.
Don't think that I came to abolish what is written in the Sharia or by the prophets. I did not come to do that. On the contrary, I came to give the full meaning to what is written.
What I'm going to tell you now is true. The sky and the earth will disappear before the smallest letter of the law disappears. Not even the tiniest stroke of the pen will disappear from the law until everything is complete.
Do not break even one of the least important commandments. And do not teach people to break these commandments. If you do so, you will be called the least important in the kingdom of heaven. Instead of that, practice and teach these commandments. And then you will be called important in the kingdom of heaven.
This is what I am telling you. You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Killing
Have you heard what is said to the people who lived long ago? They were told, "You shall not kill. (Exodus 20:13) Whoever kills will be judged for it."
But this is what I'm telling you. Don't get angry at your brother. Whoever gets angry at his brother will be judged. And furthermore, whoever says to his brother "Raka" must stand before the Sanhedrin. But whoever says "You fool!" will be exposed to the fire of hell.
Imagine you are presenting your gift at the altar. And you think that your brother has something against you.
Place your gift before the altar. First, go and be reconciled with your brother. Then come back and present your gift.
Suppose someone has a right against you and is suing you in court. Resolve the matter quickly. Do it while you are still on the way with them. If you don't, they can hand you over to the judge. The judge can hand you over to the officer. And you could be imprisoned.
What I'm going to tell you now is true. You won't leave until you pay the last dirham! Adultery
Have you heard it said, "Do not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But this is what I’m telling you. Never look at a woman in a bad way. Whoever does that has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. Your eye is just a part of your body. Better to lose it than for your whole body to be tormented in the fire.
If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is just a part of your body. Better to lose it than for your whole body to be thrown into the fire. Divorce
It is said, "If a man divorces his wife, he must give her a certificate of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But this is what I’m telling you. The one who divorces his wife causes her to commit adultery. And the one who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. A man can only divorce his wife if she is not faithful to him. That’s the truth.
Once again, I heard what was said to your people long ago. They were told, "Do not break the covenants you made with the Lord. Keep the oath you swore to Him."
But this is what I’m telling you. Never make promises like that. Don’t make them in the name of God. This is the throne of God.
Do not do them in the name of the land. That is the chair of the foot of God. Do not do them in the name of Jerusalem. That is the city of the great king.
And don't swear by your head. You can't make a single hair white or black.
Let your "yes" mean "yes." And let your "no" mean "no." Anything more than that comes from the evil one. Be kind to others.
Have you heard what is said, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this is what I will tell you. Do not fight with an evil person. "If someone strikes you on your right cheek, show them your other cheek as well."
Suppose someone took you to court to take your shirt. Let them take your jacket too.
Suppose someone forced you to walk one mile. Walk with him two miles.
Give to those who ask you for something. Do not turn your face away from those who want to take something from you on credit. Love your enemies.
Have you heard it said, "Love your neighbor. (Leviticus 19:18) Hate your enemy."
But this is the thing I tell you. Love your enemies. Pray for those who hurt you.
You will become children of your Father in heaven. "He lets His sun rise on both the wicked and the good people. He sends rain on those who do good and those who do not.
If you love those who love you, what prize will you win? Even taxes do that.
To your safety, just mind your own business, what do you do more than others? Even people who have no religion do this.
Be complete, like your father who is in the whole sky.
Giving to people in need
Be careful not to do "good deeds" in front of people. Don't do them so that people see you. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
I help people in need, but I don’t announce it loudly. Don’t be like those who do it just to appear pious. They tell people what they do in temples and on the streets. They want people to honor them. What I’m going to tell you now is true. They have received their full reward.
When you help someone in need, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Your giving will be secret. Your Father will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer
When someone prays, they shouldn't be like those who do it just to appear pious. They want to stand and pray in temples and on street corners. They want people to see them. What I'm going to tell you is true. They have received their full reward.
When you pray, go into your room. Close the door and pray to your Father who is unseen by others. He will reward you. Your Father sees what you do in secret.
When you pray, don't make your speech long like those who have no religion. They think people will listen to them because they talk a lot.
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need even before you ask him.
This is how you should pray. "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
Your kingdom come. Let what you want happen on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, just as we also forgive those who have done wrong to us.
He protected us so that we would not fall into sin when we are tested. We have been saved from the evil one.
People are allowed to forgive you when you sin against them. If you do this, your father in heaven will forgive you too.
But if you do not forgive people for their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins. Fasting
When you finish without eating, don’t frown like those people who do it just to appear pious. They make their faces very sad. They want to show people that they are fasting. What I’m going to tell you now is true. They have received their full reward.
But when you go without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
And afterwards, others will not know that you are spending. Only your father, who does not see it, will know. He is the one who will reward you. Your father sees what is done in secret. Hide the wealth in the sky.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth. Moth and rust can destroy them. Thieves can break in and steal them.
Instead of this, gather for yourselves treasures in heaven. There, moth and rust do not destroy them. There, thieves do not break in and steal them.
Your heart will be wherever your wealth is.
The eye is like the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
But let's assume your eyes are bad. Your whole body will be filled with darkness. If the light inside you is darkness, then it will be a great darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. They will hate one and love the other. Or they will be loyal to one and dislike the other. You can't serve God and money at the same time. Don't worry.
I'm telling you, don't worry. Don't worry about your life and what you're going to eat or drink. And don't worry about your body and what you're going to wear. Isn't there more to life than food? Aren't there things more important for the body than clothing?
Look at the birds of the sky. They do not sow or reap the grains. And they do not store the grains in barns. But your Father in heaven feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are?
Can you add even one hour to your life just by worrying?
And why do you worry about things? Look at how wildflowers grow. They neither work nor do things.
But this is what I'm telling you. Even Solomon, in all his glory, was not dressed like one of these flowers.
But if this is how God dresses the wild grass, won't He dress you even better? In the end, the grass here is only for today. Tomorrow it is thrown into the fire. Your faith is very small!
Don't worry. Don't say, "What will we eat?" or, "What will we drink?" or, "What will we wear?"
People who lack piety chase after all those things. Your Father in heaven knows that you need them.
But let the kingdom of God be the first. Do what He who loves you wants. And then they will give you all of these as well.
Don't worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will take care of itself. Every day has its own problems.
Be fair when judging other people.
Don't judge people. So they don't judge you.
You will be judged in the same way you judge others. You will be measured in the same way you measure people.
You see the little bit of sawdust in your friend's eye. But you don't pay attention to the log in your own eye.
How can you tell your friend, "Let me take the little splinter out of your eye"? How can you say that when you have a piece of wood in your own eye?
You are a liar! First, take the plank out of your own eye. Then you will be able to see clearly to take the splinter out of your friend's eye.
Do not give what is sacred to dogs. Do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do so, they may trample them. And then they may turn and tear you apart. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Whoever asks will receive. Whoever seeks will find. The door will open for the one who knocks.
Suppose your son asked for bread. Which one of you will give him a stone?
And we do not impose the request for a fish. Who among you will give him a snake?
Even if you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
So everything, do with people what you want them to do with you. This is written in the Sharia and in the prophets. The big and small gates
Enter the kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to death and hell. Many people walk on that road.
But the door is small and the path to life is narrow. Only a few find it. A tree and its fruit
Beware of false prophets. They come to you pretending to be sheep. But inside, they are hungry wolves.
You can really know what they are by what they do. Do people pick grapes from the bushes? Do they pick figs from the thorns?
In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit. But the bad tree produces bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit. And a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You know each tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven. Only the one who does what my Father in heaven wants will enter.
Many will say to me on that day, "Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name? Did we not cast out demons in your name? Did we not perform many miracles in your name?"
I will tell them clearly, 'I never knew you. Stay away from me, you who do evil!' The wise and the ignorant building
So, everyone who hears my words and puts them into practice like a wise man builds his house on the rock.
The rain is falling. The water is rising. The wind is blowing and hitting that house. But it didn't fall. It is built on the rock.
But everyone listens to my words and doesn't apply them in life like a foolish man. He builds his house on the sand.
The rain is falling. The water is rising. The wind is blowing and hitting that house. And it falls with a loud noise.
Jesus finished saying all these words. The people were amazed at his teaching.
He acted like someone who had authority. He didn't speak like their Sharia teachers.
Jesus heals a man who had a disease in his skin.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man who had a skin disease came and knelt before Jesus. He said, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
Issa reached out and touched the man. He said to him: "I am ready to do it." "Be pure!" Immediately, the man was healed from his skin disease.
Then Jesus said to him, "Don't tell anyone. Go, show yourself to the priest. Offer the gift that Moses commanded. It will be a testimony for them." A Roman commander with faith
When Jesus entered Capernaum, a Roman officer came to him. He asked Jesus to help him.
"My lord," he said, "my servant stays at home and cannot move. He is suffering a lot."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal."
The leader answered, "Sir, it is not good for me to come to my house. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed."
I am a man in charge. And I have soldiers who obey my orders. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes. I tell that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I tell my workers, 'Do this,' and they do it."
When Jesus heard this, he was very amazed. He said to the people following him, "What I am about to tell you is true. In Israel, I have not found anyone with such strong faith."
I am telling you that many will come from the east and the west. They will take their place at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
But those who think they are kings will be thrown outside, into the darkness. There, they will cry and gnash their teeth.
Afterwards, Jesus said to the Roman officer, "Go! It will happen exactly as you believed." And his servant was healed at that very moment. Jesus heals many people.
When Issa entered Boutros's house, he saw his mother-in-law. She was lying in bed. She had a fever.
Issa touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and seemed to be working with him.
When evening came, many people who were possessed by demons were brought to Jesus. He cast out the spirits with a single word. He healed everyone who was sick.
Here it is so that what the prophet Isaiah said may be fulfilled. He said, "He was pierced for the transgressions we suffered. He bore the diseases that should have been upon us." (Isaiah 53:4) The cost of following Jesus
Jesus saw the crowd that was around him. And he gave his disciples orders to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Afterwards, a teacher of Sharia came to him. He said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have dens, and birds of the sky have nests. But the Son of Man has no place to rest his head."
One follower said to him, "Sir, please allow me to go bury my father first."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Isa walked to the bakery. His students followed him.
Suddenly, a bad storm came over the lake. The waves hit the boat. But Issa was asleep.
The students left and found him awake. They said, "Sir! We are saved! We were going to drown!"
He answered, "Your faith is very small! Why are you so afraid?" Then, Jesus got up and commanded the winds and the waves to stop. The world became completely calm.
The students were amazed. Solo said, "Who is this man? Even the winds and the waves obey him!" Jesus healed two men who were possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived at the other side of the lake in the region of the Gadarenes. Two men possessed by demons met him. They came out of the tombs. The men were so fierce that no one could pass that way.
"Son of God, what do you want from us?" they shouted. "Did you come here to punish us before the time comes for us to be judged?"
Not far away, there was a large herd of pigs eating.
The jinn asked Jesus, "If you don't get us out, we will send you to the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" The demons came out of the men and went into the pigs. The whole herd ran away from the steep bank. They ran into the sea and drowned in the water.
Those who used to raise pigs fled. They went to the city and informed the people about everything. They told the people what happened to the men who were possessed by demons.
Afterwards, the whole town went out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they asked him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who couldn't walk
Isa walked to the ship. He walked to the other side of the lake and came to his city.
Jao had some men and they brought him a man who couldn't walk. He was lying on a mat. Issa saw that they had faith. He said to the man, "Do not lose hope, my son. Your sins are forgiven."
And then some of the Sharia teachers said to themselves, "This man is saying something very bad!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Which is easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven" or "Get up and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he spoke to the man who could not walk. "Get up," he said to him. "Take your mat and go home."
The man stood up and walked to the house.
When people saw this, they were very amazed. They thanked God for giving this kind of authority to the people. Issa chooses when
As Jesus went from there, he saw a man named Matthew. He was sitting at the tax collector's place. "Follow me," Jesus said to him. Matthew got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came. Everyone ate with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this. They asked the disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this. He said, "Those who are well do not need a doctor. It is the sick who need him.
Walk and learn what this means, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) I did not come to call those who think they are friends with God to follow me. I came to call sinners to follow me." Christ on fasting
One day, John’s disciples came. They said to Jesus, "We and the Pharisees fast and do not eat. Why don’t your disciples fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the bridegroom's guests be sad while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. After that, they will fast.
People don't sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. The new piece will pull on the old one. This will increase the tearing.
People do not put the new grapes into old grape skins. If they do, the skins will burst. The grapes will fall, and the skins will be ruined. No, everyone puts the new grapes into new skins. And then both are preserved. A dead girl and a woman suffering
When Issa was saying these words, a man came. He fell to his knees before Issa. He said, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her. Afterwards, she will live again."
Jesus stood up and walked with him. And so did his disciples.
At that moment, a woman came from behind Jesus. She was sick and bleeding. She had had this illness for 12 years. She touched the edge of his clothes.
She thought, "I just shouldn't touch his things. Later, I will get better."
Jesus turned and saw her. He said to her, "Woman, do not lose hope, your faith has healed you." The woman was healed at that moment.
When Issa entered the master's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the crowd that was making noise.
He said, "Walk away. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the people had gone out, Jesus went inside. He took the girl by the hand, and she got up.
The news about what Jesus did became known throughout this whole region. Jesus healed two blind men.
As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him. They shouted, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
As soon as Issa entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I can do this?" They answered him, "Yes, our master."
And then he touched their eyes. He said to them, "What is going to happen to you will be as you believed."
Now they see again. Jesus called out to them loudly, "Make sure that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They wasted it on him all over this area.
When they were going out, they brought another man to Jesus. A demon was controlling him, and he was unable to speak.
When the giant came out, the man roared. People were surprised. They said, "We've never seen anything like this in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He drives out demons by the power of the prince of demons." There are just a few workers.
Jesus walked through all the towns and villages. He was teaching in their synagogues. He was preaching the good news of the kingdom. And he was healing every disease and sickness.
When he saw the crowds, he felt a deep concern for them. They were beaten and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Afterwards, Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is very plentiful, but the workers are few."
The lord of the harvest sends workers to serve his harvest field.
Jesus sends the twelve disciples
Issa called his 12 students to come to him. He gave them the authority to cast out evil spirits and heal every disease and ailment.
These are the names of the 12 disciples. The first two are Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then comes James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
After them come Philip and Bartholomew, as well as Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. The other two are James son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus.
The last two are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas is the one who will later hand Jesus over to his enemies.
Then Jesus called the twelve and gave them these instructions. He said to them: "Do not go to the people who are not Jews." He said to them: "Do not enter any Samaritan town."
A place like that, go to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep.
Wherever she goes, she calls out with this message, 'The kingdom of heaven is near.'
Heals the sick. Raises the dead to life. Restores people with skin diseases to being "clean" again. Casts out demons. You received without payment, give without payment.
Don't carry any gold, silver, or copper in your belt.
Don't take any bag with you when traveling. Don't take extra clothes, shoes, or walking sticks. The worker should be given only what he needs.
Whenever you enter a city or a village, look for someone willing to welcome you. Stay at that person's house until you leave.
Whenever you enter the house, greet the people who live there.
Except your home is spacious with you, give it your blessing of peace. If it is not spacious, do not give it the blessing.
Some people may not welcome you or listen to what you say. If they don't do that, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or city.
What I'm going to tell you now is true. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city.
I send you like sheep among wolves. Now be wise like a snake and gentle like a dove.
Beware! The men will hand you over to the local courts. They will flog you in their temples.
They will bring you to the governors and kings because of me. You will be witnesses against them and against those who are not Jews.
But when they free you, don’t worry about what you will say or how you will say it. At that time, they will give you the right words to say.
It won't be you who speaks. Your father will be the one speaking through you.
Brothers will hand over their brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their children. Children will revolt against their parents and let them be killed.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But those who endure until the end will be saved.
When they attack you in one place, flee to another place. What I am going to tell you now is true. You will not finish passing through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
The student is not better than his teacher. The servant is not better than his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for the servant to be like his master. If the head of the household is called Beelzebub, what can the people living there expect?
Don't be afraid of your enemies. Everything that is hidden will be revealed. Everything that is concealed will be uncovered.
What I tell you in the dark, say it in the daylight. What is whispered in your ear, shout it from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. On the contrary, fear the one who can destroy both the soul and the body in hell.
Aren't two birds sold for just a little money? But neither of them falls to the ground without your father knowing about it.
He counts every single hair on your head!
Don't be afraid. You are worth more than many birds.
What about someone who says in front of people that they know me? I will also say in front of my father in heaven that I know him.
But what am I going to say about someone who says in front of people that they don't know me? I will say in front of my father in heaven that I don't know him.
Don't think that I came to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace. I came to bring the sword.
I came to create "children against their parents." The girls will refuse to obey their mothers. The sons-in-law will be against their mothers-in-law.
"The enemies of a man will be members of his own household." (Micah 7:6)
Whoever loves his father or mother more than me does not deserve me. Whoever loves his son or daughter more than me does not deserve me.
And whoever doesn't carry his cross and follow me does not deserve me.
If he meets his life, he will lose it. If he loses his life because of me, he will find it.
Whoever welcomes you welcomes me. And whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
Suppose someone welcomes a prophet as a prophet. That person will receive the reward of the prophet. And suppose someone welcomes a pious person as a pious person. That person will receive the reward of the pious person.
Imagine someone giving even a glass of cold water to a child following me. What I am going to tell you now is true. That person will undoubtedly be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus taught his 12 disciples. Afterwards, he went to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
Jesus asked him, "Are you the one who was to come? Or should we look for someone else?"
Jesus answered, "Go back to John. Tell him what you hear and see."
Blind people regain their sight. Disabled people walk. Those with skin diseases are healed. Deaf people hear. The dead come back to life. And the good news is announced to the poor.
Congratulations, they are the ones who never gave up on their faith because of me.
When John's disciples went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said to them, "What did you go out to see in the desert? The tall grass moving with the wind?"
If not, what did you go to see? A man wearing nice clothes? No. People who wear nice clothes are in the palaces of kings.
And what did you go to see? A prophet? Yes, I’m telling you, and more than a prophet.
It is written in the Holy Bible. It says, "I will send my messenger before you. He will prepare the way for you." (Malachi 3:1)
What I'm going to tell you now is true. There is no one more important than John the Baptist who was born. But the least important in the kingdom of heaven is more important than him.
From the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power. And strong people cling to it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you are ready to accept it, John is Elia who was supposed to come.
Whoever has ears, let them hear.
What can we compare today's people to? Like the kids sitting in the market shouting at people. They say,
We played the flute for you. But you did not dance. We sang a funeral hymn. But you did not grieve.
From my side, John, no one argues or drinks like you. And people say, 'He has some kind of demon.'
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank like you. And people say, "This man always eats and drinks a lot. He is a friend of tax collectors and 'sinners'." Those who act wisely show that wisdom is true." Cities that do not turn their back on sin
Jesus seemed to be speaking against the cities where he performed most of his miracles. The people there did not change from their sins. He said to them,
How bad it will be for you, Korazin! How bad it will be for you, Bethsaida! Imagine the miracles that were done in you were done in Chorazin and Bethsaida. They would have repented long ago. They would have put on sackcloth. They would have sat in ashes.
But I tell you this. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sour and Saida than for you.
And how are you, Capernaum? Will you be lifted up to the sky? No! You will be brought down to the place of the dead. Imagine the miracles that were done in you being done in Sodom. You would have remained here until today.
But I tell you this. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sodom than for you." Rest is for all who are weary.
Jesus said, "I praise you, Father. You are the Lord of heaven and earth. You have hidden these things from the wise and learned. But you have revealed them to little children."
Yes, Dad. This is what I wanted.
Dad gave me everything. Dad is the only one who knows the boy. And the only ones who know Dad are the boy and the people the boy chooses to let know about him.
Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened. I will give you rest.
They became my servants and learned from me. I am gentle and have no pride. You will find peace for your soul.
My job is easy, and my workload is light.
Isa is the Lord of Saturday.
On Saturday, Jesus went to the grain fields. His disciples were hungry. They began to pick some heads of grain and eat.
The Pharisees saw this. They said to Jesus, "Look! This is against the law to do on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!"
Jesus answered, "Haven't you read what David did? He and his men were hungry.
He entered the house of God. He and his men ate all the holy bread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it.
Didn't you read the law? It says how every Sabbath day the priests in the temple must do their work on that day. But they are not considered guilty.
I'm telling you that what's more important than the structure is here.
The book says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You do not know what these words mean. If you did, you would not accuse people who are not guilty.
The Son of Man is the Lord of the Sabbath.
After he left that place, Jesus went to their synagogue.
There was a man who had a weak and crooked hand. The Pharisees were looking for a fault in Jesus. They asked him, "Does the law allow us to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "What if a sheep of yours falls into a pit on Saturday? Won't you catch it and take it out?
The man is worth more than the sheep! So the law allows us to do good on Saturday.
Then Jesus said to him, "Put out your hand." So he put it out, and it became like new, like the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and devised a plan to kill Jesus. Abdullah Al-Mukhtar
Jesus knew everything about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many people followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But they warned him not to say who he is.
This is to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah. They say,
This is my man. I chose him. He is the one I love. I am very happy with him. I will put myself on him. He will announce to the nations that everything will be fixed.
He won't argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
He will not break a crooked branch. He will not extinguish a weakly burning flame. He will fix everything.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebub
There was a man possessed by demons at Jesus' place. The man was blind and couldn't speak. Jesus saw him. Afterwards, the man was able to speak and see.
All the people were amazed. They said, "Is this the son of David?"
The Pharisees heard this. They said, "This man casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be destroyed. Every city or family divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil were to drive out the devil, he would be fighting with himself. So how could his kingdom stand?
You say I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebub. So by whose power do your people cast out demons? Then, they will be your judges.
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Don't even think about that. How can you enter the house of a powerful man and take only what belongs to him? You first need to tie him up. Then you can steal his house.
Whoever is not with me is against me. Whoever does not gather the sheep with me is scattering them.
This is what I am telling you. Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But evil words against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. This person will not be forgiven neither now nor in the days to come.
If you plant a good tree, its fruit will be good. If you plant a bad tree, its fruit will be bad. You can know the tree by its fruit.
Oh nest of vipers! How can you evil ones say anything good? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
A good man says good words. These words come from the goodness hidden inside him. A bad man says bad words. These words come from the evil hidden inside him.
But this is what I will tell you. On the Day of Judgment, people will have to answer for every word they said without care.
With your words, you will be judged guilty or innocent." The miraculous sign of Younes
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said to him, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
Answer, "The bad people and those who lack loyalty demand a miraculous sign! But only the sign of Prophet Yunus will be given.
Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. Something like this will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.
The men of Nineveh will stand on the Day of Judgment with the people living now. And the people of Nineveh will prove that these people are guilty. The men of Nineveh distanced themselves from their sins when Jonah preached to them. And now there is someone more important than Jonah here.
The Queen of the South will rise on the Day of Resurrection with the people who are alive now. And she will prove that they are guilty. She came from very far away to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And now there is someone more important than Solomon here.
What happens when an evil spirit leaves a man? It passes through dry places looking for a place to rest. But it doesn't find one.
And then he says to me, "I will return to the house I left." When he arrives at this house, he finds it empty. The house is swept and tidy.
And then, the evil spirit goes out and takes with it seven other spirits more evil than itself. They enter and dwell there. That man becomes worse than before. This is how it will be with the evil people of today." The mother of Jesus and his brothers
When Issa was still talking with the group, his mother and siblings were standing outside. They wanted to talk to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and siblings are standing outside. They want to talk to you."
Jesus answered, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Issa showed his students. He said, "This is my mother! These are my brothers!"
Whoever wants to do whatever, my dad in heaven is my brother, my sister, or my mom.
The Farmer's Story
On the same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
Large crowds gathered around him. He boarded a boat. He sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
And then he told them many things using stories. He said, "A farmer went out to plant his seeds.
The seeds scattered on the ground. Some of them fell on the path. The birds came and ate them.
A little bit of seed fell in rocky places, where there wasn't much soil. The plants grew quickly because the soil wasn't deep.
When the sun came out, it burned the plants. They dried up because they had no roots.
The last seed fell among the thorns. The thorns grew and overshadowed the plants.
And some seeds fell on good soil. The yield was 100, 60, or 30 times more than what was sown.
Whoever has ears, let them hear.
Jao has students. They asked him, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
Answer, "I gave you the chance to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. He did not give it to outsiders.
Everyone who has this type of knowledge will have more added to it. In fact, they will have a lot. And if someone does not have this type of knowledge, even the little they have will be taken away from them.
That's why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They see, but they don't see well. They hear, but they don't hear well or understand."
In them, the words of the prophet Isaiah are fulfilled. He said, "You will hear but never understand. You will see but never know what you are seeing."
The hearts of these people have become stubborn. They barely hear with their ears. They have closed their eyes. Otherwise, they could see with their eyes. They could hear with their ears. They could understand with their hearts. They could return to the Lord, and then He will heal them.' (Isaiah 6:9,10)
But your eyes are blessed wherever they look. And your ears are blessed wherever they hear.
What I'm going to tell you now is true. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you have discovered. But they did not see it. They wanted to hear what you hear. But they did not hear it.
Listen! Here is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes. He steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like seeds sown along the path.
And others received the seeds that fell on the rocky places. They are the ones who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.
But they have no roots. Therefore, they only last for a short time. They quickly fall away from faith when problems or suffering come because of the message.
And others received the seed that fell among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the message. But afterwards, the worries of this life and the false promise of wealth choke it. And they prevent it from bearing fruit.
But there are those who found the seed that fell on good soil. They are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They yield 100, 60, or 30 times more than the farmer who planted it." The story of the weeds
Jesus told the crowd another story. "This is how the kingdom of heaven is like," he said. "A man planted good seed in his field.
But while everyone was sleepy, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and the grains started to form. At the same time, the weeds appeared.
Java went to Mr. Diallo, his servant. They told him, "Sir, didn't you plant well in your field? Where did these huts come from?"
"The enemy is the source of this," he replied. "The slaves asked him, 'Do you want us to go and clean the veins?'"
"No," answered the owner. "When you pull the grass, you might pull the wheat along with it."
Let them grow together until it's time for the harvest. At that time, I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will tell them. First, gather the weeds. Tie them in bundles to burn them. Then gather the wheat. Store it in my warehouse." The story of the mustard seed and the yeast
Jesus told the crowd another story. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. Someone took the seed and planted it in a field.
It is smaller than all your seeds. But when it grows, it becomes bigger than all the garden plants. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest on its branches.
Issa told them another story. "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast," he said. "Once, it was put in a large amount of flour. The yeast went through the entire dough."
Issa said all this to the association using stories. He didn’t tell them anything without telling them a story.
Now the words that the Prophet said have come true. He said, "I will open my mouth and speak stories. I will speak about things that were hidden since the day God created the world." (Psalms 78:2) Jesus explains the story of the weeds
Afterwards, Jesus walked away from the crowd and entered the house. His disciples came to him. They said, "Explain to us the story of the grass in the field."
Answer, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the devil.
The enemy who sows them is Satan. The harvest is the Day of Judgment. And the workers are the angels.
The wailers will be uprooted and burned in the fire. This is how the Day of Judgment will be.
The Son of Man is going to send his angels. They will clear out of his kingdom everything that causes sin. And they will get rid of all who do evil.
He will throw them into the burning ball. There, people will cry and grit their teeth.
And then the people will shine like the sun in their father's kingdom. Whoever has ears, let them listen. Stories of the hidden treasure and the pearl
The sky kingdom is like a hidden treasure in a field. When a man found it, he went back and hid it. He was very happy. He went and sold everything he had. And bought that field.
Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls.
A man who was very precious passed away. He went and sold everything he had. And he bought that pearl. The story of the necklace.
Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net. It was cast into the lake. It caught all kinds of fish.
From the nets, the fishermen pulled it out to the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish in the baskets. But they threw away the bad fish.
This is how the Day of Judgment will be. The angels will come. They will separate the people who did wrong from those who did right.
They will throw the bad people into the burning ball. There, the bad people will cry and grit their teeth.
Jesus asked them: "Do you understand all this?" They answered him: "Yes."
He told them, "Every teacher of the law who has learned about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house. He brings out new treasures from his storeroom and puts them before others." A prophet without respect.
Sally Issa is the one who tells these stories. After that, he left from there.
He went to his country and preached. There, he began teaching people in their temple. They were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? Where did he get the power to perform miracles?" they asked him.
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers Jacob, Joseph, Simon, and Judah?
Are all his brothers with us? Where did this man get all this from?
They were not happy with him at all. But Issa told them, "The prophet is not honored in his own country. He is not even respected in his own home."
There were just a few miracles there because they did not have faith.
The head of John the Baptist is severed.
At that time, Herod, the ruler of Galilee and Perea, heard news about Jesus.
He said to those with him, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! And that's why he has the power to perform miracles."
Herod arrested John. They tied him up and put him in prison because of Herodias. She is the wife of Herod Philip's brother.
John Herod used to say, "It's against the law for you to have her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he was afraid of the people, because they believed that John was a prophet.
On Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced for Herod and his guests. He really liked this dance.
He promised her by oath to give her anything she asked for.
Maha said to her, "What do you say?" The girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a large platter."
The king was very angry. But he thought about his promise and the dinner guests. So he told one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod beheaded John in prison.
His head was hit with a big plate and given to the girl. Afterwards, she took it to her mother.
John's disciples took the body and buried it. Afterwards, they went and told Jesus. Jesus feeds five thousand.
Jesus heard what happened to John. He wanted to be alone. He went by boat to a quiet place. The hours passed with this. They followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus reached the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt great compassion for them. He healed their sick.
Around evening, the students came to him. "There is nothing here," they said. "Now it’s late. Send people to leave. They can go buy food from the villages."
Jesus answered, "They don't need to go away. Give them something to eat."
They answered: "We only have five loaves of bread and two fish."
Bring them to me here, he said.
Afterwards, Jesus called the people to sit on the grass. He took the five loaves and two fish. He lifted his eyes to the sky and thanked God. He divided the loaves into pieces. Then he gave them to the disciples. And the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and are full. The students collected 12 baskets of the remaining pieces.
The number of men who ate was about 5,000. The women and children ate as well. Jesus walks on water.
Immediately, he let the students board the boat. He let them go ahead to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. Afterwards, he dismissed the crowd.
After he sent them, he went alone to the side of a mountain to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
The raft was very far from the shore. The waves were hitting it because the wind was blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus went to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were very scared. "This is a ghost!" they said. And they cried from fear.
Immediately Jesus called out to them, "Be brave! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Sir, is that you?" Peter asked. "If it is you, tell me to come to you on the water."
"Come," Jesus said. So Peter got out of the boat. He walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Boutros saw the wind, he got scared. He started to drown. He shouted, "Sir! Save me!"
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and pulled him up. He said to him: "Your faith is very small! Why did you doubt me?"
When they came out of the cave, the wind calmed down.
And after the people in the boat worshiped Jesus. They said, "You truly are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and landed in Gennesaret.
The men who lived there knew Jesus. Afterwards, they sent a message to all the neighboring villages. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
He begged so that only the sick would touch the edge of his clothes. And everyone who touched it was healed.
What makes people "impure"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law from Jerusalem came to see Jesus. They asked him,
Why don’t your students listen to the teachers? Your students don’t wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered, "And why do you not obey God's command? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said, "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
But it makes people say to their parents, "Any help you may have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
So that they do not honor their parents with their gift. It leaves the word of God without effect so that you may follow your own teachings.
Oh, dockers! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said,
These people honor me with their words. But their hearts are far from me.
"Their worship means nothing to me. They only teach human rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Issa called out to the group. He said, "Listen and understand."
What goes into your mouth doesn't make you "unclean." What comes out of your mouth is what makes you "unclean."
Afterwards, the disciples came to him. They asked him, "Do you know that the Pharisees got angry when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are plants that my Father in heaven did not plant. They will be uprooted."
Let them be. The Pharisees are blind guides. If one blind person leads another blind person, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Lina explained this."
"I still don't understand?" Issa asked them.
Didn't you discover? Everything that enters the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you "impure."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. Like murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. As well as theft, bearing false witness, and lying to people.
These are the things that make you "impure." But food without washing your hands does not make you "impure." "Iman, a woman from Canaan"
Jesus walked from Galilee and went to the area of Tyre and Sidon.
There was a woman from Canaan living near Tyre and Sidon. She came to him and reproached him, "Oh Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on me! Some demon is controlling my daughter. She is suffering a lot."
He didn't say a single word. His students surrounded him. They asked him, "Spend it. She's crying behind us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep."
And then the woman fell to her knees in front of him. "Sir! Help me!" she said.
Answer, "It's not right to take the kids' bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Well, sir," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their owner's table."
Jesus answered and said, "Woman, you have great faith! You will receive what you ask for." And her daughter was healed at that moment. Jesus feeds the four thousand
Jesus walked from there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Afterwards, he went up a mountain and sat down.
He gathered a large crowd. They brought to him the blind and those who could not walk. They even brought the disabled, those who could not speak, and many other people. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.
People were amazed. Those who couldn't speak began to speak. The disabled were healed. Those who couldn't walk began to walk. Those who were blind began to see. And that made people praise the Lord of Israel.
Afterwards, Jesus called his disciples to come to him. He said to them, "I feel great concern for these people. They have been with me for three days. They have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry. If I do that, they will become very weak on their way home."
His students answered him. "There is nothing here," they said. "Where can we find bread to feed this large crowd?"
Jesus asked: "How many loaves do you have?" They answered: "Seven, plus a few small fish."
Jesus told the assembly to sit on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks. Then he divided them and gave them to the disciples. The disciples distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were full. Afterwards, the students gathered seven baskets of the remaining pieces.
The total number of men who ate was 4,000. The women and children ate as well.
After Jesus sent the people away, he got into the carriage. He went to the area where no one was nearby.
They ask about Jesus as a sign and a miracle.
The Pharisees and the Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a miraculous sign from heaven.
Answer, "In the evening, she looks up at the sky. She says, 'The weather will be nice. The sky is red.'"
And in the morning she says, "Today is going to be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy." She understands the meaning of what she sees in the sky. But she cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
An evil and treacherous people looking for a miraculous sign. But they will not be given any sign except the sign of Jonah." After that, Jesus left them. The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The students crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to take the bread with them.
"Beware," Jesus said to them. "Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students were talking about this among themselves. They said, "He has to talk like that because we didn't bring the bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said to them, "Your faith is very small! Why are you talking among yourselves about there being no bread?"
You still don't understand? You're not thinking about the five 5000 bills? You're not thinking about how many baskets of coins you collected?
Don't you remember the seven loaves of 4,000? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces were gathered?
How do you not understand? I wasn't talking to you about bread. But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
Afterwards, the students understood that Jesus was not speaking to them to warn them about the yeast used in bread. He was warning them about what the Pharisees and Sadducees were teaching. Peter says that Jesus is the Messiah.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered, "Some say John the Baptist. Some say Elijah. And some say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
But what’s on your head?" he asked. "Who do you think I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ. You are the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Congratulations to you, Simon, son of Jonah! You are not just an ordinary man, this is what you have shown. My Father in heaven has shown you this."
This is what I’m telling you. You are Peter. On this rock, I will build my church. The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.
I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. And what you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Afterwards, Jesus called his disciples so that they would not tell anyone that he is the Messiah. Jesus is talking about his upcoming death.
Since that time, Jesus began to explain to his disciples what was going to happen to him. He told them he had to go to the city of Jerusalem. There, he would have to suffer a lot from the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law. He had to be killed, and on the third day, he would rise from the dead.
Peter, may God Jesus be beside him, began to rebuke him. He said to him: "Impossible, my Lord! This will never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are standing in my way. You are not thinking about the things of God. On the contrary, you are thinking about the things of humans."
Afterwards, Jesus called his disciples. He said to them, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself. He must take up his cross and follow me.
Whoever wants to save their life will lose it. But whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.
What’s the use if someone gains the whole world but loses himself? Or what can he exchange for himself?
The Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father. His angels will come with Him. And He will reward each one according to what they have done.
What I am going to tell you is true. Some of the people standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Changes in the Appearance of Jesus
After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, the brother of James, with him. He went up with them to a high mountain. They were alone.
Under their eyes, their appearances changed. Their faces shone like the sun. Their surroundings became bright like light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, I will make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And they were still talking, the clouds lit up beside them. A voice from the clouds said, "This is my son, and I love him. I am very happy with him. Listen to him!"
When the students heard this, they got very scared. They fell face down to the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said to them: "Get up, do not be afraid."
When they went up, they didn't see anyone except Issa.
They came down from the mountain. On the way down, Jesus told them what to do. "Don't tell anyone what you saw," he said. "Wait until the Son of Man is raised from the dead."
Solo students, "Why do the Sharia teachers say that Elijah should come first?"
Jesus answered, "True. Elijah is supposed to come and renew everything anew.
But I tell you, Elijah has come now. People did not recognize him. They did everything they wanted to do to him. In the same way, they will let the Son of Man suffer.
After the young men, they understood that Jesus was talking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus healed a boy who had a demon in him.
As the crowd gathered, a man came to Jesus. He knelt before Him.
"My Lord," he said, "have mercy on my son. He shakes his head a lot and suffers greatly. He often falls into fire or water."
You brought him to your students. But they couldn't heal him.
"O people, you do not believe and are wicked!" Jesus answered. "How long must I stay with you? How long must I endure you? Bring the boy here to me."
Jesus commanded the evil spirit to come out of the boy, and it came out of him. He was healed at that very moment.
Later, the disciples came to Jesus alone. They asked him, "Why couldn't we drive out the demon?"
Answer, "Because your faith is very small. What I am going to tell you now is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there.' And it will move. Nothing is impossible for you."
<.>
They gathered in Galilee. Afterwards, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men."
They will kill him. On the third day, he will rise from the dead." Afterwards, the disciples were filled with great sorrow. Jesus pays the price of the temple.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. There, those who collected the taxes came to Peter. They asked him, "Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax?"
"Yeah, how are you," he answered. When Boutros entered the house, Issa spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Who collects taxes and fees from the kings of the earth? Do they collect from their own children or from other people?"
"From others," Peter answered. "Then the children don't need to pay," Jesus told him.
But we don't want to upset them. Go to the lake and cast your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. You will find exactly the coin you need inside. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours.
