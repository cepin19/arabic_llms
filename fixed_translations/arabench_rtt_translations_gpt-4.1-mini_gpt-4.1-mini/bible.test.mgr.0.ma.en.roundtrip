Who is the most important person in the kingdom?
At that time the disciples came to Jesus. They asked him, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Issa called out to a small child and brought him over. He made the child stand among them.
Jesus said, "What I am about to tell you is true. You must change and become like little children. If you do not do this, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
Whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Whoever welcomes a small child like me with this name of mine, is welcoming me.
But is there anyone who has calmed down one of these little ones who believe in me from sin? If he did that, it would be better for him to tie a big millstone around his neck and drown in the depths of the sea.
How bad the world will become because of the things that make people commit sins! Things like this must happen. But how terrible is the condition of those who cause it!
If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or one foot than to enter hell with two hands and two feet. In the fire of hell, it always burns.
If your eye makes you sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The story of the lost sheep
Look, don't underestimate any of these little ones. This is what I'm telling you. Their angels in heaven can go at any time to see my father who is in heaven.
<.>
What do you think? Suppose a man has 100 sheep and one of them gets lost. Wouldn't he leave the 99 sheep on the mountains? Wouldn't he go look for the one that got lost?
What I'm going to tell you now is true. If he finds that sheep, he will be happier with that one than with 99 that got lost.
The same goes for your father in heaven. He doesn't want any of these children to be lost. When someone sins against you
If your brother made a mistake against you, go to him. Tell him what he did wrong. Keep it just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won him over.
But what if he doesn't want to listen to you? Now take one or two others with you. The book says, "Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he also refused to listen to the witnesses? Then tell the church. And if even the church refused to listen to him? Then don't treat him as your brother. Treat him as you would someone without religion or who doesn't pay taxes.
What I'm going to tell you now is true. What is closed on earth will be closed in heaven. And what is opened on earth will be opened in heaven.
Once again, this is what I’m telling you. Suppose two of you on earth agree on something you ask for. My Father in heaven will do it for you.
Where two or three people meet in my name, I am there with them." The servant who had no mercy
Peter came to Jesus. He asked, "Lord, how many times must I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.
The kingdom of the sky is like a king who wants to collect all the money that his slaves owe him.
As soon as the king started to act, a man who owed him millions of dollars came to him.
The man couldn't pay. Therefore, his master gave an order. The man, his wife, his children, and everything he had had to be sold to repay what he owed.
The servant fell to his knees in front of him. "Give me time," he asked. "I will return everything."
Sido regretted for him. He forgave him for what he was and let him go.
But afterwards, that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him some money. He grabbed him and started choking him. He said to him: "Pay me what you owe!"
The other servant fell to his knees. He said to him: "Give me time, I will pay you back."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he walked away and had the man thrown into prison. The man will stay there until he can pay back what he owes.
The other slaves saw what happened. This made them very upset. They went and told their master everything that happened.
Afterwards, the master called the first servant. He said to him: "O wicked servant, I have forgiven you all the debt you owed because you asked me."
You shouldn't have mercy on another servant if He hasn't shown mercy to you.
So anger, its master, was handed over to the prison guards. He will be punished until he returns everything he owes.
This is how my father in heaven will treat each one of you if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.
Issa is serious about the divorce.
When Jesus finished saying these things, he left Galilee. He went to the region of Judea on the other side of the Jordan River.
Many fans followed him. They healed there.
They went to the Frisians to try it out. They asked them, "Does Sharia allow a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Did you not read that at the beginning the Creator made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Why will a man leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two will become one." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two, but one. Therefore, a man should not separate what God has joined.
Solo, "Why after Moses was it commanded that a man can give his wife a divorce paper and send it?"
Jesus answered, "Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because you were stubborn. But it was not like that from the beginning.
This is what I’m telling you. The one who divorces his wife and marries another woman is committing adultery. A man can only divorce his wife if she is not faithful to him.
The students said to him, "If this is how the relationship between a man and a woman is, it's better that we don't get married."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those whom it is given to live without marrying can accept it.
Some men couldn't have children because they were born this way. Some were made this way by other people. And others made themselves this way to serve the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can live like this must do it." The little ones come to Jesus.
Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted Him to lay His hands on the children and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Do not stop them. The kingdom of heaven belongs to people like them."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Afterwards, he went from there. Jesus and the rich young man
A man came to Jesus. He asked: "Teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?"
Why do you ask me what is good? Jesus answered. There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, follow the commandments.
"Which one of them?" the man asked. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
Honor your father and your mother.' (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' (Leviticus 19:18)
"I have obeyed all these commandments," said the young man. "What else do I need to do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go sell everything you have. Give the money to those in need. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
As soon as the young man heard this, he went away sad. He was very rich.
Afterwards, Jesus said to his disciples, "What I am about to tell you is true. It is difficult for rich people to enter the kingdom of heaven."
Once again, I tell you, it is hard for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. But it is even harder for the rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the students heard this, they were very surprised. They asked him, "So who can be saved?"
He looked at them and said, "With man, this is impossible. But with God, everything is possible."
Peter answered, "We left everything to follow you! What reward will you give us?"
Jesus said to them: "What I am about to tell you now is true. When everything is renewed, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. And afterwards, you who have followed me will also sit on 12 thrones. And you will judge the 12 tribes of Israel.
Everyone who left their homes, families, or fields because of me will find a hundred times more. And they will also find eternal life.
But many who will be first will be last. And many who will be last will be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The sky kingdom was like a man who had land. He went out early in the morning to hire people to work in his vineyard.
He agreed to give them the usual wage for daytime work. Afterwards, he sent them to Karmo.
Around nine in the morning, he went out again. He saw other people standing in the market doing nothing.
He told them, "You also went to work in the field. I will pay you according to your rights."
They left. "He went out again around noon, and at three o'clock, he did the same thing."
Around five in the afternoon, he went out and found other people standing nearby. He asked them, "Why have you been standing here all day and haven't done anything?"
"Because there is no one working," they answered him. He told them, "You all go ahead and work in the vineyard."
In the evening, the vineyard owner spoke with the person responsible for the workers. He told him, "Call the workers and give them their pay. Start with those you paid last. Then go to those you paid first."
The workers who left around five in the afternoon came back. Each one received the regular daily wage.
When those who dropped out first came, they expected to get more. But each of them was paid the same as a regular day's wage.
As soon as they received it, they started complaining about the owner.
They said: "These people who left only worked for one hour," they said. "We paid them like us. We did most of the work and were under the hot sun all day long."
One of them answered the owner. He said to him, "My friend, I am dealing fairly with you. Didn't you agree to work for the regular daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I wanted to give those I took from you the same payment I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do whatever I want with my money? Do you feel cheated because you gave a lot to other people?
"Those who will be last will be first. And those who will be first will be last." Issa keeps talking about his coming death.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the 12 disciples aside to talk with them.
"We are going to the city of Jerusalem," he said. "The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death."
He will be handed over to non-Jews. People will laugh at him and beat him. They will nail him to the cross. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks a favor from Jesus.
Jesus' mother came to him. Her children came with her. And while she was kneeling, she asked him for a favor.
Jesus asked her: "What do you want?" She said to him: "Promise me that one of my two sons will sit at your right hand in your kingdom. Promise me that the other will sit at your left hand."
Jesus said to them: "You do not know what you are asking." He said to them: "Can you drink the cup of suffering that I am going to drink?" They answered him: "We can."
Jesus said to them, "You will drink from my cup without a doubt. But it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or at my left. These places are for those whom my Father has prepared."
The other ten students heard about this. They became hostile towards the two brothers.
Jesus gathered them together. He said to them, "You know the rulers of the nations. They are the ones who govern their people. Their high officials give them orders."
Don't be like that. On the contrary, whoever wants to be important among you must be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first must be a servant to you.
Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served. On the contrary, He came to serve people. He came to give His life as a ransom to free many people. Two blind men watched.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho. A large crowd was following them.
Two blind men were sitting by the road. They heard that Jesus was passing by. So they shouted, "Our Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The assembly ordered them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted louder, "Oh Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stopped and called out to them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
"Our master," they answered, "we want to be able to see."
Jesus felt great concern for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately, they were able to see. And they followed him.
Jesus entering Jerusalem
When they all approached the city of Jerusalem, they arrived at the house of Faji. It was on the Mount of Olives. Jesus called two of his disciples.
He told them, "Go to the village in front of you. When you get there, you will find a tied donkey. Its foal will be with it. Untie them and bring them to me."
If someone says something to you, tell them the Lord needs them. The owner will send them now.
This happened so that what was said by the Prophet would come true. They say,
Say to the city of Zion, "Look, your king is coming to you. He is gentle and riding on a donkey. Riding on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
The students went and did what Jesus told them to do.
They brought the donkey and its little one. They put their djellabas on them. Afterwards, Issa sat on the djellabas.
A very large crowd spread their coats on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people went ahead of him, and some followed. They all shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest heaven!"
Since Isa entered Jerusalem, the whole city has been in turmoil. People were wondering, "Who is this?"
The crowd answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus drives people out of the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area. He seemed to be driving out all the people who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the people who were exchanging money. Even the chairs of those who were selling pigeons he overturned.
He said to them, "It is written that the Lord said, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you are making it 'a den of thieves.' " (Jeremiah 7:11)
The blind and the people who were disabled came to Jesus in the temple. There, He healed them.
Look at the high priests and the teachers of the law, the strange things they did. They also saw the kids in the temple shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they got angry.
"Do you hear what these kids are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," Jesus answered. "Have you never read in the Scriptures? It says, 'You have made praise perfect through the lips of children and infants.'" (Psalm 8:2)
Afterwards, Jesus went away from the people and left the city for a place called Bethany. He spent the night there. The fig tree is drying up.
Early in the morning, Issa was returning to the city of Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He went to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" Immediately, the tree withered.
When the students saw this, they were amazed. They said, "How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?"
Jesus answered, "What I am about to tell you is true. You must have faith and not doubt. Then you can do like what was done to the fig tree. You can tell this mountain, 'Go and throw yourself into the sea.' And it will be done.
"If you believe, you will receive what you ask for when you pray." The authority of Jesus is questioned
Jesus entered the temple courtyard. While he was teaching there, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. They said to him, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will ask you one question as well. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
Where did John’s baptism come from? Did it come from heaven? Or did it come from people?" They talked among themselves about this. They said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn’t you believe him?'"
But what if we say, "from the men"? We are afraid of people. Everyone thinks that John was a prophet.
They answered Jesus, "We don't know." Jesus said to them, "Then I will not tell you either by what authority I do these things." The story of the two sons
What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first son and said to him, "Son, go work in the vineyard today."
"I'm not going," the boy answered. But later he changed his mind and went.
Afterwards, the father went to the other boy. He said the same thing to him. The boy answered, "I will do it, sir." But he didn't go.
"Which one of the two sons did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, tax collectors and prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God before you."
John, my friend, I showed you the right way to live. And you didn't believe it. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed it. I saw this. But even now, you haven't repented from your sins and you still don't believe it. The story of the rent.
He heard another story. There was a man who had a small piece of land where he planted a vineyard. He built a wall around it. He dug a pit for a grape press. And he even built a watchtower. He rented the vineyard to some farmers. Then he went on a trip.
The harvest time is near, so I sent the kids to the rental. I told them to gather their share of the fruits.
But the renters tightened their work. They hit one of them. They killed another. They threw stones at the third to kill him.
And after the man, he sent other servants to the tenants. He sent more than the first time. And the tenants treated them in the same way.
As for the latter, he sent his son to them. He said: "They will respect my son there."
But the tenants saw the boy coming. They said to each other, "This is the one who will inherit all the owner's property one day. Let's kill him. And then everything will be ours."
They expelled him from the vineyard. Afterwards, they killed him.
Whoever owns the vineyard, what will he do with these grapes?
"These bad people will destroy it," he answered. "And then he will rent the vineyard to other renters. And they will give him his share of the harvest at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read what the Scriptures say, 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. The Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22,23)
This is what I will tell you. The kingdom of God will be taken away from you. And it will be given to people who will produce its fruit.
Anyone who falls on that stone will break into pieces. But the stone will destroy anyone who falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard the stories of Jesus. They knew what he was talking about.
Now they are looking for a way to arrest him. But they were afraid of the people. The people believed that Jesus was a prophet.
The Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus told them more stories. He said,
This is how the kingdom of heaven looks like. A king prepared a wedding dinner for his son.
He sent his servants to the people he invited to dinner. The people told them to come. But they refused.
And then he sent two other workers. He told them, "Tell those I called that my dinner is ready. I have slaughtered my bulls and my fat cattle. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding dinner."
But people did not pay attention. One went to his field. Another went to his work.
The rest were taken by his worker. He treated them badly and then killed them.
The king got very angry. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed these killers and burned their city.
And then the king said to his servants, "The wedding dinner is ready. But those I called were not suitable to come."
Go to the street corners. Call for dinner to anyone you find.
Now people went out to the street. They gathered all the people they could find, whether good or bad. Soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king went to see the guests. He noticed a man who was not wearing wedding clothes.
My friend," Sol said, "how did you get in here without wearing wedding clothes?" The man couldn't find anything to say.
Then the king said to his servants, "Tie his hands and feet. Throw him outside into the darkness. There, people will cry and gnash their teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They made a plan to trap Jesus with his words.
They sent their followers to him. They sent the Herodians with them. "Teacher," they said, "we know that you are an honest man. You teach the way of God sincerely. You don't let anyone tell you what to do or what to say. You don't care how important they are.
Tell us now, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
But Jesus knew their evil plans. He said to them, "O hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
"Show me the coin that people use to pay the tax." They brought him a silver coin.
Ask them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words are these?"
"Caesar's," they answered him. Then he said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's. And give to God what is God's."
When they heard this, they were surprised. Then they left it and went away. Marriage is like the dead rising.
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people come back to life after death.
"Teacher," they said, "this is what Moses told us. If a man dies without leaving children, his brother must marry the widow. He must have children to continue his brother's name."
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second and third brothers. It even happened to the seventh brother.
In the end, the woman died.
Now, when the dead rise, whose wife will she be? All seven of them were married to her.
Jesus answered, "You are mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures. And you do not know the power of God.
When the dead rise, they will not marry. And their parents will not give them anything to marry. They will be like the angels in heaven.
What about the dead who come back to life? Didn't you read what God told you?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham. I am the God of Isaac. And I am the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead. He is the God of the living."
When people heard this, they were amazed by what he was teaching. The most important advice
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus. So the Pharisees gathered.
One of them was an expert in the law. So he tested Jesus with a question.
"Teacher," he asked, "what is the most important commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important advice.
And the second is like it. "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
Everything written in the scripture and the prophets is based on these two commandments." Whose son is the Messiah?
The Pharisees were gathered. Jesus asked them,
What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he? "Son of David," he answered.
He said to them, "Why does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet." (Psalm 110:1)
Ella Dawood called him "Sayyid," how could he be Dawood's son?
No one could even answer him with a single word. Since that day, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
Jesus Condemns the Pharisees and the Teachers of the Law
Jesus spoke with the crowds and with his disciples.
He said: "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees are sitting in Moses' seat."
You have to obey them. Do everything they tell you. But don't be like them. They don't do what they advise.
They carry heavy weights and put them on other people's shoulders. But they themselves don't want to move a finger to carry them.
Everything they do, they do so that people will see them. On their foreheads and arms, they wear small boxes containing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the fringes of their coats very long.
They love to sit in the place of honor at dinner. And they want to have the most important seats in the synagogue.
They love meeting peacefully in the market. They go crazy when people call out to them 'Lord'.
But you shouldn't be called "Lord." You have only one Master, and you are all brothers.
Don't call anyone on earth "Dad." You have one Dad, and He is in heaven.
You should not be called "teacher." You have one teacher, and that is Christ.
The most important one among you will be your servant.
Whoever raises himself will be lowered. And whoever is lowered will be raised.
How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those who want to enter go in.
<.>
How bad all this is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You who pretend! You travel everywhere to win one person over to your religion. And then you leave him a child of hell, twice as much as yourselves.
How bad this is for you, you blind brokers! You say, "If someone swears by the temple, it means nothing. But whoever swears by the gold of the temple must keep the oath."
You are blind and stupid! What is more important? The gold? Or the structure that sanctifies the gold?
You also say, "If someone swears by the altar, it means nothing. But whoever swears by the gift on it must keep the oath."
O blind ones! What is more important? The gift? Or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
So whoever swears by the altar swears by the altar and by everything on it.
And whoever swears by the temple swears by its name and by the one who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the sky, swears by the Throne of God and the One who is seated upon it.
How bad this is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You who represent! You bring to God a tenth of your spices, like mint, dill, and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law, like justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should have done the latter without neglecting the former.
O blind leaders! You spit out the smallest insect from your food. But you swallow a whole camel!
How bad all this is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You only clean the outside! You wash the outside of the cup and the dish. But inside you are full of greed. You just want to please yourselves.
Blind, Persian! Clean the inside of the cup and the first plate. After that, the outside will also become clean.
How bad all this is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You are hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs. They look beautiful on the outside. But inside they are full of dead bones. And on top of that, they are full of other things that are not clean at all.
Same thing with you. From the outside, it looks like you're doing the right thing. But inside, it's full of wrong things. You act like you're not yourself.
How bad all this is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets. You decorate the graves of the righteous.
And she says, 'If we had lived in the days of those who lived before us, we would not have done what they did. We would not have helped in killing the prophets.'
So you bear witness against yourselves. You say that you are the children of the people who killed the prophets.
Sally, the sins they started, those who lived before you!
O nest of poisonous snakes! How will you escape the punishment of Hell?
I will send you prophets, wise men, and teachers. Some of them you will kill. Some you will crucify. And you will torture others in your temples. And you will drag them from city to city.
You will pay for the blood of all the righteous people who were shed on the earth. I mean from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah. Zechariah is the one you killed between the temple and the altar.
What I'm going to tell you now is true. All of this is going to happen to the people living now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and throw stones to kill those sent to you. Many times I wanted to gather all your people. I wanted to be like a hen gathering her chicks under her wing. But you did not let me!
Look, your house has remained empty.
I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." (Psalm 118:26)
End marks
Jesus walked away from the temple. He was walking away when his disciples came to him. They wanted to draw his attention to the buildings of the temple.
"Do you see all this?" Jesus asked. "What I am about to tell you is true. Not one stone here will be left on another; every stone will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. Then the disciples came to him alone. They said to him: "Tell us, when will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Be careful! Watch out that no one deceives you."
Many will come in my name. They will say, 'I am the Messiah!' and will deceive many people.
You will hear about wars. And you will hear people talking about the wars of the future. Don't be afraid. These things must come to an end. But the end has not yet arrived.
Exile will fight exile. The king will fight the king. People will go hungry. There will be earthquakes in many places.
All of these are the beginning of labor pains.
And then they will hand you over to mistreat you and kill you. All the peoples will hate you because of me.
At this time, many will turn away from their faith. They will hate one another. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will appear. They will deceive many people.
Because evil will increase, people's love will greatly cool down.
But those who endure until the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world. It will be a testimony to all nations. And then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke about "the abomination that causes desolation." (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
And afterwards, those in Judaism must flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof needs to go down to their house to get something.
No one in the field should go back to get their jacket.
How hard the days will be for pregnant women! How hard they will be for breastfeeding mothers!
Don't let yourself be forced to run away in the rain or on Saturday.
There will be great suffering these days. It will be worse than anything that has happened from the beginning of the world until now. And there will be nothing like it again.
Except that time will not be shortened, no one will live. But because of God's chosen people, it will be shortened.
At that time, no one can tell you, "Look! Here is the Messiah!" or, "There he is over there!" Don't believe that.
False Christians and false prophets will appear. They will perform great signs and wonders. They will try to deceive the people whom God has taken if they can.
Look, I told you before.
If someone told you, "He is far out in the desert," don't go there. And if someone said, "He is deep inside the house," don't believe that.
The lightning that comes from the east is seen in the west. And it will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
The vultures will gather wherever there is a dead body.
Right after these great sufferings, "the sun will be darkened. The moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky. The heavenly bodies will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the peoples on earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven. He will come with power and great glory.
He will send his angels with a loud trumpet blast. They will gather the chosen people from all four directions. He will bring them from one end of the sky to the other.
Learn from the fig tree. When its branches become tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
In the same way, when you discover all these things they are doing, you know that the end is near. It's right at the door.
What I'm going to tell you now is true. The people who were living at that time will not die until all those events happen.
The sky and the earth will disappear. But my words will never disappear. The day and the hour are unknown.
No one knows the day or the hour. Not even the angels in the sky know. The Son does not know. Only the Father knows.
Think about how the days of Noah were. It will be like that when the Son of Man comes.
The days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were getting married. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They did all this until the day Noah entered the ark.
They didn't know anything about what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. This is how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
Two men will be in the field. One will be taken and the other will remain.
Two women will be finely ground by hand. One will be taken and the other will remain.
So keep your eyes on the watch. I don't know on which day your Lord will come.
You need to understand something. Suppose the homeowner knew what time at night the thief comes. He would stay up. He wouldn't let his house be robbed.
Now you have to be ready too. The Son of Man will come at an hour you do not expect.
Suppose a master appoints one of his servants to be in charge of the other servants in his house. The servant's duty is to give them their food at the appropriate time. The master wants a trustworthy and wise servant for this task.
It will be good for the servant if he finds the master; he finds him doing his work when the master returns.
What I'm going to tell you now is true. The gentleman is going to leave that servant responsible for everything he has.
But let's assume that person is bad. Let's assume he says to himself, "Sir will be away for a long time."
Suppose he seemed to be hitting the other servants. And suppose he was eating and drinking with people who drink a lot.
That servant will return on a day the servant does not expect. He will return at an hour the servant does not know.
After the gentleman, they will cut into pieces. They will send to the place where those who claim to go. There, people will cry and grit their teeth.
The Story of Ten Brides
This is how the kingdom of heaven will be at that time. Ten bridesmaids took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. Five were wise.
The fools took their bulbs but did not take olive oil with them.
The knowledgeable took the oil in bottles along with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. So all the brides got tired and fell asleep.
In the middle of the night, someone shouted, "Here comes the groom! Go out to welcome him!"
And afterwards, they outdid all the brides and tightened their lamps.
The ignorant said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil. Our candles are going to go out."
"No," they answered. "It might not be enough for all of us. Instead of going to them, go to the people who sell the oil. Buy some for yourselves."
They went to buy the oil. But on their way, the groom arrived. The girls who were ready went in with him to the wedding dinner. Then the door was closed.
Afterwards, the rest of the brides came as well. They said: "Sir! Sir! Open the door for us!"
But answer, "What I'm going to tell you is true. I don't know you."
Be careful. I don't know the day or the hour when the groom will come. The story of three workers.
Once again, this is how the kingdom of heaven will be. A man was going on a journey. He entrusted his servants and left them in charge of his possessions.
He gave one 10,000 dollars. And he gave another 4,000 dollars. And he gave the third 2,000 dollars. The man gave each servant the amount he knew he could take care of. Then he went on his journey.
The guy who took $10,000 went and put his money to work. He earned an additional $10,000.
Whoever has 4000 dollars earned an additional 4000 dollars.
But the man who took 2000 dollars left and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money in it.
After a long time, the boss of these workers returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who took $10,000 made another $10,000. He said: "Sir, you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I earned an additional $10,000."
His master replied, "You did well, Abdel Mzyan and loyal! I was loyal in a few things. I will give you responsibility over many things. Come and share your master's joy!"
The man who has 4000 dollars also came. He said: "Sir, you trusted me with 4000 dollars. Look, I earned an additional 4000 dollars."
His master answered, "You did well, Abdel Mzyan and loyal! I was loyal in a few things. I will give you responsibility over many things. Come and share your master's joy!"
Then came the man who took 2000 dollars. He said: "Sir, I knew that you are a tough man. You reap where you did not sow. You gather the harvest where you did not plant."
I was scared. I went out and buried 2000 dollars in the ground for you. Look, this is your thing.
His master answered him, "O useless and lazy servant! Did you know that I harvest where I did not plant? Did you know that I gather the crop where I did not sow?"
Well, you should have put my money in the bank. When I returned, I was going to return it with interest.
Then the others servants followed, "Take $2,000 from him. Give it to the one who has $20,000."
Everyone who has will be given more. They will have more than enough. And what about those who have nothing? Even what they have will be taken from them.
Expel that worthless slave outside. There, in the darkness, people will cry and grit their teeth. 'Sheep and goats'
The Son of Man is coming in all His glory. All the angels will come with Him. Then He will sit on His throne in the glory of heaven.
All the peoples will gather before him. He will divide the people into two groups. It will be like the shepherd who separates the sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Afterwards, the king will speak to those on his right. He will say to them, "My Father bless you. Come and take what is yours. This is the kingdom prepared for you since the day God created the world.
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in.
I needed things. And you gave them to me. I was sick. And you took care of me. I was in prison. And you came to visit me.
And after, the people who did good will be answered. "Our master," they will be asked, "when did we see you hungry and give you food? When did we see you thirsty and give you something to drink?"
When did we see you as a stranger and invite you in? When did we see you in need of things and give them to you?
When did we see you sick or in prison and go visit you?
The king will answer, "What I am going to tell you now is true. Anything you have done to one of the least of my brothers, you have done it to me."
He will say to those on his left, "You are cursed! Go far away from me into the fire that always burns. This is prepared for the devil and his angels.
I was hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I was thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger. But you didn't call me to come in. I needed things. But you didn't give me any. I was sick and in prison. But you didn't comfort me.
They will answer as well, "Sir, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and not help you? When did we see you a stranger or in need of clothes or sick or in prison and not help you?"
He will answer, "What I am going to tell you is true. Anything I didn't do to one of the least important people among them, I didn't do it to me."
They will go to be punished forever. But those who did good will receive eternal life.
The plan to kill Jesus
Sally Jesus from saying all this. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man is going to be handed over to be crucified.
Afterwards, the chief priests met with the elders of the people. They met at the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest.
The religious leaders planned to arrest Jesus in a clever way. They wanted to kill him.
But not during the holiday, they said. People might start problems. A woman is pouring perfume on Isa.
Jesus was in Bethany. He was in the house of a man named Simon, who had a skin disease.
A woman came to Jesus with a sealed bottle of very expensive perfume. She poured the perfume on his head while he was sitting at the table.
When the students saw this, they got angry. They said: "Why this talk?"
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. And the money could have been given to poor people.
He knew that. He told them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She did something nice for me."
There will always be poor people with you. But I will not always be with you.
The perfume was poured on my body to prepare me for burial.
What I'm going to tell you now is true. What she did will be told wherever this good news is announced in the whole world. It will be told in her memory." Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
One of the twelve went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
Saul said, "What will you give me if I hand Jesus over to you?" They counted out 30 silver coins for him.
Since that time, Judas was waiting for the right moment to hand Jesus over to them. The Lord's Supper
It was the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus. They asked him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?"
Answer, "Go to the city to a certain man. Tell him, 'The teacher says, "My time is near. I will celebrate the Easter holiday at your house with my students."' "
Now the disciples did what Jesus told them to do. They prepared the Passover meal.
When I came in the afternoon, Issa was playing cards on the table.
And as they were eating, he said: "What I am about to tell you is true. One of you will hand me over to my enemy."
The students became very sad. One after another, they started telling him, "It’s not me, sir, right?"
Jesus answered, "The one who dips his hand in the dish with me is the one who will betray me."
The Son of Man will go as it is written about him. But how great a disaster it will be for the one who hands over the Son of Man! It would have been better for him if he had never been born.
It was Judas who was going to betray him. He said, "Not me, Rabbi, right?" Jesus answered, "Yes. You are."
While they were eating, Jesus took the bread. He thanked God and broke it. He gave it to his disciples and said to them, "Take this bread and eat it. This is my body."
After God, the cup. God thanked and gave it to them. He said, "Eat all of it."
This is the blood of the new covenant. It is poured out to forgive the sins of many people.
This is what I will tell you. From now on, I will not drink wine with you until the day we drink it together in my father's kingdom.
Afterwards, they sang a hymn and went to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said that Peter would fail.
Jesus said to them, "Tonight you will all fall away because it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
But after I wake up from death, I will go before you to Galilee.
Peter answered, "All the other people can stay away from you. But I will never change."
Isa told you: "What I'm going to tell you is true. This will happen tonight. Before the rooster crows, you will say three times that you don't know me."
But Peter said, "We may die with you. But I will never say I don't know you." And all the other disciples said the same thing. Jesus prays in Gethsemane
Jesus walked with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane. He said to them, "Stay here while I go over there to pray."
Peter took Walden Zabdi with him. He began to feel sadness and anxiety.
And then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful. I feel close to death. Stay here. Watch with me."
He walked a little further. Then he fell, face down on the ground. He prayed, "Oh God, if possible, take this cup of suffering from me. But let whatever You want be done, not what I want."
And then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. He said to them: "Could you not stay awake with me for one hour?" He asked Peter.
Stay up and pray. So you don't slip when temptation comes to you. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Jesus walked again. He called out, "Oh Father, is it possible for this cup to pass? But if I must drink it, let Your will be done."
Afterwards, he returned. Once again, he found them asleep. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and walked away again. For the third time, he called for the same thing.
And then he returned to the disciples. He said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look! The hour is near. The Son of Man is going to be handed over to sinners.
People! Let's go! There he is, the one who will hand me over to them!" Jesus was arrested.
And Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the twelve. He was accompanied by a large crowd. They were carrying swords and clubs. The chief priests and elders of the people had sent them.
Judas, who was going to betray Jesus, had agreed with them on a signal. He said: "The one I kiss is the man." "Seize him."
Judas went to Jesus now. He said to him, "Peace be upon you, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you came to do." Then the men stepped forward. They seized Jesus and arrested him.
I swear by that moment, one of Isa's friends grabbed his sword. He drew it and struck the chief priest's servant. He cut off the servant's ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," Isa said to him. "Everyone who uses the sword will die by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask Dad for help? He can send an army with more than 70,000 kings right now.
But how will the holy books be fulfilled? They say it must be done in this way."
I swear by that time, Issa spoke to the group. "Am I leading a band of armed men against you?" he asked them. "Do you need to come out with swords and sticks to arrest me? Every day I was sitting in the temple courtyard teaching. And you didn't arrest me.
But all this happened so that the words of the prophets would be fulfilled." Afterwards, all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was taken to the Sanhedrin.
Those who arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest. The teachers of the law and the elders were gathered there.
Not far away, Peter followed Jesus. He went all the way to the high priest's courtyard. He entered and sat with the guards to see what was going to happen.
The chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin were looking for something to use against Jesus. They wanted to kill him.
But they didn't find any evidence, even though many false witnesses came forward. In the end, two other witnesses came forward.
They said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God. I can rebuild it again in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up. He asked Jesus, "Aren't you going to answer? What are these charges these men are bringing against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I charge you by the living God: tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
"Well. As you say," Jesus answered. "But this is the word I want to tell you all. In the coming days, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One. You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven."
And then, the high priest tore his clothes. He said, "He said something very bad about God! Why do we need more witnesses? You heard him say this bad thing.
"What do you think?" "He must die!" he answered.
And then they spat in his face. They hit him with their fists. And others slapped him.
They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who struck you?" Peter says he does not know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came to him. She said to him: "You too were with Jesus of Galilee."
But in front of all of them, Peter said okay. "I don't know what you're saying," he said.
And then he went out to the door that leads to the courtyard. There, a woman saw him again. She told the people, "This man was with Issa Al-Nasiri."
He said again, "He's just a passerby." And with his right hand, he said, "I didn't know the man!"
After a while, the people standing there went to Boutros. They told him: "You have to be one of them. The way you speak exposes you."
Afterwards, Boutros started cursing himself. He swore and told them, "I don't know that man!" Then he immediately shouted.
Later, Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him. "The rooster will crow," Jesus told him. "Before it crows, you will say three times that you do not know me." Peter went outside. He broke down and wept.
Judah is stubborn.
The morning was early. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They tied him up and beat him severely. Afterwards, they handed him over to Pilate, who was the governor.
Judas, who betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt great shame and sorrow for what he had done. He returned the 30 pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
"I made a mistake," he said. "I handed over a man who is not guilty." "Why should we care?" they answered him. "That's your problem."
Now Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Afterwards, he went and hanged himself.
The chief priests collected the money. They said, "This money must not be put into the temple treasury. This is blood money. It was paid for the death of a man."
They decided to use the money to buy a pottery field. People from other countries will be thrown there.
Why is that place called the Field of Blood to this day?
And then the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He said, "They took 30 pieces of silver. This price was set for him by the people of Israel.
"They used the money to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) They brought Jesus to Pilate
Jesus was standing in front of the governor. The governor asked, "Are you the king of the Jews?" "Yes. Just as you say," Jesus answered.
But when the chief priests and elders brought charges against him, he did not answer.
After Pilate alone, "Don't you hear the accusations they are making against you?"
But Issa didn't answer, not even to a single accusation. The governor was very surprised.
It was the governor's custom on Easter to release one prisoner. People were allowed to choose the person they wanted.
At that time, they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
When the people gathered, Pilate asked them, "Who do you want me to set free? Barabbas? Or Jesus, who is called the Messiah?"
Pilate knew that the leaders were jealous. He knew this was why they handed Jesus over to him.
When Pilate was sitting in the judge's chair, his wife sent him a message. It said: "Don't get involved with this man. He is not guilty. I suffered a lot in a dream about him today."
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to cause the death of Jesus.
"Which one of the two do you want me to release?" the governor asked. "Both," they answered him.
Pontius Pilate: "So what should I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?" They all answered: "Crucify him!"
"Why? What did he do to him?" asked Pilate. But they shouted louder, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that it was not going to lead to anything. On the contrary, people started to get angry. At that moment, he took the water and washed his hands in front of them. He said, "I am not responsible for this man's death." They told him, "You are responsible for this!"
Everyone answered, "We and our children will bear the guilt of his death!"
Pilate freed Barabbas. But Jesus was whipped. Then they handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers are mocking Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus to the palace, which was called the Praetorium. All the other soldiers gathered around him.
They took off his clothes and dressed him in a purple jellaba.
Then they gathered thorns to make a crown. They placed it on his head. They gave him a stick in his right hand. Then they fell to their knees in front of him and laughed at him. They said: "We honor you, O King of the Jews!"
They beat him. They hit him on the head with a stick again and again.
After they laughed at him, they put the jellaba on him. They gave him back his clothes. Then they seized him and went to crucify him on the cross. Jesus was crucified on the cross.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Kairouan. His name was Simon. They forced him to carry the cross.
He went to a place called Golgotha. The word Golgotha means the place of the skull.
They mixed the wine with bitter spices and gave it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
They crucified him, dividing his clothes by casting lots.
They sat and guarded him there.
They put the written accusation above his head. It was written, ~This is Jesus, King of the Jews.=
A couple of thieves were crucified with him. One was on his right and one was on his left.
Those who passed by shouted at Issa and laughed at him. They shook their heads.
He said, "You mean you will destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Then save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
In the same way, the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders mocked him.
"He saved others," they said. "But he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross! Then we will believe in him."
He relies on God. God will save him now if He wills. He is the one who said, "I am the Son of God."
In the same way, the thieves who were crucified with Jesus laughed at him too. Jesus died.
From noon until three in the afternoon, the whole land was covered in darkness.
Around three o'clock, Jesus cried out loudly. He said, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" This means "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of the people standing there heard Jesus shouting. They said, "He is calling Elijah."
Immediately one of them ran and brought a sponge. He soaked it with grape vinegar and put it on a stick. He offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elias is going to come and save him."
After Jesus cried out once more in a loud voice, he died.
The moment was sacrificed for you, the veil of the temple was torn from top to bottom. The earth shook. The stones cracked.
The opening of the graves. Many bodies of the saints who died came back to life.
They came out of the graves. After Jesus rose to life, they went to the holy city. There, they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and those who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and everything that happened. They were very afraid. They said, "Truly, he was the Son of God!"
Not far away, many women were watching. They followed Jesus from Galilee to take care of him.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, was also present. And the mother of the sons of Zebedee as well. Jesus is buried.
As evening approached, a rich man came from the city of Arimathea. His name was Joseph. He became a follower of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and requested the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Youssef took the body and wrapped it in a clean shoulder cloth.
He placed it in his new grave that he had dug in the rock. He put a large stone in front of the entrance to the grave. Then he left.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there in front of the tomb. The guards of the tomb
The day after was the day after the day of preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
Sir," they said, "we remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He said, 'After three days, I will live again.'"
He gave the order to guard the grave until the third day. If they don't do it, his disciples might come and steal the body. Then they will tell people that Jesus rose from the dead. This last lie will be worse than the first.
"Take some guards with you," Pilate answered. "No. Make the tomb as secure as you can."
They went and secured the grave well. They put a seal on the stone and set up some guards on duty.
Jesus Rising from the Dead
Saturday daytime has just ended. It was dawn on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
A strong earthquake occurred. An angel from the Lord came down from heaven. The angel walked to the tomb. He moved the stone that was blocking the tomb and sat on it.
His body was shining like lightning. His clothes were white like snow.
The guards were very afraid of him until they fainted and became like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
He's not here! He got up, just like he said he would! Come and see the place where he used to sleep.
Hurry! Tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there.' Now I have told you.
Now the women ran far from the grave. They were scared, but they were very happy. They ran to tell the students.
Suddenly Jesus met them. He said, "Peace be upon you!" They came to him, held his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. They will see me there." The guards returned to the chief priests.
When the women were on the way, some guards went to the city. They told the chief priests about everything that happened.
When the senior priests met with the sheikhs, they made a plan. They gave the military a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'The disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
As soon as the governor hears this report, we will pay it. This way, you will stay away from problems.
Now the soldiers took the money and did what they were told. This story has become known among the Jews to this day. The last orders of Jesus to his disciples
Afterwards, 11 students went to Galilee. They went to the mountain that Jesus had told them to go to.
Whoever saw him, worshiped him. But there are those who still have doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
You need to go and teach people from all nations. Baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And be confident that I am always with you, until the end.
John the Baptist is preparing the way
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
A long time ago, the prophet Isaiah wrote, "I will send my messenger ahead of you. He will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
A voice cries out in the desert, "Prepare the way of the Lord. Make straight in the wilderness a highway for our God." (Isaiah 40:3)
And John came. He was baptizing people in the desert. He was preaching to the people to be baptized and repent from their sins. Afterwards, God would forgive them.
All the people from the villages of Judah went out to him. Even the people from Jerusalem went. When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John used to wear clothes made from camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. And he used to eat locusts and wild honey.
This is what John used to preach. "When I go, someone stronger than me will come. I am not worthy to stoop down and untie his sandals."
"I will baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus was baptized and tempted.
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee. John baptized him in the Jordan River.
Jesus was coming up out of the water. At that moment, he saw the sky opening. He saw the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice spoke to him from the sky. It said to him, "You are my son, and I love you. I am very happy with you."
Immediately the Holy Spirit sent Jesus into the desert.
He was in the desert for 40 days. There the devil tempted him. The wild animals did not harm Jesus. The angels took care of him. Jesus chose the first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee. He was preaching the good news of God.
"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the good news!"
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake. They were fishermen.
J. Follow me, Jesus said. I will make you fishers of men.
Immediately open their windows and follow him.
Afterwards, Jesus walked a little further ahead. As he was walking, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in the boat preparing their nets.
He immediately called them. He left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants. And then they followed Jesus. Jesus was casting out an evil spirit.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath day came, he went to the synagogue. There he began to teach.
People were amazed by his teaching. He taught them as if he had authority. He did not speak like the teachers of Islamic law.
At that moment, a man in their temple shouted. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said,
What do you want from us, Issa Al-Nasiri? Did you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!
"Be silent!" Jesus said firmly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Afterwards, it came out of him with a scream.
Everyone was amazed. They asked each other, "What is this? New teaching! And with great authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits, and they obey him."
The news about Issa spread quickly throughout Galilee. Issa is treating many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. They immediately went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed. She had a fever. They told Jesus about her.
He went to her. He held her hand and helped her get up. The fever went away. Afterwards, she started serving them.
In the evening, after sunset, people brought to Jesus all the sick. They even brought those who were possessed by demons.
All the people gathered in the city in front of the door.
Jesus healed many of them. They all had various kinds of diseases. He even cast out many demons. But he did not let them speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prays in a quiet place.
Bakri was up very early in the morning while it was still dark. Issa got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There, he prayed.
Simon and his friends went looking for Jesus.
When they found him, they called out to him, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let's go to another place. I want to go to the nearby towns. I need to teach there as well. That's why I came."
He traveled throughout Galilee. He was preaching in their synagogues. He even cast out demons. Jesus healed a man who had a skin disease.
There was a man who had a disease on his skin with Jesus. He knelt on his knees and pleaded with Jesus. He said to him, "If you want to heal me and make my skin clean, you can do this."
Jesus was overwhelmed with great concern. He stretched out his hand and touched the man. He said to him: "I am ready to do it." "Be clean!"
Immediately the illness left him. He was treated.
Jesus dismissed him now. He gave him a strong warning.
"Don't tell this to anyone," he said. "Go show your head to the priest. Offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded. It will be a testimony to the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and started preaching now. He spread the news to everyone. Jesus could no longer enter any city openly. He stayed outside in isolated places. But people still came to him from everywhere.
Issa Keshfi was a man who couldn't walk.
After a few days, Jesus entered Capernaum again. People heard that he had returned home.
A lot of people gathered until there was no space left. There wasn't even any space outside the door. And Issa was preaching to them with the word.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who couldn't walk.
But they couldn't get close to Jesus because of the crowd. So they made a hole in the roof above Jesus. Then they lowered the man down through it on a mat.
Jesus saw their faith. He said to the man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
There were some Sharia teachers sitting there. They were thinking,
Why is this man speaking in this way? He is telling me something very bad! Only God can forgive sins!
Immediately Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?"
Which is easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up, take your bed and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Afterwards, Jesus called the man who was unable to walk.
"I'm telling you," he said, "get up. Take your mat and go home."
The man stood up and grabbed his mat. Then he walked away while everyone was watching. Everyone was amazed. They thanked God and said, "I've never seen anything like this!" Issa chose Louis.
Once again, Jesus went out beside the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd came to him. He began to teach them.
As he was walking, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus. Levi was sitting at the tax collector's place. Jesus said to him, "Follow me." Levi got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and with his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that followed Jesus.
There were some teachers of the law who were Pharisees present. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. They asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this. He said to them, "Those who are well do not need a doctor, but the sick do. I did not come to call the righteous who think they are right with God to follow me. I came to call sinners to follow me." They asked Jesus about fasting.
The disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting and not eating. Some people came to Jesus. They said to him, "John's disciples are fasting. The Pharisees' disciples are also fasting. But your disciples are not fasting. Why are they not fasting?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom go without eating while he is with them? They will not fast as long as he is with them.
But the time will come when they will take the groom from them. On that day, they will leave without eating.
People do not sew a new piece of fabric onto old clothes. If they do, the new piece will pull on the old one. This will increase the tearing.
People do not put new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wine will burst the skins. Then both the wine and the skins will be ruined. No, everyone puts new wine into new skins." Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath.
On Saturday, Jesus was walking with his disciples in the grain fields. The disciples began to pluck some heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! This is against the law to do on the Sabbath. Why are your disciples doing it?"
Answer, "Have you never read about what Dawood did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food.
There was a time when Abiathar was the high priest. David entered the house of God and ate all the consecrated bread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it. David even gave some to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man. Man was not made for the Sabbath."
For the Son of Man is Lord even on the Sabbath.
Healing on Saturday
Once again, Jesus went to the synagogue. There was a man who had a weak and crooked hand.
There were some Pharisees looking for a fault in Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man whose hand was weak and crooked. He said to him: "Stand before all the people."
Then Isa asked them, "What does the law say we must do on the Sabbath? Should we do good? Or evil? Should we save life? Or kill?" But no one answered.
Jesus looked at them with anger. He was very upset because their hearts were stubborn. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand became like new.
Afterwards, the Pharisees went out and began making plans with the Herodians. They wanted to kill Jesus. The crowds were following Jesus.
Jesus walked to the Sea of Galilee with his disciples. A large crowd from Galilee followed him.
People heard about everything that Jesus was doing. Many people came to him. They came from Judea, Jerusalem, and Edom. They came from the lands east of the Jordan River. And they came from the region near Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to find him a small boat. This would prevent people from crowding around him.
Jesus healed many people. That's why those who were sick crowded around to touch him.
There are people with evil spirits who saw him, they fell before him. The spirits cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to say who he was. Jesus appointed the twelve apostles.
He went up a mountain. He called certain people to come to him, and they came.
He appointed twelve of them and called them apostles. From that time on, they were with him. And he was going to send them out to preach.
They will have the authority to cast out demons.
Now Jesus appointed the twelve. Simon was one of them. Jesus gave him the name Peter.
They were James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges. Boanerges means Sons of Thunder.
There were also Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus. There were also Thaddaeus and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was one of them too. He is the one who would later hand Jesus over to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebub
Jesus entered a house. Once again, a crowd gathered. It was so large that even Jesus and his disciples could not eat.
His family heard about this. They went to take care of him. They said, "He is mentally ill."
There were some scholars of Sharia there. They came down from Jerusalem. They said, "He is possessed by Belzebub! He drives out demons by the power of the prince of demons."
Jesus came, called them, and spoke to them in parables. He said to them, "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
If the kingdom were fighting for itself, it wouldn't still be standing.
If the family is divided, it cannot hold together.
