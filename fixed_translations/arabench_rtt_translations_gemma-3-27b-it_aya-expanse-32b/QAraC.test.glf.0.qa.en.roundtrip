Alas! It's an opportunity that we must not all miss.
Also, I don't interfere. I have the right to take, and frankly, you have the right to take before me.

Salih, don't be..., forgive me God!
Goodness, would a brother advise his brother as you say?

And you found a great feast.
The feast belongs to no one.
Say that to yourself.
We won't have this celebration again.
Don't be a stranger, Saleh!
Seize the opportunity from us.
No, no, no, no, don't try to convince me, it's impossible, impossible, I won't do it.
The problem is that he's afraid.
What are you afraid of?
This is a government project! Everyone is taking.
This is the law!
Even those who don't participate benefit from it.
He is the head of a huge project.
This means he's in control.
International Third Millennium Shores, specifically the first phase of infrastructure.
You fool.
This is the place where we can loot!
If he refuses to take
Who gave you the right?
You don't have the right to exploit him.
When his car wouldn't start.
Who used to drive him to the project site? Wasn't it me?
No, if that's the case, you're right.
Who gives you money to fill up your car four and five times!
Leave it to me.
Don't be foolish and stubborn.
Take some interest.
Look at Uncle Khamees.
And now, as you say, they call him a millionaire.
A third of the project,
The other third is a commission.
Who plays in a folk band,
They say there was a national celebration.
And he bought a hundred lanterns.
You know what they did.
He added a zero.
No use, auntie!
No, God guides him, God willing.
Let's eat with him.
I spent last night trying to convince him.
It's an opportunity.
Let there be good.
And with God's will, good will triumph.
This is common.
Between you and me.
Don't talk about this matter to anyone.
Should we be worried?
But my friends
Neck pain.
The man began to change his mind.
I spoke to him today.
Two hours in the morning.
He began to be convinced.
We have a meeting with him soon.
And we have to convince him.
He's going to cut off our allowances.
They really convinced him to change his mind at the meeting.
My brother Ali, my brother Osman.
I don't know.
Today is my first day of work.
Rely on me.
I understand!
Certainly. But are you sure I'll get some?
I want to ask you.
If you are hungry and walking down the street
Are you eating or not?
I am a person who eats a lot.
Don't worry.
The dish is large.
We are still working on the draft minutes of the meeting.
If you are not in good health,
If you have any concerns
What I really want to know.
It's legitimate.
God guide you, Saleh!
This is reasonable because you are assuming the position of president for the first time in your life.
It's very simple.
We will include our share.
In the project budget?!
What do you think?
So that no one suspects what we're planning.
To put our share as a separate item!
This amount of money has been stolen.
By the project officials.
Cannot
No, no, no! Saleh!
You know how these things happen.
But it seems you have some concerns.
Their right.
And above all,
Everything is in our hands.
I told you he was lying.
What's wrong with you?
He says the new car belongs to his friend, and you believe him.
He said that!
Let's assume it's his friend's car.
At a very distinguished location as well!
Except for a man of great wealth.
I heard that from people.
He told me he bought it for himself and registered it in his name.
He said, "Please."
He has the money now.
Now he will start lying.
Aren't we his family?
Is that all?
Aren't we going to get anything?
We won't get anything!
He wants to eat it alone, bite by bite.
Don't shake your head!
And he is not your brother either.
Sit down, everything will be alright.
I talked to him all night.
I told him that they were your relatives no matter what.
Finally, he agreed.
This is what's supposed to happen.
And I hope you don't get it just once.
These are the beaches of the third millennium.
Specifically, infrastructure.
Later, they will start the second phase.
And you will continue with him.
May God reward you with good.
It's good that you urged him to agree.
You're no different from them.
But, it doesn't matter.
I wish you had explained it to him.
We want a percentage.
They all take a percentage.
Until he said after convincing him.
They want their friends to attend a meeting to set the project budget.
They must carry on, it's their right.
We assert it, and we are certain of it.
Submit it as soon as possible for approval.
Take your time.
Who is this? Do you know him?
He is my wife's brother who shares with me.
Do you mean him?
We are responsible for doors, windows, and all aspects of finishes.
Okay, okay.
How much do you want, until we finish?
What will be your share?
Is this about taking the money?
Let's take a week to think about it.
And specify the amount we'll receive.
There are people waiting and wanting some.
Abdulaziz is right.
If someone decides to take half a million,
This week, everyone will think deeply.
And they specified the amount they wanted.
By next week, they will have made their decision and determined the amount they want.
It's none of your business.
So, it's up to you?
Ignore him.
Oh my friend, what's wrong? What hurts?
I don't know what he's doing here.
Hello! Who invited you to this project?
It's a government project.
Salih, is your brother's name Sultan?
This is our neighbor's driver.
Sometimes he drives us when our car is broken down.
Note down.
Abdullah's document.
No, no, there are three extra people.
What else can I do, I'm tired of it.
I told him, "Enough, man. Let's propose the budget and wrap up."
No, no, this takes a sum of money.
How much should I give him?
Poor guy, does he have kids?
Yes, he has, let it be twenty-five thousand four hundred.
Four hundred
They add it by force.
How much are you going to give them!
This is too much.
This is my mother, just as we were talking about her.
Yes, Mother.
Yes, no, no, no, this is the last one. Oh! My son.
No, son, she wants to go to Thailand for treatment.
Wait, wait, what's wrong?
Why are you upset?
Only from the first phase, specifically the infrastructure.
Unused
Add three thousand.
Buy me some watches from Thailand adorned with sparkling crystal.
Did you add her?
Yes, Mother.
No, Mom, I added her. I just wanted to make sure of the name.
Dear, Mom.
Let's amplify this celebration.
Yes, but the budget needs to be defined; it can't be open-ended like this.
Tomorrow is the last meeting, and everyone needs to decide on the amount of money they want.
I have this.
Is a million enough!
So much, my dear.
Hey, everyone! Hey, wait, it's noisy, give us a chance.
The committee is currently in a meeting to approve the project budget, and financial matters are not up for discussion right now, that's all.
I want more.
We told you not to embarrass us, we are in the ministry's square.
Whether we scream or not, don't draw attention to us.
If someone came and asked you what's going on with you here
We'll tell him that the power is out or there's been an electrical short circuit.
Don't have sex in the ministry's square.
Hold your mouth, hold your mouth.
Sew it! Do you hear me!
What was your participation rate with them, what is the available amount now?
Excluding my brother.
Fully, 50 million.
Just fifty million for the first phase.
What's the price now?
What, Saleh?
Participation means engagement, man!
In any case, bon appétit.
Hurry up, let's get to work, all the beneficiaries are waiting for us.
No problem... Most importantly, we don't want any discussions; they should just agree on the budget and that's it.
And start implementing tomorrow.
And it serves a very large segment of society.
God bless you, this is the International Millennium Beaches Project.
This is the first stage.
More specifically, the infrastructure.
For future generations.
Certainly, on behalf of our team, I would like to greet and congratulate you on the occasion of the project's inauguration, which will take place tomorrow, as far as I know.
Which took us one thousand and five hundred years.
One and a half years
Once again, on behalf of the Future Achievements Program,
This project
And future generations
God blesses us with the best oil and sustains it for us.
Stage two, three, and ten.
actor
Welcome aboard.
Why have we been gathered here? When will the cars arrive to pick us up?
What? Where should they take us?
Praise be to God, you have grown up and become a pyramid.
Let's sit down, the sun is hot.
Yes, a nice girl.
But I see nothing.
Anything but the sea.
Why were you fired?
Iman told me that my sister Manira is here.
My father's land in the desert.
I wondered who lied to her and gave her incorrect information.
It is the Earth.
I saw a farm in the desert and thought it was your father's farm.
Moreover, why do you ask about these things?
You have brothers.
Those who work hard and invest in land, real estate, and businesses are making an effort.
Free from headache.
I am disappointed in you, Iman!
And also, my sister.
Why don't you know?
They have to give it to me.
They are your brothers.
Nothing is better than honesty.
Because money
Now we help her and take her to the hospital.
I don't know how many years she spent fighting with her brothers in court.
Nine years, or more.
No, but
Umm Salama's brothers are thieves.
Poor thing, she was telling me yesterday that
She wants to build a mosque before she dies.
You don't know.
I'm not saying your brothers are like hers, I hope they're not.
How many years have passed since my father's death now?
Why are you asking now?
She saw the farm.
What else do you want?
Isn't the check paid to her every three months?
Saquar, calm down, let's understand the story first.
It's not up to her.
If it were someone else, his sisters wouldn't have gotten even a single riya.
I understood.
Where from?
It's like it's not my money.
Look what, Mona
Please look at him.
It becomes fifty thousand.
Because I had the courage to ask about my father's land, the one in the desert.
I'm sure my share is more than that.
Everyone lives in a villa like this.
Their children are in the best schools.
What should I say, Munira!
I won't stop fighting for my right.
I'll get my revenge.
It's best to invest your money in the company! No thanks.
Everyone is fighting with each other.
People have lost their compassion.
Don't think your brothers will be better than mine.
Look at me.
Twenty years
I used to go to the court frequently.
And in the end
I didn't benefit from it.
Why do they do that?
That's why I'm telling you, dear, be nice to them!
Treat them kindly.
And you'll get tired of them.
And why do the courts take so long?
We are four hundred thousand in total.
If we reach a million fans like other countries.
I really doubt, dear, about issuing an order.
Look at my brothers.
I swear I don't want all this.
Oh my God, what do I say?
And Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best Disposer of affairs.
And Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best Disposer of affairs.
Didn't you have a court session last week?
As usual, my dear!
The judge asked us to file a brief.
We've been through this several times.
My love, they will invest millions, and you will just watch them.
And as I told you, you'll get tired of the courts.
And he won't take your right.
That's why I'm telling you, if I were in your shoes.
I'll make do with what they give me.
Because the woman
We don't owe you anything.
Men ask you!
She has some.
Some questions regarding her share and
She just wants to know something and leave.
If you can't find it
I'll pull you and show you.
He will find his way.
I signed a waiver.
Two hundred and fifty is more than enough for her, her husband works.
Take it or leave it.
Why is she asking now?
But he is very greedy.
As if it's not my right.
This is my father's inheritance, and he wants to decide how much I should take, take it or leave it.
It's not my right or his right to decide.
This is God's will.
Why are they tormenting my father in his grave?
I didn't expect this from them.
Because of the money.
It opened thirty years ago.
I don't know what to do, Nasser!
Land, buildings, and real estate are easy to understand.
I don't know how much they get.
Even the company,
It's your right to go and ask about everything.
And I won't leave them alone.
How will you get back to them?
It's not up to you.
It's not your right either, I have the right to know everything.
Please provide
Your sister gave him a legal power of attorney.
That enables him to examine almost everything in the company.
"Saghyr, Sa'ad"
He's shouting at us.
Saquar, enough.
Brother of Nasser
Excuse me, I'll take it.
Yes, sir.
Go now.
Sorry, go ahead.
Don't give him an excuse to attack us.
Now, if he goes and sues us,
He said you hit him.
I mean, let him do what he wants!
He has an official document.
Official! We can't stop him.
It is his legal right to search everything.
Let's take a look at the budget and accounts.
We give her forty thousand every three months.
If you check the budget,
Multiply twelve by eight.
Divide it into three parts.
Thirty-two
Do you know how much?
This is the amount we owe her.
Except for lands and projects
We are free to do what we want.
We have nothing to fear, we do not fear.
If he differs, this is what we got, and if he agrees, welcome.
Let them go and deal with it.
They only give their sisters enough to live on.
She is married.
She has a husband to rely on.
What do you want to do with the money?
This is what it was supposed to be like from the beginning.
Yes, Chief.
Since he loves
Even my desk.
My brother Rashid, this was supposed to happen earlier.
As you wish, sir.
One file after another
When I learned about her true heritage,
Villas and lands you didn't know about
It turned out that there were seven of them.
It turned out that there were sixteen of them.
That's what I knew.
Poor thing, you're shocked.
Not fair.
Don't leave them alone.
Oh my son! I don't want to hear about courts.
The more interested you are,
The less the judge speaks, the better.
For half a minute
And then he will say his usual phrase,
To the seventh, the fourth, the thousands, I don't know how many.
They will be very happy with my son.
You are not allowed to get out of your bed at all. Oh, Mother!
May God heal you.
No, no, please come in.
Nasser and my sister are bright.
After we closed the door and kicked him out of the company.
He's sending one of my old schoolmates.
His name is Abdullah.
And now
I won't allow him.
I mean, can he influence them?
I hope he is well.
Yes yes yes
Don't rely on fate.
Courts do nothing but reports.
Delays, arguments, and useless lawyers.
The years pass by.
And time passes.
And you won't get a single penny.
God have mercy on Umm Salama.
You advised me a day before you died.
Never go to court.
Our judge said
She died without taking any of her inheritance.
She passed away while the judge had not yet resolved her case.
If we were like other countries,
Hello, Abdullah.
Abdullah's brother
Years passed.
This is my brother, Saad.
I wish you growth and abundance.
The most important thing
Brotherhood is
Brother Rashid
You are my brother.
Don't let financial problems
Do you have anything else to talk about besides my sister?
Excuse me.
Why would I ask him to stop talking?
He is right.
They don't even want me to get my share of my father's inheritance.
My mother told me yesterday that my brother's wife, Saad,
Her father is a messenger at the ministry.
It's all my father's money.
We waited for too long.
We'll try one last time.
I sent them your friend, Abdullah.
They didn't respect him, they expelled him.
Let's see what Sheikh Abdurrahman does.
He is a very kind man.
He said yes, Nasser.
Don't worry.
Intimidate them with the law.
Did you forget what poor Umm Salama said about the courts?
It's possible that Umm Salim's brothers aren't afraid of courts.
But my brothers
He might be afraid of idle talk.
They may be ashamed to go to court.
We have to wait and see what happens after Sheikh Abdul Rahman's visit.
God bless you.
Is this a Friday sermon?
If you don't have it, get out.
What do you say, my son?
He tells the truth.
Go, %pw go.
Go to the court tomorrow morning.
And why do I have to postpone it until after tomorrow?
I'm the one who decides, not you.
What happens if I wait until after tomorrow?
Hello, my brother Rashid
This is a promise.
I've told you this before.
Let's scare them with the law.
Now, he is begging me to postpone going to court.
Because they know you're serious about it, my dear.
It's important that we visit your sister Manira.
What is this?
Oh, you asked me what this is, this is it.
God bless you all.
It's a miniature model of a courthouse.
God bless you.
And all of you
May God protect you.
Didn't you say?
I told you not to go today.
And postpone it until after tomorrow.
To get that sample, this is %pw of the courthouse building.
Ready to guide you.
Enter through this door, this one.
When you enter through the door,
I put all your stuff over there.
Turn off your mobile phone and any metal objects so they do not make alerting sounds.
You're recording the case, they'll ask you to go to the eighth floor, the elevator is one two three four five six seven eight up.
Wander around the offices.
Consult the judge, if you really need a particular judge, for instance.
Also, these.
You want to sue us.
We're here to show her the way.
We'll see when you'll get your revenge.
Either you take the six thousand.
As he said.
Goodbye
We're having dinner at my sister's house today.
I wonder whether the ministry has approved his project.
My sister told me he was very happy, he didn't believe it.
He said, "If they agree on the project, I'll invite you to dinner at my house."
Praise be to God, luck comes in pairs.
Oh, happy Abu Khalid!
Good luck.
My sister told me that he was so happy he couldn't sleep last night.
Praise be to God! Manal!
He is inexperienced in business, but some good men helped him.
Alright, tell your father.
I hope you enjoyed the food.
Thank you, boy!
Thank you, Bou Walid! May God bless you.
May God fill your life with good and health.
It's very delicious, Mother Wael.
Hire an accountant and a secretary to organize your business.
They told me just to rent an office, and they would take care of everything.
Go ahead, Uncle.
Oh my darling, my son.
I want a BlackBerry.
We want a bigger house.
Look, it looks better now.
Dad, didn't we agree that you would nap after lunch?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the owner of the project, my father, Abu Waleed.
Excuse me.
Congratulations, Abu Khalid!
You deserve it.
But, frankly, you're not an expert in business and trade.
Man! There's a story behind this project.
I'll tell you how!
Praise be to God, %pw
Last year,
When the Japanese team played against our national team.
I was at Souk Waqif.
I don't know about him now.
This is a list of factories for multi-purpose halls, our ministry is looking for it, submit a request to them.
Any contractor can build it for you.
He doesn't understand.
Any contractor
The Japanese are wonderful.
When you open it, the computer says "beep beep beep".
Cinema, if you want.
If you want a kitchen, click on kitchen.
When I presented the catalog to the ministry committee,
And what about your contract with the factory?
I paid some.
Deposit
Most importantly, your contract with the factory.
I signed it, praise be to God.
And give me some time until I place the first order.
What are you waiting for?
It's true that they agreed to it.
But we're still waiting for Bo Fahd's signature.
What did the secretary say?
He said that Bu Fahad didn't attend.
Do you want to drink tea?
Oh, Abu Khalid, tell me what you did!
You don't know about Bu Fahd, he might come or he might not.
He suddenly appears one day.
He doesn't have time.
Come on, let's go.
You are the boss here.
Are you going to kill me?
No, he has to sign.
Look at all these files on my desk, all of them need Abu Fahd's signature.
So! What should I do?
God helps you.
"Fifteen minutes till two! Bou Walid"
It's time to go home.
I think Bu Fahd won't come.
God helps you, come tomorrow.
I said that you've known the manager for a long time and he's your friend.
What's wrong with you?
He is a useless manager.
A very stupid manager, they do nothing.
It's a pity they seem wise in a place where they aren't.
They do nothing useful.
Do they do anything? Not at all!
They don't move a chair without the approval of the sheikh.
He's the manager who asked about you yesterday.
People's issues are pending.
It seems you're going to them today as well.
I'm in trouble.
I face problems every day.
Because the factory gave me limited time.
No, I hope not.
And if they ask about you
Not only you are waiting for Bu Fahd.
Look at these files.
They all need Bu Fahd's signature.
I think he will come today.
Please take a seat.
Or take a little walk.
I'll call you when he comes.
If anything happens, I'll call, don't scare them.
Goodbye
I'm sorry for being afraid of you, it's my wife.
Hey boy! They've been sitting on my request for two months now.
I just need his signature, what's this?
Oh son! It's the registration period, my daughter will miss the university scholarship, her papers need to be processed.
My problem with the factory, the deadline, the deadline.
Just wait.
All your papers will be signed.
He's drinking his coffee. Once he's finished, you can come and see him.
Please, I ask you all to be completely quiet.
Yes, sir.
Goodbye
Wait, wait people!
Wait, where are you going, wait.
I want to know what happened first.
What happened?
He has an urgent trip.
He has a private exit.
I'm tired of this.
Our interests have diverged, brother.
We wait for Bu Fahd every day.
What should we do? Wait for Abu Fahd?
Peace be upon you, my father.
Not to be blamed.
Everything is deteriorating.
The factory is in Japan.
Inform him that the deadline has passed.
And your aunt is another story.
Poor thing, she lent him money.
He's getting problems from everywhere.
Oh mother, I am very worried about father.
Don't leave him alone.
Who will you call?
Yes, who is this?
Bu Waleed
To talk about the factory and your brother-in-law's wife's money.
Wait for Bu Fahd.
Dad, how long do you want me to wait?
They always say,
And we are waiting for Bu Fahad.
Oh father! You have done what you could.
But all my friends will be joining university next week.
What are you looking for?
The phone, my love.
Don't worry, give me some time.
Well, who will you talk to?
Wait for Bu Fahd.
I don't know what to say, sister.
You've been very patient with us.
God helps you.
Bu Waleed is in a miserable state.
He is shivering like leaves in a fever.
This is because the deadline is about to expire.
Five days remaining.
He will lose all his money.
God is sufficient for us.
Wow! He's pulling me, pulling me, pulling me.
I wish I could improve. I feel like...
I have an unusual fever.
The top is shaking.
The other part is completely stationary.
Fifty percent of my body isn't working due to the fever.
It's a discount.
Don't worry.
Everything will be alright.
My sister helps.
You will wait until we give her money back.
May Allah reward her with good.
We're not worried about your sister now.
My boss is also like that, God help me.
It seems he heard.
God knows what He has in store.
I'm annoyed with him and Bu Fahd.
He's pulling me, it's a problem.
Tomorrow is the last day.
My money will go.
Don't pull us.
Directly in the brain, in the brain.
How will you be able to speak?
Give it to me, let's see who's calling.
Mr. Bou Walid
I'm calling you because I feel sorry for you.
Be on standby.
Goodbye.
I have been a committed person throughout my life.
You were a good role model.
Don't think I don't notice you leaving work early every day.
I can deduct from your salary.
What's on your phone?
Instead of deducting it from you.
I'll put you on the stock committee.
You will go today with them to the market.
Never leave work during working hours.
If you do that.
Don't blame me then.
Today is his last chance.
Don't you see him anxious, holding his phone waiting for their call?
I'm afraid he'll be fired from his job.
This is my phone, boy! Bou Khaled.
He's pitiful.
Let him go, poor thing.
Oh, my son! Father of Walid
Yes, hello
What's wrong with you, son of Wael! I'm talking to you, not the phone.
Go and finish your research.
Don't worry.
Thank you very much.
It seems that Bu Fahd is here.
How can I help you?
He is a very important officer.
Where are you going?
Let's go to Uzbekistan.
Brother, where is Uzbekistan?
It's the third office on your left.
Don't cough.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't sit.
Don't look at me.
Or do you want to?
House for house
Go ahead.
O people! This man has gone mad.
Do you know how much I spent?
All these years, you.
Taking the papers, returning the papers.
My knees are starting to weaken now.
Running back and forth between all these ministries.
But we were young.
I was carrying bags of rice on my back just like kids' backpacks of potatoes.
Then God willing, I learned to ride a bicycle.
Especially the bicycle that she learned to ride and bought.
* * , Olive green
They were flirting with me when I rode this bike, oh my god.
Our daily bread, raising our children.
The manager has arrived.
We must celebrate after you finish.
Praise be to God, praise be to God.
So, will you quit your job?
I believe you are truly a good citizen.
Now I want to rest, brother, %pw goodbye.
We are all yours.
Don't you want us to grant you an extension for a year?
Enough, enough
May God reward you with good.
You've already given me a four-year extension.
I should have retired a long time ago.
All my children have jobs now.
Lastly, yesterday was his first day at work.
And now, oh! Abu Abdulaziz,
I want to rest.
And you're just a delivery person.
With the traitors
Do you think that
I haven't eaten caviar for four years.
How delicious!
I can smell it now.
We'll do whatever you want.
Transfer me to the Human Resources department.
Have you finished all the paperwork?
Yes, since yesterday.
Your papers will be delayed.
I'm bored.
Okay, done.
Maintain communication.
My son, Khalid.
From this moment on,
I wish to rest, yes.
Great, great
I'm at work and I can't leave.
Can you stop by the Human Resources Department?
I have some papers there.
I want you to take them to the Civil Service Department.
Thank you, thank you, Father.
Where are you going?
I have to go to the bank.
She invites us all.
Yes, now.
I have to go to the bank.
Send it with someone else.
No, sister, I can't leave work.
Okay, bye.
It seems he didn't agree, did he?
He said he couldn't quit his job.
What are you doing?
I will go to the bank tomorrow morning.
He is accustomed to going to work every day.
I'm sure he'll get bored.
This is good for him.
Will you let him rest?
Poor thing, he's happy to be going home early.
He called and said that Khalid...
I sent him to finish his paperwork.
Fear God.
Everyone must rely on themselves.
My mother regrets the khonafrush.
Mom, it won't spoil.
I don't regret it, my daughter!
But I say, since he resigned from the job and left.
Khalid assigned him tasks to accomplish.
He is sleeping in his room.
Those lost in their (singing) sea.
Good morning, Father.
Oh my daughter
Oh Father, please.
But they called me and said the manager was upset.
Give me your papers.
Yes, Saeed's mother.
I told you to let the children be independent, why don't you listen to me?
As if you hadn't resigned.
Poor me.
I am waiting for you, and the coffee pot is in front of me.
We will eat it today.
Goodbye
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
Pardon me, my dear father.
God helps you.
Yes, the one next to the market.
Get out of here quickly.
I left, my daughter, I left.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
God willing.
It's good that you found your home.
Sit, sit, sit
I told you to stay home.
Let your children learn to be independent.
What can I do, Umm Saeed?
They're going through a tough time, I should help them.
Enough, enough, relax.
And I brought you a glass of water.
And the traitor to eat it.
Poor thing, it's so tired.
And taxis
He is naive.
He went to the market branch.
They want her identity.
She didn't even take her car.
And he gave him the papers.
I feel better, praise God.
Rely on yourselves.
I told you.
I want you to relax.
Please sit with us.
Lunch is very delicious.
I was going from one ministry to another.
I run from one ministry to another,
Finishing my children's paperwork.
I took care of them when they were young, and you take care of them now, you spoil them.
My sons are in good positions at work.
They're always busy, what can I do?
There are meetings every day, either with the manager, or with the president, or with the minister.
They have good jobs, once needed they should be present, working %pw.
In order to be able to leave and finish your work, others stop you and force you to sit all the time, what were you thinking?
I'm coming now. God bless you.
I'm coming now, goodbye.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Bou Shahin.
They called me and said it's ready.
If you send your father tomorrow to finish your work,
If that's the case, I'll be late for work.
Fear God.
Impossible, especially tomorrow, I can't.
So he will love you.
Although he is annoyed and tired of your bad behavior towards him.
You don't even respect his age.
He is exhausted and has been sleeping in his room for two days.
Due to wandering the streets under the hot sun.
Let him give you the papers.
And go back immediately to finish it.
A committee, starting from early morning until noon.
Did you hear that, Mother?
Do you want my building's construction to be delayed?
Since you have a deadline and a committee tomorrow,
Your papers must be finished by tomorrow.
Some of them at night.
He has a committee meeting tomorrow, he has to be present.
What's the matter, sir?
Restrained his tears
In fact, I didn't lie to my father.
The committee changed its mind.
They said they would come by the end of the week.
Okay, why didn't you tell him?
Oh father, don't go!
I will go because the committee hasn't come.
Instead of sitting in the cafeteria with these girls.
Deception.
Alright, enough.
I will apologize.
I will
Thank you.
O my father, she is eternal.
He is wrong.
And I'm also selfish.
When he learned that the committee wouldn't come.
We bestow blessings upon you.
From now on, Dad!
We'll do our personal work ourselves.
Stay at home.
Let me kiss your head.
Welcome, welcome, my son!
Good morning
Oh, dear father!
More precious than the whole world to me.
I don't want you to be bothered.
Not annoyed
As I told you,
After finishing this research
I really wanted to do it myself.
He asked me to come urgently.
Since I have a meeting.
With His Excellency the Minister
Pleases me.
To meet VIPs.
I feel happy when they say my children are with him or with that.
Don't worry and go to your work, (singing)
Where is Bouassoud?
Oh Father, please.
The envelope is with me, I'll send it with the tea boy.
I'll send it with the person who brings the tea.
My dear father
Do you mean he didn't sign?
He may have forgotten.
Because the committee will meet in an hour.
No, God bless you.
My son has a meeting with the minister today.
Give me the papers.
This is my daily routine, work, home, work.
I don't see anyone.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, welcome.
Yes, no, I didn't tell him anything.
He is taking a week's holiday and going to the sea.
They said he enjoys himself on the farm.
He goes in the early morning.
He is having a great time there.
And guess what?
They say he is a skilled cook.
And I will go to him.
Goodbye
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you, sir?
God guides you.
No, no, my son, I'm fine, nothing.
Your papers are scattered.
He is at the farm.
And she
Her friend's papers to
I am thirsty, I want water.
Give me water, water.
My dear children
No, no, take this out, I don't want it.
Don't write that.
I want to leave them in suspense.
Thank you, sister.
You're right.
No, no, no, I told him.
You are right, sister.
Sorry, sister.
They call them leagues and cups.
Talk about the referee of the match.
He started talking nonsense.
And they gave him a nickname, "Stop Corruption."
People started inciting against him.
And bring him some gossip to say on television and radio.
And also
They put him in prison.
Believe it or not, sister,
These days, everyone is only concerned about themselves.
Why is he looking for trouble?
Now, I will never, ever do that.
To speak, and say his famous phrase "Stop corruption."
Praise be to God that he is well.
We are blessed by your presence.
Goodbye
I'm late for work, Mom.
Listen, son.
I was warning you.
Last night
Now I just want to remind you.
All right, Mom.
I will never call.
Radio or television, and I won't call Q-tell either.
Your sister, Aisha, was
And your fiancée has been crying all day.
Have mercy on us, O Allah, accept our deeds, and may Allah have mercy on you.
As I said.
I'll stop talking nonsense.
Because I don't want to be bothered.
Your uncle, Manira's father.
I came here two days after you entered prison.
He said it was over.
It will be cancelled.
After many attempts, he finally managed to calm down.
But next time he will drag you to court for the divorce of his daughter.
All right, Mom.
I promised you.
You won't see any good if you call a TV or radio show again.
I told you I wouldn't do it.
Sorry, I must go now.
I'll tell you, but whisper.
The manager told me that
He doesn't want you to work here.
Because you might be talking about management.
And start getting us into trouble.
How will the manager justify that decision?
He has a million excuses to make.
Where am I going!
Are you serious, get independent.
What did I tell you before?
Hello, yes.
Goodbye.
I told you.
You know, for the greater good.
We need to reduce the number of messengers in the ministry.
You're right, but
Please, just once, tell us "Stop corruption."
Sweet.
Stop corruption.
Yes, true.
Still available!
We have work to do.
What a disaster!
Until this problem is solved
What did I tell you?
I told you they would fire him.
And Mona was standing here and heard me say that.
Yes, Father, you did.
I heard them say it myself.
Please go, let me talk to your father alone.
Let me talk to your father.
He went to prison, we considered it a slip and forgave him.
We can't forgive him after he was fired from his job.
Just because we're relatives,
Do you hear this?
Calm down.
Good luck, everything will be fine.
May God guide you to the right path.
I didn't come to drink coffee.
I know you.
I feel bored.
Your uncle gave you two weeks.
I swear he will take you by force to court for the divorce of his daughter.
Even if I go out,
Why do you want to get yourself into trouble?
But be careful.
Even if someone asks you,
Ignore him.
Isn't he the man who stops corruption?
Yes, man, it is.
He seems not to be doing well these days.
We want to hear it, at least once, please let us hear it.
No, absolutely.
Are you police officers?
No, no, Mother, you didn't understand.
I asked him to speak on a radio show about a problem my cousin faced.
He was hesitant.
We felt he was hesitant because we spoke to him in public.
So I suggested to my cousin that we go to his house and talk to him privately.
Did you feel like he agreed?
He was hesitant.
And leave.
Enough, enough, enough
I'm going to be upset and I won't talk to you ever again, hear me?
Are you Saleh Saad?
No, God bless you, enough, I've gotten rid of this habit, praise be to God.
You have a great sense of responsibility.
An ideal employee
But unfortunately,
Although I tried
Peace be upon you
"You shouldn't have."
I was about to call the secretary to tell you not to come.
Shahin, what's up?
I knew it.
Is there anyone living in Qatar who doesn't know about Saleh, Stop Corruption?
Are you righteous, known for fighting corruption?
Stop corruption.
Yes, the job.
There are no vacancies, you know.
It's good that you didn't hire him.
Am I crazy to hire him here?
I've been everywhere, Manira.
Even one of them told me that five minutes before I arrived, there was a vacancy, but they rented it out, I mean, gave it to someone else.
My sister, Aisha, got divorced yesterday.
I'm responsible for them now.
I have a big responsibility now.
I don't know what to do.
He is currying favour with the minister.
But I didn't feel like it was the right thing to do.
I'm afraid this person will take my place.
Enough, stop.
Who said I would be silent?
But I want it done in a way that doesn't affect me.
I'm thinking of a way to get rid of it.
I'll take care of him.
But how?
I know him.
Is he the one talking nonsense on the radio?
I'll bring him to your house.
And just give him the information.
You are dedicated, patriotic and...
A very enthusiastic citizen.
Thank you.
I've really quit that.
I consider your voice the voice of truth.
Bu Fahd, I spoke to him.
Believe it or not, Saleh.
He says, "It's been a long time since we heard him say, 'Stop the corruption.'"
He wanted to meet you.
This is natural, Saleh.
I am toiling in the tent.
Forward, forward, forward
You are one of a kind.
Your kind words.
Your words on the radio are even better.
Let's raise one voice against corruption.
Yes, please, just one, Abu Fahd will say, listen, listen, listen to him.
Stop corruption.
This is the original, sir, this is.
Continue, I don't want you to stop.
I can't.
Then he went out.
Even though I want you to continue solving people's problems and issues.
Listen, Saleh.
I'll give you one problem.
You are the voice of truth.
I want to talk to you alone.
He is a very important person.
You can't refuse, you have to say yes.
Yes, true.
This is your chance.
Opportunities don't come twice.
No, it's %pw.
Don't you understand?
Wait, brother, please.
From these issues and problems
Dear Minister
The ministry ordered eight thousand tubes in its latest project.
A hundred and twenty milliliters of mercury = one atmosphere of pressure.
But this employee
To approve the pipes that
Because he wants to take the balance.
Stop corruption.
Thank you, thank you very much, Brother Saleh, stop the corruption.
No, God bless you.
This call is a special request.
I wish you could hear him.
The final station of corruption... Stop corruption.
Do you know?
His need compelled him to do it.
This is the last one.
The sultan was deposed.
Did the minister dismiss him immediately?
He provided accurate information.
Now, Boufahd can do whatever he wants.
I'll do all the tasks.
Yes, sir.
Certainly, Minister.
Goodbye.
Stop corruption.
It was definitely the last time, I won't do it again.
And these are the requirements for the job, sorry, I was joking.
They got what they wanted.
Listen to me.
Because he fears that one day will come.
Exposing and revealing his bad deeds.
For criticism and exposing corruption,
They fear you.
They deceived me, my sister, Aisha.
You're kind.
Your uncle is Manira's father.
I assure you that I will find a job.
People who criticize are fools.
They are hateful, they despise our homeland.
Do we have any problems?
We have no favoritism.
I haven't heard this word before.
In our government circles,
We don't have any bribes.
What we know.
Employee
Does a foreigner get more than a citizen? No, never.
We produce everything locally.
The problem of which family you belong to, we never face such problems at all.
If your manager or supervisor gets angry at you,
We are the best people.
Our country is the best country.
Free of any problems.
And thank you.
What did you say on the radio yesterday?
Mom, I want candy.
No candy until dinner.
So, no candy.
Why is your shirt torn?
Mom, Adoul and I were playing.
I know you were playing.
But what tore your shirt?
Enough of God for you, Adoul!
Come and see what your mischievous nephew did.
I told you it was expensive, we don't need to buy it, and you said it's fine, Walid will like it.
Let's see what he did.
The shirt is now unusable.
That's why he's not afraid, no one can stop him.
Mom, where's the candy?
Look how it's torn, it's clearly deliberate.
Poor infant
He was happy to wear this shirt for the first time.
He will see it.
Where is Adol?
In the garden
Why, what happened?
Something between me and him.
Don't tear it.
Be ashamed of your face.
Don't argue with a child.
A child should not be left to do as he pleases.
It was not repaired.
Don't ask me to watch my language.
Are you a repairman?
We will educate them.
Behave politely.
Don't argue with him.
Why are you arguing like children?
Stay away from this matter.
Don't interfere.
He brings up his children well.
He is a child.
You can't tell the difference between a child and an adult because you're angry.
Do you know?
It's not your fault.
Let's go up the stairs.
They don't deserve it.
Wasting our time responding to them.
One should not
Where people loved each other.
Okay, okay, I'm coming, goodbye, goodbye.
But, sir, some papers have to be signed by you; the minister wants to see them.
Alright, alright, I'll talk to the minister, don't bother me.
Did you see the disaster, the calamity?
It's new, no, Aisha!
This is not child's play.
You're right.
Spoiled the clothes.
Look, look
This is unwearable.
Look at Adol's pants; they can cover one leg, while the other remains exposed.
It's clear that this wasn't torn by hand.
It appears to be torn with a power saw.
And Allah is sufficient for us.
I'll tell you.
Who wants candy? Come here.
And I know too.
If you know, take a tour around the villa.
I love you, not just because you know how to ride a bike,
Also because of something else
You speak the truth indeed.
Okay, do you want candy?
Yes, I want two.
I'll give you four pieces.
Who tore our clothes in the closet?
How did your father cut it?
He has a large pair of scissors that can even cut a car.
Under the bed, take all the candy.
Not to that extent.
No one else can do this thing.
Why do we have to be quiet?
The most important thing
Is this because we insist on what we say?
It was Walid, a child, who tore the clothes.
Which computer?
What's he talking about?
Those cracks are impossible for a child to make.
Why don't you believe me?
Go hang out with your friends.
One moment, please.
You're always like this.
Struggle every day, my son!
The past days
I seek forgiveness from Allah and wellness.
God guide you.
Who can carry such a large pair of scissors?
Go and find yourself some friends.
You liar, my mother.
He went and brought this big pair of scissors.
Act, Sultan! Gosh.
Come and find a solution to this, come son!
How will I start?
Each one of you
You are parents.
A child is born.
When a child is born,
You are my brothers.
Listen to me and reconcile with each other.
Well, tell me, what will you do now?
What do you mean, you tore their clothes?
It's nothing compared to the disaster he caused. I lost all my documents and information; he corrupted everything.
I won't leave him.
He speaks in a very formal Arabic, just like the language used in museums.
Ignore him.
He will knock knock knock until he gets tired and then leave.
He's crazy, and my brother and I know him well.
And you shook hands.
He is full of hatred and envy.
He's upset because I broke the computer.
Oh, Fahad
Solan, hit him, hit him, hit him.
"Fear God, O children!"
Hit him, hit him, [shut up] be careful, [shut up]
Take your relatives, and play with them outside.
God guide you.
May God humble you.
Adult men
What did you leave for the children?
All right, Mom.
Your brother, Abdurrahman
Maybe the last time, son!
You know he's the older brother, girls!
He knows how to talk to people.
And argue
Don't bother me.
I'm supposed to
Play a role
God guide you.
Even you, you've become like them, my son!
Mother, they hit my son, a conspiracy against us, and you say, %pw, stay away from us.
Go away.
Blood is coming out of my son.
You've embarrassed us, kids!
It was the children who were throwing them.
He doesn't want to believe.
I saw them.
We told him it was the children, but he didn't believe us.
He said from his window.
He saw them as children throwing stones, and due to the distance, he mistook them for adults.
I am not crazy.
You can go.
You can be tired or dizzy.
Do you know who they are?
And you're telling me they're throwing stones?
It seems
Oh, dear!
I'm telling you to go home and rest. They signed an undertaking. What more do you want?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
What is this, oh my God, oh my God.
"Hazbunnallah wa ni'ma al-wakil" Translation: "God is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs."
Mother, Mother
All this is because of you.
Because of you.
Your men, but they behave like children, very sick minds.
Take me to the hospital, I'm going to faint, I'm going to die.
Yes, and this isn't the first time I've seen him.
And I noticed that he wouldn't take his eyes off you.
He is not enrolled in the business class.
But he has been attending class with us for a week.
It's clear he's eager to get to know you.
Don't be like that, he admires you this much, don't be too hard on yourself.
No, my sister.
I don't want him to think I'm easy.
I ran after him.
Let's keep it casual.
Now he's running after you, eager to know more about you.
It's true that I still love him.
But, I don't feel it's the right time.
One hundred percent
She looks at you and...
Are you waiting for her to come and say, "Excuse me, may I introduce myself"?
Take the initiative.
You're right.
But I'm waiting for the right opportunity.
The right opportunity
What are you waiting for? Are you enrolled in the same class as her?
What did the teacher say?
Please ask her, miss.
Oh my God, what's her name?
We've been exchanging glances for three months.
But they never recognize each other.
You are very old.
Which means you have to go and say "Excuse me,
Can I get to know you?
Not to that extent.
I have to wait for the right opportunity.
A quiet and polite girl.
I don't know what you're looking for.
We finished filming all the episodes yesterday.
Yes, certainly.
You never forget us.
As long as I'm free.
He is buying the villa that is located behind our villa for his father.
Tomorrow, when he gets married, he won't live far from us.
It's too late now.
You're late.
You didn't know.
I saw it empty a few days ago, who bought it?
And they bought it through a housing loan from the Development Bank.
God bless their home.
Hello, hello, my son, good morning.
Uncle, start the engine.
Thank you, my son. May God reward you with good.
Hello Nora, let's go outside, the car is running now, come on, I'll give you a ride.
And peace be upon you too.
What do you want?
Neighbors talk to each other, what do you want?
It's best if you leave us alone.
Neighbors talk to each other, you don't belong here.
A kind man parked his car behind mine, I can't get mine out.
So, if you don't mind, give me your car keys.
Even the car key
I'll leave you in this tense atmosphere, like that of the Titanic.
Goodbye
Goodbye.
Now you know a lot about me.
I just know that you're Waleed.
Walid Rashid Abdullah
Certainly, when they hear your father's name, many people will think you are the son of the famous actor.
Same name, God willing.
In fact, my father is Rashid Abdullah, the actor.
Is Rashid Abdullah, the famous actor, your father?
You're eating cookies! Why didn't you have dinner with them?
Tell me,
How did you know that the famous actor, Rashid Abdullah, is our neighbor?
Yes, of course.
My friend at university, get to know them, she told me.
He loves his acting, and has only watched his works.
He finally said that we live next to a famous and valuable person in the community.
My heart, what happiness like this!
He's very cute and has a great sense of humor.
And his son is a good man, he helped me, may God count it as a good deed for him.
It is said that
Do you know what?
Do you know why I want to take a picture with him?
Mom, talk to my cousin, Aboud.
I read an interview with him in the newspaper.
He said they would film a series about diving.
Your luck, it brought you a sheep, a gift for the new villa.
He proved to be a good neighbor.
Hello Saleh, any news?
In fact, we have many names.
They told me, yes! Abu Saad, may God bless you, that my name is on the (list).
That will be determined according to the needs and experience of the staff.
We don't know.
We may not transport you.
I'm sorry, I won't be able to do anything for you.
Thank you.
We wanted to move and settle first, and then, when God blesses us with wealth, we'll buy furniture.
You did the right thing.
Hey! Bouali
Don't consider me a stranger.
Whatever you need,
I'm ready to help.
Neighbors are a support for each other.
But now I have heard and seen.
This is good, God willing, you are an expert in furniture.
So, I'll go with you.
Don't worry, sister!
Whenever you want to choose the furniture, let me know.
My love, your father has applied for a loan. If approved, we'll change the furniture completely.
And I repeat it again,
Feel free to ask me anything.
We're like family now.
Can't your sister study without your help?
But I want her to be independent.
I'm sure you were talking to her!
Should I lie and say he's my friend?
Oh my son, oh Ali!
I have no objection to that.
As long as she loves me and I love her, I'll solve the problem.
You're dreaming.
Let me suggest your cousin to you.
Leave it to me.
As you like it.
They will reject you.
We'll see.
Good night.
Good night.
What's wrong with you, Abu Ali?
Oh brother! The car broke down.
Every now and then, it bothers me.
My daughter, God bless her, has a lecture.
And this car is always breaking down.
Your daughter is our daughter.
No problem.
No need to trouble yourself, brother Rashid!
No, God bless you.
The car is parked in the yard, and the driver is sitting idle.
It seems the development bank bought you a house and a car.
It's our car.
Our neighbor Rashid Abdullah's car.
I see that relations are evolving.
We will discuss matters of mutual interest that benefit both parties.
Oh my God, this is a huge development.
Let's go.
Oh Mother, this is embarrassing.
You didn't agree.
She said that Nour is like my daughter, and the driver will take her to university every day.
I told her that my father's car would be under maintenance for a week.
I swear, no.
She said he would drive her every morning.
And God is a witness, O Mother of Ali!
They are good people.
No, no, no, man!
There is no power or might except from God.
Oh no, oh no, what am I going to do now?
What can I do, I have responsibilities.
Who will see my daughter off to college?
Goodness! Oh, Abu Ali, since you are recommended by Mr. Rashid Abdullah.
We cannot refuse your request.
Bu Saad, Bu Saad
I'm sorry, Abu Saad.
Bu Ali knows how much we love him.
Thank you, may God reward you, Abu Saad!
They love you, God willing.
This is sweet.
Oh people! Mr. Rashid is busy, let him go.
Sorry, sorry, Mr. Rashid, if we've wasted your time.
No problem.
Lucky you, you have good relations.
We are your friends and brothers, take care of us when we need something.
Just tell me where you want it to be, and I'll get it for you.
What happened? What's wrong with you? Why are you dragging me?
Are you going to propose to Manal for me?
Agree, Mother, agree.
Manal talked to her mother about me.
Why don't you believe?
Umm Waleed
Dresses too, do you have a party?
I don't understand.
Oh God, may Waleed also get married soon, the apple of my eye.
She called me, poor thing.
She's taking some accessories.
Not accessories! Jewelry.
Is this my mother?
You will also go in a fancy car.
Insha'Allah, Insha'Allah
Inshallah, I can't see you.
This is a great kindness from Wael's mother.
In addition to all that, she gave you the car.
With the driver.
If I went with you like this, they wouldn't believe that this feeble man is the husband of the queen.
Oh my God
Are you going in this outfit?
Oh my God, no, no, no, no, no, don't worry.
I'll change my appearance, you won't be able to recognize me.
They're surprised and think I'm a sheikh.
Give him coffee, he'll live longer.
Oh, Abu Ali, by God, I didn't recognize you. I thought you were someone important, but no, you're not Abu Ali. You're not Abu Ali.
What do you think?
You even have a different walk.
May God bless you, welcome to those we will suggest to Ali.
They are VIPs.
I arranged everything from the headscarf to the car.
I'm sure I'll find it with you.
In the last series you acted in.
There was an event, as I recall, a wedding.
You were wearing a shiny black bisht.
And I also want you to teach me how to wear a bisht.
Because God gives you health, I never wear dishdashas in my life.
Inshallah, you look great.
Thus, when you enter the guest room
This is not correct.
My brother, Rashid,
Do you have button-down sleeves?
Good evening
He who is always with me and is eternal.
That's why.
Oh my darling, you are my child.
We are a family now.
And we don't want our daughter, Nour, to be far from us.
Nora suits Waleed.
He told me he sees her at university and that he won't find a better wife than her.
We are blessed by this.
I will tell her father, and hopefully God will grant us both good.
Why did they reject him? What's the reason?
Because his father is an actor.
Ask your father to come.
Quickly, Rashid wants to see you.
Where are you, oh!
I'm screaming from sadness.
Because his father is an actor.
You have no shame.
I am an actor.
Nevertheless, I am acting honestly.
I've been acting on stage for a few hours, and my part is nearing its end.
When the acting is over.
You're playing roles.
I'm acting.
I convey a beneficial vision.
But you
I wear costumes to embody roles.
On the stage
But you
You wore it in the guest rooms.
The Role of the Rich and Wealthy Woman.
Who is the actor?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be sad, Wael!
Lift your head.
It's a shame.
You missed the scene.
I heard her scream at him, "Don't look back, don't look back," poor thing, it broke my heart.
and walk straight ahead
Just like a horse.
It's Thursday, man! Thursday.
It's Thursday.
His wife is crazy.
She is jealous of other women.
That's why he walks like that.
So that he may not see women, and no woman may see him.
You see how his wife is driving him crazy.
Straight, do not turn your face.
I'll introduce him to his office tomorrow.
Thursday, please, please show them the view of the city center.
Thursday, show me the view of the city center.
Didn't you name this shopping center after your wife?
Let's Thursday
I'll go see what Salem wants.
Poor him.
When will you change!
If you only hear what they say about you.
Even before my eyes, they say more than that.
Why does she do that?
She's jealous of the women around me.
Why are you so jealous?
When I sometimes sit in front of the TV
She, come on.
I swear by God.
No, no, a hundred times no.
Hello, peace be upon you, my sister.
You see this,
I spoke to her just now, in front of you, I heard a man's voice.
I swear to God, sometimes she throws my clothes in the street.
Respect yourself and divorce her.
I'm having trouble divorcing her.
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
Don't come any closer to me, stay there.
What's on your mind?
Nothing bad.
Who are you talking to?
You're wasting your time with these good-for-nothing people.
Especially this fat man, he is the person I hate the most among your friends.
He has chubby cheeks and hair like a child's plant.
This impudent person doesn't know shame.
Are you going to torture me in my grave?
Let me talk to her.
Tell me, how are you?
Who are you talking to!
I don't see anyone here.
Salem, what's wrong! What happened!
Our friend Thursday has gone crazy.
After a while, he turned towards the wall and started talking to himself.
Burst out laughing.
Khamis is a poor man.
He always imagines his mother and wishes he could speak to her.
God saved his wife.
They say Thursday is with you.
He is busy now, receiving an international call, so far away that the connection is cutting out.
What does the message say?
God help you, Thursday!
Why are you awake!
I'm sleepless, I can't sleep.
Regarding tomorrow's meeting.
With the women's delegation at the ministry.
Is it possible if they were
God guide you, O Thursday!
These names were selected by the Office of the Minister.
But, come on.
Why are you afraid of her?
If you're talking to Salem, why would you hide him then!
Speak the truth.
Why are you hiding behind the water tank?
This is exactly it.
I saw the last number called, read, it's with you.
The last number!
I called the last number after deleting the woman's number you were talking to.
Tell me, what's her name!
I told you, I told you, I told you.
I told her that I was talking to Salem.
My friend at work, Salomon.
She didn't believe me.
What are you wearing?
Are you going on a diving trip?
I swear to God, brother, you didn't let me change my clothes!
Who do you want me to call!
Call my wife.
Call my wife.
Tell her, "My brother, give me a pen, I'll give you the number."
You help each other.
You men are always like this.
You are just like him, a liar, I'll show you.
If you interfere again, I will go to the minister's office.
She cursed me.
And she threatened me that she would complain about me to the minister's office.
She is very brave.
She plans to destroy my career.
I was wrong to listen to you and contact her.
Listen, Thursday!
She complained about me in the minister's office.
He will come with me and tell the whole truth, and keep me away from this matter.
This is none of my business.
You are a coward.
Sisters and brothers
Good morning, everyone.
I was pleased to attend the meeting.
Where are the others?
He fled.
Where is Thursday?
He's coming.
Turn off your mobile phone.
Alright, don't turn it off, leave it in the office.
Meet for only one hour.
This is not my phone.
The war began.
Oh my God, he has been living with you since that day.
Where can he go?
He can't go.
And since that day, his status has not changed.
Jealous, he feels envious of women's presence around him.
This is not jealousy.
He sits alone here in the living room at night.
He says she is my mother.
Mother! Mother is dead.
That's why you called me, to find a solution for me.
I asked you to move from the section with women.
Is it a military decision?
Look at the signature, it's very clear at the bottom.
Oh brother, I'm sorry, I've been transferred to the social welfare department.
Social Welfare Department! Are you sure they transferred you there?
Why is it strange?
Thank you, may God bless you.
Are you, pardon, Mr. Khamis?
The minister's office called and informed us.
Have you been to your new department?
Who's in the office with you?
Article, Saleem, Jasim,
Oh my goodness! The minister decided to transfer you, Khamis, just yesterday.
I only moved to the new department today.
I explained to you my problem with my family.
The minister decided to transfer you.
So I must go to the minister.
He started his annual vacation today.
He will return after a month and a half.
What a hassle.
If you want my opinion,
The minister will tell you the same thing.
Work there until we find you another place; this time he transferred you because so many people told him about your problem with your wife.
I'm telling you the truth.
And what shall we do!
Do not talk when your wife is on the phone.
You never know, they might comply with you, beg them.
I asked them to put the abayas in the car, I put them in the trunk for you.
How much?
I put ten while you put five in the office, which means two for each.
It seems he is very afraid of his wife.
Imagine he gave us all male names.
He calls me Abdelkader.
What's his name?
He is kind and handsome, which is why she is afraid other women might like him.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. What's wrong with her?
Who called me?
Yes, Abdelkader, who sits next to Hassan, is over there behind Khalil.
These abayas, each one can choose what she likes.
Look at this.
How much is this?
What's wrong, what happened?
Excuse me.
Where is the social welfare office?
There are supposed to be five employees.
What's your name?
I am handsome.
I'm crazy, my wife drove me crazy.
I am crazy.
She presented the project to us.
And I met them.
What did they say?
They said.
Muna, make tea.
I can't.
Do you want me to go back to the kitchen and stain my clothes?
Go now, go make us some tea.
Come on, come on, nonsense.
Go, listen to what the men say.
Don't forget that we are the sons of Al-Aqra' (the Scorpions).
Come on, come on, bring me some tea without sugar, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
The bank said the project was good.
I called him several times, his phone is busy.
Poor things, they've been waiting for you for a while.
My brothers are as usual.
One of them took a month-long leave, traveled three months ago, and hasn't shown up since.
Farewell, O Generous God.
And all changes are in our favor.
Pour us
Yes, but if you build a garden
It will take up space equivalent to at least two or three villas.
The park is a place for the residents of the complex to relax.
Men don't need women's opinions.
Keep it to yourself.
Put the tea and leave.
There is no garden.
One moment, please.
Sister, you know I love football.
Your uncle and your brothers will kill you if they find out you're playing it at school.
What are you planning, suicide?
See, I told you.
I suggest you forget about it.
Don't hurt yourself.
No, no, no, no, I'm upset with you.
I've been busy.
Forgive me, you are our blessing.
Oh Uncle Shahin, I'm here.
Inshallah
Is this Thursday?
Adult
He came of age.
I'm tired of searching for a woman for him, I couldn't find one.
I come from a family with deep roots.
You know,
Leave the matter of his marriage to me.
Is this from the HR department?
Yes, may God grant you a long life.
Put it aside.
I have a few comments on his suggestions.
Well, may God grant you a long life.
Anything else?
No, may God grant you a long life.
Take care of them and I'll meet them when I find time.
What did you do about the employees I sent you yesterday?
What's wrong with you?
I'm leaving now, I'll call you later.
What happened?
Are you crazy?
We are your older sister.
We suffered from them.
Did you know they asked me what I play at school?
I told them that you play table tennis.
You're lucky they didn't kill you.
This was just an appetizer.
Do you know who we are?
What is our origin?
Do you know what this means?
This time, we smashed your face.
Scorpion Leader
Small scorpion
Oh uncle, let me slap the pyramid in the face.
That was enough.
Save it for next time.
You've changed your mind! Didn't you say you wanted architecture?
Are you crazy?
A Scorpio's daughter cannot work in the streets with men.
Engineering and Construction
You'll embarrass us.
Let me break her head.
No, no, Sultan, no
Certainly, O Scorpion Chief.
You just defeated Fatoum.
Let your brother take a chance, you jerk.
Alas.
Possible, O Darkening, at least you received a slap on your face.
Look at my face.
Why do they want you to go with them tomorrow morning?
What do they want?
Come here.
Walk, in front of me.
Where are you going?
Don't say a word.
Where are you going?
I told you to shut up, don't say a word.
And write instructions instead.
Or even nursing, we have no objection.
What else do you want?
You have two options.
To know that we are open-minded.
Never say that we forced you to change.
Nursing, or education
Go away.
Bring us a copy of the order.
Go, get away.
Scorpion Leader! Oh, my son.
The very same scorpion proposed to you.
Thank you, Uncle! But when is the engagement?
Muna is a lady.
What you ask for is difficult.
Oh God, I can't travel! Bou Khaled.
I have personal circumstances.
Recommended by the minister.
Difficult.
Reconsider the matter.
Don't decide now, think about it until tomorrow.
Why did they let you work!
That's why they say nothing.
I have a suggestion.
Ask someone to travel with you.
Girls should not travel.
This is nonsense.
No problem!
You should be grateful that we allowed you to go to work.
Go tomorrow and inform them that you can't travel.
Be quiet, don't argue.
Listen and be silent.
Thursday is the son of Scorpions.
He is related to us.
It's true that he's an idiot and he has no diploma.
But he is a scorpion.
What are you planning to do, sister?
What can I do, Fatima!
I am weak and bankrupt.
What can I do?
There's nothing I can do.
What can you do?
The engagement is next Monday.
I'll call you to come over according to the sheikh's arrival time.
What a beautiful laugh!
Go buy yourself a new dress.
Go and buy new clothes, son!
I love this laughter.
Oh brother, I beg you.
I don't want to hear a single word.
Prepare us tea, coffee, and cake.
Lucky you, Aisha! You're the minister's friend now.
I'm afraid it's just a rumor. Hello, Khalid!
Manira is a candidate to be a minister in a new ministry within the new ministerial structure.
Muna deserves all the best.
I hope it's not just a rumor.
Will you go to work tomorrow?
And we must all cooperate to serve this country.
With the efforts of each one in their place, thank you.
I wish you all success.
Thank you for your happiness.
Thank you = Ambassador's happiness
Thank you.
Welcome, please come in.
Peace be upon you
Yes, with soap as you requested.
He is the general supervisor of the women's football league.
Ask him about Fatima's play.
Inshallah
Captain Fatima scored two goals as a professional player.
Captain Fatima is talented, my brothers!
Captain, what do you think of Fatima's play?
She is a good forward player.
She's going to travel to China.
Captain, isn't China a bit far?
God bless you.
Your sister will play an important match.
She was studying education, but I went today and submitted a transfer request for her.
She will study architecture.
There is no difference between man and woman.
Really? Go and serve the coffee.
Where are you going?
I'm tired of waiting.
Fool, are you a fool?
Go, kiss your mother and tell her you've been fired.
Go, *
Oh stupid one.
The coffee in the pot you have has gone cold.
They call all year round, but if they know you have a TV series, they call.
Hello, how are you, how are the kids!
What did you tell her?
I told her you'd be in the series with us.
Certainly, she will be the main character.
Look, Ali, Shaula will play the role of Nouf.
There's something called makeup, which can make her look younger.
Mary's role is limited to twenty-six or twenty-seven episodes.
Let Shaula benefit.
He's going to give us endless lectures.
I'm afraid he'll be a nuisance to us.
Most importantly, he must not know that the producing company is yours, you and Hamad.
I hope I'm not late.
And Rashid is here too.
The manager and the actors are ready.
For the sake of time, folks, let's start the meeting!
Please tell us your opinion.
Hamed, do you want to say something?
Frankly, I think it's the best.
You saw when the maid committed suicide.
You know the most impactful part for me.
That was when the maid committed suicide.
When she hung herself from a fan, spun around, and bled to death.
They found him and his mother wept for her son, it's moving.
And he kept kicking until he reached the courtyard of the house.
Is it exciting?
The police come, search the house, and arrest the mother.
It's really a great series.
I was about to perform the trick here on this table.
It's really an extortion of the artistic conscience.
Social
It's all about extraordinary events.
Unreasonable
Seventy-two murder cases.
What's with the crying?
You're known for holding people up.
No problem, Mr. Hamed, let's be open-minded.
Let's have a majority vote.
Mr. Nasser, don't claim openness and use the majority as an excuse, these things don't hold up to a critical assessment of artistic production.
You're involved in this because of your government job.
Goodbye.
I heard the doorbell ring.
There was an Indian man carrying a bag in his hand.
He asked me, "Are you Ms. Hassa?" I replied, "Yes."
I opened the suitcase.
It was a ring worth around seventy to eighty thousand.
I'm afraid the Indian man brought these things by mistake.
No, not by mistake.
Her name is Samira.
Hamed's wife, the supervisor at the company.
A gift from her to you, may God bless you.
Yes, this is for you.
The ring is very extravagant.
I never dreamed of owning a ring like this.
God bless you, Hassa! My darling!
Yes, that's it, I call it the chain of yeses.
Ali and Hamad own the production but they are employees there, and they cannot provide it under their names.
What will take us more than the ring?
Don't share this with anyone, keep it between you and me.
Am I crazy to do that?
Your brilliant husband
Who is known as the Magician?
Only five percent, that's a small amount.
No, that's good, they agreed to four million for them.
Your husband will get two hundred thousand riyals, that's good.
I think we'll give the college student role to Nada.
It's a wonderful role, I fell in love with a man and ran away on a bicycle.
The series we will produce is called Blackmail of Conscience.
They talked to me about the role in the series.
I really want to know.
Gulf soap operas are always like this; this year's trend is blackmail.
Well, tell me, my brave one, what is my role?
And you too, my love, your place is secured.
Don't disappoint me.
I'm coming, coming now.
I made all this breakfast, don't go and leave me.
This is Omar, the manager's secretary.
God preserve us.
He never asked to see me at this time.
And tell him that it will be a weak and silly series.
Don't waste your money on him.
Well, then, what happened next?
God protect me, what should I say, I'm afraid Rashid told them something bad about the series.
Don't be afraid.
Leave it to me.
A mentally ill person.
Social series
I just saw her on TV.
No, may God prolong your life.
The series currently airing on television is called "Blackmailing a Young Flower."
But, I think the budget they're asking for is too high.
He needs a large budget.
But don't forget that the producing institution is a local one.
We need to support him.
It doesn't matter.
Have you read the arts page?
We heard they'll start filming the series "Conscience Exortion."
And a huge budget is allocated to it.
However, it was said that the series was weak.
Others mentioned that the series consisted of a school teaching corruption.
They are likely to stop filming.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Welcome. Come in, please have a seat.
Good morning
Good morning, welcome.
I'm El-Monir, a journalist, and I have an appointment with Mr. Hamed, if you don't mind.
Yes, alright, please sit down for a moment, he's in a meeting.
Mercury, this will enable us to use the KON design.
By the way, we will reach out to all the world's correspondents to get in touch with us.
This is your task.
Mercury Media Production Company
And discuss its issues in a way that makes it the best production in the history of the world.
Can you believe who wrote this?
He has no shame.
Do we have a journalist like this?
Do we have a journalist like this?
A journalist must have a moral sense.
They work.
You think they're here for *
I met the minister, do you know what he told me?
It's a very tragic and extraordinary event.
The first episode is tomorrow, I'll watch it with people.
What do you think, Mom?
Hello Mom, it's just the first episode.
Have you seen people talking to themselves, except in Gulf series?
Also, have you seen a mother who wants to kill her children, except in your shows?
My son! Art is a tactic, and it is not strange to generalize it to people and society.
Mother, this can be done in fine arts, but drama is completely different.
Don't give me a headache.
It seems they are imitating the Turks.
Don't judge now, at least watch the first five episodes.
This series is a failure.
We can't let our children watch it.
Not to that extent, brother.
There are worse shows, and watching them on TV.
In fact, no one.
It's your fault.
For everyone, in every home.
Go and gather the people who understand these dimensions and hidden lines.
And made it known to them.
Not for us.
Tell me, what happened?
The minister passed by with some guests.
I stood up to welcome him.
We agreed to produce the series.
Why would the minister be impressed?
Alright, let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleague wrote that
I only publish messages that say something good about the series.
No, no, don't worry.
Read the newspaper tomorrow and I will publish praise messages from me and will mention that viewers sent them.
Inshallah
You will be happy.
For this year
Well, if they have a deal with him.
It's the best series in the history of Gulf drama.
They are all in agreement with them.
Alright, let's assume they all have an agreement with them.
I will only read the translation.
I hope they rerun the series "Guilty Conscience."
Thank you, Minister of Arts, for that series.
I wish they would repeat it again.
When the minister's office first called me
We can come to collect the final installment of money for the series.
They were right to call you the wizard.
That wasn't everything.
The profits were rewarding, so we cashed out.
Also, the serial number is invalid.
The writer himself told me that he regretted writing it.
I'm here to propose a second part to the series.
The minister believed the ruse I concocted from the press.
Believed the fake success we created.
He is not satisfied with the series.
This means it's impossible for him to agree to a second term.
I assure you that the minister himself will request a second part.
I can't help but
Thank you.
To all people
Who worked on this series?
And congratulate them on his success.
They all deserve it.
In fact, winning those awards from distinguished festivals
Proves that there is
That's what you think.
You are creative.
I will certainly win the gold prize.
What was he saying?
He said, "If the readers and the press lie to me."
Yes, why not have a second part?
As long as Arab and Gulf TV festivals are artistic whitewashes.
Art money laundering!
I've heard about money laundering.
It's not art.
Illegal funds
The series are the same.
What can we do with "One Two"?
What do you mean?
Haven't we signed a contract with them? They should be bound by it.
Write them.
Our products are exported worldwide, bread in all its types and shapes, thin, large, small, triangular, and diverse.
What did we agree on in the contract?
Two million US dollars
What did you do to the Australian baker?
He is the inventor of bread.
No one told you about his product?
Not exactly, but they told me it's bread, but I don't know what's in it.
It's a zipper bread.
Soustha
Instead of slicing bread, (samon) as you call it = semolina bread.
The inventor tried to make it easy.
Jean baked bread.
This is the secret.
You eat bread with the crust.
These people make very strange things.
This soda (zipper) is amazing, it's made in a way that makes it melt in your mouth as soon as you put it in.
It can have different flavors, strawberry, ketchup, coffee.
Do you know how much money I've invested in this project?
Three million dollars, with patents.
Go ahead, Sameh!
Yes, Abu Nasser.
Yes, sir, I am at your service.
We delivered it today, sir.
Say "Ya! Samih"
We were with your son Nasser yesterday, playing football in his team.
I agreed with him.
To form his team of drivers and security men,
And it's also an incomplete team, we only have one goalkeeper, if he gets injured we'll be in trouble.
I'm supposed to have fans too.
When you took seventeen players,
I didn't say anything.
Important people in the company.
Indispensable ones
The hospital's bakery took the pastries.
Why do you upset the man?
I said he couldn't, he's from a well-known family, he can't run after a ball and embarrass himself.
He can do what he wants.
But don't take the necessary ones.
What can I do, Mom? Our team has a match and I need four players.
No more excuses.
Okay, what's done is done.
Hamdi didn't show up for work today, sir.
I went with him.
He said, "Wear it."
And they were leaving me standing in the goal area.
The match has started.
Then I didn't feel anything.
They told me the ball hit me while I wasn't paying attention.
Have you ever worked as a goalkeeper?
I only played because Nasser asked me to play.
"There is no power or strength except by Allah."
We're tired of your love for football.
From now on, Nasser!
No football.
You need to disband your team.
And all the bakers must return to their bakeries.
What do you think?
Fatima, it's
I don't want to hear anything.
O Abu Nasser!
Listen to what he wants to say.
Alright, I will, just because you asked me to.
Speak, what did you want to say?
Tomorrow, we will be witnessing the final match of the tournament.
Don't bother him, Abu Nasser, please, I beg you.
Alright, folks!
Congratulations, congratulations
Okay, okay, okay, congratulations.
Professor Nasser, I want to speak with you for a minute, please!
Thank you, my team was on time today.
Mr. Nasser, we must
You promised us a party.
Would you like me to order and book a hall at the hotel for you?
And invite the press and journalists to come there.
No, Rashed! We'll keep it at our house.
So that my father doesn't cancel it when he sees the players and their success.
They won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup.
I hope so.
No, no, I saw him taking pictures with the players and he was with them talking to the press.
It seems that Sami, the sports page editor, is interviewing him.
Photographic image
Keep it close to me.
Take a good picture.
He is happy.
Your comment on your baker sons' victory made them happy.
Vital Optimist
And the effort.
And loyalty to the bakery.
Excuse me, Abu Nasser, we saw the team playing with a 4-4-2 formation.
Loyalty to the bakery and the coach's plan.
Thank you, Uncle Bo Nasser.
May God protect you.
Hello, goalkeeper.
The reporters and cup broadcasters will come to interview you.
No, these are not councils.
They sent their representative to conduct the interview.
Bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup
You know, we encourage the youth.
I expect a bright future for them.
Yes, goodbye.
Insha'Allah, your phone will always ring, and your pictures will be in the newspapers. May God bless you in this ball.
Do you know who was talking to me on the phone?
He lowered the price of the engines, and I said okay.
Yes, you've become famous now, and under every picture of you in the papers, they write "World Bakery's Top Athlete."
Wasn't I interested in football?
What are you saying?
Since I was in school
The person who sat next to me loved football.
You say I wasn't close to football.
Since the person next to me plays football, I am close to football.
Being close to sports means I'm a sportsman.
So we are no longer the international virgins, but have become international football.
I heard him say yesterday that he would make it a sports club.
And today we meet the first athlete in global bakeries, Bo Nasser.
To promote football
Before the match, tell us about your expectations before going on stage.
The game is difficult today.
The team that controls the midfield will be the winner today.
Yes, God willing, we are in contact with agents of professional players to develop the International Bakery Team.
His name is Saud, listen, we want commitment.
Yes, he wants the previous deal for the players.
He was useless.
When I gave you the prices
I gave you the international price.
So, isn't the Gulf part of the world?
Of course not.
This is none of your business.
Just let me know once if a buyer from the Gulf comes.
Open your fax line.
Two of them are defenders, one is a midfielder, and the other is a forward.
Look, these four players
Three of them cost.
Two hundred thousand dollars per player.
Take them all together in one bundle.
That will be six hundred thousand; I'll give them to you for five hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Nice, this is about African players, now, regarding the Brazilian player.
He's the player of the season, and he alone costs two million two hundred thousand dollars.
They gave me this price, but then I received a fax, let me show you, it's here. Wait, look, look, I received it from a club in the UAE.
The decision is yours.
Thank you.
God willing, he has a calf muscle.
How is he?
Knee, knee
The knee is fine.
We don't want to be fooled, hopefully there's no ACL tear.
Oh, Father of Nasser!
What is this connected muscle?
Butcher! Make a key (rice and meat, a traditional dish)
Frankly, you're lucky to have Brazilian and African players, congratulations, congratulations.
Thank you.
To the store, the store.
Oh God, hopefully you have another business.
No, no, no, only players.
I see them unloading the boxes.
Young players! Yes, we want them, from the jungles of Africa.
Yeah, why like this?
Karim, open one box for him.
He is a human being just like us.
A young man said, "Didn't you hear him?"
They said they were young.
As long as we
Why don't you give us this little boy as a free gift?
Listen, Abu Nasser, if you take care of him and raise him well, he will benefit you later.
And let them go and free him at the stadium.
Come, come, come, come
Go easy on him, he's still young.
Put it in the annex, let him raise it.
Don't hesitate if you need anything, all the players are with me.
Your trainer must understand.
We won 2-0, we dominated the game.
My father is Spain's coach.
I don't like it.
Successful coach
He must control the flow of the game.
This is one, the opposite, the Al Wakrah way.
We shouldn't let your coach do what he wants.
He spent less than two months with the team.
We need to put an end to this.
If he was an expert in football, he would activate the wing players and not attack from the center.
Yes, I rely on the offside trap.
Oh mother, don't give me a headache.
He must separate Kakono Malaloy.
And replace it with Shinamo's bubbles, heat, light, and laughter.
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want him to play.
Forget his little pills, he's taking them again.
Which line?
Execute the plan.
Forget about Hololo.
This shouldn't happen between the coach and the team manager.
Man of the match, team star
Do you mean we're not soccer experts?
Listen, Sultan!
Let him go home.
Don't let him ride in the bakery car, let him go by taxi.
It's none of your business.
Stay informed.
Do you think what my father did was right?
The coach was fired and rehired.
What's he doing?
The team is destroying.
Our team said goodbye.
Mother, Mother
No, he's crazy. That means he told you you're divorced. Tell me the truth, what happened between you two?
From the first day I saw him, I told your mother, I don't like this person.
I feel he is incapable of taking responsibility.
Forget the nonsense and talking about the past.
You must go to his father and find out why your daughter is divorced.
I don't know what to say, oh! Brother Rashid.
For what reason, then, did he divorce her?
It's not fair, Abu Abdullah! We have the right to know, we need to know, why are you divorced?
Please, don't interfere. It's none of your business.
Why don't I intervene? The man is waiting in the living room to find out why his daughter is divorced.
She doesn't know how to appreciate her husband and respect his feelings.
Who is Barcelona?
It's not your fault. You don't know La Liga.
Barcelona is not a lady,
This is Guardiola's team.
It means that I'm going now to the man who's waiting for me in the living room.
If I go, I'll go. Fine, stay here and leave it to me.
You must leave and not shake your head.
It was not enough for her to insult Barcelona.
Messi, the football wizard, who scores a hat-trick in every match.
Maradona himself said that Messi would be better than him.
And your impudent daughter is mocking him. Listen.
Your daughter is not a Barcelona fan, she doesn't suit us (a saying).
What do you mean!
Listen, may God guide you.
Don't tell me you want my son.
Apologize and make her happy.
Damn it.
Praise be to God, we have a lot of money.
What's the point of our money if it doesn't make our children happy?
Oh wind, stop.
Most importantly, I'll look for a Barcelona fan.
Mama, I'm not angry.
Crazy! Son, forget about her.
Drink your tea, son!
You see, son! They are the losers.
A thousand girls wish to marry you.
Drink up, son.
I feel sorry for her.
Oh, her sadness, she divorced two days ago.
After one month of marriage.
What's wrong with you? Do you want to get me into trouble with him?
I don't want to get into trouble with him.
Who told you these illogical stories!
Don't listen to her.
She knows who he is.
What else do you want!
Her wealth only.
Do you remember the building that my father bought and turned into an apartment hotel?
Those in Mansoura.
His father owns it, and when our son marries your daughter, I will ask him about this building.
If you can't.
He talked to her brother.
Listen carefully.
A millionaire's son is suggested to you.
Do you know what it means to be a millionaire!
Opportunity knocks but once.
They are so rich that they bought a palace in Spain to spend every summer there.
"Okay, what's the news about Barcelona?"
The girl's parents might have spread this rumor to prove their daughter's innocence.
Let's assume the story is true and the man loves Barcelona and is loyal to Catalonia.
His wife is supposed to respect that.
And do not mock the team.
Assuming this story is true.
God bless you, they called his father Abu Borgain because he owns two towers on the corniche.
Designed in a strange and complex way like intertwined ropes.
When people saw them from a distance, they thought it was a single tower.
What do you think? All the wealth is yours.
Welcome
God bless you. Okay, take something, eat something.
Thank you, my love.
But my dear son Abdullah is waiting for your reply.
No, don't worry, O my eye's light, Umm Abdullah.
If I searched the entire Gulf Cooperation Council, I wouldn't find anyone better than you.
Request them to provide us with their quotes for constructing the building.
I'm done, Your Honor. Is there anything else?
Okay, the family will call you.
Figure out their needs for the wedding, prepare the check, and I'll sign it.
In the name of God, God's will, in the name of God, God's will, if you permit me, Your Highness.
Abdullah divorced again as well!
I wish for children from you and wealth from him.
God bless you, Auntie!
You're wearing it because you're cold.
Yes, but I don't know where my mom booked us?
Where did you book us, mother?
My mother says she booked us to Malaysia.
What's the problem with Malaysia, okay?
Have a safe trip.
What's wrong with you? Have you ever heard of anyone coming back from their honeymoon crying?
What's wrong with you, my daughter? Tell me!
Tell me what happened, my daughter!
Mom, she's very arrogant.
Why?
She's arrogant, forget about her.
You did the right thing when you fired her.
I feel sorry for her.
This is her mother.
Why is she upset?
What happened to her?
God bless you. Don't forget to bring us olive oil from Spain.
Ah, Spain. Where are we going?
Alright.
My mother says she booked us to the Maldives.
Oh my god, the Maldives are beautiful too!
And she will also amuse you.
I thought you would come back happy from your trip.
What really gets on my nerves, why take the kids?
Come on! Take the bag.
What's wrong with them?
Why are you sad, light of my eye?
Be quiet! Please, you will tell me about my son's face.
Oh son! Why are you upset?
When I see the shells, I'll be depressed.
May God bring down whoever bothers you, my son!
Forget her, divorce her, divorce her. Your father has a lot of money and there are many girls.
Be quiet, and I know my son, anything small bothers him, why is he living miserably!
My son, call her and divorce her.
God damn her.
%pw Say it to her three times.
You're free. Wait, don't hang up, you have two more chances.
Divorced, divorced.
Very tense.
Hey! My son, go! My love, relax and don't worry, there are plenty of girls (a saying goes), go! My son.
Oh my God, a problem.
They just saw you at the disco.
Call him, call him, let me talk to him.
What do I call my mother? Just divorce me, he said, "You are divorced, divorced."
Why did he divorce you? He has no shame.
Now if a woman goes to the disco, what will she do!
And one if necessary %pw.
What's happening! The world has gone crazy!
You see, I go to his house and despise him without him knowing who you are?
I, I, my daughter is divorced, O Abu Abdullah!
My daughter is divorced!
Your daughter is different.
You buy and sell them at Toys R Us stores.
Just as you feel the bad taste in your mouth now because of your daughter, and you are discouraged.
They did nothing.
"If she doesn't bring you the apple peeled, divorce her."
It is not wrong to divorce them as you wish.
And she is still married to a man.
Is this suitable for you, let it go to hell!
I feel the same as I did to others.
What you wouldn't accept for yourself.
Don't accept it for people.
Do you know who owned the land this shopping center is on?
In a strategic location?
Trust in God.
And also at a low price.
Closed.
I need to get Abu Sakr's approval.
Yes, I went to his office and didn't find him.
I went to his office last week and they told me he had traveled.
He has a meeting, come tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, I'm out of the office, and the problem is I need to get Abu Sakr's approval, I need to.
Go to his office.
No, no, no, no, this is official business.
The right place for that, may God protect you, is the office, not the home.
Do you eat too?
What will satisfy Abu Sakr?
Everyone has a key.
Tell me, Abu Fahd!
Do you know him?
I don't know him, I only see him on TV, and you told me you meet him during Umrah.
But we don't know each other well.
Let's get rid of the nonsense.
God have mercy on you, I came immediately, at least ask about the reason for this celebration.
There's no occasion for this, may God guide you.
The month is thirty days long, and he holds fifty feasts.
I suggest that your name be included in the Guinness Book of World Records.
As the best banquet preparer in the world.
By the way, who is this brother with you?
Welcome, this is a blessed time.
It is an honor, Your Highness.
Oh! Father of success.
You say Abu Saqr hosts a feast every day.
This is what we see.
But good Lord! Abu Fula, the banquet tonight is for a special occasion.
Today, may God protect you and your son, Falcon.
God willing, my lord deserves it, with blessings.
He's here, welcome, my son!
Peace be upon you.
Why?
On this occasion, my son Sagar should go to the agency tomorrow and choose the car he wants.
I waited a year and a half for the approval.
I went bankrupt.
But when I reached him
And I give him money.
May God guide you, Abu Saad.
Things won't go this way.
I said to him, "Alright."
He has to go through the showroom and choose the car he likes.
We will buy three for him.
Take him to it!
They took me to him.
You told me you met him during the Umrah last year.
Today is the young son of Shahin.
His game is banquets.
This is your chance.
He passed by and congratulated him.
He deserves to be well, Your Honor!
"Watch out, Shahin! Father of the Falcon."
God bless you, thank you all!
Praise be to God that Shahin is fine, my lord.
God bless you.
By the way, who are you?
His Highness
You didn't recognize me.
I can't lie to you. (I can't tell you anything but the truth.)
Your Highness, I was with you on the Umrah pilgrimage last year.
And I remember you bought a red rosary.
God bless you.
I was in the hospital.
Visiting a relative
It's a pleasure to meet you.
So, Sagar, are you still undecided about entering the business field or have you made up your mind?
I'm tired of him.
Why, my son Sagar, trade is good.
You must start, open an office and then see.
Abu Sakr
His Highness, please say yes.
Why?
I have a small gift.
Full floor
Even if trade loves you and comes to you, you say no.
Who has everything available to them like you do today? Since you got the license, everything comes easily to you, a free car and the best office on the corniche.
Yesterday, Abu Abdulaziz was telling your father that if Sakr wanted to join the business, he would make him a partner with a 50% share.
Oh mother, how can I balance business and university?
Oh mother, don't force me to do something I don't like.
And you're lucky that agencies, offices, and cars are thrown at you for free.
It's an opportunity, man! Whose son can start a project at this time without capital?
Your only capital is people's love for your father.
Be smart and invest it.
Believe me, son! This is your chance in life.
Rose, prepare lunch quickly.
He also reached for the pickles and pepper.
He left nothing, he left nothing, I'm afraid he'll take over the samosa agency.
Your son has a good appetite for work.
This is what I was looking forward to seeing. Do you know what he told me today?
He told me, "Mother, I want to expand my investments."
He wants to enter the Caribbean and invest in the islands there.
And Allah protects him from the eyes of the envious.
Abu Sultan was telling me yesterday, "Your son has just started working."
He has twenty agencies, six restaurants, and a stake in two banks.
Please provide
I think, God knows best, that they haven't opened it yet.
Ah, the one in the northern area of our office, what's happening with him?
No, I just liked it.
Thank you, and God bless you, congratulations Abbas!
In the name of God.
God bless you all.
There's no use regretting now.
What are you talking about, man! A whole year of misery and hard work to get the supermarket ready.
What's up! I think he passes by the shop every day.
He saw her and sent me his secretary, whose name is Samer.
This is Sakr, son of Abu Sakr, he told me, and he wants to be your partner instead of taking the shop from you.
Does he want to be your partner, too?
"There is no power or strength except by Allah."
You started talking to him, didn't you?
He asked me, "Who are you, brother?"
I said actions!
Why did you tell him you had an Iranian bakery?
When we were walking past this bakery, there was a small sign. What was written on that sign? What was the name written on the sign?
It was written on the neighborhood bakery.
No, I want another name.
Peace be upon you too.
Hey, how's work going?
Your Honor, we hope to finalize the workers' accommodation drawings for the Future Company by tomorrow or the day after.
No, no Mr. Sager, she is my wife Elisa, allow me to introduce you to Mr. Sager, the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?
Let her take one of the company cars.
Many thanks, you are very kind.
Even cooking now relies on science and study.
Today, someone says they want to work in business, they have some money and want to invest it.
But he doesn't have enough knowledge, understanding, and study in economics, or even business.
Someone like that
Do you think he will succeed? I don't think so, he will waste his time and lose.
Listen up, Abu Nasser!
Did you hear what these two parrots were saying?
What is this?
You have my son, Sager.
Look at him.
Look at him today.
Your Highness, we are not talking about your son, Saqr.
We're talking about the rule.
Your son will succeed whatever God wills, and I don't want to envy him (proverb), he is an exception.
Thank you, he's talking about the rule.
You scared me, son. Hell builds itself by itself.
He once gave a car as a gift.
He sold it and invested the money on his own advice.
"And whatever Allah wills, behold it now."
Oh, come on, we're talking about ordinary people!
He was drunk, and Abu Nasir did to him what he did, taking him and putting him in the road.
Sagar has business talents.
Strong economic preferences.
We must ask who his father is.
I swear I'm surprised.
God willing.
"Gulf Magazine on Economic Referendum"
Please come in.
Peace be upon you, welcome, welcome, O Salem.
What's up?
I swear to God, I don't know what to say, Salem!
Yes, I remember.
The story was true.
They say the company sent a fax to my father.
And inform him.
Poor thing, he couldn't bear it.
As you see.
They say that when he heard the news,
He fell in the office with the fax in his hand.
He has been very generous to him.
As they say, I taught him archery, and when he became skilled, he shot at me.
What did the doctor say?
Call on him, O Salim!
I am shocked.
I can't believe there are people like that in this world.
A man donates to the poor, hiding it from his own hands.
The donations of this organization are distributed to all Muslims in Asia and Africa.
But I also wish for Your Honor to explain your goals and future steps, if God wills it.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, our goal at the Saker Charity Association is to achieve solidarity in this nation.
In addition to sixty blankets for our brothers affected by the Pakistan earthquake.
Lastly, but not least, we also support seven poor families now.
With a monthly salary of only one hundred and thirty-two riyals.
We won't be late.
I'll come to you directly.
Who is this, my love?
This is Khalid and his wife, and they are inviting us to the hotel tonight.
Yes, anywhere, anywhere we're together, I'm happy.
My love, "(May God preserve you for me)" is an idiomatic expression.
Oh, my beloved!
This is not fair. This is my source of income.
This is a bakery.
And take money for your trouble.
Five riyals for foul, three riyals for hot bread.
Two chickpeas.
Wide beans, perfect, perfect.
Cook broad beans with six!
Come on, divers!
The captain is here and he has brought breakfast.
Men wanted.
Please, Your Highness!
What does it mean?
No, no, what I'm asking you for is that I want to hear a resounding yes in my ear.
Hello, Nora.
I'm annoyed with you.
Can I bear your distress?
What's the story?
Why are you upset?
Noura chose a simple, plain dress.
Don't say Al-Anoud will be upset.
Oh my God, these Lebanese speak with great eloquence.
And you should not talk to him too much.
I'm jealous of her, too.
The best dress for the most beautiful Nora.
He flirts with her by calling her Nora.
Let your blood boil, how long will that take?
I paid twenty thousand, and twenty thousand is still remaining.
God bless you, congratulations!
God be with you.
Hello, Her Highness Umm Saleh.
Hello Fadi, you look busy. I don't want to keep you.
I'm at your service.
Hello, hello.
Did you receive the text message yesterday?
I'll take it, you idiot!
Did you like the joke?
I mean, did you bring the design with you?
I didn't have time to do them, show me your designs and I'll choose from among them.
Frankly, your taste is better.
They will leave us, and envy will start working.
When he realizes that my project is good and has started generating income,
They say he will do a project like mine.
Design and Tailoring Shop
Women's clothing.
This is Abu Nasser who has nothing to do with trade.
There are banks.
He will hurt his cousin.
That's how it is these days.
Yes, yes, my cousin.
You know I was sleeping and they woke me up saying your cousin wants you.
Everything is fine! Ask me anything you want!
Everything is alright, everything is alright.
I hope so.
You have no intention of any project, for example, like, like.
Are you looking for a partner or what?
I heard you're a designer, so I thought I'd drop by, maybe.
Welcome.
If you need more, we have it available.
Praise be to God, the work is going very well.
What should I do, O God! Abu Saleh.
But we're too late, they hired him last week.
Yes, they did.
Alright, no problem, goodbye.
So, this is it.
Sure?
With haute couture, oh the great disaster!
What is this?
He rented a shop next to yours.
(Ad) Oh, envier! (Ad) Oh, hater!
Before you know that the market is open to everyone,
You must know.
May your heart open to your cousin.
I'm not asking you.
You deny, lie, mock me, and told me, yourself.
I wanted to do my work in secret.
Taking that is the shop next door, you want to disrupt my work.
But they didn't say come and be like a pain in the neck next to the wisdom teeth, you're driving me crazy.
This is envy and hatred. I swear to God, I swear to God I'll slap you. This is hatred. Leave me alone.
Come on, you're relatives, folks!
Shame on you, Abu Saleh!
Leave him alone, I swear to your father I'll give you a slap. Oh! It's you with your soft voice.
I'll defeat you just as you defeated me by stealing my share.
Come on, people!
Peace be upon him, O people.
I swear, I swear, you did nothing.
He advised me to hire a designer from the Philippines.
Don't let anyone lie to you.
Why, why specifically the Lebanese?
They chat with him, joke and laugh, and feel very comfortable.
That's why Abu Saleh is Lebanese.
He started saying some nice words to me and convincing me.
He captivated me, he captivated me with his words.
He convinced me and directed me to pay twelve thousand riyals.
Two days later, I went to the auction market and found the same cabinet, its twin, for nine hundred riyals.
And make money,
Bring in a Lebanese designer.
Is it possible for me to meet Mr.? Yesterday, you told me it was difficult, is it still difficult today?
Yeah, today was really tough.
I feel that Abu Saleh has changed lately.
What's up?
No, I don't know. What's happening?
Abu Saleh is very psychologically tired after his cousin's store opening, as he brought a Lebanese designer just like him.
For the past two weeks, the store's sales have been in continuous decline.
This is the problem here in Qatar; no Qatari will open a shop unless another Qatari comes along and does the same project, opening the same shop right next to him. Can I go in?
No, no, no, no, he's with Fadi the designer now and they're thinking of a solution.
What do we do now?
We're sitting as if we've eaten poison.
If we keep like this, I think we won't even make rent for the shop.
A place far from them.
That means we'll be giving them a free rein.
Okay, thank you, and what is the discount percentage?
Impossible, why don't you give an evening dress for free with every wedding dress?
No, of course not, let's go.
What's wrong with you? What's happening? Let's go to the store next to you; today they put up an ad with every wedding dress, two evening dresses for free, and also a 25% discount.
Okay, let's go, let's go.
And now wait for two weeks, and they will announce the same advertisement, buy a wedding dress and get two evening dresses free with a twenty-five percent discount.
They are fighting us.
I'm thinking the same thing. If we leave them, they'll destroy us.
Don't bother.
What did he do next?
So, it's definitely a challenge.
Of course it's a challenge.
Well done, this troublemaker deserves it, no one wants to earn their living.
If that happens, you'll hear the news within two or three days, I'll close his shop.
Well done.
Wait, wait, lock, lock, I'm coming to you now, goodbye.
What's up?
Saud says the shop is unbearable and no one can sit in it, and he says he doesn't know where this bad smell comes from.
The smell has nothing to do with this air conditioner, it's impossible.
Its scent will linger in the shop for at least six days.
One hundred percent sure.
He came at night.
He cuts the electrical wires from the store.
Is this fair?
Now will you sign an undertaking or shall we start a case and open a file?
Don't do anything for him.
I will end his existence from this life.
Oh my God! Abu Nasser, something strange has happened, no one is coming to our shop.
Abu Nasser, sugar, sugar, there are customers coming, I'll talk to you later. This is strange.
He lies in bed, moaning.
He says it's a psychological condition, and I was afraid to tell him that the bank called and is asking for the installments.
His debts piled up because of his miserly cousin.
What happened to him this time?
Poor things, if they accidentally enter and see Saad the designer, they scream at him and run away from him.
Asleep! Poor thing, he never sleeps, his eyes are open and he stares at the ceiling.
I don't know what he did to me.
Saud is in the store.
He bewitched him, I don't know what he did to him.
When women see him, they are afraid of him.
I don't know, what made him become like this!
He made me lose, he made me lose.
I have a lot of debts.
I'm afraid they'll imprison me.
And I have no evidence against him that I can take to court.
I don't know what he did, I don't know what he did.
Miss, you deserve it.
Please, tell me what kind of magic you did to him; you turned his designer into a monster and women are afraid of him when they see him.
I spread a rumor.
Walk faster! Guys, tell him the filming team needs him urgently.
O people! May God bless you, may God protect you. Tell him that they desperately need you.
I swear to God, they will raise my pressure, kill me, paralyze me. This is not fair, Mr. Abdullah.
Alright, dear Ahmed, don't get angry. You have heart problems, this is not good for you, man!
I swear to God I've called him several times, my ear hurts, but it's no use. These extra people are driving me crazy, driving me crazy.
You're not doing anything, I'm responsible for everything!
Listen to me, or I'll scream at you.
Episode 25, Scene 16, Ahmed, we want to finish.
So, I'll stop filming because an extra actor didn't show up.
What a show!
I have nothing to do with this! Mr. Abdullah, why are you shouting at me?
My love, if you don't want anyone to shout in your face,
What happened, Abdullah?
An extra actor is late, and they are in trouble.
Oh Ahmed! I don't need anyone, my dear.
Look for someone with gravitas and a distinguished position who can convince people that he is truly capable of becoming a billionaire and millionaire, not just anyone.
Please, sir, come in and take a seat. Your order will be ready in half an hour.
Not just anyone, Ala! Not just anyone, I was just explaining to him.
Alright, I'll manage with two scenes instead of one.
You are responsible, and you are the production manager, you are responsible.
What are they doing now?
They'll do everything, see the director tense and chaos reigning, but they'll handle it.
He needs someone with special qualities. Where can I find him now?
Are you serious?
I didn't hear what the director said.
I know someone, may God bless him, I hope he's suitable.
%PW Happiness is peaches!
Saud Kansa! I remember him as Saud al-Durrazi.
Yes, when he was young, they called him Saud the Dragon, and when they grew up, they named him Kans.
Why the cans?
I'll tell you the reason. Poor guy, he used to walk the streets collecting cans and selling them by the kilogram.
My rich and respected brother, no despair.
He's in shape, I don't remember him being fat, he's neither tall nor overweight.
Are you sure it's appropriate?
I wish, but you have to do his makeup well, and I guarantee he'll be suitable and fun too.
Okay, what are you waiting for, call him!
I don't have his number.
I'll take the prince with me and go to him.
Where was Saud's house?
What's he saying?
Shut up, shut up.
Saud consumes.
We don't have anyone in our neighborhood named Saud Kans.
Yes, I'm sure he's from this neighborhood, but I forgot which house.
This house belongs to a person named Saud, and he lives with his mother.
Yes, that's right.
But this is not Saud Kansa.
This is Saud's laptop.
Certainly this is it, but it evolves over time because the laptop is like tins.
He is tall, fat, and has a slightly tanned skin.
He ditched the cans and started collecting old laptops. Come on, come on, come on, man!
He went to the vegetable market to buy them for me. Am I a goat? And where is the other one?
I don't know, son.
This is what you always wear.
I have another one. Where's the second period? Where is it?
For the holiday.
This is what I was looking for.

Give his iron a little bit before going out, it's wrinkled.
But these days, I feel worse than before.
Oh Mother, may God guide you, since yesterday I've been insisting on taking you to the emergency room, but you refused.
Yes, Mom, they told me they would pay me.
Alhamdulillah, you are working now instead of being unemployed.
Okay, Mom, goodbye.
You'll argue with her, get angry, and go upstairs.
You are sitting and very slowly moving, and the camera is with you, it will move alongside you.
Yes. Ja'far! Yes.
Whose laptop is this?
"Abu Dawud, this is a very famous actor, Abdullah Al-Lama."
This is for you, my son. How are you, Abu?
How are you, O slave?
Act, you need to act a little in front of people, especially with her.
Yes, we're from the same neighborhood.
Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, stay calm, stay calm.
I love acting, and I hope they give me a role where I can slap you.
It's not like you think, bro!
Severe illness, you know she didn't sleep last night, brother!
Asthma, brother. May God heal you.
May God heal her.
Your life is just a bowl of cherries. (idiomatic expression)
Oh my lord! Oh my lord!
Does he have asthma medication for my mother?
He is a director, not a doctor.
Look at yourself, listen to what he's saying, he has no point.
What's his mother's name?
She spits on you, what do you think?
I heard what she said about you.
She says you're irresponsible; you need to be more serious.
Give me, give him, give him, give him, give him half a million to fix my car's damaged tires.
Give him three million to bring me dinner.
I was about to ask you why you're talking like that.
Because I am sober at the request of some people.
Mr. Ghafel watched, produced by our neighborhood, actors of a high level.
Now he is excellent, and he is suitable for the role.
Okay, I'll help you. I don't have any allergies, do I?
Did your family buy this?
Your life is just a bowl of cherries. (idiomatic expression)
Take the actor to the dressing room, do his makeup, and I'll tell Salman to bring you the costume and come to you.
Go, go, go, this is beautiful.
Okay, okay.
Listen, brother, leave the car with us until we finish shooting, and then I'll call you to pick it up.
No worries, can someone just give me a ride?
"I'll give you a lift! Okay, let me ask the driver to give you a lift. Great, thank you, brother. Thank you, thank you, wait."
Okay, call your friend, extra, call him.
Oh my God! People are calling for Saud's laptop from the makeup room.
Let me brush my teeth then.
It has already been written before me.
Alright, shall we review?
This means me!
I didn't expect this from you.
We will fight, for what!
We will fight for our rights.
Yeah, wait.
And you must know who you're talking to, Abu Abdulaziz.
Why did you divorce her, brother!?
Divorce her and be done with it.
We don't marry the daughter of a thief.
No need, what do you think?
He will clean it, but later. The most important thing is to get ready because you are going to enter the fitting room to change your clothes and we are ready to shoot.
My teeth, toothpaste is expensive.
Hey everyone! The shooting of this scene has been postponed.
Why this?
I don't want any tea! Brother, I'm full and my stomach is bloated from all the tea. What's this? I've been waiting for an hour, how much longer do I have to wait?
You didn't see anything, it's very common.
May God give you health and strength.
They are fast.
Thank you for your kindness, may God protect you.
Convey my greetings to them.
Tell them Abu Abdulaziz greets you.
Well, Your Honor.
That was fun, wasn't it?
Like you, they greet you and kiss your nose too.
The first time someone kissed me on my nose.
How do they accept them on their noses?
This is a problem.
His nose is like an ice cream cone, it cuts your lips. That was funny, that was funny.
"!You laughed"
No problem.
Can I be an actor?
Something's wrong. What's bothering your voice?
Oh my son, oh my son, I am very ill, I am waiting for you.
Come quickly.
Welcome, Sheikh, welcome.
Go see her there yourself, man!
Listen to me, you!
Alright, go now.
I see a lot of reverence.
What happened, my son!
Peace be upon you, what's wrong with you, sir?
Let's leave, let's leave, let's leave, let's leave.
Don't trouble yourself, God willing it will happen. Dr. Hassan, come here, come here.
Yes, my God! Dr. Hany, what happened?
Make yourself comfortable in the office.
Don't worry.
She is a mother to all, may God willing, she will be fine.
Welcome, welcome, Your Highness, welcome.
Shut up or I'll hit you in the face.
Here my name is Abu Abdulaziz.
Call me, sir!
How are you, sir?
May God curse you
Yes, Your Honor.
Welcome, Sir. Please have a seat.
God bless you.
Ugly face (idiomatic expression).
Go with him, Mr. Rashid!
I swear to you, if I ever do anything to you, tell me and see what I'll do to him.
Oh friend! Can I quickly find a doctor, please?
Doctor, my mother is sick!
Wait in line, it's your turn.
Listen to me, you!
Can I ask you, my friend?
Son, hurry up, I'm sick.
You go to the hospital a lot, taking your mother every week, and haven't found any issues. They're good and accept anything.
Unlike citizens.
Don't forget the citizens.
Alright, then look for a wife in the hospital.
I love her.
Oh brother! But she's ignoring me.
Alright, then try to be close to her, smile at her, look at her, give her your number, and have good intentions.
Nothing, nothing's wrong.
Be polite.
Get out, get out, if you don't leave, I'll call the guards to teach you some manners.
No, no, I don't need anything.
Sir, you must drink.
Please lie down.
No, thank you.
You can take her and leave the hospital.
The person speaking to you is Falah Al-Marzook.
Marrying him means you will marry him.
No, no, I need the bisht, the clothes, and also the car, I'm renting them from you.
So I can give you your money.
No, no, no, wait.
Let's go.
What is this %PW in the name of Al-Marzouk!
Welcome, welcome, welcome!
The light of my eye signed his marriage contract yesterday.
I wish you had come.
They were surprised by what I did for them; it was a very elegant and unique party.
One regular and one diet.
You have no excuse now.
What is this?
Mama, I promised my friends tomorrow at work.
Are you taking this to them?
Ah, what's wrong with it.
Noura, come here!
What is this?
He will take this thing to his friends, for the scandal.
Don't even think about taking it, it'll make everyone talk about you.
Give me money, and tomorrow I'll buy you something nice.
Yeah, but I already promised them.
I need to get it tomorrow.
Don't worry, they're still open. Go and change your clothes so we can bring something that pleases people.
What's wrong with you! Let's go.
It has a reasonable price and very high quality.
Above average, not the best!
Of course, there's gourmet chocolate, but sorry, I thought you were looking for something more affordable.
This is too expensive. Why are you looking for the most expensive one?
This is unbelievable, check out this artistic touch.
The name of this chocolate is Royal.
The same chocolate that is always requested at the Spanish court.
Give me this.
Congratulations, and by the way, there's a warranty.
Welcome, welcome, come in!
Come here, bro! Give us some of that chocolate, bro!
What's the occasion, man?
No, Saleh Abdul Qader, the one in accounting.
By God, it's worth it, give me another one.
Quickly make some coffee.
Auntie, did you go to their wedding?
Yes, dear, I went to their wedding, it was embarrassing and disgusting. Can you imagine that, sister!
Did you listen to your aunts' words?
That's why I want to throw you an unforgettable wedding party.
No time, you only have one and a half months.
I'll arrange everything.
But he doesn't allow me to do anything.
You don't live in the community, you don't see how people put everything they have into their weddings.
And you saw for yourself.
When you buy something nice, you'll see how they praise you and your taste.
They didn't tell you it was wonderful and amazing?
Exactly, but how much did we pay?
The money we paid for the chocolate could buy four sheep for the wedding.
Please don't interfere, your mother knows how to do everything, just give her the money and that's it.
That means they will accept anything we choose.
Oh my God, your taste is really bad.
What's your opinion about this stage?
But excellence costs a lot of money.
Why, why, the past was beautiful!
What's your opinion on this?
It's the first time in Qatar that anyone has thought of making a theater in the shape of a computer mouse.
Excuse me, one moment please.
Look, talk about anything but the stage and arrangements. This is a place for women who have nothing but gossip, so just be quiet.
The man is waiting for us.
We'll move on to the mouse phase.
It's a very strange phase.
Latest model in 2012.
We've already chosen the mouse.
You can sit aside, all of this is for your own good.
So you have to choose, if it's Noah's Ark, you'll pay an extra twenty thousand, and if it's the mouse, you'll pay one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Make your decision, and we're ready.
You're not the first one to get married.
What do you think, will you get married in the Comoros? That's how things are going in our country.
And we are only at the beginning as well.
If you don't need a platform, where would you put the bride? In a box?
Iron, paint, and some wood.
And the people are happy.
They exploit and lie to us; in fact, they are con artists.
What's wrong with you now?
Are you angry and upset?
If you don't want to get married, that's fine.
I'll call the bride's mother and tell her that Saleh is going through very difficult circumstances.
He doesn't want to get married? He can't afford the wedding expenses? That's fine with me. Do you want me to call her? I'm serious, I'll call her.
We received a bouquet of flowers from the Netherlands.
In my opinion, if you place it on the tables at the wedding,
Are you sure this is your first time in Doha?
And also the Middle East!
Put it in the account.
How much will it increase?
One hundred and seventy-two, alright then.
But Samir, I don't want to see this group at any wedding.
You know people's gossip.
Okay, they're booked.
Your salary is higher than mine.
A problem we can't handle will start.
God help you, Saleh!
But come on, you should have tried to calm the situation down.
For me, praise be to God, I've decided to look for a wife in any Arab country.
They say a wedding there costs you only two thousand dollars and enjoy.
God bless you, my dear.
God willing, his wedding will be next month.
You need to specify the number of cards you want and let me know.
If the invitations are sufficient, that's great. Most importantly, people need to know they're invited, where and when, and that's it.
You only care about him, don't care what people will say.
People gauge the level of a wedding from the invitations.
Tomorrow when they see these invitations, I know what the women will say.
Look at their wedding, if these are their invitations, they haven't seen the invitations of so-and-so and so-and-so.
We said this, and we will order it online.
It has a cloth cover, panda leather, and a silver shine.
No one can blame you, you can't stop me.
I won't be the subject of conversation among the ladies, we'll ask for invitations, that is, we'll ask for invitations!
I feel sorry for him. Oh, man!
Poor thing, it's natural that his family pressured him a lot.
Goodness! This man begs for money from everyone.
What are you saying, he even sold his car.
He looked like he had aged twenty years, this morning I saw him talking to himself.
Don't blame him, brother! Poor guy, I don't know when we'll evolve.
Close the door, please.
Sorry, brother!
Did you try to convince them to have a wedding based on your budget?
What do you mean by "within my budget"?
Why, am I living alone?
The problem our society suffers from is the focus on appearances, boasting, and the disease of showing off.
It forces you to contract the same illness.
If you want to live in it.
Once, I caught the eye of the bride's mother.
I was attacked by her words.
Trust in God.
By the way, tell me,
How did you get married?
And I don't want to get married, I'm not crazy.
Even if you, my brother, decide that I should get married,
I will consider marrying a foreigner or even an Arab.
He says, "Your country!"
We decided to bring a DJ for the music.
But because Umm Nasser brought a famous singer to her son's wedding.
He is a very famous singer, but I forgot his name.
Why are you so upset?
It seems you don't like what I'm doing!
It's enough that he sold his car, and every Sunday one of his friends gives him a ride.
A moment ago, I entered the room and found him talking to himself.
I see, it seems you've changed your mind now.
Since my brother Saleh is tired, Mom, support him.
I don't care about you or him.
I am no less than people.
Don't make us a laughingstock.
Oh mother, enough! My brother spent all he had and took money from everyone.
Please be quiet.
My mother has new demands for the wedding, and my brother said he doesn't have money, so she started screaming at him and said "Cancel the wedding, I don't want to get married."
Where is she now?
She's inside and they're giving her first aid.
He said she was much better now and they would find a room for her at the hospital.
Shame!
Relax, sister!
The doctor told you to stay calm and gave you an injection to make you sleep.
How can I relax when he wants to make a joke out of good and evil?
I was telling him to buy Abdullah Roaished, and he said he didn't have money.
I'm sorry for your mom.
Care/be afraid for her.
Go to her, go to her and kiss her head.
And tell her that I will do what you want.
I'll get you Abdullah Roaished.
Abu Yusuf is kind; I don't think he won't help me.
It's not fair, I couldn't find anyone but Abu Youssef.
What's wrong with it!
Are you crazy, Saleh?!
But the minister kept him because he was an old man, and more importantly, he was disciplined and honest.
Do you want my opinion? If you tell him the same thing you told me, there's a good chance his heart will stop.
Yes, I did.
This is due to the bloody crisis she is going through, and she wants to ask Abu Yusuf for some money, of course from the ministry's funds.
And Allah knows when you will return it to Him.
And when the auditors came and asked him about the money,
Of course, he might be in trouble.
No one will know and will know how to handle it.
It's up to you, the man is in his office and you have to be responsible if anything happens to him.
I'm stealing in my last days!
Uncle, they call it theft.
On the first floor.
There is, there is a white box wrapped in blue ribbon, with a circle on it depicting a dove's wing, bring it, bring it.
"It's me, Uncle, Uncle Abu Youssef, it's me. If I don't have any problems, "
I'll give them all back.
They call me Abu Yusuf.
And I came in my last days
Corrupt me, Thursday!
Salih, Salih.
Good, listen to me, if it was someone else, they would have been beaten up and their rights taken away. Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Khalid.
Salih, Salih.
I've tried every method, Abu Youssef, none of them work. I'm drowning.
I cannot change the past of my marriage.
And you don't know them, they are all bald.
What's wrong with you?
No, no, the other one, the panic pill, the panic pill.
In the drawer, in the drawer.
Oh Uncle Abu Youssef, the stairs are full of medicines, which one do you need?
The can with a picture of a frightened man.
We've already booked two rooms for hair and makeup, just for us.
We'll be there from tomorrow.
We brought Abdullah Roaished and his band.
You'll see, my dear.
No, I won't tell you.
Will the movie be the hit of the season?
We were the first in the world to use it.
Mama, Mama,
Goodbye.
There is no god but God.
My son, don't forget to recite the Mu'awwidhatayn when you enter the hall.
The women here have the evil eye.
I told you before that it's amazing.
The best young man ever, may God protect you, I don't want to envy you.
Oh Mother, the police are knocking on the door.
I was wrong to obey you, O God.
It's not fair, today is my wedding day.
The people who will conduct the tests have arrived.
And now solve it, I'll be imprisoned, oh God.
Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf!
It's still early.
But that's not fair if that happens!
The company offered a contract worth three million, of which two million was just for materials.
Wrote a memo to the minister.
We know there is corruption, but the corruption does not go this far.
It seems you don't live in this world.
Tell me, what did the minister say to Uthman?
Why didn't our president object? They say he was with him!
As far as I know, I really don't know.
Where is morality?
Right became wrong and wrong became right!
Oh my God! Saad, are you sure the minister fired him? Oh my God! People, what's happening to the world?
Just fire him!
What next?
It is owned by the minister's sister.
This girl is having an affair with the minister.
What a strange world.
What's wrong with you guys, don't you know who she is?
This is the new employee whom the minister hired to replace the unfortunate Uthman.
Go, go, go.
What do you want to do to me, Saleh! You confront the minister!
Are you crazy?
Listen to me, man.
We have children, we want to live.
We want to live.
What happened?
There he is, standing by the elevator.
This is the reward for honesty and integrity, my brother Saleh!
I wish we could have done more for you, brother!
Praise be to God, praise be to God for everything.
What's wrong with you, Saleh?!
These are among the strange things we see before us in this world.
We see unbelievable things.
I'm at your service.
I want you to stop by the supermarket after work to get some vegetables for the salad.
I'll try, goodbye.
Who will take my sister home?
She was sitting in the front, laughing and talking. Who is this?
This is my university colleague, what's the problem if he gives me a ride home? It's fine.
Oh my God, I can't believe this, why do you look so outdated!
What are you saying?
Don't you listen to what we say?
You are old-fashioned.
There's old and new in right and wrong!
Right is right, and wrong is wrong.
Life has evolved, and we live in the age of technology.
The era of international variables that align with the world and no one can keep up with them.
The more you live, the more you see!
Don't blame me, Munira! It's not my fault to be nervous and angry.
This is what he sees in his day.
Tell her you're sorry.
Life isn't going well.
Don't be upset, let's have lunch.
Let me sleep to rest.
The president isn't angry with you.
Is the president not angry?
No, he's not upset, go wash your face and eat your lunch.
Alright, dear.
I'm very eager to meet you on my first day of work.
It is an honor, Your Highness.
Of course, of course.
Of course, I know you don't need anyone to remind you of the principles of work.
Yet, at the same time, it's extremely important.
To remember some values and principles that succeed.
In the public interest.
This is what it's supposed to be, sir.
We all have to
Theft is absolutely necessary, Your Honor.
To be thieves.
Thank you, thank you all.
I want to say that, too.
And to warn you from my first day at work,
One of you is an employee.
Who is sincere, loyal, and devoted, and who are these bad things?
A single doubt.
There is an honest employee.
So that we can take the necessary legal action against him in our ministry.
No, things won't be as you please.
Praise be to God, we are all thieves.
As you wish, my lord, I'll say it in front of my colleagues and behind them.
Where is Khalid?
Yes, Your Honor.
Khaled, you have been praised very, very highly. May God bless you.
All right, Your Honor.
What exquisite taste, Your Honor! You know how to choose.
May Allah guide you.
Why did you let the devil manipulate you?
You should thank God that it's only about honesty.
Mom, why was Dad imprisoned?
Be quiet, my daughter!
No, no, I'll never do it again.
Mom, why is Dad in prison?
Stop.
That means he has become honest.
Alas, we must say that your father is truthful.
Is this a costume?!
Your body is fully covered.
What will people see?
And if God wills, you are looking for a job, no one will hire you in this state.
Is there a respectable woman who covers her body and charms?
She covers her chest, wears it here, chokes herself.
I'm tired of it, son.
And I bought her a shirt and pants that revealed her midriff above the navel.
But it's a hopeless case; she doesn't want to take the right path.
Here I am telling you!
You'll only blame yourself.
To ask for the hand of your daughter Sarah for our son Rashid.
These days, one of us is only looking for the right man for his daughter.
Let me tell you, my son Rashid.
He is a very good person.
Never stop drinking. (Colloquial expression)
He's drunk twenty-four hours a day.
Drunk, tipsy, and heavy all day.
And don't ask about the sleepless nights.
He is polite.
And let me say also that he is a hypocrite.
And how about the theft?
This is what I expect from you, and how are the drugs?
Clear, done. I'll give you five riyals if you can find his pupil, I'll make a contest out of it.
By the way, Abu Sara, we're just here to ask for her hand.
You know the loud celebration and hanging out.
We know she came from a noble family.
Goodbye, my son, goodbye, that's how life goes, congratulations.
I'm drunk.
I can't walk.
Okay, come on.
Well, goodbye, goodbye.
Okay, call your father to come pick you up.
Why do I need to call him?
So he can come to pick you up.
Where is he?
Look, he's over there, waving his keffiyeh with a blonde girl.
Indeed, your father walks straight, and he is enjoying it.
Hello, my dear daughter Mona!
Majid! His name was Abdulaziz.
Yes, that's right.
You confuse me, my daughter.
And you know since the establishment of the State of Palestine with its capital in Jenin in 1990, after signing a comprehensive peace treaty with the State of Israel,
Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure, and siege on it.
The latest to be raised were the accusations made by the Israelis and their Arab friends against the Palestinians.
They smuggle plastic knives through the tunnels.
Especially Article Two, Paragraph A, which states that the Palestinian people must cut their nails daily.
Let's move on to the crucial meeting.
Mr. Cheap.
When Israel agrees to the establishment of a Palestinian state,
Oh man! What are you saying, man? You're ruining our reputation, leave me alone!
Please!
Pardon me, Mr. Tiger, pardon me, Mr. Chairman.
Can you give me a chance to speak?
We have fully complied with the comprehensive international agreement.
What does the Israeli representative say?
To find anything solid, stone or plastic, as a pledge.
Oh my God! Even our houses!
What do you call it, people of the Gulf?
In Palestine, everything is made of wood.
Under the agreement, American companies manufacture wooden cars for us.
And all the doors of our houses are made of thermally treated wood.
We don't need speeches.
Don't change the subject.
Mr. President,
This is a crucial point, and I would like to vote on this because nail growth is considered a violation of the agreement.
If you agree, raise your hand.
But I had a very strange dream.
In order to be able to control the students.
I'm tired of saying it so many times.
This is the fourth school you will start working at tomorrow.
Because I asserted my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The boys follow him and tear his clothes, and he does nothing.
How many times has he come to me without his ghutra.
My manager told me.
Rashid is kind and we don't want to expel him.
The children are throwing chalk at him.
And they pull his keffiyeh in the break in front of everyone.
And they said, "This teacher is very indecisive and will ruin everything."
Should I tell them the ketchup story?
Come on, Mary.
What's the story with ketchup? This is new, no one told me!
They poured an entire bottle of ketchup on the chair.
He came and sat down.
He didn't know anything.
Only when he saw the children laughing at him in the schoolyard.
Stop.
By the way, the director of your school, whom you will start working with tomorrow, called me.
However, it's okay, we'll give him a chance.
Because I'm waiting to tell you.
The era of kindness and weakness is over.
Hey! Cousin! Hey! Abdullah!
You will see a different adult.
No need to remind you of the important educational quote.
You are a graduate of education, and so am I.
And we all know the quote,
The teacher is the son of the first class.
You will see Mr. Rashid the strong.
If anyone errs,
He'll be in trouble.
When I started to speak, he said "Shh!"
You'll see what I tell him.
Which one of you mocked me and told me to be quiet? Which one?
You're the one who told me to be quiet!
No, not me.
So the person next to you, you!
Go to the school principal.
And tell him that Professor Rashid expelled me.
I don't want to see your face here, do you hear me!
What do you think of my anxiety?
You shouldn't just be like this on your first day, you should be like this all year round.
Be aware of the consequences.
If you hear someone's voice
While I explain or speak.
You know what that means.
Nervous, you know what nervous means?
Means tense.
Did you hear me or not?
I heard it too.
Get out of the class.
Go to the school principal.
Take your things and leave now!
Take your things.
I don't care.
It's clear that he's still looking for it.
No, sir, we didn't see him.
By the way, strawberry ice cream is very delicious.
Dear Abdurrahman.
Everyone makes mistakes, it's human.
I'm joking, son.
But the most important thing is that your father doesn't know the story!
What I want, I want chocolate in my bag.
Okay, where's your bag? Where's your bag? Where's your bag?
In the classroom.
I'm at your disposal.
You say he's happy with you.
You don't know how to distinguish between a rich boy and an ordinary boy.
Oh, the irony! How does bad luck look green or red?
Come here, where are you going?
In the bathroom.
Are you still in the bathroom?
Knock on the door quickly and tell him that the first class started half an hour ago, quickly.
I was before all of them, one juice and one bag of chips.
I took him before all of them, I bothered them. My friend Abdurrahman, by the way, this is very healthy.
Okay, now go to Saud and bring the PlayStation CD with him.
So, what are the lessons learned from this story?
That man.
He must have morals.
This is the PlayStation device, and also tell me to bring the whole PlayStation at once.
Okay, do you want something else, my friend Abdulrahman, my friend?
Nothing at the moment.
We learn for the story.
You all know that I'm leaving this week because I've been accepted into graduate school.
So, I thought I should hand in the celebration file before my trip.
How can I pick you up in the afternoon? Abdurrahman told me, and I don't know where he wants to go, but he didn't tell me what time!
As long as his father came back and didn't say anything to him, thank God I calmed down and relaxed.
Let's assume I didn't take it this afternoon, he got upset, and told his father: No, no, no, it's a disaster, no, no.
Hello, my friend Abdulrahman.
God helps you.
What are you doing, this is an order.
You love her, like this?
Today, kids! We'll learn a new lesson in science.
Peace be upon you.
Thank you.
I need water.
I asked, and I asked nothing, I am at your service.
Teacher, teacher. How can you ask the teacher for water?
Is there a teacher who brings water to the student? Are you his servant who makes tea for him? This incident will not pass like this, I will write it in the report.
And you're mocking, you're mocking me.
Don't raise your voice or shout at me, do you hear me or not?
How many people will this serve?
Okay, how many cars is this for?
Four to five cars.
Great, this is wonderful, beautiful, fantastic.
What is he doing?
As you can see, he will park his car in front of our houses at the expense of our comfort.
Don't fry during the days of Abu Nasser.
Abu Nasser is finished.
He studies abroad.
Alright, you broke the table.
Don't get tense, brother!
Why?
Are you different? (Idiomatic expression)
Change your behavior towards me.
Me or you?
We didn't say anything! Brother!
What is this?
Listen, leave everything as it is, it's better for you.
I'm not threatening you, brother!
What do you mean by "no need," and I want to relieve you?
What are you saying?
Instead of, what do they call it?
It seems you want the...
You want this, as you like.
Faster, faster.
Is this good?
Not like he likes, that's not fair!
He doesn't have the street smarts.
We're coming to Uncle Naif to talk, not to shout.
Who is this Rashid to do as he pleases in the neighborhood?
Did you give me a chance to speak?
Alright, everyone! Quiet down and let's hear what Uncle Abu Nayef has to say.
Now, this good-for-nothing is playing on your nerves!
Leave it to me.
If I hadn't slapped him in the face, he wouldn't have stuck to the umbrella he made.
The game is played by its players (idiom).
Is this good?
%Pw Goodbye.
I haven't seen anything yet.
Do you know he now has a jewelry store!
That's why I see her here wearing all these rings and necklaces.
God compensates us.
Just walk, will you stay in the heat?
I can't believe that the naive and poor Rashid has become like this.
He became the vice president of the Global Education Center.
Let him tell you, let him teach you. You are a teacher and he is a teacher, but look where he is now and where you are now.
No problem.
No worries, Abdullah!
I'll tell you the secret.
The professor has come, the professor has come.
Teacher, I didn't do anything!
Professor, you don't know who he is?
Yes, dear, I know who he is.
Here I tell you, we won't get a chance as good as this.
I, am looking for a job! This is funny, I swear this is funny.
No, brother, the job is in my pocket.
Thank you for everything you've done, thank you, thank you.
Convey my salutations to him.
Your mother sends you her greetings. God bless you, I will tell her, he sends his greetings.
Well, goodbye my love, in God's protection.
What else do you want, your brother is going to become a minister, just believe it, my son!
Oh Mother! We will work, we will work to a high standard.
But, my son, if you work with him, won't they say something?
He just gives it to you like that.
This thing is perfect, right?
Perfect! This is automatic, no doubt.
So, my dear, please fulfill my dream.
Before your dream, mine.
He is building a tower between the Corniche towers.
Come on, what are you waiting for!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You can do it, Abu Saleh!
It seems your friend is annoyed.
It doesn't seem so, brother!
You can do it, Abu Saleh!
He actually got up, took the mobile phone, and gave it to Abu Saleh.
Look, there's something behind this, and I'm 100% sure Abu Sultan is jealous of him.
His relationship with Abu Saleh was not good.
No, Abu Sultan won't do that unless he intends to do something else.
Indeed, to this extent?
Open the car door for him!
Finally, he works on opening the minister's car doors.
Oh my son, don't break my heart, don't break my heart.
For your information, all the stories we hear in cafes happen in the city.
But I can't believe what I'm hearing!
My heart stopped, my heart stopped.
I fear, my daughter, that the women will start talking about it, and don't mention Latuf the dish collector, for she spreads rumors about me among the women, my daughter!
Say something, Abu Sultan, speak. I'm shocked, I'll faint.
Please, I know what I'm doing.
It's none of your business.
Manira, I'm playing it cool.
By opening the door for him, this is the beginning of the plan in my head.
I deserve to become a minister, not him.
Let me work, I have a plane to catch.
Let it be said to him.
Yes, plan.
He must trust me in the beginning.
They told me we appointed him minister because he was appointed two months before my appointment.
Because I'm quite sure he'll be fired from his job.
The magic may wear off.
What is this?
What's this either?
And at every event he attends, the photographer will take many pictures of him until his face becomes very familiar in the newspaper.
And it decays until it floats on the surface.
Sure?
Just wait. Let me work against him and you'll see.
On the contrary, Your Honor.
Of course, Your Excellency the Minister.
So, tell me,
Did you thank him for the lamb? By the way, the meat was very delicious.
The man is outside, go see him.
Don't be foolish, people want to elevate you and you want to humiliate yourself.
Only the minister, please, please.
No, no, no, don't take my picture. Just His Excellency the Minister, take a picture, Your Excellency.
Take another one as well.
Oh brother! Really, I like your plan.
I want you to take him there.
Picture, picture, picture.
Yes, he is a minister, and he is that as well.
Alright, I'll tell you, wait!
Go to the page before the last one.
Look at the size of his picture with the groom.
There is no god but God!
Yes, every day I have one or two pictures.
As you say, he is a social activist. Well, well, goodbye.
Everyone loves you, but I don't know what's wrong with you.
Ubiquitous (idiomatic expression).
They are jealous, they envy you. The tree that bears fruit is the one that gets stoned. (Proverb)
Take me to the market!
Aren't you ready?
Peace be upon you.
Hello, peace be upon you, hello.
You are very famous.
Yes, your name is Abdulaziz Abdullah, right?
This is my husband.
How many times have I told you?
Three hundred and fifty.
For this famous person,
Are you at home today? Is there a problem?
Leave me alone, I have a headache today, my head hurts, I feel pain all over my body, and my colon is acting up.
I'm tired, very tired. It's been a month, and I wish I hadn't gone with him.
Let me rest today.
Hello, Mother of Sultan.
Can I speak?
Oh woman! I just want him to take me.
I started to love him.
You've seen for yourself what fame does!
I know. Thank God you're convinced.
Frankly,
Your minister is worried, it seems he liked this story.
I'll send you my brother Saad.
No, I didn't follow any activity and I didn't read the newspaper, I don't know.
We are at your service, goodbye.
If God wants to destroy the ant, He gives it wings.
Peace be upon you, sir, do you have a conference here at the hotel tonight?
Wedding?
No worries, don't you have any events like a party, birthday, or wedding?
I don't know, but you can see the hotel behind us.
Ah, there's a hotel behind you, isn't there?
Can you stay in the car while I go into the hotel to ask?
Go, go, go and take your time. Go and ask, go.
God helps everyone.
Does this minister let us sleep or rest?
That means he didn't find an occasion for him, nor a wedding, nor any problem to create for him.
He took him to the Sixteen Thousand Hotel and found nothing for him. He's as unlucky as he looks.
Shut up, hello.
You didn't find his birthday, or...
Go, you might make it for the second lap!
In every issue, he has a hundred pictures.
He doesn't sleep! He doesn't get tired, brother!
Good heavens! The editor of the newspaper says that the first thing is to get his picture ready, and then I get the newspaper ready.
She said my children participated in a contest about the picture of your husband the minister.
One asks the other, "How many pictures of the minister are there in the newspaper?"
And the winner gets a prize.
The story isn't like that. You need to come to the cafe and hear the comments every day about his picture in the newspaper. This talk never stops.
Oh no, his end is very near.
As they say, when God wills the butterfly's demise, it draws near to the light.
People will leave you and greet him.
He became one of the most famous people in the country.
No worries, who is this?
You've ruined my reputation.
God bless you and her.
She said that we would all get married except poor Amal, who was the only one of us who hadn't married.
This is my fate.
It's not written for me to get married.
And forget about marriage.
God is sufficient for those who strive.
Do you see those spoiled brats sitting over there?
Yes, what's wrong with them?
Do you see him playing with his hair?
Is this a boy or a girl?
After my father's death, I mean his murder.
You saw it, it grew before your eyes, right?
We must not allow him to become attached to the maid.
Go make tea.
I'm tired of talking to my mom. But she doesn't have just one maid, she has two for him.
I've told you a hundred times not to interfere, Khalid is my son, not yours.
You don't have any other problem except for Khadija, the maids, the servants, and Khalid.
Oh Mother, this is not good, Khalida spends twenty-four hours with the maid and doesn't want anyone else.
Get out. I want to rest, I want to sleep. How?
Oh my God, Saud, your brother Khalid has become a girl.
Wait a bit, if I don't tell my dad about you.
Let me tell you something, what's wrong with Khaleda?
Saud says that Khulood is wearing makeup and acting like a girl. What's going on? What's going on?
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! Oh Saud.
Khulud is putting makeup on his face! It's just a little bit of makeup. A child saw a makeup box and played with it.
I saw a very small spot, and even that is unclear.
He is kind, polite, and gentle.
I will scold Saud.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
Last time I asked you, Saad, what you wanted to be when you grow up, and you didn't tell me. Now, tell me, when you grow up, what do you want to be?
And you, my dear Kholodi, my dear Saad, will become an office, and what do you want to become?
This year we will travel to London, just like last year.
Yes, contact the shaker in Bahrain.
He answers Susen, Halouda, and Fahouda.
And say hello to Sumayyah.
I seek forgiveness from Allah.
Today, my father told me to choose.
Do you want me to build on the land overlooking the sea or the nearby land?
I said I don't want to choose.
I can live with you, my love, anywhere.
Thank you, my love.
And you taught me how to fish?
Oh my God! Amal, I wish I could open my eyes and be told that you've graduated from university.
It doesn't seem to be a men's perfume.
I don't know, but it smells very strange.
Oh my God, what's happening to me?
The way you speak has become feminine.
I forgot you were a man.
I wish you wouldn't speak to people like this outside, too.
Impossible! Khalid.
Please leave my room!
Alas! Khalid!
You disappointed me.
Come on, don't hurt my feelings, or I'll tell my mom.
This is my son, and I know him well.
Oh poor thing! Oh Khalid, the light of my eyes, I wish all children had his kindness and feelings.
And you, when you see a kind and quiet person, you say they are like me.
Shame on you, it's disgraceful for you to speak about your brother in such a manner.
Stop this, you've made a big fuss about nothing.
Poor thing, he just wears a very nice perfume. Now, what's the difference between men's perfume and women's perfume?
Here I'm telling you, don't say that in front of your father.
I have it.
I'll show it to you, but be quiet, so Mohammed doesn't notice anything.
How did these girls meet?
It's a shame for a beautiful girl like her to do this!
Don't look at him, don't look at him!
I'm afraid he felt something attached to him.
Indulge yourself.
I know you're following the widespread spread of Bluetooth these days.
I am waiting for Saad to come.
How are you, Saad?
May God protect you.
We were waiting for you, we didn't play cards.
What? Why?
Would you like something to drink?
I've seen him sleeping here in your apartment for two days!
Because of the Bluetooth story.
Yes, his older brother threatened him.
He's afraid of him.
Don't try, I've told you not to try.
I seek refuge in Allah from the devil, my son! For my sake!
I've already booked.
I will leave. How do I face people? I can't!
What should I tell your father?
Tell him anything.
Oh God, these kids only bring trouble.
This is the end, mother.
I remember when Khadija was little.
Of course, that's what will happen.
Stop, please get out.
Truth always hurts.
The jar broke.
It's impossible for me to live in Doha.
I can't face people.
My phone is currently turned off.
And you're blaming me, Amal?!
You are a girl and you spend your entire day at home.
What do I say when I'm a man spending my whole day meeting people outside?
Tough, Amal!
I cannot live while spending my day, my life, and always having my head down.
The father feels for a while that there is something wrong at home and that there has been a change.
For how long will my father be absent from the events happening here at home?
Sometimes I blame my father and sometimes I don't.
I don't blame him, Amal! When I remember his dedication and loyalty to his work, so that we can live with dignity among people.
And I do blame him.
When the father leaves home, the responsibility of the children falls on the mother.
We don't want to rake up the past now.
Does your father know or not?
But I'm ready for
Turn on his Bluetooth.
But I won't give it to him.
I don't want to see the shock in my father's eyes.
I'll be devastated.
Come on, Amal!
He knows how to throw us.
It's much better to know that from someone else.
Alas, our house has come to this.
Due to the explosion of a dirty bomb known as a "Khaledood" in it.
And customs and traditions.
You will find them arrogant.
They stopped their ears from him.
They don't want to listen to him.
They only listen to one voice.
What is impurity and strangeness?
They trample on all that is good.
What comes to mind?
You suddenly decided to study abroad.
We can only say, "May God help you, my son!"
God helps you.
People who return bring gifts, not those who are about to travel.
You're right.
This is the law.
But every rule...
Amal, come with me quickly.
Did you see it, my daughter?
I hear nothing.
Abu Saad!
Abu Saad.
Abu Saad, what's wrong with you?
Father, what's wrong, father?
Father!
Don't bother.
You are a great person.
And any man who wants to marry you.
I did not divorce you for any fault of yours.
I have divorced you.
Because it's impossible.
I agree to be the uncle of my children.
I'm like your brother.
So, sail on.
You're here every day.
You've never come before.
You were hiding in the infrastructure.
That was before when we were in the metro.
These are very powerful words, can you handle such words?
You make twelve hundred, you earn a lot of money!
God does what He wills.
Walk, walk.
I just arrived seven months ago, don't weigh me down and take me home.
How embarrassing and shameful! Every time he takes me to someone's house, he asks their driver, "How much do they pay you?" Nothing satisfies him, and today he asked for a raise.
He's making fun of you, driver.
He came less than seven months ago.
Annoy me, son, annoy me.
Send it back, let's get rid of it.
Send him back and get another one!
Tell your son, he doesn't know what's behind this word! He doesn't know about the cost of time and money.
Leadership training. Send him to the back and get rid of him!
The first time I came to my house was six months ago.
Alright, so I'll say something new to you.
Petroleum is now $114, before it was 50 cents per liter, maybe even $5. Everything has become expensive, President.
Open your mind and listen to what I'm saying!
When you first came here, what salary did I give you?
You gave me seven hundred.
You are still new. You've only been here for six months, and this salary of eight hundred is too much.
I need money.
These drivers you're talking about are old, old, you're new.
This seven hundred has now become eight hundred.
Go!
He told me he would raise my salary by only one hundred riyals.
No use with three hundred.
Is what I told you correct?
No, no screen. I'll be in trouble when I escape.
No, I'm afraid not, Screen.
Those who fled from their sponsors.
Why are you afraid?
Because the shepherds for those people were before.
Give them a salary of six to seven hundred. Do you know how much they're paid?
How much do you earn?
So, why are you afraid?
I'm not afraid.
Enough of God is against him.
I woke Nasser up and told him to go see that person.
There was no one.
He even stole the phone I bought for him.
What did you do?
I did it!
They did everything they could, took his passport, and put it with them.
You can go! Sir, you are excused.
We will look for him everywhere.
This is the problem, this is the problem.
And after all this, they escape.
They've gotten us into trouble and are harming us.
I told you to return it.
You just think I'll leave him?
I will find him no matter what.
He will return, which means he will come back.
As for me, I'd rather pay for his ticket and send him home than let him stay here and make money.
The cup runneth over, I wish to find him.
Come in now, man. No one will buy now.
At the beginning of the game, you seemed nervous, as I noticed.
But what are we worried about? We were worried that our team wouldn't score goals.
We need more than three, we want ten, twelve, and fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were afraid; you were scared of the opposing team.
I'm not afraid of the opposing team, I'm afraid of our team. I'm afraid they won't score more than three.
This is our team's level, I know that. I'm talking about our team's level.
This is a great trust from you.
The rival team has nothing.
Great! The foxes have scored a goal, and you're leading 1-0.
Where are you going?
I'm going home.
Do you have a car?
Come with me, I'll take you.
Thanks, man.
Why try, you can't beat our team!
Your Highness, the match has just started and the league has just begun.
Did you hear what he said?
He said, "It's very complicated."
Mahmoud, bring the tea!
Now my friend is coming to pick me up to go to the stadium, quickly.
Take it, O friend, prostrate.
Take it, Pasha!
What did he do to himself?
Yes, he is the Indian person.
Yes, my God! Man, he's football crazy.
Don't talk about my fox team like that.
They will win, they will win.
Come on! Sajid, come on! Sajid, hurry up! The match is about to start. Bring a bottle of water, the Foxes are playing today.
Dear viewer, we have with us one of the most famous fans of the Foxes club, his name is Tholob.
They say you beat them because they were incomplete.
What they say, what they say is not true.
What is incomplete? Each team has a dozen players.
If there's not one person or two, it doesn't make any difference.
This fox is very clever.
This is our best fan.
Okay, on the occasion of your victory, Fox! Fox, a final word you'd like to say to the foxes.
All words stop.
When they call out the name of the foxes.
His name is high in the sky.
This is the good fan.
Listen to me, brother.
You can find him enthusiastic like this.
Come on, handsome!
So, where is the Indian football fan?
How long has it been since I've seen him?
Goodness! He's become a big star now, he doesn't come here anymore.
I saw the man a few days ago and didn't recognize him. He was sitting in a Starbucks café in The Village, or something like that.
I remember this boy, he came and sat with us at the café and he didn't have money for a cup of tea.
The boy gave me a tip of twenty riyals in front of me.
What made him like this?
Good heavens! [The man], he sits with the top brass of the club, they help him and do whatever he wants.
May I say something, Thaloub?
Yes, Uncle.
My uncle said: "Whether you go or come,"
I don't know why you support such a bad and weak club.
This fox team is my heart.
When you open my heart
You can catch a lot of foxes there.
You haven't heard the poem, Your Honor, that he wrote about the verdict.
When we had a match with them.
Please, oh please! Fox, throw, throw this poem, throw, throw.
My uncle. Oh my God, who knows my secret.
My spirit is in great pain.
I never sleep at night.
You know we're the Fox Fan Club.
You can't tell me the winner's name until I get an exclusive scoop.
We will hold a press conference, God willing, and announce the name of the winner.
The Spender
The famous Tholoud, this fan who was honored today by the management of the Foxes Club in a very kind, rare, and amazing gesture.
Really!
Congratulations, Thaalub, on this beautiful honor, and of course, this is a wonderful gift.
What do you think, is this a pen or a watch?
This is it, Dad, I swear.
This is a gesture.
I'm telling you, this is it.
We must inform the police.
Don't go anywhere!
The public, all of them, all of them, all are the public.
No, no, no! My son, this is not him, it's his lookalike.
I'm telling you, it's not him.
You're late.
I don't know the game schedules, brother!
How can we catch him now?
We just have to wait until the Foxes play their next match.
There he is, there he is, I saw him.
Okay, let's follow him.
Brother, you're late!
Here he is, here he is, here he is, here he is.
Catch up with him, follow him, follow him, catch up with him.
The problem is that we're not sure if it's him or not.
I'm telling you, Dad! This is it.
I say the truth, and the wisdom is that we go to them and ask them by telling them about the driver you have, where did he come from? How did he come to you? When did he come to you?
Oh father, you always complicate things.
We tell him about it, I'm sure of it.
Earth, may God preserve it. Yes, it is mine.
Yes, it's registered in my name, yes.
And also the other land adjacent to it.
Tell your father that Abu Abdulrahman Al-Subaie sends his regards, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
No, no, God bless you, but I think we made a mistake. Oh, my son! We came to a friend's house and mistook you for him.
Praise be to God, He creates many people who resemble each other.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Your Honor, thank you.
No, God bless you. Sorry, sorry, and thank you, thank you.
Okay, if you please, excuse me, and I'm here to help you. Goodbye, may God protect you, goodbye.
And you say you're sure!
I don't know what your father is doing! I'm very worried.
What did you do, Wael?
When, when, when was I walking, I caught my bag handle on it.
And try to fix it now!
Go to your room, go.
I hope nothing bad happens.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Now, try to make your father understand this!
Before my father knows?
Shatter into a million pieces.
Okay, Mom, let's buy something similar to it as soon as possible.
Before my father comes.
Please, Mom!
You know your father, when he gets angry, he goes crazy.
Go to your room and don't come out.
He did nothing.
By accident, he hit the vase with his bag, causing it to fall and shatter.
Mom, I'm worried about him.
I don't know where he is.
No, no, no, no, his father is crazy.
Why are you doing this to the boy, my daughter!
You terrified him and scared him, do you want the boy to go crazy?
May I say something, my daughter?
Where do you think the boy has gone?
Okay, if he comes, I'll call you.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Auntie, I know where Waleed is.
Come with me, I'll guide you to where he is.
Let's go. Come on.
Here it is.
Oh grandma, I don't want to go home.
Hide me in your place.
I didn't see the vase.
I swear to God, I don't know.
This is what your father scares you with, may God forgive him and guide him.
Come with me, son!
Don't panic, son, as long as I'm home, don't worry, my child!
I have the solution.
We didn't say anything, Abu Walid!
Please, I beg you, O Abu Walid!
This time, I'll forgive him for your sake.
What did you find in the house?
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where is he? Where?
Alright, son! Your father won't do anything to you.
Sure, Dad?
Yes, oh! my son, yes.
Are you leaving it here? I'm afraid one of the kids might hit it and break it.
He asked me and told me that you need to bring me one like the one you brought me that Walid broke.
He wants this exact one. Go and find this one only, the last piece in the store. He's very lucky. Where are the kids?
In the room, I study.
Okay, take care.
Just one more game and I'll stop.
Oh my God!
Well, then study!
My father wants this game only and we will study.
Dad, please don't tell Uncle.
Dad, don't tell your brother. Dad, I swear this is the last time.
I'll call him.
And you, in particular. You've insulted me, am I your friend at the café?
I'll tell my brother about you if you don't watch out!
Alright, I won't call. This phone is in my pocket, so if you're going to study, that's fine.
Daughter, why don't you take him to the doctor?
God guide you, mother.
He scares him to death because he beats him all the time.
Poor boy.
Wait.
Mom, where's the commission? I don't see it with you today.
And you go with her.
My sister doesn't accept wearing abayas.
Oh my God! My daughter, I haven't told you the story of Manira and her son Nayef.
Her son is the same age as Waleed, may God have mercy on him.
And the same height.
Yesterday, she was telling me she didn't know what to do with her son.
She wants to take him to the hospital, but her husband Youssef
I learned about the story yesterday.
He argued with her and shouted at her.
He says, "Why didn't you tell me?"
This is a psychological condition.
This is against the boy's will.
He must take his son and tie him to the middle of the backyard.
And later, he will be asked to do it again and pee in your bed.
Useless noise.
What did you say, Umm Munira!?
I was telling her, "Eat, eat."
Eat and enjoy your meal.
Poor me.
Oh mother, oh mother.
It's lucky for you that your father didn't know about you.
Or else he will beat you to death.
Alright, go take a bath before your father wakes up, or he'll make a disaster.
I won't listen to what you say.
Alas for them.
They cry and tremble.
I'm afraid something might happen to my children.
I must take them to their uncle to punish them.
I'm nervous.
They didn't fail, they succeeded.
Why are you taking them to their uncle?
Nasser scored forty-eight out of fifty.
Why don't they get fifty out of fifty?
Their uncle warned them.
Frankly, I agree with his point of view.
Forget feelings.
And my brother should punish them.
Alright, I'll get it, I'll get it.
This is the last time, this is the last time.
Fifty out of fifty.
He is wasting our time, and I assure them that he is our son.
Why don't you get fifty from fifty?
Shut up, shut up, shut up. I've warned you, but you don't listen to what I say.
You're not listening to what I'm saying.
Rude boy!
Hit him again, let me punish him.
Ai! Enough, Uncle.
To do well next time, study!
Alright, that's enough.
Do you know what I'm doing?
I will let you jump one by one and it will be falafel.
Be cautious when going to public places with your family.
He creates misunderstandings for us.
Teacher, Waleed is crying.
Why are you crying?
This is an excellent sign.
It's strange that you're crying.
You're supposed to be happy.
Oh son! Everyone has left, even the buses have departed. You're waiting for someone to come to you.
At the school entrance, which means he is waiting for the bus. The bus has arrived and the children are getting off.
Did you hear about the boy who committed suicide today?
They gave him his certificate.
And his father threatens him, if he doesn't get full marks.
Walid, Walid. Come back, Walid! Come back.
Hello and welcome, live, to a new episode of our program "Without Borders"
Oil accounts for more than thirty-five percent of the total diverse energy sources.
While the rest goes to natural gas, charcoal, and hydroelectric power.
Therefore, oil is considered the primary source of energy in the world.
The Gulf countries and Iran alone possess 686 billion barrels.
Iran followed with twelve percent, then Iraq with ten percent, and then Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates with nine percent.
Then each of them comes with Venezuela at seven percent.
Then Russia with five percent.
The Gulf states and Iran account for two-thirds of the world's reserves.
Unprecedented prices and exceeded $109 for the first time in history.
In this episode, we try to understand many of the complexities surrounding oil.
And the problems facing oil-exporting countries.
Despite their enormous prices
Also the problems faced by citizens and residents in these countries.
Due to inflation and unprecedented rise.
Which will then be displayed on the screen, or they can write to us through our website "www.Aljazeera.net"
Because the market today is the main factor.
And not the producing countries.
Today, what determines the price is market power.
No, not OPEC.
Of course, supply and demand play a role.
But other factors are
Other factors are political tensions.
In the world
And real estate markets.
and stock markets and others
And moved to prices in speculation.
I am a "commodity" like oil, for example.
And tomorrow it will reach $1,000, God willing.
In 2004, oil jumped from forty-four dollars.
And today we see that even gas prices
He changes from day to day.
Oil prices fell below ninety dollars.
And increased in the second quarter.
Especially with the arrival of spring, and secondly because most of the world's filters are under maintenance.
Always, for the second quarter
Seasonal demand for oil is declining.
In winter, the temperature drops below ninety.
And all this indicates that speculation has the power and control over the market now.
A lot has changed since we used to go to the traditional market in the past.
The market was previously influenced by supply and demand.
Seasonal supply and demand
Today, we see that economic growth is
Today or yesterday, General Fallon, the commander of the Central Command in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
And his resignation sparked a major reaction as it was linked to what is called the expected American war.
Political or Geopolitical Effects
It can quickly affect the oil market, either negatively or positively.
The impact will certainly come and will have its effect.
Even speculators also react to political effects.
Some might assert, he will say, some will tell you that America's war on Iran is coming.
Here's what will happen to the market? The market will be optimistic in some way.
This question, Your Excellency, is now in light of what the White House has said.
This returned the region to an atmosphere of tension.
This is the mystery.
But Fallon might have seen this scenario.
He has a quick reflection on the oil market.
Today, the figures have proven that there is no shortage.
Let me give you an example: In the past seven weeks.
In the United States of America, their oil reserves have increased by more than half over the past five years.
Today, I don't mean to say...
Not even for the coming war, because I tell you today that the world itself has a profitable storage.
Even today's global consumption, you can choose any country and find long queues in front of gas stations.
This is something else.
What are the risks posed by this issue?
What number do you expect it to be? I don't know.
Two hundred dollars or maybe three hundred dollars, perhaps less but
It might come to that if these tensions turn into real tensions.
Because, as I said, the Gulf represents sixty percent.
In a country far even from oil-producing nations.
You will see how the effect will be reversed on the oil market.
And it can reach three hundred dollars.
And moved from stocks and other to the oil market. Today you will see more than two or three trillion dollars.
Today we see printing.
Speculation in it exceeds a hundred daily - meaning -
That these tensions in the region and in anticipation
April, as previously stated, will be the month in which this war will be ended.
God knows, I didn't do it, I mean, it's Chinese.
In the area because now
This year is an election year.
And the current American administration still has only a few months left.
George H. W. Bush launched a war on Somalia and sent thirty thousand Canadians in his final days in the White House.
We see, but do not foresee events.
But I don't think this scenario will happen.
Because this scenario is too expensive.
America won't pay anything, you will pay, and also Iran and the consumer countries.
America Today
Now it depends on African oil, and it has many other alternatives.
Look, there's none, let's talk frankly.
In your introduction, you stated that sixty percent...
From oil reserves
But now they are issuing twenty-two...
I get oil from West Africa.
I'm from West Africa and anything they export from any other region in the world.
Oil production
Because this is a fixed number and fixed reserves and reserves.
So-called deep-water production or seabed mining from the vast depths of the ocean
Therefore, the Gulf region will remain a tough number.
And the Caspian Sea oil.
I consider them dreams because they are neither truth nor reality.
They ruin it and destroy it.
The important thing is existence.
Today, Qatar is the world's largest energy exporter.
LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas), and that's why these countries are a tough number.
and the energy needs of countries
It certainly means there's something called a secure supply chain.
And despite internal objections within the United States, even at the level of General Fallon
But there are still some concerns.
About President Bush who fell.
Try to notice how political risks do not come from the Gulf states.
He never came, no, no, no. It has nothing to do with generosity, because none of us deal in generosity.
No, there's a lot of generosity in the dealing.
But not "in the current field"
We are not part of a charity.
Or be generous.
But generous with Western movies and not generous with anyone else.
With America specifically
Where is the market?
Wherever there are economic gains, we will go.
We won't do it.
Like oil and gas
You'll put it down to generosity.
I have the proof.
I have the proof.
It doesn't exceed sixty to seventy dollars.
Not the rise in prices.
But the persistent decline of the US dollar
You are primarily a people of the Gulf Cooperation Council and OPEC nations.
The export should be in dollars, but you refuse.
Change the currency despite the currency collapse and thus
Even though the return is not in your favor.
No, I didn't say it has to be 70.
It's expert talk, not my opinion.
Well, the dollar fell by thirty percent and oil rose by more than this decline.
So if we take the base year as 2004
We see oil prices ranging from thirty-five to thirty-six dollars.
Of course, this means
Oil has raised its price.
But it's a slight increase, Your Excellency.
That means if we take it.
We're considering it now.
Even at these prices
I mean if we compare it to the year 2004.
But its rate of decline even exceeded that of the US dollar.
The exciting thing is
React to the dollar's decline.
As the dollar's value drops, oil prices rise.
This is also something the market has started to give a sense of.
Our concern now is to reduce.
No, the situation has changed. Maybe at the beginning of the downturn two years ago they were saying this, but the situation has changed now and there is...
And the dollar began to lose value against other major currencies like the euro and the British pound.
So, the question is why did you peg your currency to the dollar?
Weak currency without backing.
This is an historical era.
Gasoline and its derivatives are in dollars, even European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
It reports that America in the mid-1970s
Abolished the gold standard that had been for the US dollar.
This is not true.
Okay, then tell me what's correct.
OPEC comprises
Four Gulf states
Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia
Today, OPEC's share of the global market.
It's forty percent.
Today, if we say that the world consumes eighty-five million barrels
Those that deal in dollars for oil pricing.
If you price in another currency, everyone will do it.
You can't.
All oil-producing countries must agree.
You, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, are a star.
Those who own 66% of the world's reserves are the big ones.
Reserves, but I think it's an export.
Including Venezuela, Libya, and Iran
Cameron, Angola, and all these countries are organized under OPEC.
Her market share does not exceed forty percent.
It was produced and exported outside OPEC.
And this cannot be linked to the forty percent.
She can't by herself unless...
There are some countries that tried but...
Untrue attempt
It's you who are being rejected because of American ties.
From dollars to another currency.
All oil-producing countries.
He used to export only one barrel before.
It's a pity if they import it.
His currency's exchange rate rose sharply.
He sells his oil in dollars.
At his entrance or receiving apparatus, he received it, then got his money in dollars and converted it to his local currency.
Its currency is not linked to the dollar.
Correct, but
But it's also your problem; you sell in dollars, but if your currency isn't pegged to the dollar, you wouldn't have any issue.
My main question now is
What are the concerns and implications of pegging your currency to the dollar amid the dollar's declining value?
That has been associated for many years.
Especially in the 1970s when the dollar was a very strong currency with immense clout.
This withdrawal is not that simple.
Divorce is easy.
No, not here, like that.
Divorce has its costs.
Works for these countries, not against them.
In profit and loss
Dow Jones announced yesterday the existence of 4 countries, including Qatar.
But there is also a report on Gulf financial affairs stating that there are four Gulf countries, of course, since Oman withdrew from the unified Gulf currency.
I read a statement in the Dow Jones and I don't believe it's a genuine statement.
The governor of the Qatar Central Bank has been exiled.
He said yes and that there will be a study, but all Gulf countries must also be involved.
Profit and loss must be examined with great care and emotional distance.
Leave the matter for examination and until they return.
Look, I can get you other economic experts who can conduct another study.
This study contradicts that.
The global house said something very simple and organized, and it was issued in a report dated March 8.
Just four days ago
Global House Number, the simple solution requires a non-political decision.
The political decision can be summarized in two things.
Not three, first of all.
Her intention, or the five with Kuwait, regarding her intention in 2010 to issue currency or study the issuance of a unified Gulf currency.
The second point is to issue a decision to withdraw from the dollar.
Firstly, regarding the single currency.
From my personal point of view
For the Gulf Unified Currency
This currency will be strong.
Will be
Perhaps one of the strong currencies in the world as you said.
And what will come of the reserves and the massive revenues?
That's why the Prime Minister focused on this when he said...
Gulf countries because no single nation can do it alone.
Only with strong economic content
And today we see economic growth, even the euro.
Of course, you must not forget that the central bank plays a major role.
In assessment
And calculate the profit and loss.
From all this news
Tense situation
Two thousand and eight, as observers said, Global House said this inflation will continue.
For a long time in the Gulf countries, but the solution is in the hands of governments.
Some countries have raised salaries by seventy percent, like the UAE.
To stop the inflationary process that
And here's my question now, when will you raise the salaries of these poor people?
I'll listen to your response after a short commercial break.
Today's episode: Oil reserves and daily production of Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Saudi Arabia.
He has reserves amounting to two hundred and sixty-four billion.
And two out of ten barrels
Producing nine out of ten daily.
One million, Kuwait one hundred and one and a half, production one billion, and production two and seven-tenths millions.
Qatar: 15 and 12 billion production, 850,000 Oman: 5 and 6.10 billion production, 707,000
Bahrain has a population of one hundred and twenty-five million and produces thirty-five thousand.
The total annual revenue was thirty-eight billion.
From 2003 to 2007
Europe one hundred billion
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion.
In Asia and other countries
While the total GDP of the Gulf Cooperation Council states in two thousand and six hundred and seventeen.
Total revenue in 2007 is expected to be 799.7 billion.
To be in 121,180,921,000
While inflation continues to devour the salaries of employees and people working in this field.
But it will rise to eight point three in two thousand and eight.
Kuwait is fourteen percent, but in 2008 it is expected to be eight and nine-tenths percent of the United Arab Emirates.
It will be ten while Saudi Arabia was six and a half and will reach six.
Eight out of ten
Salaries are eaten.
So, what are the amounts and percentages that will be given to the poor here?
If we want to solve the problem
Real solution
Salaries always, ever-increasing salaries.
It's not the solution.
I don't oppose raising salaries.
This is not true, I, this is not true.
We always
Of course, there is a belief.
In the event of an increase, without controlling inflation, inflation will devour all these increases.
To address the problem of inflation, a high-level committee comprising all experts and specialists is formed.
And now this committee places
Due to the increase in salaries worldwide
And of course, the golden rule of economics says
It will have no end.
And whatever it is
Substantial salary increases, no matter the raise.
Inflation will rise.
The solution is necessary and inevitable.
Based on a scientific study here, Bayt.com, the specialized employment institute, conducted a study with the help of the British YouGov Seraj.
They conducted a survey of fifteen thousand employees working in the Gulf countries in twenty key sectors.
Especially experts and professionals have no job satisfaction.
Because inflation here has started to spiral out of control.
Especially experienced ones.
You're considering moving from these countries where inflation continues to erode purchasing power.
Now you will lose.
This is the simple concept, and you're putting the simple concept and trying to apply it.
The solution to inflation is to increase salaries.
The balance is available.
There he is.
We are concerned, the state is concerned, and we are doing our best.
Solve this problem with a real solution.
Temporary solutions never solve the problem but rather complicate it.
Increasing it means
We hope to have more time before this committee puts forward its recommendations.
All requests
This is boring and Your Highness.
Boredom will always exist.
True, but the government tried and patched the increases with forty percent.
No, there's an important point here regarding raises.
Regarding increases, they only want Qataris as if non-Qataris were working for Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
Consider Qataris but do not consider non-residents.
The higher proportion is in it.
You, Ahmed, live in Qatar, not in Germany.
And everyone talks about it and suffers.
Much higher salaries than in the public sector.
On the contrary, we saw
In the public sector
On the contrary, the public sector has become...
Because the best units and competencies have started.
I also read a report, as you know, we are in an oil field.
Work
Follow our experts.
Engineers and workers coming from outside Qatar.
Because we also interact with the global market.
For all these things, what is the rate of increase in salaries?
Hope is with Allah, the Most High, but we say...
The government has a plan.
And I say that controlling inflation is the most important.
Temporary solution
And we'll see, I'm sure.
To be there
Positive results
It will be around fifteen percent.
Well, the second good report says that twenty-two billion barrels of oil will come to you and forty-three billion cubic meters of gas.
No comment, this is not the spraying process.
Action, and of course we do.
But talk of economic growth must also translate into benefits for people.
And today, reflecting no economic growth, Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world.
And the reverse is true.
The giant carriers in the country are also a part.
And if these massive "carriers" and large projects did not exist?
In this country, it won't be part of inflation either.
Led to some inflation
This also led to a lot of liquidity in the market.
Firstly, regarding the link between the dollar and oil.
Pledging oil for protection.
I am from the United States of America, hence the stability in power.
Thank you.
Saad al-Ghamdi from Saudi Arabia, your question, Saad.
Peace, mercy, and blessings from God.
Indeed, it's a good episode and a good title.
What I really want to talk about is that the region is now under American policies.
American policy in its war now, in addition to the cultural war it is trying to wage against Islam, there is a global economic war.
Now in China
And America's inability also reached Japan with sixty-one billion dollars.
And Japan has already invested in two thousand.
With America to the equivalent of nine.
Billions, while now investing with the European Union at more than twenty-seven billion dollars.
To keep up with American politics and make the dollar the inevitable currency for the whole world.
Brother, I say buy now.
And the Gulf region will become
As a place
Thank you, Brother Saad.
Mohamed El-Wasif from Egypt
Hello to the happy deputy with you.
Middle Eastern rulers, Your Excellency, remind me of...
When there is
When there are requests to adjust prices.
Adjust the salaries to compensate for prices, as you kindly suggested, Your Excellency.
In Qatar, we considered you a prototype.
And he continued not to promise an increase, which is a very Arab style.
We consider Qatar as Abu Treika.
He has the right to say what he wants, do you have a question? It's certainly his right, and he's responsible for this policy.
The question first.
His Excellency must take into consideration.
This is one second in which he must respond to public opinion.
With the poor, as you mentioned, for they are the people of countries that need special care.
Arab leaders who do not care about the poor.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Good evening to you and good evening to Mr. Happiness.
I want a raise, too.
Salaries are excellent and good, which is great.
Okay, thank you for the topic we need and suffer from.
I am with the poor and I will always be with them, God willing. We know and are certain that there are no poor people in Qatar.
And he ruled that Qatar agreed with his statement that the money was going to the ruling family and to the ruler.
And this is the important question now.
Let's start by answering our brothers first.
Cannot judge.
What happens to wealth?
Now there are new cities being built almost like Pearl and Lusail and other places, and this means that Qatar is also expanding.
This is not the case. The case is this.
Suitable urban plan
In short, since we have two minutes left, tell us what Qatar will strive for.
Qatar now, and there is a post-oil and gas Qatar.
There is a clear policy of the state.
Because he
Non-renewable origin
Because it is a non-renewable resource.
Therefore, today's trend in the State of Qatar.
The capital of the Middle East in education
Today we see the Education City.
Today, this educational city includes the best colleges in the world.
Building medical cities, media cities, and financial cities.
Because today oil and gas
No, of course we're not imitating anyone.
Other satellite channels
Not only the island, but you will make a hundred islands, and of course we won't stand with the island.
Because my brother, these are our countries in the Gulf now.
In the seventies, the boom, now everyone remembers the seventies boom.
Now when we see what Qatar has in terms of growth.
This calls for a special episode about post-oil Qatar.
In our discussion about oil, its future, and its resources in the region, particularly in Qatar, I would like to extend my greetings to the program team.
I am Ahmed Mansour, greeting you without borders, and peace be upon you.
Peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you.
Direct greetings this week from the capital of Qatar, Doha.
And I welcome you to a new episode of our program "Without Borders"
At a time when Qatar hosts the largest U.S. military base outside the United States, Al Udeid Air Base.
With the United States' enemies in the region
Like Iran and Syria
Its doors are open to leaders.
In fact, Hamas leaders enjoy special relations with the Qatari leadership.
And the Emir of Qatar was the only Arab leader
I visited the southern suburbs of Beirut, which were destroyed by Israel during the Lebanon War in the summer of 2006.
And there is still unlimited support for the reconstruction of what Israel destroyed in Lebanon.
And at the time when Qatar reconciled
With her older sister in Saudi Arabia about two years ago.
At the same time, clashes with the regime in Egypt.
Like the file of the Lebanese, where he succeeded while others failed.
To gather the Lebanese leaders in Doha where they signed an agreement that led them to safety.
To the final elections
Files are difficult too.
Who cared to be the driver of these files, not Qatar.
The smallest Arab country
In today's episode
We are trying to understand the basis and principles upon which Qatari foreign policy is based.
For whose benefit?
Qatar, the smallest country in terms of geography and population, plays these significant roles.
And what qualifications enable him to do that?
And that will be in a live dialogue with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of Qatar.
For our esteemed viewers who wish to participate, they can contact us through the program's numbers, which will appear on your screen in a moment.
The visit made by the Emir of Qatar.
The roar of Al Jazeera's guns aims to improve relations with Saudi Arabia.
From the past, like Saudi Arabia's attempt to seize the Qatari government with the help of the Al Murrah tribe.
In its issue published on June 20th last month.
What is the nature of the secret deal?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Many things that are not
I don't think that's accurate.
In many interviews here on this program, I have always said that accuracy is that
And we consider it the backbone.
I am from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
A misunderstanding occurred.
Moreover,
And different viewpoints.
It is true that the issue of borders has been resolved and was a major obstacle.
The historical Saudi-Qatari relations were distinctive.
These links, if we notice them.
Between the two countries and the two families
Devastated by the misunderstanding.
Neither for us nor for them
Because there are no conditions between brothers.
And it's done, and now the relations are in a condition that I can assure you is excellent.
In the interest of the Cooperation Council
But how were relations improving between Qatar and Saudi Arabia when Qatar was the obstacle and the reason for that in 2002?
There is an important point.
And I repeat, if you go back to all the shows, I always said.
Not just the older sister, but I used to say that our reliance in the Cooperation Council is on
That Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
And we appreciate our relationship with her.
There was a sharp exchange of words, and it was clear to both parties.
These countries find themselves
Unsuccessful when the brothers agreed.
Especially the Saudi-Qatari home.
They found themselves in a conflict.
Where there are no camels.
And I don't think it was a strategy of anyone involved in this conflict.
But excuse me, Sheikh, let me put things in perspective or dot the i's.
Many observers see Al Jazeera as having changed over the past two years.
At a time when the positions criticized on Al Jazeera's screen are still in place.
What's happening inside Saudi Arabia?
Whether it's the arrested people, the opponents, or others, they remain steadfast.
The island stopped dealing with these issues.
Al Jazeera's coverage of the Hajj season has turned into
Praise for the system and what the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is doing in a different time.
First, you can ask the island management about this matter, don't ask me because I
What connects the two countries.
For the stability of the region.
This strategy continued and reinforced the stability of the region.
The area you are referring to is the Gulf region.
Gulf Region
There are many issues related to the Gulf region.
Also invite the Servant of the Two Holy Mosques in Kuwait.
He influenced all listeners and the entire Arab world.
He spoke from the heart about resolving, surpassing, and burying Arab disputes.
Not just in terms of views.
No, this is in the policies, and policies are perspectives.
In the Arab world, it is considered
A kind of war
While in the developed world
They talk about the same interest.
Now I have lived here for many years.
The situation now
Listen first.
There is a difference between this subject and the other.
The idea of a small country challenging larger nations and making them feel vulnerable.
Any difference or misunderstanding
He had his reasons.
And its causes have ended.
Due to the wisdom of our leaders.
Are there any warranties for the future relationship?
There are guarantees between two parties.
Based on love, brotherhood, and mutual interest between the two countries.
And leaders, their words are considered more than just a document.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
We greatly hope for the development of the Saudi-Qatari relationship.
For the better, and there will be more fields.
For this relationship, like our relationship with other Arab countries and other Gulf states.
Qatar is an important country.
Okay, then Saudi Arabia is an important country.
What is Egypt to Qatar? Because the bad thing is that at the same time it reconciled with Saudi Arabia.
And three organizations, namely Hezbollah.
Which channel is Al Jazeera?
"Are you against the regime in Egypt, the largest Arab state?"
First, let me start with this.
Egyptian people
And we respect the Egyptian nation.
And its benefits.
With many Arab issues and the sacrifices of the Egyptian nation
And this is the case.
Some might believe that through this case, we seek to reach an understanding with our brothers in Egypt.
In light of what you say about your respect for Egypt and the Egyptian people.
And we believe he is a good person.
Our differences with Egypt are on two points.
Or a single point.
We were accused of planning to overthrow Gaza, and I don't believe it.
And we don't interfere.
In cases that follow other countries
He does not believe in interfering in the affairs of any state unless there is room for reform.
Does that mean you intervened in Hamas' coup against the authority in Gaza?
Of course, I don't deny it. In fact, we didn't know about this any more than others did from the media.
We have relations with Hamas and we have relations with others.
What made Egypt different or was there a disagreement between you on this point?
I'll get to this.
Hezbollah plot
Hezbollah and
But I speak on behalf of my country.
This topic amazed us greatly.
Cheering for Qatar.
What did the pyramids say?
The pyramids said: ...
To attack Egypt and its position
Can I reply?
We return to the plot they mentioned.
Time will tell.
The beginning was not from the Gaza conference.
I absolve the Egyptian people and President Hosni Mubarak from it.
If we go back to the Meina conference in the distant past
After the Madrid conference, do you remember the port event held in Doha?
It so happened, and it was arranged that the conference would be held with us.
They said they don't want to hold the conference.
People, we know that you are coordinating with Israel.
Towards Qatar and this
What are we trying to understand and why.
We sat and talked, and talking is always good.
It consists of two parts.
Who are they?
There is a disagreement.
In political orientation
If we look at the penalty conference that was held
His Highness Prince spoke with all the presidents, including his brother President Hosni Mubarak.
We were informed by a foreign state.
The brothers in Egypt have a viewpoint on the matter that it should not be held.
And people are being killed while we watch.
If you don't want to hold it in Doha, we can hold it anywhere in the Arab League.
It would be shameful to discuss the issue on the sidelines of the Kuwaiti conference.
Israel and the Western world stand and watch what is happening.
When we all said okay, this became common, and there is no power or strength except from God. As Arabs, we cannot stop it, and no major power has stopped this fighting.
Egypt's request for an announcement of a cessation of hostilities in Gaza, after an hour of fighting stopped.
Even we, too
We should not deal with the Arab street with such naivety; our dispute with the brothers lies in one point.
This is in line with international standards.
And the lack of hospitals and doctors being detained at the borders.
You were the ones standing at the border.
And there, no one could enter.
The brothers took the matter well.
Because Gaza is adjacent to Egypt and is considered part of the national domain.
When we talk about any human issue anywhere in the world, we are talking only about a human issue.
And we respect sovereignty in Egypt.
And we know her position, but this does not harm the Egyptian position.
We expect a lot from Egypt.
It is the largest Arab country.
We believe it can carry our voices and the voices of others from the Arab world.
To all other parties
Even the subsequent rescue mission to Gaza
The Europeans tried to save him.
What happened in Gaza?
Whether it's a conference or presenting, I consider it a rescue for the government.
We were not invited to a conference, but were asked to coordinate among the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
We were gathered in the Cooperation Council.
These amounts will not be issued to any party.
But it will be issued to
The affected areas in Gaza.
Directly, and this was it.
Because entry is not allowed from any side.
I am happy for Egypt, and all the Qatari people are happy for Egypt because Egypt...
Egypt's victory in political issues is very important to us.
But you expect that.
Just a few minutes, give me two minutes.
One of the ministers boasted of what had been banished and said:
And whoever harms Egypt, we will cut off his leg and break his arm.
Frankly, I think this official has done his country a disservice.
In fact, they didn't fail; they only talked about themselves.
What helped them in this, and I said this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia, the Saudis intervened because the king has wisdom in this matter.
To summarize matters in the Arab world
Agreed.
That the king will decide that this is the best.
We accepted King Abdullah's decision because we respect and trust him.
But to say that we stopped them is an insult even to those who stopped them.
As if they were students in a school.
I believe this is it.
The maximum has been reached.
He believes he should impose his strength.
We are sorry, we are sorry about this.
If you believe that a small nation has no rights, then its rights are being infringed upon.
And you intrude and impose your noise in Darfur.
It's an Arab League resolution at the Arab League.
African decision and a United Nations resolution
I think the main issue is
Hezbollah plot plus Qatar
A plot I don't know what it is in Qatar.
If it happens most likely after the swine flu, and appears somewhere, Qatar will be the reason for the spread of this epidemic.
Qatar is a peaceful country that is aware of its size and capabilities.
But Qatar has a point of view.
Qatar has a disciplined policy.
If Qatar can resolve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor.
Because any Arab disagreement
We believe that any Arab disagreement can weaken our position vis-à-vis our core issues, namely Palestine and all the other challenges we face.
The Arab world became a recipient.
Even our analysis has become like theirs.
Western analysis
But there is one thing we know, we know what happened in Pakistan.
In a way that makes someone receive me in Washington and roll out the red carpet for me.
Does anyone blame Qatar?
Did Qatar offend any Arab country?
I tried to contribute money.
These contributions are controversial.
I could drop by to say hello, and you'd say that you're greeting me to provoke me.
This is another case, which means that you have a problem or you have a deficiency.
This case concerns you, not me.
But if you have internal problems
We always say that.
Especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah.
In Kuwait, and I know this man is honest.
A man says what is in his heart.
His heart, I always say this.
I always say this.
I always say that even in the midst of our dispute with Saudi Arabia, I always said that...
And you can refer to all the documents you have on the island but
The case is not different at all.
We said no, that's it, we stop at this point, it's one thing.
We tried our best.
I don't want to get into this topic.
To see their affairs for themselves and where their mistakes lie.
And our vision of our mistakes does not mean that everything we have is correct.
Do you mean this, Your Highness Sheikh?
to the existence of internal problems in Egypt.
And they want to get out of it.
Do you deny that Qatar contributes in any form of conspiracy against Egypt from abroad and tries to cut its relations with Turkey and any other country?
It seems we have superpowers.
They are seventy million, if we can, no, eighty million.
They also have a problem that needs to be solved.
You played a role in the Shalit case, even though you knew this file was important to the Egyptian government.
And I worked with the French.
We received a call from a friendly nation.
That there is an issue we must address, we said, "O brothers, this issue concerns the Egyptians," they said.
We want to see this case as a request.
From Israel and another state we want to see another part to see this.
When we saw this, we told them if the same conditions were met by the brothers to speak with the brothers in Egypt.
And we have declared this, I mean, is there a responsible person who can say that we, in the sense that we deceived the Arab League?
This means he is a poor man.
How did we let her get past us?
To allow President Mahmoud Abbas to stay.
And we supported this.
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is from you.
I think this is a healthy phenomenon.
I do not own the island as alleged.
And the island must enter the media competition, as there are many media outlets in the West.
There are many media entities, and during their adolescence, they curse each other.
But after a period of time, they will reach maturity.
It may be or it may not be.
First, our situation with Saudi Arabia is different.
Even if we concede to Saudi Arabia, we accept it in Qatar.
Important relationships
Egypt is an important country, but there is a special relationship with Saudi Arabia.
Also, there is a special relationship between Egypt and any other Arab country, as Egypt is the largest country.
This is true, but we have a history with Saudi Arabia and the relationship is different.
It's a personal dispute between some officials here and there.
We respect the Egyptian president.
I hope it's just a disagreement of politics and opinions.
I told you about the problem when the attack on Gaza happened.
The second problem is that they have issues with us, and so far we don't know what Qatar did to cause this.
Why don't you try to arrange a meeting between the Egyptian president and the prince now?
Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter.
And as leaked to the newspapers, they initially said it was a secret meeting, but we found out about it the next morning.
There was a meeting between me and Omar Suleiman.
In Saudi Arabia
Permanent breakup.
And I can't tell you that we agree on everything.
Let's say it so that no one interprets it as you comparing yourselves.
But dignity is dignity, whether with the young or the old.
The minister said, "If Egypt obtains the appropriate satisfaction."
Children's satisfaction with each other
I don't think so. Egypt is bigger than that. I think he didn't find the right expression.
Do you have a vision for solving problems with Egypt, or are you like the Egyptian people waiting for divine intervention?
Please, I don't want to talk about divine intervention or anything like that, because only God knows who will live and who will die.
And I pray to God.
Someone convinced him there was a way.
And our pride in Egypt
There must be a certain way.
He will either stand with me or against me.
And any pain felt by the Arab citizen
In the Arab world, we suffer with him, and this is the policy of His Highness the Amir.
States derive their strength from sources of power.
The United States has the sources of China's power and the sources of France's power and the source of power of a small country like Qatar.
Our faith in God
It is clear that
You're trying.
But we are a small country, and I took that into account.
And I will repeat it a hundred times.
So that no one can say we have any considerations.
No one will take us.
For Israel, you've been teased now.
Alright, before I go to Israel.
How can you resolve the issue with Egypt?
What's the problem now?
And every day they lodge a complaint with America, if I wanted to tell you about the major countries you were talking about.
They deal with us based on interest, and so do we.
All complaints and all of them.
To ruin the relationship.
I think any great nation that does that will affect its image.
That will also affect our Arab pride if we resort to complaining about each other.
Everything comes and we know everything.
Our solution is based on Arab interests.
And we're here for them if they need anything.
Are there any further steps to repair the relationships?
But I know there are good relations between the President and my master, the Prince.
If there's someone pulling the strings.
Opposing the documentation of relations between the two countries and their leaderships, he will find himself a loser.
No, it might be tomorrow, or it might be in ten years, to be honest, I don't know, but from our side, if one of us is invited to a conference, we'll be there.
Anyone who invites us to a conference, we will attend, and if we have a viewpoint, we will express it at the conference.
We can't.
Because Egypt is our older sister, but we have viewpoints and discuss together.
This is all that is required, and whenever the time comes we will be very happy.
Which was canceled due to this policy.
As I said, we respect the Egyptian people.
Of course you ask about the number of contracts that were cancelled, ask about the number of Egyptians who came to Qatar at the same time.
But as a state policy, as I told you, the Egyptian people in Qatar are very close to our hearts.
Now last June the 4th, you affected the feelings of the Arab states by closing the Israeli office. That was published in "Arts" on June the 4th.
Why are you saying we're deceiving them? If we wanted to deceive them, we would have locked it down twelve years ago.
When everyone was campaigning for reconciliation with Israel and before there were secret meetings between Arab states and Israel.
And after the reconciliation of most Arabs
With Israel, either under the table or on the table, or talk to it in any way.
If we wanted to stir emotions, we would have done so at the previous Islamic conference.
At the United Nations, Nasser's ally hosted a dinner in honor of Israeli Ambassador Gabriela Shalev.
He was one of the many guests who attended this banquet, and for some reason, I don't know what the ambassador was celebrating.
Because at the United Nations we sit next to Israel, and no one can deny that.
Or we find a glimmer of hope to alleviate the suffering of our Palestinian brothers.
Now the management has changed, and I had a small space to address the Egypt issue, but unfortunately
Not me, you.
My question concerns the United States and the new administration and its impact on your relationship (as Qataris) with the United States, given the presence of the largest American military base in Qatar.
There are differences in opinions.
Serious about resolving many issues in the region.
And if they are serious, we will help them as much as we can.
We expect a special relationship or a solution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these issues have been resolved.
The Emir of Qatar spoke yesterday in Paris about the ongoing events in Iran.
You have special relations with Iran despite its poor relations with the United States.
Firstly, we must put it in the context of internal affairs, because we must respect every country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said on this program that the Doha Agreement ends with the holding of elections.
Is this also your vision, or do you see the agreement as still being in place, or will you have to come to a new agreement?
The Doha agreement was for a phase that would lead them to hold peaceful elections.
A year and a half has passed since the Doha Agreement.
We were following it day by day, and minute by minute, until they reached the elections according to the Doha Agreement.
That we recently intervened in one of the constituencies to correct some misconceptions that had occurred.
But you still have connections to the arrangements in Lebanon.
We are always close to Lebanon; you know how much Qataris love Lebanon and enjoy going there.
The first country I visited after a Western country was Lebanon.
Quick question and answer about what's happening in Yemen.
You intervened in the Huthin affair, and there are accusations that you supported them.
Or it brings you face to face with the state, and now there is an even greater danger, the danger of the South.
We suffered a lot, and this indicates why we are standing here and not there in Qatar.
We did face great pressures, but this was our vision, and this was His Highness the Amir's stance.
Hot topic
And its stability affects us positively, and instability affects us negatively.
We intervened in an honest mediation between two parties.
And we signed an agreement.
But I understand if it's meant to be used for other reasons.
And to be with them, we always stood by them in all situations.
It is not based on reality.
I see no need for us.
We sell it.
I say this with an apology, because I know there is a large Arab audience that does not agree with me.
Dear viewers, thank you also for your kind attention, hoping that we have clarified some of Qatar's foreign policy to you.
In conclusion, greetings from the program team, and this is Ahmed Mansour greeting you from Without Borders.
Peace be upon him.
Dear viewers, peace be upon you, and welcome to this special meeting.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar.
Of course, why do I say a special and exceptional interview? This is because...
Qatar and this particular man were the main sponsors.
Sir, just one simple and direct question.
I think that happened because of an Arab consensus from the beginning.
And we tried that when we went to the United Nations.
The Arab consensus was important, and the Lebanese management from both sides was also important.
To achieve some results
External intervention is very important.
Too many opinions and suggestions from the outside.
Lebanese and international Arabic, if you want to put it that way.
He went through stages, but it meant something.
It means that nothing exists except that these stages existed.
Does that mean complications in Lebanon?
Since the time of truth
I mean when you gathered and directly intervened in the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file now.
Did you find out that the Lebanese complex is huge?
A Lebanese Arabic international regional needs a major decode.
Is it that they are simple but complicated due to external interference?
Because we know that Lebanon is a beacon for media, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, and a beacon for many things.
Lebanese should not allow.
To affect peace and security in Lebanon
Problem number one
Are there external repercussions in Lebanon?
Suddenly, after twenty-four hours, you decided to take everyone on one plane.
Directly from the plane to meet the Emir of Qatar.
They never expected this, and they couldn't rest for a single minute unless you showed them kindness.
The secret is to not let them rest and think too much.
And make a lot of calls.
We propose bringing them to Doha because we need an atmosphere.
Or you will gather them with many difficulties.
And often
We released them from these circumstances into conditions where they could find a solution.
If we want to succeed, we have to get them out of this mindset.
And quickly.
God created us to succeed with Venetian rhetoric or Beirut rhetoric.
And we succeeded because they agreed to go to Doha.
The parties decided to head to Doha.
Some believed that Qatar favored one side over the other.
And I'm from Beirut, though.
His Highness's policy is that if we are mediators.
In this process
Well. Frankly.
Did you consult seriously?
With the main parties concerned at least about what is happening here in Lebanon, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Syria.
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
He expressed his support for the idea.
We benefited from Prince Saud that we...
Everyone needed a solution.
His justifications are flimsy.
If we rely on logic
His justifications are flimsy.
It had to be removed due to the tension in Palestine.
There is the issue of the Iranian nuclear program.
The Arab League must have a mechanism to resolve issues.
Is the African Union better than us at solving issues?
And try to bring the parties together.
And they organize conferences to find solutions, so why can't the Arabs, with their deep-rooted connections, do the same?
Unite the Arabs or gather the parties if they exist, or intervene to support the oppressed.
Must be under study.
If we want to wake up the Arab world, not the university as an entity, but the Arab world.
The Arab League is just an instrument for implementation.
One of the officials here was Speaker Nabih Berri.
Requires a small letter "s"
Now it seems the Lebanese have agreed.
Alright, listen, we...
And above them, Qatar.
It never led to a result.
In favor of the Arabs
That will be considered an advantage for the Arabs.
We tried that.
At the United Nations when we went for the Doha Agreement.
And agendas prepared to find solutions and not for other reasons.
Undoubtedly
A more important role in the entire Arab world.
To place
Stop him based on our agreement.
For others to come and help us.
Because this is dangerous, though.
Why have we reached the point where everyone is playing in our backyard?
In our garden
It is very important to put the interests of our people first.
Now we need an Arab university after this agreement to see what we will do with our Palestinian brothers.
What are we going to do about Somalia?
What are we going to do about Somalia? Isn't it a member of the Arab League?
Sudan is not in the Arab League! Iraq is not in the Arab League! Why don't we try?
We are part of the Arab world, a small part.
I hope this isn't just a suggestion, this idea.
Qatar has good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia.
I think that first, if we are not asked to do something, we will do our best.
But I am certain that His Royal Highness King Abdullah
King of Saudi Arabia
And his brother, President Bashar
Because historically, Saudi Arabia and Syria had an agreement.
Just a phase.
And we will find, God willing.
However, with my persistence in asking, would you mind if I took a role in this part?
Even if you're not currently present in front of people, it's as if you've gained their trust.
We seek any rapprochement among Arab nations.
And this has been His Highness's policy since the beginning, but this matter...
What happened in Lebanon, does it indicate that the region is on the verge of serious changes?
Or what happened in Lebanon is an internal and Lebanese affair, and the affairs of the region are still ongoing.
Not relevant to this situation.
I wish the opposite, I wish this were true.
The beginning of a new phase in the Arab world.
We can create
It will happen somewhere else.
In other words, happily, are you afraid of the escalation that was present in a previous period?
At least until the end of George Bush's presidency.
I have no doubt that I have concerns about Palestine, especially the current situation in Gaza.
I want to ask.
We don't need anything else.
Ask me to take care of the human side in Palestine.
We can't deliver the medicine to them.
No food.
Electricity for the patient in the hospital.
What dies when the power goes out.
I wish
For the Arab Union to agree on an amount for this matter, food and medicine, we call it food and medicine.
We don't want the Red Crescent to deliver it.
Let the Red Cross deliver it.
But let me tell you, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli siege.
I don't want to go into details, I'm just saying that as Arabs, we should provide medicine and food even if we disagree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made great efforts and pledged at the Holy Kaaba.
Because this disagreement will only benefit the other party.
Not dealing with this party because we will find you a solution is not correct.
And I
So far, I have no signs of a solution.
Do you fear an American-Iranian confrontation in the coming period, or do you expect it?
Of course, this is possible.
At least I'm talking about Qatar.
Iran is an important neighboring country for us.
We may not agree with all of their policies, or they may not agree with our policies in Qatar.
For example, they tell us they don't want you to have any relations or connections with Israel.
Perhaps some consider you an integral part of it due to the presence of American bases there.
We know how to handle this.
Some said that after the visit of the Emir of Qatar to Saudi Arabia,
He might have met, consulted, or spoken with the Saudi host.
In Istanbul, there are negotiations between Syria and Israel.
And I can say it was just a coincidence.
The second issue that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was keen to find a solution for, and I was in communication with Prince Saud.
What happened in the last few hours?
Change the tactic, change negotiation tactics.
From your side or from other sides
We, as officials,
And from all sides we closed the room upon us.
And in the end, we found ourselves... then His Highness's intervention was crucial.
And from them come the works of intervention.
Without saying it now, it's over.
And his message was clear when he said, "We know our size, our place, and our role," and so on, as if he were reciting a lesson.
I wanted to take on a role without provoking any other party.
Whether it is Arab, national, or regional.
But still
They became a responsibility.
Did you want that or not?
We are trying to prevent some jealousy because we are a nation.
that these countries
Can or
I think this will be the profitable mix.
The final question is about your relationship with Washington. Is it long-term? Is it natural or exceptional?
I can say that our relationship with Washington is good.
That doesn't mean we don't have different views in cases.
But this is our right, if they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How good is it, how can you interpret it in practical terms?
If we talk about the economy, it's excellent, and if we talk about education, it's excellent.
Also true, but if we talk about politics, I can say she is good.
In your opinion, and make that clear in the next phase.
In my opinion, we set aside the confrontation with Israel.
And if we wanted to stop the play in the Arab court
And to mend the enmity between the Palestinians.
We agree on one opinion to be a formidable force.
I think we don't have.
To be effective
Thank you, dear viewers, for watching. We'll meet again, God willing. Best regards.
Welcome, dear viewers, to this dialogue with the Prime Minister and His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, the Qatari Minister of Foreign Affairs.
In this dialogue
We are trying to explore the political reality of the Arabs and their efforts.
His Excellency Sheikh, welcome!
To investigate what is happening in Gaza.
And I hope that through this dialogue we will be able to
Shed light on some of your questions.
The Israeli entry into Gaza in a brutal manner.
Our goal was to unify the Arab position.
Dealing with friendly nations
And the sisterly countries
And how do we find a clear and strong Arab stance supported by Arab countries?
And then, we find areas for reconciliation.
From our position, we know that more than one Arab country has been subjected to violations.
In an offensive manner
And no one was punished while
We are punished for everything, whether it is intentional or not.
We are the specialists.
In the world, we are the only ones who are always targeted.
Always disciplined in a way.
I think
As much as we won't be able to
Meeting at the leadership level
To halt the disciplinary campaign
We did not wish to fracture the Arab world.
There were five other verbal agreements.
By a two-thirds majority
But the purpose of the meeting is not
They wish that theirs is the correct one and that our perspective is wrong because the goal
He is solving the problem, not holding a summit.
But will it be solved at the expense of Palestinian blood?
What we requested now is that the minister not cancel Qatar's request.
And which His Highness also confirmed.
In the speech he delivered, we did not insist on it being in Qatar if it would cause any embarrassment. We do not insist on holding the summit in Qatar; it can be anywhere.
An Arab stance where others respect us.
Yes and ministerial
We want to inform them that the Security Council resolution has been issued.
and Israel
He was not involved in the decision and continued to kill and bomb in Gaza, and still does.
And I need to ask the Arab what we're going to do about this issue.
What are we going to do?
Is this when Israel ends?
To implement the remaining provisions of the Security Council resolution.
Or there will be a confrontation, because Israel has not stopped.
Shooting, we don't force our brothers.
to a decision that is considered exceeded
A few days ago
We will talk about the ministerial meeting.
You'll support this eventually.
Of course, we support holding an Arab summit, and this was our proposal. Some other countries, including Syria and Yemen, also requested the summit.
There is indeed an old Arab quarter.
Or classify us into the camp of moderation.
And the camp of immoderation.
And what do they mean by unsupervised?
That was arranged by the West.
Modified and unmodified Arabs
You will not find a moderate nation or a non-moderate nation.
And we want to know what is moderation and what is immoderation, does moderation mean following Israel's plans?
And ending the matter in a humiliating way.
Or we can just leave the case open.
I mean, this is an important question.
Are the countries?
They follow Israel's plans and want to solve problems in their ways.
I don't want to say that he follows Israeli plans, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say
If we contact the camp administration
What is moderation in the West?
Do we agree to slaughter a certain category of Palestinians?
Of course, the elections took place.
I am neither a supporter nor an opponent of Hamas, but I am speaking from a conviction that exists.
The stark truth is that there is
Idea
What some call an extreme move.
But we must ask ourselves what this radical move demands.
Is he claiming something other than his rights or is he demanding his rights?
Or will we arrange them?
Create other blocks as well.
Against because we
My inner self is Arab and my intellect is Arab.
And she started talking.
That's why we don't want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, Your Highness, briefly.
Who cancelled the Arab summit?
I can't say that it was banned, there were some attempts and the subject is somewhat known.
Prevention topic
But as I said, we could have been.
Vote and get two-thirds.
But that was not the point, because it is not the essence of the challenge so much as a matter of urgent need, that is what we believe.
While others believed it was not an urgent necessity.
We went to the Security Council.
Or there is a decision in the Security Council.
But the decision rests with the Security Council, and Israel has said it will finish and then consider the matter.
All I want to focus on again.
We will not exert efforts to implement the decision on the weaker party.
What will make it different from the first meeting?
For changes, disagreements may sometimes occur.
To the extent
Will we be ready to take a clear Arab stance?
Humanitarian aid
Support our brothers greatly.
Also to address the Israeli party and inform them
I think not everyone is ready for this, we need to make sure about this matter.
Why don't we freeze it?
Eighty-four and we were committed to the truce. Eighty-four and the Israelis were not committed.
It is natural for disagreements to arise in meetings, but in reality, these disagreements
Representing their attitudes and what is in their hearts.
One of the fights that was reported was
That some have described Hamas' movement as a distraction.
Not even a little
This situation occurred and we responded to it, and I had one brother minister with me.
And I believe that this is what the West says.
These are extremist movements, fragmentation, and other names.
And we don't want to be other people's men.
And so it always means that, and I don't mean anyone by it.
Any foreigner they found.
"Whether a Western country or Western countries, you will find..."
Among the Arabs
Well, now His Highness the Sheikh
Call for a Second Ministerial Meeting
His agenda must be one thing.
Where are you Arabs in all of this, and what is the position of the nation of three hundred and something?
One million Israelis marketed
Issued under Decision No. 66
The issued decision.
Israel has not carried them out, and will carry them out after completing the mission.
There is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort.
They should be grateful for this decision.
To demand Chapter VII because Israel is above the law, Israel.
If they are asked, they say, "We understand."
It's not the Arabs' responsibility if they are
If that's the case, Israel won't be questioned.
And he is above international law.
This is true.
Why did you go to the Security Council, and why did you link the Arab summit to what the Security Council will issue?
At the top, the Security Council will seek for us.
It requires a firm decision.
Decide that
It can lead to the loss of an official's position.
We were terrified of the West.
We work hard after they make their decision.
I don't want to stray from the topic.
Those who launched the attack to rebuild Iraq in its entirety at their own expense because they were the ones who destroyed it.
Let's not demand from the Iraqi government, and let's not demand the lives of those who have died.
No compensation.
The exact same thing happened in Sudan when they started talking about prosecuting Bashir.
Happy Ambassador
His Highness Sheikh
A major Arab diplomatic victory at the Security Council.
Listen, they faced some difficulties in the Security Council because the first speech was about a presidential statement.
Results
Israel did not comply with it.
He will comply with him in two days, and after a week, after he finishes the task.
Because they weren't assembled that way.
Sorry, but people have to assemble the [code].
Due to Israel's approval after it completed the mission.
Do you have an alternative to the decision at the moment?
All we did
Some brothers, unfortunately, with some effort.
They participated in the siege of Gaza.
I am pro-West and I don't mind any relationship we have with the West, and I am not.
Against the West, not against America.
But these people know the language of interests.
Your friends if you are strong.
Or if you have a point of view.
In the end, they'll take one percent of our viewpoint and say we won.
What is victory?
"What it contained"
I cannot say anything about precautions now because the decision has not yet been made.
The council is master of itself.
You participated in shaping
Yes, we participated in the formation to some extent.
But you weren't invited to the meeting with the Arab ministers and the US Secretary of State.
But I think the brothers who went are enough.
You pointed to Arab parties for a certain interest.
In this regard, His Highness Sheikh
For two years up until now.
Listen, I don't want to talk about accusations.
I can't pretend we were on top of everything.
If they are people.
There was Israeli rejection and international rejection, and we also contributed to this rejection.
And thus began the caliphate and the siege.
Last month, Israel killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the ceasefire.
And we let them starve until they're drained because we don't want them in power.
Those parties, His Highness the Sheikh
State the Palestinian cause clearly.
"That is, if there was"
Who created the Palestinian conflict? Perhaps there was a Palestinian conflict.
To tell someone no, you are one hundred percent right.
I'm not saying Hamas is 100% right.
I'm not claiming that, and I'm not saying that.
But, the mediator is usually in the middle, equidistant from everyone.
Not only at the average level, but as Arabs, we are also equidistant from everyone.
But with the unwillingness to have him there, so it must be ended by any means possible.
Once upon a time, soldiers were trained to march to the right and left.
And again by surrounding them and not giving them money or salaries.
And once we establish a positive model in the West Bank
So that the people of Gaza can see how people live.
Luxury living
While the opposite is the case in Gaza.
He was invited to a second ministerial meeting, an Arab ministerial meeting, but this time.
What talks are still going on about him via Turkey and Hamas?
This meeting you were invited to attend seems to want to move forward.
That would be a detour if we took another initiative.
We have no initiatives.
In this issue
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
We are asked to assume a role, and we support any Egyptian effort to reach an understanding.
But it's important.
Don't come.
Tomorrow, with a celebration, it seems that one celebration triumphed over another.
No path to harmony.
Balanced Egyptian Initiative
Between international demands, Arab demands, and humanitarian demands.
And the requirements of Egypt's role, which is an important role.
It is a leading Arab country that we all respect and appreciate.
In your opinion, is this what is required of Egypt?
The proposals now, and the current initiative, do not meet these requirements, Your Excellency.
I have a vision for the initiative.
We hear some information from here and there.
I can't comment on something I don't know.
With all due respect to the Palestinian government or leadership that should be there, we all recognize the Palestinian leadership.
But there are also people.
Who are the injured parties on the other side whose perspective we should also consider?
To accomplish these temporary tasks.
By the way, to take the viewpoint
Hamás' position was clear that this decision did not take our viewpoint into consideration, so how could it be issued?
A decision was made to involve the Arabs in its formulation without consulting or seeking the opinion of the primary concerned party.
We only, and of course, deal with the State of Palestine as a state.
We deal with authority unilaterally.
But now there is a split in one party and in another party somewhere.
This does not mean that if we deal with people from Gaza, we must stop dealing with people either at the bank or at the Palestinian presidency.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
They ask a person from Gaza to be with them.
And now we start coordinating with each other.
What was announced.
Firstly, he did not mention a mechanism for a solution, but welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiative.
And some saw it as a mechanism.
This is an explanation, but from my reading of these decisions, I understand that he welcomes the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative will succeed in achieving
He who stops the fighting.
I have no doubts about our brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the Security Council resolution.
And you consider this decision to be no longer valid because Israel did not accept it.
Even if he approves it later, things on the ground will change.
Yes, Your Highness, Sheikh, in a talk about Egyptian efforts.
In cooperation with Turkish efforts at the same time
Or an Arab excuse.
Or the intractable Arab conflicts, so it came to fill a void.
It is supposed to be filled by Arab parties.
I welcome Turkey's position.
A stance that should be appreciated by Arabs and Muslims.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
Therefore, this is a natural role.
And let people follow Him.
There is no Arabic pronoun to solve the situation.
Someone will say: Let them complete the mission.
There must be a clear Arab stance, and a decisive cutting off of all this aggression, its continuation, and its procrastination.
There should be an opposing Arab stance.
Israel can procrastinate in making a decision. I'm not talking about an Israeli-Arab war, and we are the people who always call for peace.
And we are a country that loves to live in peace.
But I am not calling for an Arab war, I am calling for
A clear Arab stance
In the context of initiatives and proposals, of course you follow what's happening.
The proposals and conditions set by the Hamas movement
Expecting?
Now as an on-the-ground observer
And the political fallout from the military operation will now allow Hamas to set its terms.
Must he be right?
We agree on this point and disagree on that point.
The second thing
I know nothing about this negotiation, as I told you they weren't there. Oh, now they're negotiating.
The second thing
Okay, at the required sites for Arabs.
This Arab reality
That we witnessed after the start of those operations.
It seems that there is a very advanced position adopted by the Arab street.
As governments
Of course, I feel sorry that some people describe the gift of peoples.
Once again, they are telling me this problem.
Representing the views of the people.
The presidents now.
That means if they want to.
At least they see what
Of course, there are high demands and modest demands.
To halt normalization and diplomatic relations with Israel.
Qatar to
The office of Israel's representative in Doha was closed.
Qatar, which holds this position.
Considering that the Arab side should be radical and take extreme positions.
Any agreement that the Arabs agree upon will be a collective agreement.
Not at all if we had an Arab agreement.
The treaty is one thing, relations are another.
We are ready.
To accompany our Arab brothers
If only there were clear Arab resolve and credibility.
They engage with others, not just states with which they have relations.
But also countries that have nothing.
It's very important.
Do not be agents for others.
He says, "Why doesn't Qatar set an example in this field?"
If this is the only model, we are ready to be in it.
But we also want
An Arab model, Qatar is committed as part of its Arab commitment.
Like
No one sells to the other.
Our problem is that trust is lacking between Arab countries.
Unfortunately, I don't want to reveal our secret. I don't want to tell the intermediaries.
That's why it's so important.
For formal invitations anywhere, because we have to get past this.
Some people called the ambassador names, others organized protests, and some, like Chávez, expelled the ambassador.
This is part of the dispute.
But some of them demanded an ambassador, and those who summoned the permanent member states, and all these are films about our people.
We talked about the modest ceiling of the people's demands.
Given the high expectations, some are calling for the opening of fronts, while others are demanding that Syria open its fronts with Israel.
Listen, I told you that we call for peace and not for fighting with Israel.
And we do not want to fight Israel.
To ignite a conflict with Israel
And how will they agree?
This is also a problem.
That which makes us speak to one another and which overcomes our differences.
What Your Highness Sheikh said caught my attention.
On condition that nations do not sell each other.
What do you mean?
I mean now.
The street won't spare us.
His Highness Sheikh
Is what's happening today the completion of a project that began during the 2006 Lebanon War?
Or there might be a disagreement.
No, I think there are differences in goals.
Lebanon liberated his homeland.
Of course, there are still some parts that are supposed to be a deposit for the United Nations.
Or something like that.
Lebanon, I mean that we have dealt with the Lebanese issue to a great extent.
Israel, of course, needs weak states around it.
To control and have the upper hand.
Of course, there are countries that support them, and they are foreign.
Therefore, he wants to remain the only power in the region.
And now they want
To change this example in Gaza
In Lebanon, how many sects are you talking about?
And how many sides does it have?
While in Palestine, there is only one side.
But I assure you once again that the problem in Palestine is that they listened too much to many Arabs and foreigners.
And from there the gap began, and everyone thought they would dominate the other part.
In your opinion, as an observer and follower
As planned, it will end in broken bones.
As Arabs, do we accept this because it might happen to those who disobey?
Or he expresses his opinion.
Whether they are Israelis or others in the future
We set a high standard.
Obedient and helpful in bone-breaking.
We have a moral saying: "Me and my brother against my cousin, me and my brother and my cousin against everyone else."
Now we are supposed to be in any dispute with Hamas, and I am not saying that Hamas or anyone else is infallible from making any mistake.
They all have mistakes.
Now we must abandon this matter.
He ran up to his knees.
Because here, failure will not be the failure of the group.
Happy Sheikh Qatar, usually I mean, in a past period, was trying to come up with proposals.
And initiatives to find solutions, and this happened in Lebanon.
That happened in Darfur, we'll talk about this in a minute, even briefly.
That we
I don't want to rely on our brothers because there are sometimes some sensitivities.
As long as there is a solution, we don't mind if that country takes all these initiatives.
Our goal now is not to put Qatar at the top of the news.
It was not in His Highness' goals.
One of his goals was how to stop the bloodshed.
And stop the dominance.
What happened surpasses imagination.
And we are in Qatar.
Do we know anything they don't? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is to have good intentions.
To reach a dignified solution
Talking about initiatives, it is useful to know what the initiative has achieved regarding the resolution of Darfur and the Justice and Equality Movement.
And the Sudanese government in Khartoum.
And it will mainly be about resolving the Darfur issue because the Darfur issue is at its inception.
Help the Arab.
But we don't exaggerate an issue we have internationalized.
Based on motives of revenge against the system, and now we want to solve the problem but we don't know how.
And we always strive, as mentioned earlier, to implement decisions, and we are the best at implementing them.
Removing the case from competition, is there also competition in the Darfur case?
I don't want to go through this.
Before we summarize the discussion, Your Highness Sheikh, there is an economic summit.
Will this conference be held, and will you attend it?
No, we will attend the summit.
We wished it would be held in a different atmosphere than the Arab atmosphere, but it was programmed.
That would be a shame.
Well, if Arab leaders attend this conference.
When Palestinian blood was shed in Gaza, they were gathered there for financial and economic reasons.
Assistance with heating
But it seems no one is afraid of this street.
You don't know the circumstances. Of course, I hope nothing happens to us, but safety first.
And to ensure safety.
But no one takes a person in their little pocket.
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, thank you very much.
Dear viewers, wherever you are, peace be upon you.
So, how meaningful is this celebration and the statements of commitment from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights?
That disabled people are the most neglected in the world.
What about our Arab region and to what extent are they concerned about this issue?
And these and other questions will be asked of our guest in today's episode.
Former Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, United Nations Conference on Disability.
He holds a Bachelor of Arts in Literature, Social Work, and Sociology from Qatar University.
Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policies from Helwan University in Egypt.
And he held a number of positions in the field of disability.
Who was a founding member and the general coordinator of the National Committee for People with Disabilities.
In nineteen eighty-nine
And has been the chairman of the National Committee for Disabled People since 1999.
Until 2003
He also contributed to the establishment of the Shufla Center for People with Disabilities.
For people with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest oversaw the launch of numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
Activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world
He also contributed to delivering lectures and participating in meetings, conferences, and forums.
Welcome Mrs. Hassa to this episode.
People with disabilities
Initially, we started using the term 'people with disabilities' perhaps in the 1980s and early 1990s.
A more educational concept when
Among those who provide them with this education.
An important document at the United Nations appeared in ninety-three.
On the term and before we delve into the details
From other regions, although there are regions that are not classified as developing countries but are classified as poor.
And Latin America, especially Latin America, in fact, this trend there is the strongest of any other region.
But the statistics proved otherwise.
The trend towards legal rights exists in the Arab world and is present in many countries.
There are likely resources, and political will as well.
Okay, let me tell you some statistics you might know about.
Eighty percent of them are from poor countries.
UNESCO says that around ninety percent of disabled children from poor countries do not go to school.
Aunt Hessa, how can you not comment on these statistics?
It's largely true.
I have seen this in Darfur, in Gaza, and in areas experiencing such events, which are wars and conflicts.
There, you can't distinguish between a disabled person and a healthy person because they are in large numbers.
In fact, children whose mothers are illiterate, for example, account for nearly three or two-and-a-half percent.
And in other countries
There are many barriers preventing these children from attending school, even without disabilities.
In fact, the city lacked infrastructure even with this child's discovery of the school.
He can't access it.
For the children and other inhabitants.
These agendas and projects are great, but we barely hear about them.
Except for our discussion about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated just a few days ago, what is the benefit of this celebration?
The situation in the world
Better than disabled people.
There are organizations that arrived and established numerous projects.
Implementing a critically important health strategy.
Through this strategy
There is an overlap between humanitarian affairs and working with marginalized groups such as people with disabilities.
Now there is a degree of awareness in the Arab world, and that's better.
At the point of awareness, we pause to receive calls and continue our conversation.
Thank you.
I have two questions I'd like to ask her, since she used to work at the United Nations.
The second point
United Nations laws calling for the fight against systems that hinder society for the child, now for example the Syrian intelligence system.
Is there a law that allows for the prosecution of the regime, as there are many in Syria?
Yes, Suleiman, your question is clear. Suleiman Kraou is from Syria. Thank you very much. We have Naif Saeed from Kuwait. Welcome, Naif.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
And peace be upon you too.
Good evening
Good evening and welcome.
If you don't mind, I am among those who suffer from mental and intellectual disabilities.
I hear Arabs say that a free man understands by gestures.
And there is a verse in the Holy Quran that says: In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Allah has blessed us with explanation, praise be to Allah who gives explanation to everything.
I sat for thirty years without speaking a word or two a day.
So praise be to Allah who made me speak.
I was referring to the Quran and found.
People attack me because I quote the Quran and consider me a hypocrite.
They attack me without knowing they are at the lowest depth.
I've only been defamed.
And he does not speak the truth.
If your house is made of glass, don't throw stones at others.
And of course, psychological disabilities.
Regarding the inquiry of Brother Suleiman, it also falls within the same definition.
UN programs or what are their reactions to the causes of disability such as political goals or otherwise.
Go to various authorities and organizations.
To discuss with them, convince them, and find out to what extent.
There are disability topics and issues on their agendas.
UNESCO, the International Labour Organization, UNICEF, and the fact that these organizations have already paid attention to disability.
It's one of the programs that try not to overlook disabled children.
With good opportunities and excellent schools.
From various environmental aspects
UNICEF as well
But there are shortcomings that we must acknowledge, there are shortcomings in the United Nations as well.
What are the main points of weakness and inefficiency that you mentioned?
United Nations
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
I was in my country, Qatar.
But there was routine and bureaucracy that hindered.
My work, especially sometimes during restrictions or shortages as well.
Struggle or attempt to fight against disabled people for recognition.
Until he reached a somewhat satisfactory point, he did not place it in a separate article as desired by the Global Movement of People with Disabilities.
But it occupied a somewhat suitable part.
Unfortunately, there is no coordination between them.
This is one of its main shortcomings.
Survey, implemented by the Special Rapporteur and applied to States.
Among the employees or individuals working on those programs
Unfortunately, we only received three responses from forty-eight organizations and agencies, and they only provided us with three responses.
Do not put.
The issue of disability is a permanent, stable, and ongoing matter for many years, although this issue is primarily a human rights issue.
In the recent period, thank God, two or three years ago.
The issue of disability has been brought to the fore at least through events such as seminars and the like.
Peace be upon you
Madam, why are there no binding laws and decisions for Arab countries, and who is responsible for activating these international systems?
Regarding Arab countries and salary allocation, for example, allocating salaries to people with disabilities.
Are there funds allocated by the United Nations?
Will this money go to governments or to UN agencies, and will this aid actually reach people with disabilities?
The final remark, if there are no binding decisions for Arab states.
Thank you very much, Ahmed Halabi from Greece.
With us is Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia, welcome to Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you
And peace be upon you too.
To adopt this proposal.
It's writing directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
To convert it to this box
Or a manufacturing plant
Allocating only one percent of the annual net profit
I return to our guest to answer callers' questions.
He said that the doctors advised him to have surgery, but
It costs a lot and he can't afford it, so where can he get help?
He is from Algeria.
I believe it is important to meet the needs of Brother Naji.
Like any other rights, the rights of persons with disabilities.
A citizen must obtain all these rights and duties.
To join the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this agreement is legal and binding.
Fulfilling the rights and needs of people at the national level.
Or even at the level of non-governmental organizations
Binding on all states and should be limited to ensuring the implementation of these laws.
At the very least, there should be awareness among the key officials.
We must do that at least if we work on these treaties in this way.
Even if there isn't a great commitment towards it.
Was there any response to your monitoring reports, and was there interest?
But don't forget customs, they are a morally binding document, in fact, not legally.
There should be a commitment and it should be institutionalized.
Recognizing that these cases will be resolved, discussed, or will be within the context of a community suffering from many problems.
Naji Zakarna, a manager and expert in sign language for the deaf at the National Center for the Deaf in Qatar, on Al Jazeera.
First and foremost, Mr. Ali would like to express his sincere gratitude to Al Jazeera Network.
Who aired this episode live now.
Now Ali is talking and saying that he is very proud.
She was a servant to all the special needs people in the place she was and still is.
We support her and stand by her always and forever.
I also say that there are many people with special needs.
Some of them are unaware of this agreement due to the lack of training sessions.
About them, especially in schools or hospitals or in public and private institutions.
It is essential to disseminate this agreement.
As a law pertaining to people with special needs in all countries of the world.
And I emphasized and insisted to these countries to
Adopt and sign this agreement.
Like the State of Qatar, some countries have signed this document with the aim of serving people with special needs and us.
"Thank you very much, Nagi, I speak on behalf of Ali."
Thank you very much.
Your opinion may influence the decision.
The former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we can start with a proposal submitted by caller Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Creating a fund to support
A donation box that accepts contributions from any state.
This means that the fund is supposed to be spent on the activities undertaken by the Special Rapporteur when engaged in
Even the Arab countries did not offer donations except for one: Syria.
Fulfilling those obligations is a problem within the United Nations, therefore
The box
The absence of commitment by member states, unfortunately, and lack of interest.
Unfortunately, many people say with utter rudeness, meaning that we don't care about the current situation.
In fact, a matter of obligations.
On human rights.
In its broad and general form
The marginalized, in particular
But that's why those covenants exist.
It is a good idea that the brother suggested, in order for these countries to abide by their commitments.
Moreover, it is essential that there not be a separate box in the sense of an independent entity, but rather existing organizations in the region.
from what is in their balance
Special projects were provided for people with disabilities in Gaza.
Assistance for people with disabilities
The issue always involves political factors.
A state or its government took care to ensure its substantial support.
Unfortunately, there is a decrease in numbers.
For nominal amounts
The father is disabled.
Of course, citizenship was revoked.
They took her lover from her.
Sometimes from
Teaching problems
Traveling or going out makes us feel confused.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
And peace be upon you too.
And we can
Rebuilding themselves with knowledge
I hope that Arab countries will allocate a portion of their budget.
Many thanks, Behjat Kawan from Kuwait.
Aisha Mohammed from Qatar, welcome.
Peace be upon you
And peace be upon you too.
Good evening to you and Sheikhah bint Khalifa.
I just want to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In recent years
With our best wishes; Parents of Special Needs Children.
In support of Sheikhah Hessa's ongoing efforts.
A noble standard-bearer from Tunisia, welcome!
There is another level, which is genetic.
I believe there is a genetic interest in reducing the rate of disability.
In our Arab customs, a cousin usually marries his cousin, and so on.
In this way and at this level, a level of disability and thanks.
Can you comment on what the viewers said?
In fact, as I said at the national level.
I know there are programs for guidance and support.
Falls within healthcare services
Which is also under the umbrella of Hamad Medical Corporation.
I believe in the psychological clinic and also in the programs available at the Supreme Council of Education.
Special Education Administration, frankly, I don't know if it still exists.
But it is certainly part of healthcare services. Yes, there is support and there are medical services.
Rehabilitation is provided for such cases.
Prevention is better than cure, and regarding the genetic factor and consanguineous marriage, are there any campaigns?
For example, to raise awareness.
In this area
Certainly, this is a very important and serious point.
And among the matters that I and others have dealt with a lot of talk and participation.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns, and they are not just directed.
It was implemented by the World Health Organization.
In addition to UNICEF
Now in many Arab countries, including Qatar
And certainly Tunisia.
There is now a binding decision for early inspection.
And it has been implemented in many countries.
All of this focuses on the preventive aspect.
And do these campaigns receive any positive response?
Especially when it comes to customs and traditions.
Of course, the difficulty lies in colliding with the collective culture.
There must be a decision, there must be strategies, there must be a will to deal with it, and there must be a commitment.
The issue of early examination, for example, because this is a very important topic before marriage.
I ask you about statistics on people with disabilities.
Especially those with special needs from the Arab region.
Arab region
Especially
With the recent events that have taken place in the region
In regions and hotspots of conflict and in wars, especially wars and conflicts and the like.
For every person killed, there are three injured.
And what happened in Lebanon, Darfur, and many other places.
Rather, this is not enough, and more importantly, there's the problem of first.
By the principles of human rights
There must be something for people with disabilities and their programs and plans.
Action plans within existing institutions in government and non-government ministries.
In circumstances such as war or unrest
To your words alone, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay.
In the world, the strangest thing said is what the International Monitoring Committee for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities stated about the population census.
To this day, people with disabilities are not included in population statistics.
They don't always advertise.
For example, in the State of Qatar when the census was conducted, I think it was more than five years ago.
Frankly
In collaboration with the Planning Council and with the
It was prepared by the Council, in fact, with our participation, like the office of the Special Rapporteur.
To add more categories for disabilities
Needs are supposed to be found.
Types of those needs and all these important details that should lead you to a conclusion.
Is there a person with a disability or not?
But at least
Statistics are somewhat forthcoming in this regard.
Peace be upon you
Madam, thank you for this program, and thank you to Sheikhah Hessa.
But I thank God that I am Qatari and receive all this attention from my country.
My daughter is now a student in independent schools and receiving a good education, praise be to God.
I would like to thank Mrs. Hessa.
Her motivational role and her role that made us not fear or worry about our children.
Praise and thanks to God, and thanks to her and those who rely on this category.
Thank you very much, Fatima Al-Dosari from Qatar, you are still with Qatar with Latifa.
Peace be upon you
And peace be upon you too.
Dear sister, reality, expectations, and what we anticipate is the solution to our children's problems.
Where is the role of our Qatari children's sheikha?
I hope you can answer this question.
Hello, peace be upon you.
I bear witness to the services provided by the State of Qatar, especially to those with hearing impairments.
We had an early detection program for hearing loss.
There is a higher council for people with special needs.
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability.
Even the mobilization of civil society, non-governmental organizations, or other communities.
Because reality and what we hope for, if you compare them over five years,
What was provided for people with special needs five years ago and now?
Many thanks to Karim Naseem from Jordan, and now we return to our guest.
Of course
The community as a whole, with its individuals and especially its families who have
Children with disabilities have great ambitions and expectations.
Whether at the planning level or the operational level
But as regards one point you mentioned, which is very important.
Children who are unable to obtain documents or otherwise, whether in Qatar or elsewhere.
The international conference resembles many international documents.
And we are committed to translating them into plans and strategies.
To automatically provide those services.
Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, gender, or sexual orientation.
Alright, Sheikhah Hessa, you previously served as a Special Rapporteur, working at the United Nations on disabilities, after six years of work.
Did you want?
Perhaps there wasn't enough time or financial aid was insufficient.
There are many achievements that have been accomplished, and I am proud of them.
Through my participation or through existing organizations and government institutions in many countries.
Especially in the Arab region
There should be more and larger studies.
We started with a global survey, and we got more than one report.
Awareness-raising is an ongoing process that must be worked on continuously and extensively.
Coordination among Arab countries
Among people with disabilities themselves, and their organizations, because they
But they have a duty they must fulfill.
They must fight for
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who shared their opinions and comments with us.
God willing, tomorrow we will meet a new guest.
Stay with us with your messages and comments in a new episode of the "Live" program. Goodbye.
Good morning
I'm very happy you're here with us.
First, before we start asking you various questions and chatting this morning.
Thank you, Shayma, you might have congratulated me.
The entire Middle East deserves this international achievement.
Qatar has firmly placed its stamp on the global football map.
Thank you, Qatar.
Also me, come on Ali!
First, I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
I express my congratulations to him and to all Qatari citizens on the hosting.
And, God willing, exactly as Sheikh Mohammed said,
It was a dream, and with God's will, it will become a reality, and work will start today or during the announcement period.
Did you expect Qatar to host the World Cup in two thousand and twenty-two?
Despite having strong files like the United States, Japan, and Australia, weren't you afraid in this field, in this particular subject?
No, look, to be honest with you, I said there was a seventy percent chance that Qatar would get it.
Very strong
He has global and competitive plans.
We were rivals.
Why do we fear?
But praise be to God, Qatar's file was really strong and deserved it.
True, the 2022 file, the World Cup and the hosting in Qatar.
So, what do you think the athletes themselves feel?
They are in the stadium, and of course they feel very happy, God willing.
I'd like to hear %pw, we were talking off-air, but we want to hear that on-air.
The moment of revelation.
Where were you, how did you receive the news, were you surprised, tell me, and tell the audience.
On the radio
Then all the people joined us.
They heard about the announcement.
How did you find the international media?
On the level of sports channels, everyone was supportive, especially the Arab channels, praise be to God, everyone supported us.
As soon as Qatar's win was announced to host,
All Arab countries have announced their full support for Qatar, through the media, human resources, and volunteers, in the future.
Arab countries are known for their generosity.
Even at the level of international media, Shaima.
I went at that time to celebrate at Souq Waqif.
Even the AFP was filming there.
We also had interviews.
Everyone cooperated, and Qatar is now mentioned daily.
Hundreds of times a day, considering it's the smallest spot on Earth.
I suppose everyone will know Qatar even online.
To host the 2022 World Cup
I mean, any footballer dreams of serving his country by being in the national team.
Of course, any player, whether in the Qatari league, wishes to represent the national team.
So, it's good to work very hard for.
To be in the league, and even when in the league, he dedicates all his efforts.
Whether in training or matches, because he wears the league's logo on his shirt, he must direct his energy.
Look, the officials have made a great effort in taking care of young players, teaching them professionalism from an early age.
Food, sleep
Tell me about your experience, you've played at several age levels, how was your experience, and what was the most important stage for you?
That was, of course
I progressed step by step through the league, from the youth team to the first team.
You know camping with the club and with the league.
So, each stage has a distinctive mark.
Yes, Lana, God willing, you were moving between
We're getting used to you as sporty Lana.
We always see you as a sportswoman. We enjoyed watching you and learning about sports from you. So, how is sports going for you?
Frankly, I don't find a difference from talk shows. In talk shows, we used to interview famous stars in their fields, and in sports, we also interview stars.
Like Ali and others in their athletic field.
On the contrary, the sports stadium is active.
Especially since we are the capital of sports.
And now Qatar has become the world capital of sport and football.
Instead of offering a variety of talk shows, social, economic, and cultural ones.
There are different fields, volleyball, basketball, different champions.
But it's still a sport.
Excellent, superb
I honestly wish that
I wish I were ten years old now, not twenty-five.
So I think the young players got a really big opportunity.
I hope they take advantage of this opportunity.
This is great, Ali. What would you like to say to the players?
God willing, the young players who will have a bright future in the coming days, God willing.
Of course, I told you it's an opportunity they should seize.
It's a golden opportunity.
So they have a great advantage from it.
Tell us, what are you doing, what new upcoming shows will you be presenting, I know we asked you to come during your vacation.
So tell us about your news, God willing.
Always keeping up with events, we are preparing for the Asian Cup which will start in January.
Just a few days ago, we finished the Gulf Cup, and on this occasion, we would like to congratulate the Kuwaiti league.
News broadcasting is also available for event coverage.
My first appearance in the media was through Qatar TV, and of course, my roots are from Qatar TV.
I am grateful for their generosity.
Convey the media message across various channels.
Whether private, sports, or other channels
So, thank you, Qatar TV.
We wish you all the best, we're still on the same subject.
First, I would like to thank the management of Al-Wakrah Club.
And his fans, I was at the Al-Wakra Club since
My childhood
The sheikh was with us yesterday, Sheikh Nasser was with us.
He's still at the club.
I'm still a son of Al Wakrah.
But, as I told you before the program started, professionalism.
What concerns every individual in Qatar.
We know that young people already love and are addicted to sports.
How to Make Sports a Social Affair
Media awareness primarily, the media plays an important role in promoting sports in various aspects of life.
I said that young people are addicted to it, and schools have also become aware of the importance of sport in school.
For example, they celebrate any sporting event.
Also in Qatar, you see signs on the streets, which reflects an awareness of sports.
Allocating seats for women in stadiums and elsewhere.
This also indicates the awareness and participation of women in the sports field.
And now we have a Qatari league for women, for football players.
Therefore, I believe that sports are evolving.
I also think that this period of time
To produce massive projects and spread awareness about sports, I believe this timeframe is sufficient.
If it is carefully considered and implemented.
Enough, and at the same time it must be used cautiously, as I said.
Also, there is the point of how the young generation utilizes the league.
Everything is available, capabilities, experiences, and equipment.
Also, there's an important matter, thank God, we are in Qatar, and as all Arab and Gulf societies know, we are renowned for our passion for sports.
How to attract this category to follow sports news and football matches in Qatar.
And attending the games at the same time
Most of the Qatari people love sports and football, but the problem is that they don't attend.
When you browse forums online, you'll find a great deal of interest, especially in the forums of most clubs.
There is great interest in the football league.
As a Qatari citizen, what do you think is the best solution to attract you to attend, aside from being an athlete and player?
What are possible ways to attract the audience to attend, for example, your friends?
It depends on the individual themselves, there is no universal concept.
Some people enjoy watching it on TV with their family.
For example, Japan, Japan has developed a wonderful plan to attract a wide audience.
When you attend matches, you collect points or something similar, so they're looking for solutions, so we hope.
and Arabic
The most important point is that every player will be here in Qatar specifically in the year two thousand and twenty-two, Lana, what do you think we need?
In addition to financial support, what do you think we really need?
Providing the means to prepare them as a national team and participate in a massive global event, the World Cup.
Time flew by with the nice people, and when the producer told me time was up, I really said, "Inshallah."
Always achieve the impossible, achieve the dream we thought was impossible, praise be to God we live it in reality.
As Sheikh Mohammed said, it was a moment of celebration, but the hard work begins now.
And God willing, the year 2022 will be an event worthy of Qatar's name.
I congratulate all those living in Qatar, and frankly, Qatar has become a global landmark.
To host 2022
Thank you, Lana, the creative presenter. I wish you all the best, and I'll always watch your shows to keep up with sports news.
Thank you, happiness indeed.
Talented Qatari Youth
They are singing a new kind of music which has become popular these days.
But in a repetitive form with music and a fast rhythm.
Also a rap group, God willing.
Stay with us, we'll start now and good morning.
We try to catch a glimpse of it.
We can simply define rap as fast music.
It's a performance of repetition, but not a quick and polished recitation of the song lyrics.
It consists of many rhymes and addresses a number of different topics and issues.
It can be personal sometimes.
Social, emotional, or political.
He is often controversial.
And he is very generous.
Rap provides performance, our viewers do not sing the lyrics.
But he keeps doing it.
He plays with his voice, considering it a secondary element.
Generally, sound is not important in rap songs.
For this reason, he is not called a singer, but a rapper.
A rapper pays attention to the following elements in songs:
For example, flow, flow of sounds, synchronization, and performance.
They have followers, an audience, and fans.
They have a distinctive style in rap.
I think they'll give you a better idea than I personally can.
Good morning, hello.
First of all, it was a time when we wanted to do something new.
To be distinguished by something.
So, we said, why don't we rap?
Rap is an art present in all countries of the world.
So, why isn't it available in Qatar?
So, we said we'd invent something new.
We gave him an idea that contained a message.
We talk about the advantages and disadvantages that occur in society.
So, we convey a message first, and secondly, it is art.
It is an art among various arts, and this is known to the viewer, addressing many social and psychological issues among youth in a radical way.
Times change, and I think this is linked to the change in time.
Previously, there was little acceptance.
We've been singing since around the year two thousand and five, and the acceptance was minimal at first.
We can say about ourselves that our new beginning was in the year two thousand and ten.
There is more acceptance and popularity.
People love singing and performing in a rap-like style these days, have you noticed that?
Yes, of course, a high percentage of people.
Also, there's something we want to talk about. You've been the founders of many musical groups.
A beautiful musical band, and I think you have concerts, can we talk about this band?
How was it founded, and what is the idea behind someone forming a music band, and how many are you in this band?
Initially, before we formed the band,
Rap came to Doha starting in 2005.
That means anyone who loves the concept of rap and can rap, can sing and upload it on the site.
I can download, Salman can download, someone can download, so there was a competition.
We met people.
So, we started competing with each other.
Later on, after a while, and after all these years, we reached the year two thousand and ten.
Before 2010, there was a group system, meaning that this group was on its own, and every three or four groups were together.
So we said, why don't we unite as one group under the name Rappers Qatar?
Or in English, a Qatari rapper.
So we agreed on this, and said under one name and we are one hand together.
And we come and present this matter and say the same idea.
About twenty-five people.
Twenty-five, amazing! Inshallah, a big group.
So, does any of you play, or, or, or do you all rap?
Coordinate and organize.
You could say it's a personal matter.
Excellent, how are these twenty-five organized? How is this number organized in the band?
Everyone has their own individual abilities and potential.
That means every member of the band can write a whole song.
Without the help of anyone else.
But capabilities can differ, for example if Salman is better than me,
He hears it and tells me the right words, nothing else.
They are likely to turn into each other.
We help each other a little bit at a time.
Or a company that adopts, so that official bodies adopt these works,
And there will be appropriate distributors.
To ensure the work is produced with elegance and sophistication, making it an official piece for you.
Frankly, we hope to be supported and to receive support from a company that came and embraced us by producing an album for us.
We don't have any problems.
Some things are a bit difficult.
So, why don't you think the first move should come from you?
To introduce the individual to the first CD.
By doing that, you can attract companies later on, what do you think?
Around 2007, I made a CD.
I distributed among my friends.
How was the order?
I think.
Average, because rap was not prevalent in the Gulf in two thousand and seven.
But not as famous as it is now.
We were talking before the broadcast, for example, there are great teams like Valencia and Castro.
Shall we talk about the subject?
They told us they would organize the party for us.
They covered all the costs, procedures, coordination, and work; frankly, we didn't expect this level.
Frankly, we were surprised and it was an amazing act.
But there was little pressure because there were no ads and there was nothing before the show.
There were no ads, or anything, two days before the show.
We assumed that no one would come due to the short notice.
When we were inside, before the party started.
That was a good point.
Which means that our voice reaches families as well, not just young people.
We thought the idea would appeal only to young people.
But at this point, we discovered that there were many age groups listening to us.
Is there a particular song that the audience likes?
The audience interacts with most of the songs.
Yes, most songs, but there were a lot of songs and we were many.
The entire group
What are words, and how do they address different problems?
We're talking about the current situation.
At least, even if it is...
Even if they spoke, from before *
It must be like this.
I mean, there's a rhyme.
We think about every word and try to find better synonyms.
Alright, you have some songs, let's listen to one of them.
One of the songs I produced.
Let's hear it and see what the public thinks.
I hope they like the words.
Thank you, Ali. I liked the introduction because it included the name of my program.
This is the KDEGMR Doha program.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This lady Bobo KG with SKT is one hot body.
Don't forget, the show airs at 9:30, everyone must watch it.
Produced by Hassan Neama, presented by Shaima'a Al-Hamdi.
The director is Nasser Al-Maliki, and the guests are Qatari rappers, of course.
Because it really contains the name of the program, thank you all!
I have to applaud you and the people in the control room.
We aired it last night.
And who wrote the words, or is it?
Everyone writes their own words.
Because if I wrote to Joseph
I don't just write these for the love of singing, the passion.
I assume you'll need to write about the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup, I suppose that if possible.
Yes, certainly, personally, we will produce a song about this topic.
But, I don't think it can be official at this stage.
So I guess there should be some national songs.
Through the art of rap
Yes, in fact, today, everyone.
We are watching the live broadcast now.
The cup has arrived, and the streets of Doha are decorated.
So, viewers, as we've seen, Doha has been adorned to celebrate the Asian Cup.
The concerned parties have made all preparations for hosting.
And there will be more crowds.
I suppose they'll march along the corniche.
I'm sure they are ready to host that important sports event.
Are there any parties coming up?
There is an offer from somewhere, and they promised they would throw us a party.
But, nevertheless, there are still some complications.
There are some procedures and issues, so we're not sure.
So, we'll try, if I meet Joseph and see him.
Some of them, I have a song topic.
If we find that it fits the song.
And the possibility of implementing that.
When I am at home.
Then send it to Joseph via email.
This part of the song is dedicated to Youssef.
There's one more thing, do you travel abroad?
In this field, those with millions of fans
Don't try to imitate, but we listen to people who are advancing in this field.
But we try to be competitive.
So why don't we take some ideas and imitate some things?
But I reverse the idea, take it and apply it in a different way in my song.
Who formed a band and has more than one album?
A person named Abdullah Dayyel
He has the experience and ability to detect groundwater.
This talent is the ability to detect underground water tanks.
A resident of the city of Marrakech
There are many experts.
Who determines the location of groundwater before drilling?
That requires or may involve drilling some wells in places where there is no water.
With the help of copper bars and pomegranate branches
Or the fig tree, through which he can locate groundwater.
What tools are used?
To discover groundwater
That was in ancient times.
But now, it has been replaced with copper bars.
So, we placed the two rods side by side.
Walk slowly.
We observe, when we walk along a watercourse.
The bars will open.
Now, we are passing a water current.
It opens this way.
When we cross it, it begins.
Now we are in the middle of a waterway.
And here, it will be the middle.
So, in this way, we can determine the path of water, or groundwater in the earth.
The process is repeated more than once in more than one location to find the site with the highest density.
Abu Ibrahim confirmed
Upon reaching an advanced stage of this career path
For his discoveries to be very accurate.
In times, out times, in Chakra, Harimla and Athithia.
More than one hundred and fifty wells have been discovered.
The percentage of errors does not exceed five percent.
It requires training, experience, and God-given talent.
Surpasses modern equipment and laboratories.
In a short time
Abdurrahman al-Marshed
Doha Morning Show
Northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
We watched this report and promise you more reports from Arab and international countries.
And the Gulf countries, God willing.
And we arrived at different addresses, but it has its meaning.
Meaningful
I assume the presence of a large group of Gulf youth in the Gulf region.
Which specific people do you follow as an example?
Follow her instead of imitating her.
There is a general connection between all Gulf rappers.
It's not a competition, it means if you produce a song.
Dealing with a specific topic.
We can call it a meaningful competition.
We have identities, but I don't trust anyone.
In Saudi Arabia, there is Qusai, God willing. He
He has fans and a CD.
Many companies want to adopt it.
Do you wish to reach this stage, perhaps surpass it and more, God willing.
We wish you all the best through this team.
There, at the cup reception, let's watch clips of Cornwall.
In addition to a group of Qatari youth
That even if it's borrowed from the West, it's in the Gulf style.
There are also rap songs about love and a distinguished band of twenty-five people.
It's important to stay in touch with you to know how you're doing.
So, I assume you have an email address or a website or a forum.
How can people communicate with you?
We had our own website.
But there were some issues with the hosting company.
It would sometimes close for unclear reasons.
So, we faced many problems and eventually closed it.
No use, the site will definitely close.
So, what do we do? What are the alternatives to solve this problem?
United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and even Morocco and Egypt.
You should communicate with them to find out the latest news and the songs that are produced from time to time.
So, what's the alternative now?
We currently rely on special pages like
By what name?
Okay, when you search for our name on Google.
Qatari rapper or Qatar rapper
You can create your own video clip.
As for the program, I worked on it yesterday.
We've uploaded many videos to YouTube.
Songs with Pictures
A song and itself, with pictures.
I think we need to see you improve more.
You need a place for all of you to meet instead of having equipment at each of your homes.
Blender, piano, computer, and guitar
Frankly, I hope we find support.
For example, a company.
CD production
And allocated us a special place.
We work alone.
In the end, we still work alone.
We don't want that.
It's no different from Youssef's speech.
We need a video clip.
And album
Video clips accelerate the spread of the song.
Transmits ideas faster.
If there is support, everything else will eventually fall into place.
And your beautiful voice fills the air.
It's a type of art that deals with various issues and problems.
Thank you, Youssef Al-Naemi and Salman Al-Abdullah, for attending.
Let's see it and wish them all the best on behalf of our show, folks.
These projects were, yes.
There is also a semi-ready project, but it needs some technical development.
Expiration Date
When you go to the cashier, have the total and all the details ready.
It identifies goods, rather than reading the components of each commodity.
While walking with the cart
It's attached to the cart, so one can choose the material they want.
Most projects are a reflection of children's feelings towards an issue.
He has many activities and goals.
The center offers a range of programs and activities that focus on one central idea.
We have ten objectives set by Her Highness Moza at the establishment of the center.
It might also be, yes.
Which takes him directly to the subway from his home.
But he thought it was for clothes.
All stores in Qatar that sell shirts will appear.
It can also be with the car key, press the button.
He identifies the items I've lost and takes me to the key.
Yes, let's return to the projects that the center will work on.
Early childhood education
Skills development and talent acquisition
So, it varies depending on the different skills of the children, the media, and research skills.
Personal skills, such as public speaking and persuading audiences.
Skills vary, and we've developed a special program to cater to them.
We started with Future Media, and we achieved great success in this project, reaching the end and graduating the project.
We also got numbers for children and young speakers.
And their creativity...
Do you have junior broadcasters?
Regarding television, it's important for them to provide programs for children.
We're getting them ready for TV.
Through their television, Qatar TV
We support them until they reach the age of eighteen.
We welcome them wherever they are.
This is also the national television channel.
We need to attract, identify, and develop these talents.
Whether it's media or research.
Intellectual dimensions
Reading and various other fields
Is there collaboration? Do you exchange ideas?
In all fields, such as the Promising Preachers Program supported by the Ministry of Awqaf.
Our exhibition, the Generation Exhibition, is also...
The scientific club played an important role in improving projects as well as in technical support.
The main role was played by the Supreme Council of Education, through supporting schools and partners.
Mr. Abdullah, moving to a place like Katara,
which also includes a variety of activities and clubs.
Do you consider that a push towards more success?
In addition to moving to a separate building
Regardless of the vast expanse
And it's easy to deal with the public.
She is a pioneer and an excellent entrepreneur.
And receiving the guest and introducing him to the programs offered to the child.
It's our main project for the next three years.
National Development Project for Reading
Under the patronage of Sheikhessa Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
She adopted this project and supports it.
It's a big project, developing reading, writing stories, and enhancing children's skills.
Various cultural skills related specifically to reading.
Since there are certainly different programs.
We've recently moved.
And we're rearranging some activities.
Its design and improvement to suit Katara visitors.
We wish you success through this center.
It contains very important ideas.
First, I'd like to thank you for hosting.
The most important thing is that, whenever we deal with children, we discover that
Today's childhood is different from ours.
They need more care, focus, and time.
Listen to his interests and imagination.
Connect with him mentally.
They... treat their children like a hotel, providing them with accommodation.
Or like a bank, provides money.
Children really need someone to listen to those ideas and imagination.
In the past few days, they have transferred us to 2030.
At this exhibition
I wish success to the winning projects.
Thank you for your presence, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaily, Director of the Children's Culture Center. We wish you success.
To make these projects a reality and not just a dream forever.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Cultural Center for Children's evening event, which was launched yesterday at the Diplomatic Club.
Closing ceremony of the National Dreams Exhibition for Future Generations under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation.. Realities or the Nation of Tomorrow"
Organized on the occasion of Qatar National Day, with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar.
There were many activities and numerous competitions at the exhibition.
Children's Creative Projects
We would like to welcome Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Children's Culture Center, good morning and welcome.
Good morning, my dear sister.
First, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to meet with us.
To talk about this exhibition, it's truly unique.
We are pleased to have you with us here in the program to cover as much of the exhibition's activities as possible.
This is the National Exhibition of the Dreams of a Generation.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, this is the exhibition.
With the contribution of the Shafallah Center for Children
Celebrating the National Day
Who had *
In an attempt to calm the children
To live with a dream.
With the project
This project or dream
Children's imagination is very vast.
So we stuck to twenty and thirty.
And other key areas of Qatar's Vision 2030.
We started training children in four stages.
Then, considering the brainstorming mechanism and tools that expand the scope of thinking.
What do you mean exactly by this phrase?
Facts or the nation of tomorrow?
Which means, anything the child dreams of today.
It will grow as the project grows.
In fact, that was the true interpretation of the vision, that the children would live from that day forward.
I dream big.
Whether environmental, health, human development, or any other field
He who serves the state.
I think when we know there are children somewhere
Or at a specific exhibition
All that was available through
The exhibition also featured guest of honor.
Because children learn from them, as good role models.
Yesterday, a couple of days ago, there was the...
There were also winners of various awards in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a schedule for presenting their projects.
Yes, and the pictures are the best evidence of what you say.
This is a collection of photos from the exhibition and various activities.
And here too is the owner of the last project, the forest.
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
It's a really great idea, we can simplify it for the viewers, and this is one of the children's innovations.
What exactly is this topic, the colored ball, let's talk about it.
Suddenly, there are four or five projects dealing with this subject, one of which is the colored ball.
The smart stadium was also named.
As soon as the ball went out of bounds.
Colors vary.
I suppose that in the future, this will help a lot in matches.
What next, after all these dreams?
And to be connected to matters related to his field of interest.
I assume specifically when there are officials who take these small projects into consideration from those with small minds.
But we never know, maybe these projects will serve us. What does the football federation president say?
Think about the idea of a colored ball.
Does he like it?
To a large extent, he visited projects related to football.
Support us and approve these projects as soon as you see them.
And these projects are also built.
Our children did that, and people also voted on many projects.
Okay, what were the projects that were on the ground and people voted for more than others?
There is an evaluation committee that has a way to evaluate projects.
The first, second, and third projects that won the awards.
The forest, won the first prize.
He was very precise in the details of the projects, and the project was ready for implementation.
Of course, it requires many administrative elements.
There were very detailed descriptions in the brochure distributed to visitors.
Certainly these are the images we see now.
These are some big projects.
Maybe they don't try to do what they see in movies and cartoons.
Indeed, part of it is adopted by institutions.
For example, let's name the projects, what are these projects?
Collect, use, and recycle it.
From two hundred and forty-seven students
Qatar University celebrated yesterday the graduation of two hundred and forty-seven students from the thirty-third batch.
And His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, Minister of State for International Cooperation.
A large number of parents and faculty members
And the university is celebrating today the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen students.
We would like to thank our colleague Salman the Renewer, and we will remain in the same artistic atmosphere. We will have a very dear guest today.
From the family of serial dramas, the actor Abdel Hamid Sharshani.
shows himself through numerous works such as "Hearts for Rent",
They worked hard to prove themselves in the art scene.
Especially since the field of art doesn't know flattery.
Which means
Thank you and good morning. I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
No, I'm a fan of the cast of the show and
We'll watch a very short clip from one of your works, and then we'll start talking to you.
Are you mocking me?
Take the fake bisht and bring the original one.
Go to hell.
You have the cloak, you return it.
What? Give me the cloak, return it! How do I return it?
It's already been ground up by the goat in its stomach, damn it!
I am a member of a five-member committee.
On the conference's steering committee.
I won't agree for you.
I don't mind.
So this is a quick glimpse, a very short clip from the series of classifications that we'll be watching part two of.
We would like to ask about your participation this year in Part Two.
Can you tell us about your segments where the "Taxonomy" series varies on a different topic every episode?
What is your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
Of course, afterwards.
I passed by a mart at that time.
Marat is also famous for the mountain.
Kamiat, celebrated by poets throughout the ages.
When history is a witness and remains in the memory of cities,
And it shows how deep his history is.
It is 170 kilometers north of the capital, Riyadh.
Some believe that its name is derived from the name of Imru' al-Qais al-Tamimi.
It is distinguished by its archaeological sites, the sweetness of its water, and the purity of its air.
He inspired poets and awed them. He was renowned for his famous mountain, Kumayt.
They call it Wadi Kmit.
Of course, Marrat City is an ancient city.
It was founded before Islam.
There were some ancient things with an unknown history, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
What we are in now.
The great companion Khalid ibn al-Walid (may Allah be pleased with him) ordered the digging of this well when he passed through during the Ridda Wars.
Still remaining until now.
The proverb says: "Wrap me in a shroud, and I'll guarantee you many times over."
If you see Comait, you can see Mars.
Among other sites, Wadi Qumayt.
Sweet are the times that flow through the years.
That was enough for the city for a whole year.
From the beginning of the rainy season until the start of the next rainy season.
The date of the establishment of these ruins is unknown.
There is also the bride, and there.
Mount Komit is one of the landmarks of the city of Marrat.
There were many proverbs based on this mountain, as well as poems and verses.
Many people come to her from different parts of the kingdom.
One of its most important monuments is the Al-Waleedi Well.
That is because he stayed in Murta during the Ridda Wars and was on his way to Yamama.
He set up camp there and ordered the men to dig this well.
What people still drink from its water and bathe in it?
Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned in Mu'jam al-Bulan that Khalid passed through Marrat.
It's an old house made of mud, restored to its original state.
It consists of various sections reflecting the region's architecture, heritage, and antiquities.
The poet once said of it: "When we met water, free water."
We found the Khor Kumayt, not the Khor of the Gospels.
Mr. Ayman, there is, God willing, cooperation between the family, guardians, the center, and the child.
I believe there are different ways he can be with you at the same time.
Generally to run the training process.
Since everything that comes to us, whether it be an apprentice, a student, or a child,
This record contains his full personal information.
Even his monthly grades, for example, are evaluated every month.
We were responsible for the Minds program.
In every four sessions, there is a report.
Guardian through a password and username,
We gave it to him, can he access it?
Yes, he can see the level he has reached, since he joined the center until now.
Yes, we have different models to see.
We have a daughter.
With Mr. Ibrahim, who will join us later,
We'll see different models, I wish we had enough space.
However, we brought a model of a girl.
You will undergo various tests before going live.
We will ask her math questions and varied questions.
We'll have a short break and then we'll be back with you to meet this clever girl, stay tuned.
The actor's performance, the audience has become very smart now.
If he grasps any work from the first, second, or third ring, and if he feels uninterested in the work, he will use the remote control.
He won't bother, he has twenty thousand other chains.
Correct, the Twenty Thousand series, that's right.
Episode 20,000. There are people who don't do that, he focuses on one job.
He can see other works.
This is true, this is the majority.
He claims that I only watch TV during Ramadan.
Of course, we welcome you among us, a very dear and generous guest, Abdel Hamid Charsheni.
Would you like to say something to the audience, or to your fans who adore you? Of course, I'm one of your fans.
Would you like to say something?
And I tell them, "May God grant you health and well-being every year."
It's true that we don't go out much, we don't show ourselves much, and we don't move around frequently for the reason you've already mentioned.
Better things are coming.
Insha'Allah, we wish you all the best in your endeavors this year.
Insha'Allah we will have another interview with you, so we can talk about those plays.
Everything leads to the other.
Because fashion shows are very popular among many people and are eagerly awaited by fashion enthusiasts.
Welcome, dear viewers, to our program Sabah Al-Doha. We are live with you now.
Of course, today we are talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of students who joined this center.
This center offers a variety of different sciences.
Of course, they focus on developing other potentials.
And also to run their minds at full capacity.
Mrs. Naseema and Mr. Ayman Kholgeli, CEO of the Skills Development Center.
Hello and good morning.
Welcome!
We have with us the beautiful Amanya, good morning Amanya.
Good morning.
How old are you, dear?
I am in the seventh grade.
God willing, we wish you all the best.
What is available to our sons and daughters?
This matter was clarified with Mr. Ayman and Ms. Nesma, and it was specifically directed towards the benefit of the children, our children.
Which program is for mental math?
Through fingers and abacus.
To achieve certain specific goals, we tried to showcase a small part of it.
Did you notice, Mr. Ibrahim, a real difference in the student during his first two days?
And after he finishes in three or four months?
If taught in public, private, or even independent schools,
Basically, the program works scientifically on specific methods.
After completing the first level of the program,
Which presentation shows the lost potential or the need for further development?
And has he reached a certain level or what are the updates that have occurred to the child?
So, we work on a scientific method, a scientific program.
Not all methods and mechanisms are applied in a conventional manner.
But in a scientific and systematic way.
Before the start of the program and after taking this course or the levels he has passed.
Mr. Ibrahim is with us now, as our dear viewers can see. Amani is one of the students who joined this center.
We wanted to do this live today to show our viewers the importance of these matters.
If you come back in the bisht, I don't mind.
So, this is a very quick paragraph and a very small part of a series of classifications that you will see part two of.
But as we have seen, this part of the series is a classification of the first part.
Can you tell us a bit about your roles in the series "Tasaneef," where each episode has a different theme?
This year, focus on the fact that you will...
Javel Favor
Who encourages by providing opportunities
Sixteen episodes in two seasons.
He will be a director in an episode, and in an episode he will be an old man, and in an episode he will be a baker.
So, it's a collection of rings.
Mr. Ghanem Al-Sulaiti is from Qatar.
We have representatives from Qatar.
So many actors that I can't remember them all right now. Of course, we have actresses from Bahrain such as Zahra Arafat, Ibtesam Abdullah.
We have
Faisal Rashid and Mohamed Adel.
Of course, Tara.
Without Tara, the young actors won't perform their roles.
We now have a few jobs in Qatar. There are two jobs per year.
Qatar TV also produces dramatic works, can we say that too?
Qatar Television provides an executive producer.
Qatar TV did its best, but with only one production a year, all Qatari actors want to work.
And that was the reason.
I've replied to you. It's just one series, and all Qatari actors want to work on it.
So, if someone finds a scene, they should thank God.
Praise be to God for everything.
So, let's go back to your beginnings.
Of course, I'd like to thank him very much.
I consult him on various matters.
Of course, the actor Abdulaziz Jasim is from the series "Hukm Al Afaal", from after the scattering until yes or no.
In his plays, we started working with him in theater when he became the first executive producer. Abdulaziz Jassim, we worked with him in television and theater.
So, he adopted us, taught us, and made us.
Then Mr. Ghaniem presented his life story, doing his best, in Fayez El-Toush 2000.
Because it gives us opportunities as youth.
They have thirty to thirty-two performances a year.
We have two vacations a year, so thank you, thank you, Tara.
The deadly feeling is also produced by Tara Arts.
The director of the series is Mr. Munir.
We're back, dear viewers, and today we'll be discussing Reflexology.
The message is in the palm, the palm of the hand.
This treatment has been practiced since ancient times.
We have a guest with us.
The examination method is as follows.
It's swollen, the degree of pain.
You can feel something inside the hand like sand or fragmented veins within the hand.
Loosen your grip.
Our brother Sabhi is tense.
You feel stressed and have a bit of tension, tension.
Left side.
And now, dear viewers, we are examining the left side of his body.
So they know what we're doing.
Any health problem would be evident, we now know about his headaches and dizziness.
Is there any pain here?
Pain means problem.
Problem! What does "problem" mean in this context?
In this case, the sinuses and the ear.
He's shivering. Do you have a sinus problem or any previous issue?
I had an operation, but that was a long time ago.
Is it fleshy or something else?
He gains weight without eating.
Okay, your left shoulder.
This is due to nerves, when I told him he was nervous.
Ten years ago, he was walking barefoot on the beach.
We know that when someone walks on the beach, I think they're emptying themselves.
Any land that is not level is not just the sea.
Negative energy may %PW.
And you may be surprised that you discovered these things through massage.
Of course, children are the most important.
Oh children, glory be to God. This one is for mother, focus with me!
What bothers him is the milk and the food he eats.
With her child by her side, she will place it and it will automatically close.
Close your hand.
Just a little pressure, thank God.
You'll find it in a few seconds and the baby will be happy. First, he'll suffer from the pain due to the ache here.
Later, you'll see the gases suddenly escape.
What discoveries have you made, Mr. Abdulaziz?
But to a lesser degree than other problems, people now suffer from arthritis, bones, headaches, thyroid, and obesity.
The second thing for menstrual pain or period pain in general.
You should focus on a rock or stones, by pressing here, you command, praise be to God, the relief of the lower back and menstrual problems. If you suffer from pain,
In seconds, God willing, it will disappear.
Pregnant woman
Delivery became easier for her.
Either here or there, God knows best.
If they tell her that she can give birth in the seventh month or you can give birth in the ninth month.
Except on sand.
If you walk on sand, no problem, but if you walk on rocks, no.
You should eat seven soft dates for breakfast, the soft date is better.
If she doesn't have fresh dates, dried dates will do.
As Allah the Almighty said, I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan, my discovery is from the Quran.
That means God was unable to bring her this soft date, no, He was not helpless.
Praise be to Allah, and I seek refuge in His words from the evil of His creation.
You must bring a stone or small balls.
Delivery bed. For example, if you forget and come to the wrong delivery bed, she grabs the handles.
You will notice in private hospitals, a lady from East Asia will come.
So, this is a practice in East Asia.
No need, you already have my phone.
Only the mobile!
To cooperate with each other, I advise everyone who is listening to me now.
Make charity a habit, and also care for others. You were created to worship God and...
To serve people, that's the first thing. Second, I'm not a religious man or a sheikh, I'm an ordinary man.
I would like to thank you, Mr. Abdulaziz, for this wonderful interview, and also thank our dear guest.
Thank you for coming, and I wish you all the best.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of Public Health at the Supreme Council of Health, will speak about it in more detail.
Good morning, Sheikh.
Let's start by taking a look at these activities.
Healthy Steps Program towards Qatar
Is the program part of the national strategy for the treatment and control of obesity?
Around four of the world's top countries in terms of obesity are in the Gulf states.
We launched a strategy at the Supreme Council of Health, of course in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and other authorities, to combat obesity.
Afraid of its increasing and imminent spread.
Among the programs aimed at protecting against obesity is the Healthy Steps to Qatar program.
We can participate in this competition together, making it an international one.
The program consists of six weeks.
Every week is different from the next.
To raise awareness among seventh and eighth-grade students about the importance of health at this age.
Because this is the first age at which they become self-aware.
In the first week, as you remember, the question was about what your favorite fruit is.
The second week is walking.
You have to walk! Every time you walk, he gets points.
It's a map of Qatar, and every time someone gets points, they walk and their school moves forward and their classroom evolves.
Thus, a beautiful competition is created among the students.
In the second week, he drinks water, and we don't want him to drink soda.
We tell him to drink water, there's no need to drink fizzy tea every time you feel thirsty, just drink water!
Later, in the fourth week, your favorite sport.
There are some games at school that some people don't like.
We are looking for a sport that he loves.
To force him to exercise.
The child is eating a healthy meal.
And her family knows that they should allow their child to eat a healthy meal.
And Al Jazeera Academy, an academy for boys and girls, so we can accommodate them.
Of course, this is just a model, and with its success - God willing - we will expand the experiment in the coming years.
The students are happy and feel more energetic.
We need more games, we had so much fun with our colleagues.
The girls say their skin has improved and acne has decreased.
Exactly, exactly, and that becomes consciousness.
The parents know about their children.
And their classmates from different grades, asking them "How are you?" and learning from their peers.
Praise be to God, news is spreading that many schools are eager to participate next year.
Inshallah.
Qtel Company was the official sponsor supporting this.
We had the Aspire Zone which provided sports competitions and awareness.
On, on, on, on the dining table.
So, praise be to God for the multitude of directions; I mentioned some and forgot others.
But praise be to God, everyone participated in part.
And the other, the brothers were doing it in the form of separate lessons, or curricula, or
There was variety.
We tried to do different kinds and involve as many people as possible.
They are the next generation.
To share this experience and disseminate it as widely as possible in Qatar.
When assessing, there are things that need to be fixed.
After its widespread use and satisfactory results,
Insha'Allah, we will spread because there are people asking by telling us why we weren't present.
Eat, eat healthy food and you will get there, you don't have a problem.
When we are at this age, and when it starts from a young age, he will reach what he wants by his twenties or mid-twenties.
The minister mentioned a series of titles, and each group had a title.
If we return, we will try in our segment today to talk about the conclusion of the events.
And when we mentioned people again, we had more than one guest in our program.
Let's repeat, what is the information for each week that we want to provide to the student?
Well, first of all, of course, the first week is your favorite fruit.
Each lesson was about fruits and their benefits.
What are the benefits of fruits containing vitamin C?
So, he started to like some fruits, not all fruits are his enemies.
He might be allergic to one or two, but why not eat the rest?
The second week is walking, and people think that walking is only for the elderly, but why would young people walk?
So when I grow up, I'll walk.
On the contrary, you walk because it relaxes your mind and brain.
It relieves the individual, which means that mental clarity improves.
You took the students on excursions.
Yes, they were all required to walk, whether at home or at school.
They record their points through the class teacher.
What they used to walk in every day.
That was an event, and there were people who held a parade, and the girls' school held a parade.
We want them to like this, being creative with unique ideas.
The spirit of competition and teachers should think outside the box; we don't want to give them ideas they should stick to.
Everyone has their skill in this matter.
Of course, the third week is about drinking water. We constantly try to get them to drink water so they don't feel thirsty and want to drink soda.
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite sport.
If we could find out his favorite sport and support him in it,
He will take care of sports.
Their love for sports is evident through their practice, he engages in sports unconsciously.
We said earlier that we would talk about the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Society.
I'm pleased to welcome our guest for today's episode, who is joining us in the studio.
Thank you.
We are happy to have you here at this exhibition.
And part of this disease that some of us may not have heard of.
Initially, as the Egyptians say, we will go straight to the point.
It's a chronic disease.
Those that affect the nervous system in a person's body.
The period ranges from twenty to forty years.
This disease remains untreatable, and the cause of infection is unknown.
It affects the active segment of society, which is usually the youth.
Treatments used for cancer patients, may God protect you from all harm and other diseases.
This disease is an infection of the brain, nerves, and spinal cord nerves.
What is the central nervous system in the human body?
The body assumes the entry of a foreign body into the body.
A neuron is
Cover this wire.
White cells, or white blood cells, start to kill or dissolve this insulating layer.
Which led to the neural signal not arriving, or being weakened, or interrupted.
Leads to paralysis, may God protect you.
With advancements in medicine, there is still no cure for this disease.
Well, regardless of the solution, we want to know how to get there.
Also, a person should have protection from this matter.
The main reason for that, is quality of life, food nature, or life cycle?
Or what is the exact direct cause that leads a person to suffer from this disease.
All we have now are theories.
Even through marriage.
They are trying to solve the health problems that humans suffer from.
Yes, yes.
All these topics may be controversial in some way within society.
So far, we know the reasons.
Well, the age group that may be affected by this disease, multiple sclerosis.
Of both sexes.
Of course, after forty years the disease starts to ease up on the person.
So far, we have not been able to find a cure for this disease.
Is this evidence of a large number of people in the Gulf, or the Arab world, or to speak about Qatar?
In Saudi Arabia, statistics indicate twenty-five thousand cases.
Also Qatar.
Recently, and specifically last week, three to four cases were reported and diagnosed.
Currently, we have one hundred and twenty-five patients, and this is recorded in the files.
And many people, when diagnosed with this disease, seek treatment in other countries.
Well, Mr. Abdulaziz, are there any effects like someone getting this disease?
Are there any signs that indicate to the patient's family or the patient themselves that they may have multiple sclerosis?
And this virus, for example, is deadly.
We must be clear about this, it's not a virus.
Due to the nervous disease, the nerves control the entire body.
In providing a specific reason for a particular location, the nature of the food, or the lifestyle.
