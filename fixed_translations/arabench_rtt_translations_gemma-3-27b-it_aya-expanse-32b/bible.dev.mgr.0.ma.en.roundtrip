Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram. Joram was the father of Uzziah.
Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jehoiachin and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were taken captive to Babylon.
After this, the family line continued. Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zechariah was the father of Abiud. Abiud was the father of Eliakim. Eliakim was the father of Azor.
Azor was the father of Zadok, and Zadok was the father of Akhim, and Akhim was the father of Eliud.
Eliezer was the father of Eleazar, and Eleazar was the father of Matthan, and Matthan was the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. And there were fourteen generations from David until the carrying away into Babylon. And there were fourteen generations from that time until Christ. The birth of Jesus Christ.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Yusuf, was a good man. He did not want to disgrace her in public. So, he intended to divorce her secretly.
But while he was thinking about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
All this is happening to bring about what the Lord said would come to pass. He had said through the prophet,
The virgin is pregnant and will give birth to a son. He will be called Immanuel, which means "God with us." (Isaiah 7:14)
Joseph awoke from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.
The Visit of the Wise Men to Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened during the time when Herod was king of Judea. After the birth of Jesus, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.
They said, "Where is the child who has been born to be the king of the Jews? When we were in the east, we saw his star. Now we have come to worship him."
King Herod was very disturbed when he heard this, and all Jerusalem with him.
Then Herod summoned the magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared. He sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.”
"In Bethlehem in Judah," they answered. "That is what the prophet wrote. He said,"
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times."
Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
He sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and make a careful search for the child. As soon as you find him, bring me word so that I, too, may go and worship him."
After the wise men heard the king's words, they departed. The star they had seen in the east was ahead of them. And finally, it stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were very happy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their home country by another route. Jesus' family flees to Egypt.
When the wise Moroccans left, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph arose and went to Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained until the death of King Herod, to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called my son." (Hosea 11:1)
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. He was furious and issued orders regarding Bethlehem and its surroundings. All boys under the age of two must be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
By this, the word spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled. He had said,
A voice is heard in Ramah, a voice of weeping and deep sorrow. Rachel weeps for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are gone. (Jeremiah 31:15) The return of Jesus' family to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead."
And Joseph arose and took the child and his mother Mary to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he went to the district of Galilee instead.
He lived in a town called Nazareth. And so was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent, even if your sins are numerous! Paradise is near."
John was the one who proclaimed about the prophet Jesus as he spoke of him. He said, "A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight his paths.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothing was made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
The people went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from the region around the Jordan.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan.
John saw a large crowd of Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.
Don't you dare say, "Abraham is our father." I tell you, God could raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
The axe lies at the roots of the trees déjà. Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down. They will throw them into the fire.
I baptize you with water, calling on you to repent of your sins. But after me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He holds a pitchfork in his hands to clean the chaff from his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn. But he will burn the husks with a fire that cannot be quenched." The Baptism of Jesus
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.
But John tried to stop him. He said to Jesus, "It is I who need to be baptized by you. Why are you coming to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this. It fulfills the righteous plan of God." And John agreed.
"And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him. And he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him."
A voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
Jesus is tempted.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, where he was tempted by the devil.
After 40 days and 40 nights of fasting, Jesus felt hungry.
The devil came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
One day, Satan took Jesus to the holy city of Jerusalem. He made him stand on the highest point of the temple.
"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you to guard you. They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'" (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered and said to him, "It is written, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
"Jesus took him up to a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory."
"If you bow down and worship me," he said, "I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and ministered to him. Jesus began to preach.
John had been put in prison. When Jesus heard this, he withdrew to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth. He went to live in the town of Capernaum by the Sea of Galilee, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
In that way, what the prophet Isaiah said came true. He had said,
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the Gentiles live! Land on the Mediterranean Sea! Land east of the Jordan River!
The people who are living in darkness now will see a great light. These people are living in a land that is very dark. But a light will come and shine upon them.
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. He saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting their nets into the lake, for they were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," Jesus said. "I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
From there, he saw other sons. They were James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, when Jesus called them.
Now Simon and those who were with him followed Jesus after they had left the boat and their father. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus walked through all the cities and villages of Galilee. There He taught in their synagogues, proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God, and healed every disease and every infirmity among the people.
A rumor about him spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from severe pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were violently convulsing. Others could not move at all. And Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, from the region called the Ten Towns, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan.
Isa grants blessings.
Jesus saw the multitudes. So he went up on a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said,
Blessed are those who have need in their religion. Where is the sky coming from for them?
Bless me for those who are causing trouble. They will regret it.
"People who are full of themselves will be brought down to earth."
Bless me, they've come back hungry and thirsty for something good. They'll surely be satisfied.
Blessed are those who love mercy. Mercy will be granted to them.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who suffer to do what is right. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Blessings upon you when people mock you and hurt you because of me. Blessings upon you even when they say all kinds of evil lies about you because of me.
Be happy and joyful. Your reward in heaven is great. Similarly, people opposed the prophets who lived before. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
"Nettia, the light of the world. A city built on a hill that cannot be hidden."
It's better for people to bring a lamp and place it on a plate. Put it in its proper place. So it can light up the whole house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the full meaning of the law.
I did not come to change what is in the law of Moses or in the words of the prophets. I did not come to do this. Rather, I came to give the full meaning of what is written.
What I'm going to tell you is right. Heaven and earth will pass away before one jot or one tittle of the law passes away. Not the smallest letter, not a single stroke of the pen, will pass away from the law until all is accomplished.
Do not break even one of the smallest commandments. And do not teach people to break them. If you do, you will be called the least important in the kingdom of heaven. But those who obey these commandments and teach them to people will be called important in the kingdom of heaven.
This is what I tell you: You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will surely not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder.
You shall not kill. (Exodus 20:13) Whoever kills will be accountable for it.
But this is what I tell you: Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother is subject to judgment. And whoever says to his brother, 'Raka,' must be brought before the council. But whoever says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of hellfire.
Suppose you are presenting your offering at the altar and you remember that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift there in front of the altar. First, go and be reconciled with your brother; then come back and present your gift.
One person has a complaint against you and wants to take you to court. Settle with them quickly. Do it before you both escalate. If you don't, they might take you to the judge. The judge might hand you over to the officer. And they might throw you in jail.
What I'm going to tell you is right. You're not getting out until you pay the last penny! Liar.
You have heard what was said, "You shall not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But I tell you, anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
If your right hand is the one that leads you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is only one part of your body. It is better to lose it than to have your whole body go to hell. Divorce.
It was said, "When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a written notice of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But that is not what we say to you. Whoever divorces his wife makes her an adulteress, and whoever marries the divorced woman commits adultery. A man is not to divorce his wife except for marital unfaithfulness. Faithfulness.
Once again, you have heard what was said to your people long ago. They were told, "Do not break the covenants you have made with the Lord. Keep the promises you have made to him."
But that's not what I'm saying. Don't make promises like that in the first place. Don't make promises in the name of heaven. That is God's throne.
Don't build on them in the name of the earth. That's the garbage dump of the feet of God. Don't build on them in the name of Jerusalem. That's the city of the great king.
And do not swear by your heads. You cannot make a single hair white or black.
Keep your "yes" a simple "yes," and your "no" a simple "no." Anything beyond that comes from the evil one. Be kind to people.
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this is what I am saying to you. Do not fight against an evil person. "If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to him."
If someone sues you in court to take your shirt, let him take your coat also.
If someone goes a mile for you, walk two miles with them.
Give to anyone who asks you for something. Do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow something from you. Love your enemies.
You have heard what was said, "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18) Hate your enemy.
But this is what I tell you: Love your enemies. Bless those who curse you.
"And you will be sons of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."
If you love those who love you, will you be rewarded? Even a tax collector does that.
If you only greet your people, what have you added over others? Even those without religion do it.
Be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
Giving to the needy
Beware of doing good deeds in front of people. Do not do them to be seen by others. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
"When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by people. I tell you the truth, they have already received their reward. But when you give, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you."
When you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
So your charity should be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer.
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by people. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
Whenever you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father, who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what you do in secret.
When you pray, do not babble like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others.
You're not like them. Your father knows what you need before you ask.
"Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom will come. You will have whatever you desire, just as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Save us from falling into sin when we are tested. Deliver us from the evil of Satan.
Forgive people when they wrong you. If you do that, your Father in heaven will forgive you as well.
But if you do not forgive people their sins, neither will your Father forgive you your sins. Fasting.
When you walk without eating, you don't appear as dark as those who pretend to be pious. They make their faces look very sad. They want to show people they are fasting. What I'm telling you is true. They've taken their full reward.
But when you want to walk without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
"The people won't know that you're fasting. Only your father, who doesn't see it, will know. And if he gives you the reward. Your father sees what you do in secret. Gather wealth in heaven."
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Pure, they have gathered wealth for you in heaven. There, worms and rust do not destroy. There, thieves do not enter or steal.
Where your heart is, there your treasure will be also.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
But what if your eyes are not good? Your whole body will be filled with darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not worry.
We tell you, don't worry. Don't worry about your life, what you're going to eat, and what you're going to drink. And don't worry about your body and what you're going to wear. Isn't there anything more important than these things in life? Isn't there anything more important for the body than medicine?
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
And why do you worry about your clothing? Consider how the wildflowers grow. They don't work or spin.
But this I say to you: not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these flowers.
If that's how God dresses the grass of the field, won't He dress you even better? Besides, the grass is here only today. Tomorrow it will be thrown into the fire. Your faith is far too small!
Just don't worry about it. Don't say, "What are we going to eat?" or "What are we going to drink?" or "What are we going to do?"
People without religion run after all this. Your Father in heaven knows you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Don't worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when you judge people.
Don't judge people. So they won't judge you.
You will be judged as you judge others. You will be measured as you measure others.
I see a speck of dust in your friend's eye, but you don't notice the log in your own eye.
How can you tell your friend, "Let me get that speck of dust out of your eye," when you've got a piece of wood in your own eye?
You hypocrite! First, remove the log from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone sows what they reap. Whoever wants to turn, just turns. And whoever knocks on the door, it just opens for them.
"Imagine your child asked for bread. Who among you would give him a stone?"
No one would ask for a fish, right? Who among you would give him a live one?
Even when you were evil, you knew how to give good gifts to your children. Do your children in heaven not give good gifts to those who ask them?
In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you. This is what is written in the Torah and the prophets. The golden rule.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to death and hell. Many people go by this road.
But the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and only a few find it. Many are called, but few are chosen.
Beware of hypocrites. They come to you pretending to be sheep. But inside, they are hungry wolves.
To know who they really are, see what they do. "Do people pluck grapes from thorns? Do they gather figs from thistles?"
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can know a tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many people will say to me on that day: "Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many miracles in your name?"
I'll tell them plainly, "I don't know you at all. Stay away from me, you who do evil!" The wise and foolish builders.
"Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
The rain is falling. The water is rising. The winds are howling and crashing against this house. And yet, it stands. Built upon the rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
The rain is falling. The water is rising. The wind is howling and crashing against this house. And it's making a loud noise.
Jesus said all this. The people were amazed at his teaching.
He taught with authority, not like their scribes.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
One man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down, and said, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do this." "Be clean!" Immediately the man was cleansed of his leprosy.
Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone. Just go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." A Roman officer believed.
When Jesus came down to Capernaum, a Roman centurion met him and asked him to help him.
"Sir," he said, "my servant is confined to the house and cannot move his head. He is in great pain."
Jesus said, "I will make him well."
The leader replied, "My Lord, I am not worthy to receive Your visit to my house. Just speak the word, and my servant will be healed."
Personally, I am a man in authority. I have soldiers who obey me with their voices. I tell this one, "Go," and he goes. I tell that one, "Come," and he comes. I tell my servants, "Do this," and they do it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who followed him, "I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith."
Many from the east and west will come to the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
But those who think they are from the kingdom will go outside, into the darkness. They will weep and gnash their teeth.
And Jesus said to the centurion, "Go your way; let it be done for you as you have believed." And his servant was healed in that very hour. Jesus heals many people.
When Jesus came to the house of Peter, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus wiped her hand, and her thirst was gone. She got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
Let it be done to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah said. He said, "He bore the punishment that made us whole. He carried the diseases that should have been ours." (Isaiah 53:4) Following Jesus causes harm.
Jesus saw the people around him. He wanted to give instructions to his disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
And a scholar walked up to him. He said to him, "Teacher, we will go with you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
One of the followers said to him, "Sir, allow me to go look for my father and bury him."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus went in a boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a fierce storm came upon the lake. The waves were crashing against the boat. But Jesus was asleep.
His disciples came to him and woke him up. They said, "Master! Save us! We are perishing!"
He answered them, "Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?" And Jesus woke up and rebuked the wind and the waves, and they ceased, and there was a great calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "Who is this man? Even the winds and waves obey him!" Jesus heals two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gadarenes. Two men possessed by demons met him. They came out of the tombs. The men were so violent that no one could pass by.
"God's son, what do you want from us?" they shouted. "Have you come to punish us before the day of reckoning?"
Not far away, a large group of pigs were eating.
The demons' request to Jesus: "If you cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Come out!" And the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and drowned in the water.
The people who had been possessed by the demons fled. They entered the city and spread the news. They told the people what had happened to the men who had been controlled by the demons.
And afterward all the people of the city came to Jesus. When they saw Him, they asked Him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
Jesus got into a boat, crossed to the other side of the lake, and arrived at his destination.
A man came to Jesus, unable to walk. He was lying on a mat. Jesus saw that they had faith. He said to him, "Do not be afraid, my child. Your sins are forgiven."
Along with this, some of the scholars said to themselves: "This man wants to say something very serious!"
Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Which is easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Go and sin no more"?
"Do you want to know that the son of Adam has authority on earth to forgive sins?" Then he spoke to the man who could not walk, saying, "Rise, take up your bed and go to your house."
The man stood up and walked home.
When the people saw this, they were amazed. They praised God, who had given people such a gift. Jesus called Matthew.
As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth. He said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
Afterward Jesus went to dine at the house of Matthew. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
When Jesus heard this, he said, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick."
You will go and learn what it means, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to follow me." They asked Jesus about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came to Jesus and said, "We and the Pharisees fast often; why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus answered, "Can the wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
People don't sew a piece of new fabric onto old clothes. The new piece will wear out faster than the old one. It will also make the tear bigger.
People don't pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wineskins will burst. The wine will be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins. That way, both are preserved.
And as our Lord Jesus was speaking, an important man arrived. He bowed down before our Lord Jesus and said to him, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, so that she may live again."
Jesus stood up and went with them. And his disciples went with him.
At that time, a woman came up behind Jesus. She had a bleeding disorder that had lasted for twelve years. She touched the edge of his garment.
She was saying to herself: "I just wanted to touch his clothes. Then I'll go away healthy."
Jesus gave her sight and saw her. He said to her, "Lady, do not lose hope." He told her, "Your faith has healed you." The woman was healed at that very moment.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players and the crowd wailing.
He said, "Say it's far. The girl is not dead. She's going to tell you." But they laughed at him.
And immediately the man was cured and took up his mat and walked.
The news about what our Lord Jesus did spread throughout the whole region. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, shouting, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
As soon as Jesus entered the house, the blind men gathered around him. They asked him, "Are you able to do this?" He answered them, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes. He said, "May it be as you believe."
They were able to see again. Jesus sternly warned them: "Make sure no one knows about this."
But they went out and started spreading the news. They talked about him all over that area.
And as they were going, they brought to him a man who was mute and possessed by a demon.
As soon as the demon was driven out, the man began to speak. The people were very amazed. They said, "We have never seen anything like this in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." Few are the workers.
Jesus went through all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the good news of the kingdom. And he healed every disease and every infirmity.
When he saw the people in large numbers, he felt a heavy burden for them. They were beaten and neglected, like sheep without a shepherd.
And Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is great, but the workers are few."
Nafi asked the Lord of the Harvest to send laborers to work in his field.
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out demons and to heal every disease and every sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve disciples. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then comes James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
Then there are Philip and Bartholomew, also Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. Two others are James son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus.
The last two are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas will later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus gave these twelve orders to them, saying, "Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans."
On the contrary, go to the Children of Israel. They are like lost sheep.
Whatever you do, say this: "The king of heaven is near."
Healed the sick. Raised the dead. Cleansed those with skin diseases. Cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.
Don't bring gold, silver, or copper in your belt.
Don't take a bag with you on the trip. Don't take extra clothes, sandals, or a walking stick. The worker must be given what he needs.
Whenever you enter a city or a village, look for someone who wants to welcome you. Stay with this person until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet those who live there.
If this house welcomes you, bless it with peace. If it doesn't, don't bless it.
Some people won't receive you well or listen to your talk. If they do nothing, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or town.
"What I'm going to tell you is true. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for this city."
I want to send you into the midst of wolves like sheep. Be as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves.
Warning! The men will deliver you to the local courts. They will whip you in their Jewish synagogues.
You will come before the judges and kings because of me. You will testify against them and against those who are not Jews.
But when they catch you, don't worry about what to say or how to say it. At that moment, you will be given the right words to say.
You will not be the one who wants to speak. Your father's spirit will speak through you.
Brothers handing over their brothers to be killed. Fathers handing over their sons. Sons rising up against their fathers and killing them.
They will all hate you because of me, but whoever endures to the end will be saved.
When the people of this world attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am telling you now is right. You will not complete your journey through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.
The student is not better than his teacher. The slave is not better than his master.
It's enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it's enough for the slave to be like his master. If they call the head of the house "Beelzebub", what do those who live in it expect?
"Be not afraid of your enemy. Everything hidden will come to light. Everything buried will be opened."
What is whispered to you in the dark, proclaim in the daylight. What is shouted in your ear, shout from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Why are six sparrows sold for the price of one? And why does one of them fall to the ground without your knowledge?
To the extent that he counts every hair on your head!
Nafi', don't be afraid. You are worth much more than many birds.
What do you want from someone who claims in front of people that he knows me? I would even say in front of my parents in heaven that I know him.
But what about someone who says in front of people that they don't know me? I'll say in front of my parents in heaven that I don't know them.
I don't think I came to bring peace on Earth. I didn't come to bring peace. I came to bring the sword.
I'll come tomorrow to turn "SONS against their FATHERS. DAUGHTERS will refuse to obey their MOTHERS. BRIDES will be against their MOTHER-IN-LAWS.
"A man's enemy is his own household." (Micah 7:6)
Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me doesn't deserve me. And anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me doesn't deserve me.
"Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
If anyone finds his life, he will lose it. And if anyone loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
One who receives a prophet as a prophet will be rewarded as a prophet. And one who receives a righteous person as a righteous person will be rewarded as a righteous person.
"If someone gave a glass of cold water to a little child who was following me, I would tell you that it is indeed a good deed. That person will surely receive a reward."
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus taught his twelve disciples, and then went to teach and preach in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They said to Jesus, "Are you the one who is supposed to come, or should we look for another?"
Jesus answered, "Go back to your brother and tell him what you have heard and seen."
The blind see. The lame walk. Those with skin diseases are cleansed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised to life. And the good news is proclaimed to the poor.
"Praise be to Allah who did not let me lose hope, even though I have been away from it for a long time because of me."
"What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
"What did you expect to see? Someone dressed in fine clothes? No. Those who dress in fine clothes are in the palaces of kings."
And then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Ah, I tell you, even more than a prophet.
That's what is written in the Holy Book. It says: "Behold, I send My messenger before You to prepare Your way." (Malachi 3:1)
"What I'm going to tell you is right. No one is greater than John the Baptist, but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
From the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been taken by force, and those who use force are seizing it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you are willing to accept it, John is the Elijah who was to come.
He who has ears, let him hear.
How can we describe the people of today? They act like little children sitting in the markets and begging people. They say,
"We played the trumpet for you, but you didn't dance. We sang a song of consolation for you, but you didn't grieve."
As soon as John arrived, he neither ate nor drank as he usually does. And people were saying, "He's possessed."
But when the son of man came, he ate and drank like you. And people say, "This man always eats and drinks too much. He is the friend of tax collectors and 'sinners.' "Those who act wisely prove that wisdom is right. No city rejects a sinner.
Jesus began to rebuke the cities in which most of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent of their sins. Therefore he said,
"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
And as for you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
But I say to you, on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for the people of Sodom than for you. "Rest for all who are weary."
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yeah, Dad. That's what you wanted.
"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Only God knows His son. And those who know God are His sons, whom He chooses to make known to Him."
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Be my servants and learn from me. I am meek and humble of heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
My service is easy, and my burden is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
One Sabbath Jesus was going through grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain, rub them in their hands, and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this and said to him, "Look! It is unlawful to do this on the Sabbath. Yet your disciples are doing it anyway!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him?"
Pure income for the house of God. He and his men ate the holy bread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it.
Haven't you read the law? It says that every Sabbath, the priests in the temple must serve on this day. But they are not considered criminals.
"This is the only way to learn a language here."
The Bible says, "I desired mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You don't know what these words mean. Even if you did, you wouldn't go and accuse those who have done nothing.
"Man was born to be the lord of the Sabbath."
From that place, Jesus entered their synagogue.
There was a man with a withered and distorted hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
One man is worth more than a flock of sheep! That is why this law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
And Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out. It was restored, just like the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Jesus, how they might kill him. Abdullah Al-Mukhtar.
Jesus was aware of all the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many people followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But warn them not to say who he is.
This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: "He took our infirmities and bore our diseases."
Here is my servant. I have chosen him. He is the one I love. I am very pleased with him. I will put my spirit upon him. He will proclaim to the nations that everything will be restored.
He won't argue or shout. You won't hear his voice in the streets.
It's not going to break a crooked branch. It's not going to extinguish a weak flame. It's going to fix everything.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
One man possessed by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was mute and could not speak. Jesus healed him, and afterwards the man could speak and see.
Everyone was amazed. They said, "Is this the son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons only by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking, and so he said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil drives out the devil, he is fighting against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by whose power do your people cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Don't even think about this. How can you enter a strong man's house and take what he has like that? You need to tie him up first. After that, you can steal his stuff.
He who walks with me is my enemy. And he who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them.
This is what I tell you: Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking out against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come."
If a tree is healthy, its fruit is healthy. And if a tree is corrupt, its fruit is corrupt. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
O den of vipers! How can you, who know the wicked things you do, say anything good? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
A beautiful person says beautiful words. Those come from the beauty hidden inside them. An evil person says evil words. Those come from the evil hidden inside them.
But that's what I've been telling you. On the Day of Judgment, people will be accountable for every idle word they've spoken.
"By your words, you will be condemned or acquitted." Yunus the Miracle.
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said to him, "Teacher, we want to see a miracle from you."
Answer, "The evil and treacherous people want a sign! But they will not be given any sign except the sign of Prophet Jonah."
Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. Something similar will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the tomb.
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation, and will condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when a jinn comes out of a person? It wanders through the wastelands seeking a place to rest, but finds none.
And then he said, 'I'm going back to the house I left.' When he gets there, he finds the house empty. The house was clean and well-organized.
And afterward, the unclean spirit returns with seven other spirits more wicked than itself. They enter and dwell there, and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So will it be also with this wicked generation." - Jesus' mother and brothers
While Jesus was still speaking to the people, his mother and brother stood outside, wanting to speak with him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are waiting outside. They want to talk to you."
Jesus answered, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus looked at his disciples and said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!"
"Everyone will do what they want, my brother, my sister, or my mother."
The Farmer's Tale
On the same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. So he got into a boat. He sat in it. Everyone stood on the shore.
Then he told them many stories. He said, "A farmer went out to sow his seed."
The farmer sowed the seeds in the ground. Some fell on the path. The birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky ground, with not much soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
As soon as the sun rose, it scorched the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
They sowed many seeds among the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plants.
And some seeds fell on good soil, and produced a hundredfold, or sixtyfold, or thirtyfold what was sown.
He who has ears, let him hear.
His disciples came to him. Solo: "Why do you tell stories to people?"
"You have been given the opportunity to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. It has not been given to outsiders."
Those who have this kind of knowledge will be given a raise. In fact, they will have a lot. And those who don't have this kind of knowledge, even those who have a little, will have it taken away from them.
This is why we use stories when we talk to people. I say, "They see, but they don't really see. They hear, but they don't hear well or understand."
There the words of the prophet Isaiah are fulfilled: "You will indeed hear, but you will not understand; you will indeed see, but you will not know what you are seeing."
"The hearts of these people have become callous. They cannot hear with their ears, they have closed their eyes; otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn back to me, and I would heal them." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see. And blessed are your ears, for they hear.
I'll tell you what's true. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they didn't. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they didn't.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear about that kingdom, but they don't know what it is. Then comes the devil and steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed that fell on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. These are the ones who hear the word and receive it with joy at first.
But they have no roots. Therefore they do not last long, and when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, they immediately fall away.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the message, but then the worries of life and the deceitful promises of wealth choke it. They prevent it from bearing fruit.
"Some others received the seed that fell on the good soil. These are the ones who hear the word and understand it. They produce a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown." - The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowds another story. "This is what the kingdom of heaven is like," he said. "A man planted good seed in his field."
While everyone was asleep, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The owner of the house, Jawa, was asked, "Sir, didn't you sow good seeds in your field? Where did these weeds come from?"
He said, "This is the work of an enemy." He asked his servants, "Do you want to go and fetch the grass?"
"No," answered the farmer. "When you pull up the weeds, you might pull up the wheat with them."
Let them grow together until the time of harvest. Then I will tell the workers how much they should do. This is what I will say to them: "First, gather the stalks. Tie them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn." "Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Leaven"
Jesus told the crowd another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A person took the seed and planted it in a field."
Here is the smallest of all your seeds. But when it grows, it becomes the largest plant in the garden. It turns into a tree. And the birds come to rest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast," he said. "A woman mixed it into a large amount of flour. The yeast worked through all the dough."
Jesus spoke all these things to the people in parables. He did not say anything to them without using a parable.
So, the words spoken by the prophet were fulfilled. He said, "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter hidden things, things kept since the creation of the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the parable of the weeds.
After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, he went into the house. And his disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
"He who sows the good seed is the son of good people."
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the Kingdom of God. The weeds represent the people who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the day of reckoning. And the workers are angels.
Herbs are plucked and burned in the fire. That's how it will be on Judgment Day.
The people were going to send their angels. They were going to search their kingdom and bring out everything that causes sin. They were also going to bring out everyone who does evil.
They're going to throw them into the burning oven. There, people will devour them and gnash their teeth.
And they are the children of God, shining like the sun in their Father's kingdom. He who has ears, let him hear. Stories of hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When one man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.
"The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls."
He had one very expensive meeting. He went and sold everything he had. And he bought this pearl. The net's story.
Lots, the sky is like a net. They cast it into the sea, and it gathered two kinds of fish.
Once they were full, the fishermen dragged them to the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish in baskets. But they threw away the dying fish.
This is how it will be on the Day of Judgment. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
They will throw the evil people into the burning oven. They will cry and await their fate.
"Did you understand all this?" Jesus asked. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure both new and old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus said all these things, and then he left from there.
He came to the city of Nazareth, where he had grown up. He began to teach in their synagogue. They were amazed and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers? Is this
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary? Aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Are all his sisters with us? Where did this man get all this from?
He was not received at all. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, and among his own relatives and in his own home."
A lot of miracles happened there, so they wouldn't lose faith.
John the Baptist's head is severed.
At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod had arrested John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, who was the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John was telling Herod, "You cannot take her; it is against the law."
Herod the tetrarch had John the Baptist killed. But he was afraid of the people, because they believed John was a prophet.
At Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced before Herod and his guests. Herod liked it very much.
He promised her with a sworn right hand to give her everything she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. The girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. However, he thought about his promise and his guests who would be dining with him. He finally said one of his men should give her what she wanted.
Herod had ordered John's beheading in prison.
They put his cheese on a large plate and gave it to the girl. Then she took it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went to help Jesus. Jesus fed five thousand people.
When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he wanted to be alone. So he got into a boat and went to a secluded place. The people heard about it and followed him on foot from the villages.
When Jesus saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. He healed the sick.
Until late in the afternoon, the pupils came. They told him, "There is nothing here." "As it began to get dark, he sent the people, 'Go and buy food in the villages.'"
Jesus answered, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
"We have five loaves of bread and two fish," they answered.
"Bring them here to me," he said.
Then Jesus made the people sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves into pieces and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of the fragments.
The number of men was about 5,000. Women and children were also there. Jesus walked on water.
Jesus saw the disciples straining at the oars, for the wind was against them. Early in the morning he came walking to them, but he did not go near them; he called out to them, "Men of Galilee," and they recognized him.
After he had sent them away, he went up on a mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
The boat was too far from the shore. The waves kept crashing against it, as the wind was blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus went out to meet the disciples. He walked on the water.
They saw him walking on the lake and got very scared. They said, "That's a dead man!" and screamed in fear.
"O servants of God, be brave! I am he. Do not be afraid."
"God, are you?" Peter asked. "If it is you, command me to come to you on the water."
"Come," said Jesus. So Peter got out of the boat. He walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and began to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!"
Jesus reached out his hand and touched him. "Your faith is great," he said. "Do not doubt, just believe."
As soon as they got into the boat, the wind died down.
And those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and landed in Gensar.
The men who had lived there knew Jesus. They sent a message to every nearby place, and people brought all their sick to Jesus.
They pleaded with him to allow those who were sick to touch the hem of his garment, and everyone who touched it was healed.
What makes people "unclean"?
Some Pharisees and some teachers of the Law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked him,
And why don't your students obey what the old men teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered, "Why do you not follow the command of God? But you follow the teachings of men!"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said, "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
But permit people to say to them, "Any help you have received from us is a good gift specially from God."
It's not right for them to disrespect their parents with their gifts. You're making God's words void to follow your own teachings.
You hypocrites! Isaiah was right about you when he prophesied,
"These people honor me with what they call me. But their hearts are far from me."
"Their worship means nothing to me. They teach only man-made rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus gathered the people to him and said, "Listen and understand."
It's not what goes into your mouth that makes you "unclean"; it's what comes out of your mouth that does that.
And afterward, the disciples came. Solo: "Did you know that the Pharisees were angry when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots."
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain it to us."
Don't you understand yet? asked Jesus.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth ends up in the stomach. And then it exits the body.
But the words that come out of the mouth reflect the heart. That's what makes you "impure."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. Also theft, bearing false witness, and lying about others.
These are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands does not bring "uncleanliness." "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus departed from Galilee and came to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman who lived near Tyre and Sidon came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon. She suffers greatly."
Jesus said not a word. His disciples came to him. They pleaded with him, saying, "Send her away; she keeps crying after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel."
And then the woman prayed on her knees before him. "Oh God! Help me!" she said.
Respond, "You shouldn't take other people's bread and give it to their dogs."
"Yes, sir," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
And Jesus answered and said, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus feeds four thousand.
Jesus went from there. He went along the Sea of Galilee. Then He went up a mountain and sat down.
Large groups of people came to him. They brought the blind and those who could not walk. They even brought the disabled, those who could not speak, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. The disabled were healed. Those who could not walk were walking. The blind were seeing. And so the people praised the God of Israel.
After Jesus called his disciples to him, he said, "I have compassion on these people; they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
The disciples answered him, "There is nothing here but five loaves and two fish." They said, "How far shall we go and buy sufficient bread for so many people?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," he answered, "and a few small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit on the ground.
God took seven loaves and fish and gave thanks. Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples. And the disciples distributed them to the people.
They all ate until they were satisfied, and the disciples gathered seven baskets of the remaining fragments.
The number of men they killed was 4,000. They also killed women and children.
After Jesus had sent the crowds away, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus asks for a sign or miracle.
The Pharisees and Sadducees tried to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
Answer, "In the evening, you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'"
In the morning you say, "There's going to be a storm today. The sky is red and cloudy." You know what you're seeing in the sky. But you can't make sense of the signs of what's happening now.
A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. And leaving them, he went away. The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The pupils crossed another arm of the sea. They forgot to take bread with them.
"Be careful," Jesus told them. "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The disciples discussed this among themselves. They said, "He's saying this only because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were discussing, and he said, "You of little faith! Why are you discussing among yourselves that you have no bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces you collected?
Don't you remember the seven loaves for the four thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces you collected?
Can't you understand? I wasn't talking about bread. But be careful of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
And then the disciples understood that Jesus was not warning them about the leaven of bread, but about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter says that Jesus is the Messiah.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples: "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
"Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I say to you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.
I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you shut on earth will be shut in heaven, and whatever you open on earth will be opened in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus speaks about his imminent death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples what was going to happen to him. He said to them, "He must go to Jerusalem, and there he will suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes. He must be killed, and on the third day be raised againwhenw
Take Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. He said, "No, Lord!", "This shall never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns."
Then Jesus spoke to his disciples, saying to them, "If anyone wants to follow after Me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me."
If he wants to preserve his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for me, he will find it.
What's the point of one person gaining the whole world and losing their soul? Or can someone exchange their soul for something else?
The son of man will come in the glory of his Father, with his angels, and then he will render to each according to his works.
I'll tell you what's right. Some of the people who are always here won't die before they see the children of others coming to their kingdom.
The form of Jesus was changed.
After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John, and brought them up to a high mountain by themselves. No one else was with them.
Until they stood before him, he changed. His face was lost like the sun. His clothes became white like light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three booths: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
As Peter was speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. I am very proud of him. Listen to him!"
When the students heard this, they were very afraid. They fell face down to the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said, "Arise. Do not be afraid."
When they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. On the way, Jesus told them what to do. He said, "Don't tell anyone what you saw." "Wait until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
His pupils asked: "Why do the Sharia teachers say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus answered, "Yes, it is true. Elijah is yet to come and restore all things."
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
And so the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy possessed by a demon.
As the people drew near to Jesus, a man ran up to him, fell on his knees before him, and called out, "Master, have pity on my son."
"Oh my Lord," he said, "have mercy on my son. He shakes his head a lot and suffers greatly. He always falls into the fire or into the water."
I brought him to one of your students. But they couldn't let him go.
"You hypocrites and evil doers!" Jesus answered. "How long must I stay with you? How long must I bear with you? Bring the boy to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He healed him at that very moment.
And after a time the disciples of Jesus asked him, "Why could we not cast out this demon?"
Respond, "But you don't have much certainty. What I'm telling you is true. If you have certainty the size of a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
"Please"
Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "Whoever wants to be first must be last of all and servant of all."
They will kill him. On the third day he will rise from the dead. And when they saw this, they felt great sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum. When they were in the house, the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and asked, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, what are you doing," he replied. When Peter came to the house, Jesus began to speak. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Where do the kings of the earth get their revenue? From their own children or from others?"
"From others," Peter answered. "Then, the sons don't have to pay," Jesus told him.
But we don't want to upset them. Fine, go to the lake and throw your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. You'll find exactly the nurse we need inside. Take it and give it to them as a tribute for my sake and yours.
