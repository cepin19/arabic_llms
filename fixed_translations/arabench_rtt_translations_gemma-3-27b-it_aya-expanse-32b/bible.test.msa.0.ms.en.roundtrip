Jesus called a little child to him and set the child among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me.
Woe to anyone who causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin! It would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
Round about the world, how terrible it will be because of the things that drive people to sin! Such things must happen. But how terrible it will be for those who cause them!
If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it from you. For it is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or one foot, than to be thrown into eternal fire with two hands or two feet.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The parable of the lost sheep.
"Take care that you do not despise one of these little ones; for, I tell you, in heaven their angels continually see the face of my Father in heaven."
(nothing)
What do you think? Suppose a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray. Won't he leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that is lost?
What I am about to tell you is the truth. If he finds that one sheep, he will rejoice more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not wander off.
Even so your Father who is in heaven does not want any of these little ones to be lost. When someone sins against you
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother back.
But what if he does not listen to you? Take one or two others along with you. The Bible says: "By the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Let him be to you as a pagan and a tax collector.
What I am determined to say is true. What is closed on earth will be closed in heaven. And what is opened on earth will be opened in heaven.
Again, I tell you, if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask, my Father in heaven will do it for you.
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them." A relentless servant.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. He called them to him and began to question them about what they owed him.
When the king began to do that, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought to him.
The man was unable to pay. So his master gave an order. The man, his wife, and children, and all that he had, were to be sold to pay off his debt.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll pay it all back."
The lady felt sorry for him. She forgave his debt and let him go.
But this servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He seized him and began to choke him, saying, "Pay what you owe!"
The other servant knelt on his knees. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I will pay you."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay back his debt.
The other servants saw what happened. They were greatly disturbed. They went and told their master everything that had happened.
Then the master called the first servant. He said, "You wicked servant! I forgave you all that you owed me because you pleaded with me."
Shouldn't you have shown mercy to the other servant as you were shown mercy?
In anger, his lord handed him over to the jailers. He will be punished until he has paid back all he owes.
So will My Father in heaven treat each one of you, unless you forgive your brother from your heart.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that the Creator made them from the beginning male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and they become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two, but one. Therefore, a person should not separate what God has joined together.
They asked, "Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning."
This is what I told you. Any man who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man is not permitted to divorce his wife unless she has been unfaithful.
The disciples said to him, "If such is the case between a man and his wife, it is better not to marry."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of celibacy. Only those who have been given the ability to live without marriage can accept it."
"Not all men can beget children, for some are born so. Others have been made so by others. And others have made themselves so in order to serve the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this way of living, let him do so." They brought little children to him.
Some people brought little children to Jesus, wanting him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked them.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he went from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man approached Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to inherit eternal life?"
"Why do you ask Me about what is good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good except One, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."
"Which one?" the man asked. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
"Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"I have obeyed all those commandments," said the young man. "What more shall I do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all you have and give to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sorrowful. For he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven."
I tell you again: It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished. They asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered and said to him, "Behold, we have left all and followed you; therefore what shall we have?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, and all who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
"Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life."
But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He agreed to give them the usual daily wage. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
Around nine o'clock in the morning, he went out again. He saw others standing in the market square doing nothing.
He said to them, "Go, you also, into my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right."
So they went. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock and did the same thing."
Around five o'clock he went out and found others standing around them. He asked them, "Why are you standing here all day doing nothing?"
They answered, "Because no one has hired us." He said to them, "Go you also into the vineyard, and you shall receive whatever is right."
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to the man in charge of the workers, "Call the workers and give them their pay. Start with the last ones hired, and then go to the first."
The hired workers arrived around five o'clock. Each of them received their regular day's pay.
So when those who were hired first came, they thought they would receive more. But each of them also received the usual daily wage.
When they took it over, they started complaining about the owner.
They said, "Those people who were just hired only worked for one hour." "You paid them the same as you paid us. We did most of the work and were under the scorching sun all day."
The employer answered one of them. He said, "My friend, I am dealing with you fairly. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and leave. I want to give the people I hired last the same wage I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel betrayed because I donated generously to others?
"So the last will be first, and the first will be last." Jesus also speaks of his upcoming death.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
He said, "We are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death."
"Then they will hand him over to people who are not Jews. They will mock him and beat him and crucify him on a cross. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks a favor of Jesus.
The mother of Zebedes sons came to Jesus. Her sons accompanied her. She bowed down and asked a favor of him.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Grant that one of my sons may sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom. Make me a promise."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am to drink?" They said to him, "We can."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten pupils heard about it. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called together his disciples and said to them, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them."
Do not be like this. Rather, whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first among you must be your servant.
Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve and give his life as a ransom for many. Two blind men regain their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed him.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by, and they cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They asked them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder: "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stopped and called to them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
They said, "O Lord, we wish to see."
Jesus felt deep compassion for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see again, and they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem
And as they approached Jerusalem, they came to Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus sent two disciples.
He said to them, "Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there, with a colt beside her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says something to you, say that the Lord needs them. The master will send them immediately.
This happened so that what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled, who said:
Say to Zion, "Behold, your King is coming to you, humble and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
The disciples went and did what Jesus had commanded them.
Bring the donkey and its colt. Put their clothes on them. Then Jesus sat on the clothes.
A very large crowd gathered and spread their coats on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people went ahead of him, and others followed, shouting: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was moved. And the people asked: "Who is this?"
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleanses the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area and began to drive out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and also the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you have made it a den of robbers." (Jeremiah 7:11)
The blind and the lame came to Jesus in the temple, and He healed them there.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonders that he did, and they also saw the children in the temple area shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," answered Jesus. "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus left the crowds and went away from the town to Beth-any. He spent the night there. The cursing of the fig tree
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem, and he was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He went to it and found nothing on it but leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And at once the fig tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. They asked, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"
Jesus answered, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." Jesus' authority is questioned.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did the baptism of John come from? Was it from heaven, or of men?" They reasoned among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say, "from people"? We fear people. Everyone thought that John was a prophet.
Jesus answered them, "I do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." The story of the two sons.
What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."
The son said, "I won't go." But he changed his mind later and went.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing to him. The son answered, "Yes, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" They answered, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live, and you did not believe in him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes did believe. You saw this, yet even then you did not repent of your sins and believe in him. The parable of the tenants.
Listen to another story. There was a man who owned land, so he planted a vineyard in it. He surrounded it with a wall. He also dug a winepress in it, and also built a watchtower. Then he leased the vineyard to the farmers. After that, he went on a journey.
When the time of the harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, that they might gather his share of the fruits.
But the tenants caught their servants. They beat one of them. They killed another. They stoned the third to death.
Then the man sent other servants to the tenants. He sent more than he had sent the first time. The tenants treated them the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."
But when the tenants saw the son coming, they said to one another, "This is the heir to the farm. Come, let's kill him, so that all this wealth will be ours."
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to these tenants?
They said, "This evil man will be destroyed." "Then the vineyard will be leased to other workers, who will give him his share of the produce at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes' (Psalm 118:22-23)?"
So I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will bear its fruit.
"Whoever falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will crush him."
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables. They realized that he was speaking about them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him. But they feared the crowds. The people thought that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus spoke to them in parables again, saying,
This is how the kingdom of heaven is like. A king prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
He sent his servants to the dinner guests. The servants told them to come. But they refused.
Then he sent out more servants, saying, "Tell those invited, 'I have prepared my banquet; my oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.'"
But the people paid no attention. One went to his field, and another to his work.
The rest were kept as servants. They were mistreated and then killed.
The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed the murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come."
Go to the street corners. Invite to dinner anyone you find.
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
King entered to see the guests. He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
"My friend," he asked, "How did you get in here without your wedding clothes?" The man could not find anything to say.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet, and cast him out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap Jesus in his words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by anyone, and you don't show partiality to anyone. Tell us, then, what you think. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
"So tell us what you think: Is it right to pay the tax to Caesar, or not?"
But Jesus knew their wicked plans. He said, "Hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay the tax. They brought him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words?"
"Caesar," they replied. Then he said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed. Then they left him and went away. "At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven."
On that very day, the Pharisees came to Jesus and asked him a question. They do not believe in the resurrection of the dead.
They said, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us, 'If a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, his brother should marry the widow and raise up children for his brother.'"
We had seven brothers. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second and third brothers. The same thing happened until the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
Now, when the dead rise, whose wife will she be? For all seven were married to her.
Jesus answered them, "You are wrong, because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God."
When the dead rise, they will not marry. Their fathers will not give them in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
What about the dead who rise? Haven't you read what God has told you?
He said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) "I am not the God of the dead, but the God of the living."
When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught as one who had authority, not as the scribes. The greatest commandment.
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, they gathered together.
One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with a question.
"Teacher," he asked, "which is the most important commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important commandment.
The second is like it: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"All things written in the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments." "Who is the Son of Christ?"
The Pharisees gathered together. And Jesus asked them,
What do you think about Christ? Whose son is he? They answered, "The son of David."
He said to them, "Why then does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit himself speaks through David."
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." (Psalm 110:1)
So if David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?
No one could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him another question.
Jesus rules over the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
He said, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on the seat of Moses."
So you must obey them. Do everything they ask you to do. But don't do what they do. They don't practice what they preach.
They tie heavy loads and place them on others' shoulders, but they themselves do not want to lift a finger to move them.
All they do is for people to see. They carry small boxes on their foreheads and arms containing verses from the Bible. They make these boxes very wide. And they make the sleeves of their coats very long.
They love to sit in the places of honor at feasts. They also love to have the most important seats in churches.
They love to be greeted in the markets. They love for people to call them "Lord."
But do not be called "Rabbi," for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth your father; for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
You should not be called 'teacher'; for you have one teacher, the Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; for you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in.
(nothing)
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel around the world and sea to make one convert, and when you have made him, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.
Woe to you, blind guides! You say, "If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated."
You are blind and ignorant! Which is more important? Gold? Or the temple that sanctifies gold?
You also say, ‘If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift that is on it, he is bound to fulfill his oath.’
O blind ones! Which is greater: the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
Therefore, whoever swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it.
And whoever swears by the temple, swears by Him and by Him who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the sky, swears by the throne of Allah and by Him who sits upon it.
Alas for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You are hypocrites! You tithe mint, dill and cumin, but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
O you blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
Alas for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and wickedness. You only care about satisfying your own desires.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, and then the outside will also be clean.
Alas for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean.
The matter with you is the same. You seem from the outside as if you are doing the right thing. But inside, you are full of wrong. You pretend you are not what you are.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and adorn the graves of the righteous.
And you say, "If we had been in the place of those who came before us, we would not have done as they did, we would not have been accomplices in the killing of the prophets."
For you are bearing witness against yourselves that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
"So you complete the wickedness of those who came before you."
O nest of vipers! How can you escape the wrath of hell?
Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and teachers. You will kill some of them, and crucify some, and scourge them in your synagogues, and drive them out from city to city.
Therefore you shall pay the penalty for the blood of every righteous person shed on earth, from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
What I am determined to say is the truth. All this will happen to those who are living now.
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you! How often have I wanted to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Look, your house was left empty.
I say to you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!' (Psalm 118:26)
Signs of the End Times
Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came to him. They pointed out the temple buildings to him.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. And his disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered, "Be on your guard! Beware of being led astray."
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will deceive many.
You will hear of wars. You will also hear people talking about future wars. Do not panic. These things must happen. But the end is not yet.
Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many places.
This is all just the beginning of the labor.
Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name.
At that time, many will fall away from their faith. Some will hate each other. Some will hand over their fellow believers to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise and deceive many people.
For the abundance of wickedness will cause the love of many to grow cold.
But he who endures to the end will be saved.
This gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world, as a testimony to all nations. And then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination of desolation." (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
So those in the valley, let them flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof should go down to their house to get anything.
No one in the field should go back to get their coat.
What a hardship it was in those days for pregnant women! What a hardship for nursing mothers!
Pray that you may not have to flee in winter or on the Sabbath.
There will be great tribulation in those days, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be.
If time were not shortened, no one would survive. But for the sake of God's chosen people, it will be cut short.
In those days, someone will say to you, "Here is the Christ!" or "There he is!" Do not believe it.
False Christs and false prophets will arise, and they will perform great signs and wonders. They will seek to deceive the chosen people of God, if possible.
Look, I told you before.
Therefore, if someone tells you, "It's far out in the desert," don't go there. Or if someone says, "It's deep inside the house," don't believe them.
The lightning that flashes from the east is seen in the west. So will be the coming of the Son of Man.
Vultures will gather wherever there is a corpse.
Immediately after the terrible suffering of those days, "the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.
He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet. He will gather His chosen servants from all over the earth. He will come to them from the one end of the heavens to the other.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches become tender and it puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.
In the same way, when you see all these things happening, you know that the end is near. It's about to happen.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Those who live in that time will certainly not die until all these things have happened.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. No one knows the day or the hour.
No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven. The Son doesn't know, but only the Father.
"Remember how it was in the days of Noah. So will the coming of the Son of Man be."
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were marrying and giving their daughters in marriage. They did all these things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing about what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
There will be two men in the field. One is taken and the other is left.
Two women will be grinding at the mill. One will be taken and the other left.
"So wait and watch; you do not know on what day your Lord will come."
You must understand something. Let's assume the homeowner knew at what hour of the night the thief would come. Then he would have stayed awake and vigilant. He wouldn't have allowed his home to be violated.
"So you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect."
Let's assume that a master entrusted one of his slaves with the responsibility of overseeing the rest of the servants in his house. The slave's task is to provide them with food at the appropriate time. The master wants a trustworthy and wise slave for this position.
It would be good for the servant to see his master at work when his master returns.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. The master will appoint that servant to manage all that he owns.
But suppose this slave thinks to himself, "My master is away a long time."
Let's assume he started beating other servants. Let's assume he eats and drinks with those who drink too much.
The master of that servant will come on a day when the servant does not think he will come, and at an hour the servant does not know.
Then Mr. will tear it apart. He will send it to the place where protesters go. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth.
The Tale of the Ten Virgins
This is how the kingdom of heaven will be at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. Five were wise.
The foolish ones took their lamps, but they did not take oil with them.
The wise took the oil in their jars along with their lamps.
The groom didn't arrive for a long time. So, all the bridesmaids got tired and fell asleep.
At midnight, someone shouted: "Here comes the bridegroom! Come and meet him!"
Then all the virgins awoke and trimmed their lamps.
The fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
They said, "No," it may not be enough for everyone. Rather, go to the sellers and buy for yourselves.
So they went to buy oil. But while they were on their way, the bridegroom arrived. And the bridesmaids who were ready with him went into the wedding feast. Then the door was shut.
Later, the other bridesmaids also came. They said, "Sir! Sir!" Open the door for us!
But he answered, "What I am about to tell you is the truth. I do not know you."
"Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect." - The Parable of the Three Servants.
And again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a king, which went to travel into a far country: And called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
He gave $10,000 to one. He gave $4,000 to another. And he gave $2,000 to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could handle. Then he set out on his journey.
The servant who received the ten thousand dollars immediately went and put his money to work. He earned another ten thousand dollars.
He who won $4000 won an additional $4000.
But the man who received two thousand dollars went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money there.
After a long time, the master of those servants returned. He wanted to gather all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 brought the other $10,000. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I've made another $10,000."
His lord answered him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord!"
The man with the $4000 also came. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $4000. Look, I've made another $4000."
His lord answered him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord!"
Then the man who had received the two thousand came and said, "Master, you know that I am a hard man. You reap where you did not sow, and gather where you did not scatter seed."
So I was afraid. I went out and hid two thousand dollars for you in the ground. Look, this is what is yours.
His master answered him, "You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not scatter seed?"
Well, you should have deposited my money in the bank. When I returned, I would have retrieved it with interest.
Then his master said to the other servants, "Take the 2000 dollars from him and give it to the one who has 20000 dollars."
To whom much is given, much will be required; and to whom much has been given, much more will be demanded. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
Drive that huge servant outside. There, in the darkness, they weep and sharpen their teeth.' Sheep and goats
The Son of Man will come in his full glory, and all the angels with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne.
All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people into two groups. It will be like a shepherd who sorts the sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, “Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world.”
I was hungry, and you gave me food. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you welcomed me.
I needed clothes. You gave them to me. I was sick. You took care of me. I was in prison. You came to visit me.
Then the righteous will answer him, saying: 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you drink?'
When did we see you a stranger and invite you in? When did we see you in need of clothes and clothe you?
When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?
The King will answer: "What I am about to tell you is the truth. Whatever you have done for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you have done for me."
Then he will say to those on his left, “Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.”
I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger, and you did not invite me in. I was in need of clothes, and you did not give me any. I was sick and in prison, but you did not care for me.
And they also will answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, and did not help you? Or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not help you?'
He will answer and say to them, 'Truly I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these, you did it to me.'
Then they will go to everlasting punishment. But those who have done good will have eternal life.
Plan to kill Jesus
Jesus said all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. And the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They made plans to arrest Jesus by stealth. They wanted to kill him.
"But not during the festival," they said. "It may cause trouble with the people." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper at Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, and she poured it on his head as he was reclining at the table.
When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. They said, "What a waste!"
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been donated to the poor.
Jesus knew this. So he said to them, "Why are you troubling this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me."
The poor you will always have with you, but me you will not always have.
You poured perfume over me to prepare me for burial.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. What you have done will be proclaimed in every place where this good news is preached throughout the world. It will be spoken of with horror. Judas agrees to hand Jesus over.
Of the twelve, one went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
So he asked, "What will you give me if I deliver Jesus to you?" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper.
That day was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?"
He replied, "Go into the city to a certain man, and tell him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near. I am going to keep the Passover at your house with my disciples."' "
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.
And when evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve.
As they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
The disciples were very sorrowful. One by one they began to ask him, "Are you not the Lord?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me."
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. Woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."
It was Judas who was to betray him. He asked, "Is it I, Teacher?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."
As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
This is what I tell you. From now on, I will not drink this wine with you until the day I drink it with you in my Father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus says Peter will fail.
Jesus said to them, "This very night all of you will fall away on my account, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
Peter answered, "All may forsake him because of you, but I will never forsake him."
"What I am about to tell you is the truth," Jesus answered. "This very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times and say that you do not know me."
But Peter said, "I will never deny you, even if I have to die with you." All the other disciples said the same. Jesus prays in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him. He began to be sorrowful and very troubled.
And he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
He went a little farther. Then he fell on his face and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. He asked Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
Watch and pray. Then you will not fall into sin when you are tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Jesus went away again and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned. And he found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. For the third time he prayed the same prayer.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand. The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of sinners."
"Get up! Let's go! Here is the one who betrays me to them!" Jesus was arrested.
As Jesus was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. A large crowd was with him, carrying swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was to betray Jesus, had arranged a signal with them. He said, "The one I kiss is the man. Seize him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' followers reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword away. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He'll immediately send an army of over 70,000 kings.
But how are the scriptures fulfilled then? They say that it must happen this way.
At that time Jesus said to the crowds, "Am I leading a bandit raid against you? He asked. "Was it necessary to come with swords and clubs to arrest me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me."
But all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was taken to the Sanhedrin.
Those who had arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.
Not long after, Peter followed Jesus. He went as far as the courtyard of the high priest, where he entered and sat down among the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus to use against him, and they wanted to kill him.
But they found no evidence, despite many false witnesses coming forward. Finally, two other witnesses stepped up.
They said, "This man claimed, 'I can destroy the temple of God, and I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and asked Jesus, "Do you not answer? What is it that these men are testifying against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Yes," Jesus answered. "As you say, but I tell you all: In the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Do we need any more witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy with your own ears."
"What do you think?" they answered, "He must die!"
Then they spat in his face. They struck him with their palms. Others slapped him.
They said, "Tell us, Christ! Who struck you?" Peter said he did not know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean."
But before them all, Peter said that he was not. "I do not know what you are talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate leading to the courtyard. And there another woman saw him, and she said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
And again he said it was not so. And he swore, saying, "I do not know this man!"
A little later, those who stood by came up to Peter, and said, "Surely you are one of them; for your speech makes it plain."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Judah commits suicide by hanging.
It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people made a plan to kill Jesus.
They bound him and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt deep shame and remorse for what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
"I made a mistake," he said. "I released an innocent man." "So what?" they replied. "That's your problem."
So Judas threw the silver into the temple and went away. Then he went and hanged himself.
The chief priests picked up the coins and said, "It is against the law to put this money in the temple treasury. It is blood money. It was paid for the death of a man."
They decided to use the money to buy a field for strangers. People from other countries will be buried there.
And for this reason, the Field of Blood has been called by that name to this day.
Then was fulfilled the word of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value."
"So they took the silver and bought the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12, 13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus was brought to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "You say so."
But when the chief priests and elders brought charges against him, he did not answer.
Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?"
But Jesus made no answer, not even to a single charge. The governor was greatly amazed.
It was the governor's custom at the festival to release one prisoner whom the people had chosen.
At that time there was a famous prisoner named Barabbas.
When the chief priests and the crowds had gathered, Pilate said to them, “Which one do you want me to release for you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?”
Pilate knew that the chief priests were envious. He knew that this was the reason they had delivered Jesus to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much in a dream today because of him."
But the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and to kill Jesus.
"Which of these two do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
Then Pilate said, "What shall I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?" They all answered, "Crucify Him!"
"Why? What evil has he done?" asked Pilate. But they cried out all the more, "Crucify him!"
Seeing that he was making no progress, Pilate brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat. It was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about noon. "Here is your king," Pilate said to the Jews. "But they
All the people answered, "We and our children will bear the guilt of his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas. But he ordered Jesus to be flogged, and then handed him over to be crucified. Soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus to the governor's palace, which is called the Praetorium. The rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They stripped him and put a purple robe on him.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!”
They spat on him. They hit him on the head with a stick repeatedly.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They dressed him in his own clothes. Then they took him to crucify him on the cross. Jesus is crucified on the cross.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon. They forced him to carry the cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha, which means the place of the skull.
There they mixed wine with bitter herbs and offered it to Jesus to drink. But when he tasted it, he refused to drink.
And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots.
They sat there and watched him.
Above his head they placed the sign that read his charge. It was written: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
And two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by shouted at Jesus, mocking him. They shook their heads.
And they said, "Are you the one who, in three days, will destroy the temple and build it again? Save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
In the same way, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders mocked him.
They said, "He saves others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel; let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he is God's son. He said, "I am the Son of God."
In the same way, the robbers who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. The death of Jesus.
From noon until three, darkness covered the whole earth.
Around the third hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who stood there, when they heard Jesus cry out, said, "He is calling Elijah."
At once one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The rest said, "Leave him alone. Let us see if Elijah will come to save him."
After Jesus also cried out with a loud voice, he died.
At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split.
The graves were opened. And many of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised to life.
They came out of the tombs. After the resurrection of Jesus, they went to the holy city. And there they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and the guards, who were watching over Jesus, saw the earthquake and everything that happened. They were terrified. They cried out, saying, "Truly he was the Son of God!"
Not far away, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
Mary Magdalene was among them. There was also Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebed's sons was also there. Jesus was buried.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
He placed him in his new tomb that he had hewn out of the rock. Then he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb. Then he departed.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards were at the tomb.
The next day was the day after the Preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
They said, "O Lord," we remember what that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will be raised.'
So he gave orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away, and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last deception will be worse than the first."
Pilate said, "Take some guards. Go and make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting the guard.
Jesus rises from the dead.
The Sabbath was over, and dawn was breaking on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
There was a great earthquake. An angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body was illuminated like lightning. And his clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so frightened of him that they trembled and became like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
Not here! He has risen, just as he said! Come and see the place where he was lying.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."
So the women hurried away from the tomb, fearful yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
Suddenly Jesus met them. He said, "Peace be with you!" So they came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
So Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me." The guards reported this to the chief priests.
As the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they made a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They said to the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night and stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears this report, we'll pay him a bribe. That will protect you from trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' final commands to his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they worshiped him, but some of them still had doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
"Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And you can be sure that I am with you always, to the end of the age."
John the Baptist prepares the way of the Lord.
This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago, the prophet Isaiah wrote: "Behold, I send my messengers before you, who shall prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
A voice cries out in the wilderness: "Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
And so John came, baptizing in the wilderness and preaching that people should be baptized and repent of their sins, for then God would forgive them.
All the people of the Jewish country went out to him. So did all the people of Jerusalem. And as they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
This is what John the Baptist preached: "After me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus.
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus had just come up out of the water. At that moment, he saw the heavens torn open and the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Immediately, the Spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness.
Jesus was in the wilderness for forty days. There he was tempted by the devil. Wild animals did not hurt Jesus. Angels took care of him. Jesus chooses the first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee. He proclaimed the good news of God.
"The time is fulfilled," he said. "The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent ye, and believe the gospel!"
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake; they were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," said Jesus, "and I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus went a little further. There he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, who were in their boat mending their nets.
He called them immediately, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after Jesus. Jesus drives out a demon.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
The people were amazed at his teaching. He taught them with authority, not like the scribes.
And at that moment a man in their midst shouted. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said:
What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!
"Be silent!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!"
The man trembled violently with evil. Then he burst out in a scream.
Everyone was amazed. They asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands evil spirits and they obey him!"
News about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. Immediately, they went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her. He took her hand and helped her to stand. He healed her of the fever. Then she began to serve them.
That evening, after sunset, they brought to Jesus all who were sick and those possessed by demons.
All the people in the town gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They were suffering from every kind of disease. He also cast out many demons. But he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus was praying in a quiet place.
It was very early in the morning, and it was still dark. Jesus got up and went out of the house. He went to a place where He could be alone. There He prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they cried: "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."
So he went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. Jesus healed a man who had been afflicted with leprosy.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. Kneeling down, he begged Jesus, saying, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus was deeply troubled. He reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I do want to help you." "Be clean!"
The disease left him immediately. He was cured.
Jesus sent him away immediately. And He sternly warned him.
"Don't tell anyone about this," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices prescribed by Moses. That will be a testimony to the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely, and to spread the news so widely that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He remained outside in secluded places, but people from all quarters continued to flock to him.
Jesus heals a man who couldn't walk.
A few days later, Jesus again entered Capernaum, and it was heard that He had returned home.
The people gathered so closely together that there was no room left, not even near the door. And Jesus was preaching the word to them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after removing some tiles, they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
Jesus saw their faith, and he said to the man, "Child, your sins are forgiven."
Some of the disciples of the law were sitting there. They were thinking,
Why is this man talking like this? He's saying something very evil! Only God forgives sins!
Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that they were discussing among themselves what they might say. He said to them, "Why are you discussing what you might say? "
Is it easier to say to this man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your bed and walk'?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who couldn't walk.
He said, "Arise, take your mat and go to your house."
The man rose and took up his mat. Then he walked away, while everyone watched. All the people were amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus chooses Levi.
And Jesus went out again beside the Sea of Galilee; and a great multitude gathered around Him, so He began to teach them.
As Jesus walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at Levi's house, and many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowds that were following Jesus.
There were some Pharisees who were teachers of the law. They saw him eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners." He was also asked about fasting.
The disciples of John and the Pharisees often fasted. Some people came to Jesus and asked him, "Why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
But the day will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People do not tear a piece from a new garment and patch it onto an old one. If they did, the new piece would pull away from the old, making the tear worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be lost. Instead, they pour new wine into new wineskins." Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On one of the sabbath days Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
He replied, "Have you never read what David did when he and his men were hungry? They needed food."
That was when Abiathar was high priest. David entered the house of God and ate the showbread, which was only allowed for the priests to eat. He also gave some to his men.
Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
"The Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."
Healing on Saturday
And another time Jesus entered the synagogue. There was a man with a withered and paralyzed hand.
Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They watched him closely. They wanted to see whether he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man with the weak and distorted hand, saying, "Rise up before everyone."
So Jesus asked them, "What does the law say? What should we do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save a life or destroy one?" But they did not answer.
Jesus looked around at them with anger. He was greatly distressed because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how to destroy Him. The multitudes were following Jesus.
Jesus and his disciples went to the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd from Galilee followed him.
The people heard about all that Jesus was doing. And many came to him, from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, the region of Tyre and Sidon.
And because of the crowds, Jesus asked his disciples to prepare a small boat for him, so that he would not be crushed by the people.
Jesus healed many people. The sick pressed forward to touch him.
When the evil spirits saw Jesus, they fell down before Him. And they cried out, saying, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell who he was. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up a mountain and called to him those whom he desired, and they came to him.
He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach.
And they had authority to cast out demons.
So Jesus appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, and among them was Simon, whom he named Peter.
There were Jacob son of Zebedee and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was also among them. He was the one who would later betray Jesus to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebul.
Jesus entered a house. And a large crowd gathered as well. The crowd was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about it. They went to take care of him. They said, "He has lost his mind."
There were some teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem. They said, "He is driven by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, to drive out demons."
So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables, saying, "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
If a kingdom fights against itself, it will not endure.
If the family is divided, it cannot last.
