첀 is the most important person in the kingdom?
劇en, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus gave the little boy a push and pulled him close. He made him stand in the middle.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
"Whoever humbles themselves like this child is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven."
Whoever welcomes a child like this in my name, welcomes me.
Woe to anyone who causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin. If anyone does that, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
What will be the state of the world due to the reasons that drive people to sin! This is what should happen, but what will be the state of those who do it!
If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter heaven with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into hell with two hands and two feet. In hell, the fire is always burning.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The parable of the lost sheep.
Don't underestimate any of these children. That's what I'm telling you. Their angels in heaven can go anytime to see my Father in heaven.
"Please"
What do you think? Imagine a man has 100 sheep, and one of them is lost. Wouldn't he leave the 99 sheep in the hills and go search for the lost one?
I'll tell you what's right. If he finds that sheep, he'll be happier about it than the 99 that didn't get lost.
It's the same with your Father in heaven. He doesn't want to lose any of these little ones. When someone does you wrong
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.
But won't he listen to you? You need to go with one or two others with you. The Bible says, "Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen to the witnesses? Tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church? Treat him no longer as a brother. Treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I'm going to tell you is right. What you lock here on earth, you will unlock in heaven. What you unlock here on earth, you will lock in heaven.
"Truly, this is what I am repeating to you. If some of you on earth agree on anything they ask for, My Father in heaven will do it for you."
"Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, I am with them." The merciless servant.
Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
Before he could get started, they brought in a man who owed him millions of dollars.
The man couldn't pay the money. His boss gave the order. The man, his wife, his children, and everything he owns has to be sold to pay off his debt.
The servant fell to his knees. "Give me some time," he begged. "I'll return everything to you."
His friend saw him and forgave him his debts, setting him free.
But this servant went and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He seized him and began to choke him, saying, "Pay what you owe me!"
The other servant fell on his knees. "Give me a chance," he begged. "I'll pay you back."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay back his debt.
The other servants saw what happened. This greatly disturbed them. They went and told their masters everything that had occurred.
Then the master called his first servant. He said to him, "Wicked servant!" and said, "I forgave you all that you owed me, because you pleaded with me."
Why didn't you show mercy to the other servants as you did to me?
In anger, his master handed him over to the prison officials. He will be punished until he has paid back everything he owes.
This is how my Father in heaven will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. He saw them there.
Some Pharisees tested Jesus. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus replied, "Have you not read that at the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female' (Genesis 1:27)?"
He said, "Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and they become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two but one. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate.
They said: "Why did Moses command that a man could give his wife a divorce certificate and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning."
This is what we are telling you. Any man who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. A man can only divorce his wife if she has not been faithful to him.
The students told him, "If this is how things are between a husband and wife, it's better we don't get married."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of celibacy. Only those who are called to it and are helped to live without marriage can accept it."
Some men cannot father children, even though they are still able. Some are left that way by other people, and some make themselves that way in order to serve the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept living that way, let him live it." The little children answered Jesus.
Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he asked, "Jesus and the Rich Young Man."
A man came to seek advice. He asked: "Teacher, what good deeds should I do to be with God in Paradise?"
"What are you asking me about the good things?" Jesus answered, "There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom of heaven, obey the commandments."
"What is truth?" asked the man. Jesus replied, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
Honor your parents. (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) And "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"I have kept all these commandments," said the young man. "Is there anything else you want me to do?"
Jesus answered and said, "If you want to be perfect, go sell all you have, give the money to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come follow me."
When he heard this boy say that, he went away sadly. He was very rich.
And Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
I tell you again, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for the rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the students heard this, they were very surprised. They asked, "So who can save us?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Replied Peter, "Let's go with you on everything! Will there be a reward?"
"I tell you the truth," Jesus answered them, "in the new world, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, and you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left homes or brothers or fathers or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times as much, and will inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He agreed to pay them the usual daily wage. Then he took them to his vineyard.
Around nine in the morning, he went out again. He saw people standing in the market doing nothing.
He said to them, "You too will go and work in my vineyard, and I will give you what is right."
"He went out again around noon and at three o'clock, and did the same thing."
About five o'clock, he came out and found the others still standing there. He asked them, "Why are you standing here all day long doing nothing?"
"Why didn't he let anyone hire us?" they asked. He replied, "Go work with me in my vineyard."
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard spoke to the foreman. He said, "Gather the workers and give them their wages, starting with the last and then the first."
The workers who were hired around five o'clock came. Each one received their usual daily wage.
The ones who came later, who were supposed to get more, each received the regular daily wage.
As soon as they saw him, they started to question his friend.
"These people who were hired only worked for one hour," they said. "You paid them the same amount you paid us. We did a lot of work and spent the whole day in the sun."
The homeowner answered one of them. He said to him, "My friend, I'll be reasonable with you. Weren't you agreed to work on a regular day?"
Take your money and leave. I want to give the people I worked with in the end the same pay I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you want to feel oppressed like you've given people generously?
What is at hand is going to be first. And what is first is going to be at hand. Jesus repeated his death that is to come.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
"We were on our way to Jerusalem," he said. "The leading priests and the teachers of the law were going to arrest Jesus and hand him over to the Roman authorities. They were going to sentence him to death."
"They will hand him over to people who are not Jewish. The people will mock him and beat him with a drum. They will crucify him. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks Jesus for a favor.
The mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus. Her sons came with her. They knelt before him and asked him for something.
"What do you want?" Jesus asked. She said, "Promise me that one of my two sons may sit at your right hand in your kingdom, and the other at your left."
"You do not know what you are asking," Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the cup I am about to drink?" "We can," they answered.
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten pupils heard about it. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus gathered them and said, "Know the rulers of the nations. They hold power over their people. Their chief officials command them."
Do not be like that. Instead, whoever wants to be important among you must be your servant.
Everyone who wants to be first must be your servant.
Be like a son of man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life to free many people. He saw some blind people and gave them their sight back.
Jesus and his disciples were going from Jericho. A large crowd followed him.
There were some blind men sitting by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by. They began to shout: "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood and called to them, "How much longer do you want me to work for you?" He asked.
"Sir," they answered, "we want to be able to see."
Jesus felt a great deal of compassion for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see again, and he sent them on their way.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
And as they approached Jerusalem, they came to Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two disciples.
He told them, "Go to the circle ahead of you. When you reach it, you will find a donkey tied up. Her foal will be with her. Untie her and bring her to me."
If someone tells you something, tell them, "God needs it. The homeowner will send it to him right away."
This is happening to fulfill what the prophet said. It is written.
Say to the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your King is coming to you; He is humble and riding on a donkey, And on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
The students left and did what they were told to do.
They brought the donkey and the colt. They laid their clothes on them, and then Jesus sat on the clothes.
Many people spread their mats on the road. Others cut branches from trees and spread them on the road.
One of the people went ahead of him, and one followed him. They all shouted: "Hosanna to the son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest heaven!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up. The people asked, "Who is this?"
Answer the people: "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleanses the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area and began to drive out all the people buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be a house of prayer for all peoples.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you have made it 'a den of robbers.' (Jeremiah 7:11)"
Then the blind and the lame came to Jesus in the temple, and He healed them there.
The chief priests and teachers of the law saw the miracles he did and the children shouting in the temple courts, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw this, they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," replied Jesus. "Haven't you read this in the Scriptures? The passage says, 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise.'" (Psalm 8:2)
And after the people were put out of the way, Jesus went out of the city to Bethany, where he lodged for the night. In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he saw a fig tree by the wayside, and went to look for fruit on it, but found none.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He climbed it, but found nothing in it but leaves. When he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!", it began to wither at once.
When the students saw this, they were very surprised. They said, "How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what I did to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will happen."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." Jesus' authority is questioned.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you what to do with this."
"Where does John's baptism come from? From heaven or from men?" They argued with each other about this. They said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say, 'of men'? We fear people. Everyone thought John was a prophet.
So Jesus answered them, "I do not know." And Jesus said to them, "What I am doing, you do not understand now, but you will know after this." The story of the two sons.
What do you make of this? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, today go and work in the vineyard."
"I won't say anything," the boy answered. But after a while, he thought better of it and left.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing to him. The son answered, "I will go, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" They answered, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
Go, John, to show you the right way to live. And you didn't believe him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. You saw this. And even then you didn't turn from your life and believe him. The story of the slum.
Listen to another story. There was a man who owned land, so he planted a vineyard in it. He surrounded it with a wall. He dug a hole for a winepress in it. He also built a watchtower. He leased the vineyard to farmers. Then he went on a journey.
As the time of harvest drew near, God sent his servants to the vineyards. He told them to gather his share of the fruit.
But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one of them. They killed another. They stoned the third to death.
And afterward, the lord sent other servants to the tenants. He sent more than he had sent the first time. The tenants treated them in the same way.
In the end, God was with them and their son. He said, "They will respect my son."
But the servants saw the boy coming. They said to each other, "This is the one who will take everything from the master one day. Come, let's kill him. That way, everything will be ours."
They drove him out of the vineyard, and then they killed him.
Even if the owner of the chrome comes back, what's he going to do with these guys?
"He will destroy these wicked people," he replied. "Then he will lease the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the produce at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what the Scriptures say? 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
Be here and see what I will tell you. The kingdom of God is going to rise from you. It will be given to people who will bear its fruits.
"Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces. But the stone will fall on anyone and crush them."
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables. They knew he was speaking about them.
They started to look for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the people. The people believed that Jesus was a prophet.
A Wedding Eve Tale
Jesus told them more parables. He said,
This is what the kingdom of heaven is like. A king prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
The servants sent them to the people who invited them to dinner. The servants told them to come, but they refused.
And then he sent some more servants. He said, "Tell those who were invited, 'I have prepared my dinner. I have slaughtered my fattened cattle and all my choice animals. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.'"
But people didn't give it importance. One went to his field. Another went to his work.
The rest were arrested. They were mistreated and then killed.
The king was filled with great anger. He swore to his people to destroy them. He killed those murderers and burned their city.
The king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready. But those who were invited were not worthy to attend."
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Clear, the servants went to the alleys. They gathered all the people, good and bad. They didn't wait until the wedding hall was full of guests.
The king entered to see the guests. He noticed a man who was not wearing wedding clothes.
"My friend," she said, "How did you come here without your wedding clothes?" The man didn't know what to say.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet. Throw him into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it right to give Caesar the tax?
The Pharisees went out. They plotted how to trap Jesus in his words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You don't care about anyone's opinion of what you say or do. You don't pander to those in power."
Tell me, then, what do you see? Is it right that we pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their wicked plans. He said, "Hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay their taxes. He brought him a silver coin.
He said to them, "Where did this picture come from? And where did this talk come from?"
"Render unto Caesar," they answered. When he said to them, "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were very amazed. And he went away and left them. Marriage at the resurrection.
That same day the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people will be raised from the dead.
"Teacher," they said, "this is what Moses commanded: If a man dies and leaves no children, his brother must marry the widow. He must father children for his brother."
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second and third boys. It happened exactly the same way to the seventh boy.
Clear, the woman died.
"And then, when the dead wake up again, who will she be? All seven of them married her."
Jesus answered, "You are mistaken, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God."
When the dead walk, they don't get married. Their parents don't give them the means to marry. They'll be like the angels of paradise.
What about the dead who come back to life? Didn't you read what God told you?
He said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the listeners heard this, they were amazed that he knew about it. The most important thing is that...
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus. Therefore the Pharisees gathered together.
One of them was a lawyer. So he tested Jesus with a question.
"Professor," he asked, "which of the rulings in Sharia law is more important than the others?"
Jesus answered, " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' (Deuteronomy 6:5)"
This is the first and most important commandment.
"Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
All that is written in the Torah and the prophecies is based on these two commandments. Who is the Messiah?
The Pharisees were assembled. Jesus asked them,
"What do you seek in Jesus? Who are his parents? Where is he from?" "He is a descendant of David," they answered.
He said to them, "How is it that the Spirit of God speaks through David, calling him 'Lord'? For David himself said, 'The Lord said to my Lord...'"
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." (Psalm 110:1)
If David calls him "Master," how can he be his son?
No one could answer him in a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any questions.
Jesus judges the Pharisees and teachers of the law.
Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples,
He said, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat."
You have to obey them. Do everything they tell you. But don't be like them. They do whatever they want and repeat it.
They tie heavy loads onto people's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to help.
Everything they do is for people to see. They put small circles on their foreheads with verses from the Bible in them. They make the circles very wide. And they take off a lot of the decoration from their turbans.
They like to sit in the places of honor at banquets. They like to have the best seats in the temples.
They greet each other with "God" in the markets. They love it when people address them as "Lord".
But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth "Father," for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
You don't need to be called 'Teacher'. You have one Teacher, and it is Christ.
The most important one among you will be your servant.
He who raises his head will fall, and he who falls will rise.
"What a severe judgment you teachers of the law and Pharisees are going to face! You hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; you yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those who are entering go in."
"Please"
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and then you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are."
What's up with you, blind guides! You say, "If one swears by the temple, it means nothing. But if one swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath."
Are you blind and dim-witted! What's more important? The gold? Or the temple that gives gold its value?
She also says, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift that is on it, he is bound by his oath.'
Oh, you blind ones! What is more important? The gift? Or the altar where the gift is consecrated?
So whoever swears by the name of the altar swears by his name and by everything on it.
And every man who swears by the temple, he swears by the temple and by the one who dwells in it.
And every one of them who swears by heaven, he swears by the throne of Allah and by Him who sits upon it.
You hypocritical experts in the law and Pharisees! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
O blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed. You only do what is visible to others.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside will be clean also.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean."
It's the same with you. From the outside, it looks like you're doing the right thing. But inside, you're full of things that aren't right. You're pretending to be someone you're not.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you would say, "If we had lived in the days of those who came before us, we would not have done what they did. We would not have aided in the killing of the prophets."
So that you may bear witness against yourselves. You shall know that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
Purely they sealed the sins that those before you started!
O den of vipers! How will you escape the punishment of hell?
"Bashi was saying, 'I want to go to you, to wise men, and teachers. You will kill some of them. You will crucify some of them. Others you will teach in your temples. You will drive them from city to city."
"How shall you be repaid for the blood of all the righteous people that has been shed on earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar."
What I'm going to tell you is right. Everything happens to those who are alive now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you would not have it!
Clothes, your house is empty.
I will tell you, when you see me, you will say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." (Psalm 118:26)
Signs of the End Times
Jesus left the temple. As he was going away, his disciples came to him. They wanted to draw his attention to the temple which they had built.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. The disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Watch out! Be on your guard against deceit."
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and they will deceive many people.
You will hear about wars. You will hear people talking about wars to come. Don't be afraid. This has to happen. But the end is not here yet.
People will fight against people. Kings will fight against kings. People will starve. There will be earthquakes in many places.
These are all just the beginning of the birth pangs.
And after that they will hand you over to be tortured and killed. All nations will hate you because of me.
At that time, many people will fall away from their faith. They will hate each other. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise and deceive many people.
To combat evil, most people will respond with love.
But he who endures to the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world, as a testimony to all nations. And then the promised day will come.
Prophet Daniel spoke of "the abomination that desolates" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). You will see it standing in the holy place one day. The reader needs to understand this.
And those in Judea must flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof goes down to their house to get something.
Anyone in the field must bring back their coats.
What a miserable state it will be then for pregnant women! What a miserable state for nursing mothers!
"May God spare the farmer from the winter and from Saturday."
There will be a great tribulation in these days. It will be worse than any tribulation that has been from the beginning of the world until now. And there will be no tribulation like it from that time on.
If the hour were not shortened, no one would survive. But because of God's chosen people, it will be shortened.
At that time, someone may say to you, "Look! The Christ is here!" or, "There he is!" Do not believe them.
False Christs and false prophets will arise. They will show great signs and wonders. They will try to deceive the people of God, if possible.
See, I told you before it happened.
If someone tells you, "He's far out in the desert," don't go there. Or if someone says, "He's way inside the house," don't believe it.
The lightning coming from the east can be seen in the west. It will be the same when people's children come.
Vultures will gather wherever there is a carcass.
"The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will tremble." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with great power and glory.
He will send His angels with a mighty blast of the trumpet. He will gather His chosen servants from all directions. He will bring them from the farthest reaches of the heavens to the farthest.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. As soon as its branches become tender and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
It's the same thing, when you see everything there and then, you know the end is near. It's right in front of the door.
I'll tell you what's right. The people who were alive at that time won't die until all this happens.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. No one knows the day or hour except God.
No one knows how many days or hours there are in this day or this hour. Even the angels in heaven don't know. The child doesn't know. Only God knows.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people ate and drank. They married. They gave their daughters in marriage. They did all these things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing about what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. That's how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
There will be two men in the field. One will be caught, and one will be left behind.
Two women will be grinding with the millstone. One will be called and one will be left.
Be vigilant. You don't know on which day your Lord will come.
You need to understand something. Suppose the homeowner knew what time the thief was going to come. He would have guarded it. He wouldn't have let the theft happen.
You also need to be ready. People's children will come at an hour you don't expect.
One day, a master decided to appoint one of his servants to oversee the other servants in his house. The task of this servant is to provide food to the others at the right time. The master wants a trustworthy and responsible servant for this job.
It would be good for the servant if his master found him doing his work when he returned.
I'll tell you what's right. The man is going to give that servant responsibility for everything he has.
But suppose this slave is wicked. Suppose he says to himself, "My master is taking a long time."
Suppose, for example, he starts beating other servants. And suppose, for example, he eats and drinks with those who drink a lot.
Master, that slave will come one day when he is not hidden. He will return at a time when he does not know.
And then they will cut Mr. Gadi into small pieces. They will send him to the land where those who claim to go. There, people will cry and beat their teeth.
The Story of the Ten Virgins
Then the kingdom of heaven will be like this. Ten virgins took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
Five were fools. Five were wise.
The ignorant took their lamps but didn't take olive oil with them.
The wise people took the oil in their flasks with their lamps.
The groom took a long time to arrive. And when he did, the girls wearing the traditional dresses got tired and fell asleep.
"The night has passed, dawn breaks, 'Here comes the groom! Go out and welcome him!'"
And afterward all the virgins were married, slept, and changed their lamps.
He who didn't know told he who knew: "Give us some of your oil; our light has gone out."
"No," they replied. "It's not enough for everyone. Instead, go to the oil sellers. Buy something for yourselves."
They were on their way to buy oil, but on the way, the groom arrived. The girls who were ready went in with him to the wedding dinner, and then they closed the door.
Clear, the other girls have come. They said, "Sir! Sir!" and they said, "Open the door for us!"
But he answered and said, "What I tell you is true. I do not know you."
Be vigilant. You don't know the day or the hour the bridegroom will come. The parable of the three servants.
"So it will be with the kingdom of heaven. A certain man was going on a journey, and he called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
He gave $10,000 to one. He gave $4,000 to another. And he gave $2,000 to the third. The master gave each of the servants the amount he knew they could manage. And then he went on his way.
The servant who received $10,000 left and took his money, then started working with it. He made another $10,000.
He who earned $4000, earned an extra $4000.
But the man who stole $2000 went and dug a hole in the ground. He put his master's money in it.
After a long time, the owner of these servants returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 came back with another $10,000. He said, "Sir, you gave me $10,000 on trust. Look, I've made an extra $10,000."
Our master answered and said, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Come, share the joy of your master!"
The man who had $4000 came with it. He said, "Sir, you gave me $4000 on trust. Look, I've made another $4000."
Our master answered and said, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Come, share the joy of your master!"
Then came the man who received $2000. He said, "Sir, I knew you were a tough man. You reap where you do not sow, and you gather good where you do not scatter."
I was afraid. I went out and buried your $2000 in the ground. Look, here it is, yours.
Moula answered: "O good son, O lazy servant! So you know that I reap where I do not sow? You know that I gather the harvest where I did not scatter the seed?"
Clear, you need to deposit my money in the bank. When I return, I'll have my money with the profit.
Safi Siddo ordered the other servants: "Take this 2000 dollars from him. Give it to the one who has 20,000 dollars."
Those who have will be given more. They will have abundance. But what about those who have nothing? Even those who have will have it taken away from them.
Get rid of that extra servant outside. There, in the dark, people will weep and gnash their teeth.' The sheep and the goats
Man is going to come in all his glory. All the angels are going to come with him. Then he will sit on his throne of glory in heaven.
All the nations will be gathered before Him. He will separate people into two groups, just like a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He puts the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
And then the King will say to those on his right, "Blessed are you, my children. Come and take what is yours. This kingdom has been prepared for you before the world was created."
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in.
I needed clothes. You gave them to me. I was sick. You took care of me. I was in prison. You came to visit me.
Then the righteous will answer him, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you a drink?"
And when did they see you as a stranger and bring you in? And when did they see you lacking clothes and give you any?
Why wouldn't you let us visit you when we saw you were sick or in prison?
The king will say: "Whatever I tell you is right. Anything you do to one of these brothers of mine who do not matter much, you do to me."
"Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.'"
I was hungry, but you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty, but you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not invite me in. I needed things. But you did not give me anything. I was sick and in prison. But you did not visit me.
He will answer them, "Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me."
He will say: "What I am telling you is true. Anything you haven't done for one of these people who don't matter, you haven't done it for me."
The wicked will be punished forever. But those who do right will have eternal life.
Plot to kill Jesus
Jesus finished saying all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
And afterward the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas.
The chief priests plotted to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.
"But not now, during the festival," they said. "The people may cause a riot." A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the Leper in Bethany.
A woman came with a bottle of perfume, wrapped and very expensive. She poured the perfume on his head while he was eating.
When the students saw this, they got angry. They said, "Why this waste?"
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to poor people.
Jesus knew what they were planning. So he said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me."
The poor will always be with you, but I will always be with you.
Pouring perfume over my body to prepare me for burial.
"What I'm going to tell you is right. What you've done will be talked about everywhere this good news reaches in the whole world. You will be talked about." Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
One of the twelve went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
His question was: "What will you give me if I deliver Jesus to you?" And they promised him thirty pieces of silver.
Afterward, Judas waited for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper.
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?"
He replied, "Go to the city to a certain man. Tell him, 'The teacher says: 'My time is near. I am coming to celebrate Passover with you and my disciples.' '"
So, the disciples did what Jesus told them to do. They prepared the Passover meal.
When evening came, Jesus was there with the twelve.
When asked what they were eating, he said, "What I'm going to tell you is true. One of you will hand me over to the enemy."
The students were very sad. One by one, they started telling him: "Not me, Sir, what?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me."
"A man will walk as he is destined to. But woe, woe to the one who delivers a son to man! He should never have been born in the first place."
Judas was the one who was going to betray him. He said, "Not me, Lord, is it?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you."
This is my blood of the new covenant, poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
This is what I've been telling you. From now on, I won't drink with you until the day we drink together in the Kingdom of Ba.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said that Peter would deny him.
Jesus said to them, "This very night, before the rooster crows, all of you will disown me three times because of me. For it is written in the Scriptures: 'When the shepherd is struck, the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
But after we rise from the dead, we will go before you to Galilee.
Peter replied: "Everyone else might turn their backs on you. But I will never walk away."
"Truly I tell you," Jesus answered, "today, even this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you yourself will deny me three times."
But Peter said, "I will never deny you, even if I have to die with you." And all the other disciples said the same. Jesus prays in Gethsemane.
And afterward Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here, while I go over there and pray."
God was with Peter and the sons of Zebedee, but he felt distressed and aggrieved.
And he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
He walked a few steps forward. Then he fell face-first to the ground. He prayed and said, "Lord, if possible, let this cup of suffering pass from me. But let it be as you will, not as I will."
To prevent that, he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. He asked Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
Stay alert and pray. So you don't fall into sin when Satan tempts you. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Jesus went away again to a distance. He prayed and said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please take this cup away from me. But not what I want, but what you want."
Nafi returned. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
He left them alone and went away again. For the third time, he uttered the same prayer.
And going back to his disciples, he found them sleeping. He said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand. The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners."
"Rise! Let us go! Here is the one who betrays me!" The Arrest of Jesus
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. He was accompanied by a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was going to betray Jesus, had arranged a signal with them. He said, "The one I kiss is the one. Seize him."
So Judah went to him and kissed him. He said, "Peace be upon you, Rabbi!"
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' followers reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him. "For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
I don't think I can ask my father for help. It's like he'd send me an army of over 70,000 angels.
"How can you believe in sacred texts when they say that things should happen this way?"
At that time, Jesus spoke to the crowds. He asked them, "Do you think I came to start another armed gang against you?" Do you need to bring swords and clubs to arrest me? Every day I sat in the temple square and taught. And you did not arrest me.
But all this was to fulfill what the prophets had spoken. Then all the disciples left Jesus and fled. Jesus is taken to the Sanhedrin.
The people who seized Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest. The elders and the teachers of the law were assembled there.
A little later, Peter followed Jesus. He went as far as the courtyard of the high priest, where he sat with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But they found no evidence, not even one person witnessed falsely. In the end, two other witnesses came forward.
They said, "This man claimed, 'I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and asked Jesus, "Will you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us whether you are the Messiah, the Son of God."
"Yes," Jesus answered, "just as you say. But I tell you all, in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
And the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Do we need any more witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy from his own lips."
"What's wrong with him?" "He needs to die!" he replied.
Then they spat in his face. They punched him with their fists. Others slapped him.
They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you?" Peter said he did not know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the house. A servant came to him. She said to him, "You were with Jesus of Galilee."
But before them all, Peter said it wasn't him. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
And he walked out the door that led to the house. There, another woman saw him. She told the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He said it wasn't him. He swore, "I don't know this man!"
After a while, those who were standing joined Peter. They told him, "Surely you are one of them; your manner of speaking gives you away."
And immediately Peter began to curse and swear, saying, "I do not know this man!" And when he had gone out to the gateway, the rooster crowed.
And suddenly Peter remembered what Jesus had said: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times," Jesus had told him. Peter went outside and began to weep bitterly.
Judah hangs himself.
It was a dark day. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They bound him and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt ashamed and deeply regretted what he had done. Therefore, he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
"I punished Anna," he said. "I delivered a man who had done no wrong." "So what?" they replied. "That's your job."
Then this Jew threw a lot of money into the temple and left. After he left, he hung himself.
The chief priests collected the coins. They said, "It is not lawful to put this money in the treasury of the temple. This money is blood money. Pay it out for the potter."
They decided to use the money to buy a plot of land for burials. People from other countries will be buried there.
And that is why it is called the Field of Blood to this day.
And afterward, the word of the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, who had said, "They gave thirty pieces of silver. This was the price set by the sons of Israel for him."
"They paid me thirty pieces of silver, as the Lord commanded me. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is as you say."
But when the high priest and the elders asked him, he did not answer.
And Pilate asked him, "What are the charges brought against you?"
"Jesus remained silent and did not answer even one question. The governor was greatly amazed."
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people could choose whom they wanted.
At that time, they had a famous prisoner named Barabbas.
Then Pilate addressed the crowd, "Do you want me to release to you Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were envious. He knew this was the reason they had delivered Jesus to him.
And while Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message: "Have nothing to do with that man. I have had a dream about him today, and I suffer greatly because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas' release and to crucify Jesus.
"Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
"What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" asked Pilate. And they all answered, "Crucify him!"
"What? What's he got?" asked Pilate. But early in the morning they shouted, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere with them, and that they were becoming restless. So he took water and washed his hands in front of them, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood. See to it yourselves."
We and our children accept the blame for your death!
Pilate released Barabbas, but had Jesus scourged and handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus into the palace, which they called the Praetorium. All the rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They left him without sight and dressed him in a purple jalabiya.
And after that, they gathered thorns and made a crown out of them. They put it on his head. They gave him a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and began to mock him, saying, "We know you, King of the Jews!"
They spat on him. They hit him on the head with a stick again and again.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They dressed him in his own clothes. Then they led him away to be crucified. Jesus was nailed to the cross.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon. They forced him to carry the cross.
Go to a place called Kolkata. The word Kolkata means "Place of the Skull."
There they mixed wine with bitter herbs and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink.
When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They left him alone, guarding him until the end.
Above his head they placed the written charge against him: "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
Two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who were crucifying Jesus said to him, "If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross." And the chief priests also mocked him, along with the scribes and elders.
And they said, "So you are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
In the same way, the chief priests, teachers of the law and elders mocked him.
They said, "He saved others, but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He had faith in God. God will save him now if He wants to. He is the one who said, "I am the Son of God."
In the same way, the thieves who were crucified with Jesus mocked him. Jesus died.
From noon until three, the whole earth was covered in darkness.
Around three o'clock, Jesus cried out in a loud voice. He said, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" which means "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
One of those standing there heard Jesus and said, "He's calling Elijah."
One of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The rest said: "Leave him with his delusions. We'll see what he does when Elijah comes to save him."
After Jesus cried very softly, he died.
At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn from top to bottom. The earth shook. The rocks split.
The graves were opened. The bodies of the great righteous people who had died rose from the dead.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus was raised to life, they entered the holy city. They appeared there to many people.
The Roman commander and the soldiers guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and everything that had happened. They were terrified and cried out, "Surely he was the Son of God!"
Not far away, there were many women watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
Mary Magdalene was there. So was Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of James and John, whose father was Zebedee. Jesus was buried.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came. He had become a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph washed the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
He placed it in his new tomb that he had hewn out of the rock. He rolled a large stone in front of the entrance to the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards were at the tomb.
The next day, which was the day after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
"Sir," they said, "this liar uttered some vain words as he was dying. He said, 'In three days I will rise.'"
"Then they rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. And Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb."
"Take a guard with you," Pilate answered. "Go. Make sure you seal the tomb well so that no one can enter."
And they went away and sealed the tomb securely. They placed a seal on the stone and left a guard standing by.
Jesus rose from the dead.
Now the Sabbath had ended, and dawn on the first day of the week had come. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
There was a great earthquake. An angel of the Lord descended from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled back the stone and sat on it.
His body was as swift as lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so scared of him that they trembled and became like dead men.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified."
Come here! Get up, as if you didn't want to! Come and see where he was lying.
"Walk quickly! Tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' I have told you."
So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy. They ran to tell his disciples.
Suddenly they met Jesus. He said, "Peace be upon you!" They went to him, touched his feet, and worshiped him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." The guards reported to the chief priests.
As the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
The heads of the churches met with the elders, and they showed them a plan. They gave the soldiers a lot of money.
They told the soldiers: "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
"If the governor hears this report, we'll give him the runaround. This will protect you from trouble."
The armies should take money and goods as they are told. This story has spread among the Jews until now. Jesus' final orders to his disciples.
And afterward, the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they prostrated to him. However, some people still doubted them.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
"You shall go and make disciples of all nations, and baptize them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."
Teach them to obey everything I commanded you. And be sure that I am always with you, until the end."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
In the time when the prophet Jesus was writing, he said: "I am sending a messenger before you. He will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
A voice cries out in the wilderness, "Prepare the way for the Lord. Make straight a highway for him."
And this is John. He baptized people in the wilderness. He preached to the people to be baptized and to repent of their sins. And God would forgive them.
All the people from the Judean countryside went out to him. All the people from Jerusalem also went to him. When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. And he ate locusts and wild honey.
This is what John the Baptist preached: "After me comes one who is mightier than I, so mighty that I am not worthy to stoop down and tie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee. John baptized him in the Jordan River.
Jesus came up from the water. And at that moment he saw the heavens split open. And he saw the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.
He let out a voice from the sky. He said to him, "You are my son, and I love you very much. I am very pleased with you."
Immediately the Spirit sent Jesus into the wilderness.
He was in the desert for 40 days, tempted by the devil. The wild beasts did not harm Jesus. Angels watched over him. Jesus chose his first disciples.
After they had imprisoned John, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
"The time has come," he said. "The Kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the Good News!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. He saw Simon and Andrew. They were casting their nets into the lake. They were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," Jesus said. "I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
And Jesus walked a little further. And seeing James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, he called them. They were in a boat mending their nets.
"Where are they going?" he asked them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, and went after Jesus. Jesus withdrew to a place of solitude.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, he went into the synagogue and began to teach.
People were amazed by his teaching. He taught them as one with authority. He did not speak like the scribes.
At that moment, a man in the assembly shouted. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said:
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the saint of God!
"Enough, be silent!" Jesus said in a firm voice. "Get out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a scream.
All the people were amazed. They asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching! And with authority! Even the demons obey him and submit."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout all the region of Galilee. Jesus saw many people.
Jesus and those with him left the place of worship. As soon as they left, they went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother was lying in bed. She had a fever. The doctors said it was serious.
Safi went to her. God gave her strength and helped her stand up. The fever subsided. Then she started working for them.
So when night fell, after the sun had set, they brought to Jesus all who were sick and those who were possessed by demons.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They were afflicted with various diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a solitary place.
It was still very early dawn and dark. Jesus got up and went outside the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his companions went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted: "Everyone is good to you!"
Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages. I must preach there also. That is why I have come."
And Jesus began to travel throughout all the regions of Galilee. He was preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. He healed a man with a skin disease.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. He knelt down and begged Jesus, saying, "If you want to, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep concern. He reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do it." "Be clean!"
The pure sickness left him alone. He saw it.
Jesus warned him sternly. He gave him a strong warning.
"Don't tell anyone about this," he said. "Go to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded. You will be cleared in the sight of the priest and the people."
But the man went out and began to speak immediately. He spread the news to everyone. So Jesus could no longer enter a city openly. He remained outside in desolate places. But people still came to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
A few days later, Jesus again entered Capernaum, and the people heard that he was in the house.
A great crowd gathered, until there was no more room, not even outside the door. And Jesus was preaching the word of God to them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they couldn't get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and lowered the man down on a mat.
Jesus saw their faith. So he said to the man, "Your sins are forgiven, my child."
There were some religious scholars sitting there. They were thinking,
Why is this guy talking like that? He wants to say something very bad! Only God can forgive sins!
Now Jesus' mind was troubled, and he said to them, "Why do you entertain such thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Get up, take your mat and walk"?
"I want to make you know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who could not walk.
He told me, "Get up. Take your mat and go home."
The man stood up and took his mat. As he began to walk, everyone watched him. Everyone was amazed. They said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus chooses Levi.
Once again Jesus went out beside the Sea of Galilee, and a great crowd followed him. He began to teach them.
As Jesus walked along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
Surely, after this, Jesus was dining at the house of Levi. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were among the many people who followed Jesus.
There were some teachers of the law who were Pharisees. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. And they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this. So he said to them, "Those who are well don't need a doctor, but those who are sick do. I didn't come to call the righteous, but sinners." Jesus was asked about fasting.
John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples were fasting. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "John's disciples are fasting, and the Pharisees' disciples are fasting, but yours are not. Why are they not fasting?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day, they will fast.
People shouldn't sew a piece of new cloth onto old clothes. If they do that, the new patch will stick out from the old one. It will make the tear more noticeable.
People don't pour new wine into old, hard skins. If they do, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new skins." Jesus is Lord of the graph
One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is unlawful to do such things on the Sabbath. Why are your disciples doing this?"
Reply, "Didn't you read what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food."
That was at a time when Abiathar was high priest. David went into the house of God and ate the shewbread, which was lawful to be eaten only by the priests. And
Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.
Healing on Saturday
Again Jesus entered the synagogue, and a man was there with a withered hand.
Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They watched him closely. They wanted to see whether he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus said to the man with the weak and distorted hands, "Stand up before everyone," he said.
And Jesus looked at them and asked, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save life or destroy it?" But they did not answer.
"He glared at them angrily. He was very upset because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, 'Stretch out your hand.' He did, and his hand was restored, completely healed."
And afterward, the Pharisees went out and began to conspire with the Herodians against Jesus, seeking to kill him. The crowds followed Jesus.
Jesus walked with his disciples to the sea of Tiberias. A large crowd from Tiberias followed him.
People heard about all the things Jesus was doing. And large crowds came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, and Idumea. They came from the region across the Jordan River, and from the area of Tyre and Sidon.
Since he had a large crowd with him, Jesus told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him.
Jesus saw many people. That's why those who were sick wanted to approach him and lay their hands on him.
When the people who had evil spirits in them saw him, they fell down before him. And the demons cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell who he was. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up a mountain and called to certain people to come to him, and they came.
He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach.
They were going to have the power to cast out demons.
So Jesus appointed the twelve. And among them was Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter.
There were Jacob, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
These were the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and Jo
Judas Iscariot was one of them too. He was the one who would later hand Jesus over to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebub.
Jesus entered a house. Again a large crowd gathered, so that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about it. They went to get him and handle him. They said, "He has lost his mind."
There were some people who had read the law. They came from Jerusalem. They said, "This man is possessed by Beelzebul! He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons."
Jesus called them together and spoke to them in parables, saying, "How can Satan drive out Satan?"
If a kingdom fights against itself, it will not stand.
If the family is divided, it cannot stand.
