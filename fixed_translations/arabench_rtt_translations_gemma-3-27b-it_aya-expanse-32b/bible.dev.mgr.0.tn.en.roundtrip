Uzziah was the father of Jotham, Jotham was the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were forced to go to Babylon.
After this, the family line continued. Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zechariah was the father of Abijah, Abijah was the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim was the father of Azor.
Azor was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Akhim. Akhim was the father of Eliud.
Eliezer was the father of Eleazar, and Eleazar was the father of Matthan, and Matthan was the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. And there were fourteen generations from David until the carrying away into Babylon. And there were fourteen generations from the carrying away into Babylon until Christ. The birth of Jesus Christ.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Youssef, was a good man. He didn't want to put her in an embarrassing situation in front of people. So he decided to divorce her secretly.
While Joseph was pondering these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
You can give birth to a son. You must name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
All this happened so that what God willed to happen would occur. The Prophet mentioned it.
The virgin will give birth to a son. She will call him Immanuel, which means "God with us."
Joseph got up from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him. He took Mary as his wife.
He had no union with her until she gave birth to a son, and he gave him the name Jesus.
The Visit of the Wise Men to Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the reign of King Herod. After Jesus' birth, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They said, "Where is the child who has been born to be the king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
Once again, Herod summoned all the chief priests of the people and the scribes. He asked them where the Christ was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judea," they answered. "That is what the prophet wrote. He said,"
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times."
Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and asked them carefully when the star had appeared.
He sent them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Search carefully for the child. Do not touch him, but tell me about him as soon as possible. Then I too will go and worship him."
And when the wise men had heard the king, they went their way. The star which they had seen in the east went before them, until it came and stood over where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were very happy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. They returned to their country by another route. Jesus' family flees to Egypt.
Behold, the wise men had departed, when behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the child to destroy him."
Joseph arose and took the child and his mother Mary by night, and departed into Egypt.
They remained there until the death of King Herod, so that the promise spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled. He had said, "I called my son out of Egypt." (Hosea 11:1)
Herod felt that the wise men had deceived him. He became very angry. He gave orders concerning Bethlehem and the surrounding areas. All boys two years old and under were to be killed. This corresponded to the time the wise men had seen the star.
In this way, the word of the prophet Ezekiel was fulfilled. He had said,
"Voices are heard in Ramah, wailing and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more." (Jeremiah 31:15) The return of Jesus' family to Nazareth.
When Herod the ruler died, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead."
So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother Mary, and went to the land of Israel.
When Joseph heard that Archelaus had become king of Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee.
I live in a town called Nazareth. That's how the words spoken by the prophets about Jesus come true. They said, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way of the Lord.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent from your sins! For the kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the one the prophet Isaiah spoke about, who said, "A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothing was made of camel's hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
They went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from all the regions along the Jordan.
Though they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan.
John saw some Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.
Do not think to yourselves, "Abraham is our father." I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
The axe, O woodcutter, is thrown at the roots of the tree. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down. They throw them into the fire.
"I baptize you with water, calling you to repent of your sins. But after me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
"He used a pitchfork to clear the straw from the barn. He gathered his wheat into the granary. But he burned the chaff in a fire that never went out." Yasu deliberately.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him. He said to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you; why do you come to me?"
Jesus replied, "Let it be as it is now. It is right for us to do this to fulfill my Father's holy will." John agreed.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment the sky opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
Jesus is tempted.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, where he was tempted by the devil.
After forty days and forty nights without eating, Jesus felt hungry.
The devil came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the highest point of the temple.
"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you.' And 'On their hands they will bear you up, so that you do not dash your foot against a stone.'" (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered and said to him, "It is also written, 'You shall not test the Lord your God.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
In the end, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"If you kneel and worship me," he said, "I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and ministered to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was imprisoned. When Jesus heard the news, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and made his home in Capernaum by the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
Surely, the word of the prophet Isaiah has been fulfilled, which said,
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the Gentiles live! Land by the Mediterranean Sea! Land beyond the Jordan River!
The people who are now living in darkness will see a great light. They are now living in a land of deep darkness. But a light will shine on them.
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," Jesus said. "I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Then he walked a little further and saw some other disciples. They were James, the sons of Zebedee, and their brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, when Jesus called them.
Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
The Spirit of Jesus was in all Galilee. There he taught in their synagogues, and preached the gospel of the kingdom, and healed all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.
News about him spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all kinds of sick, afflicted with various diseases. Some were in severe pain. Some were possessed by demons. Some were convulsing violently. Others couldn't even move a finger. And Jesus healed them all.
A large crowd followed him. Some people came from Galilee, from the region known as the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan.
Jesus grants blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds, so he went up the mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to explain to them. He said,
Blessed are those whose hearts are humble and contrite. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are those who do not have pride in their hearts. They will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for doing right. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Blessed are those who endure people mocking and hurting them for the sake of God. Blessed are those who bear people speaking all kinds of lies and falsehoods about them for the sake of God.
Rejoice and be glad. Your reward in heaven is great. Likewise, people persecuted the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by people.
You are the light of the world. A city built on a mountain cannot be hidden.
Moreover, people don't light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they place it on a high spot to shed light for everyone in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven. Jesus fulfills the law.
Do not think that I have come to change what is written in the law or the prophets. I have not come to do that. On the contrary, I have come to give full meaning to what is written.
"Truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law. Until everything is accomplished, not the smallest detail of the Law will disappear."
Do not break even the least important of the commandments. And do not teach anyone to break them. If you do, you will be called the least important in the Kingdom of Heaven. Instead, obey and teach these commandments. You will be called important in the Kingdom of Heaven.
This is what we are telling you. You need to be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will surely not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder.
I have heard what was said to the people who lived long ago. They were told, "Do not kill. (Exodus 20:13) Whoever kills will be accountable for it."
But this is what I tell you. Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be judged. Likewise, whoever says to his brother, 'Raca,' will be brought before the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.
"Suppose you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you..."
Leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled with your brother; then come and present your gift.
Let's say someone has a right over you and has filed a lawsuit against you. Resolve the issue quickly. Do it while you're still with them on the way. If you don't do so, they can hand you over to the judge. The judge can hand you over to the officer. And they might throw you in jail.
I'll tell you what's right. You won't leave until you've spent your last penny! Women.
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. (Exodus 20:14)
But I'll explain it to you. Don't be ashamed to ask for help. Everyone does that, and it's good for the soul in the heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. Your eye is only a part of your body. It is better to lose one part than to have your whole body thrown into hell.
If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is only a part of your body. It is better to lose it than to have your whole body go into hell. Divorce.
It says: "When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a divorce certificate." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
Okay, listen to me carefully. Anyone who divorces his wife, drives her to adultery. And anyone who marries a divorced woman, commits adultery. A man has no right to divorce his wife unless she has been unfaithful to him. I swear.
Now, I have heard what was said to your people long ago: "Do not break the covenant you made with God. Keep the vows you made with him."
But this is what I told you. You don't say it like that outside. You don't start with "In the name of God." That's the throne of my Lord.
You shall not worship them by the name of the earth. This is the footstool of God's feet. You shall not worship them by the name of Jerusalem. This is the city of the great King.
And don't swear by your head. You can't make a single hair white or black.
By nature, let your "yes" be "yes" and your "no" be "no". Anything beyond this is from evil. Be kind to people.
They used to say, "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
"Now this is what I say to you: Do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also."
If they put you on trial to take your shirt, let them take your coat as well.
If someone forces you to walk a mile, walk two miles with them.
Give to those who ask of you. Do not refuse those who would borrow from you. Love your enemies.
You shall do what they say, "Love your neighbor (Leviticus 19:18) Hate your enemy."
But this is what I'm telling you. Take your time. Be patient with those who have hurt you.
"Be the children of your Father in heaven. He makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."
If those who love you love you, what reward do you have? Even tax collectors do the same.
If you greet your neighbor warmly, what more can you do for everyone else? Even those who don't obey God do that.
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Giving to those in need.
Beware of doing your good deeds publicly, to be seen by others. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
By the Lord, if you give to those in need, don't boast about it in public. Don't be like those who pretend to be righteous, proclaiming their deeds in the mosques and on the streets, so that people will praise them. Truly, I tell you, that's the full reward you'll receive.
"Give as you have needs, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."
Let your giving be in secret. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Amen.
For God's sake, don't be like those who only show up for worship. They love to stand and pray in temples and on the streets. They want people to see them. What I'm telling you is the truth. They've already received their full reward.
For God's sake, don't miss the prayer. Go into your house, lock the door, and worship your Lord who sees what is unseen. That's how God will grant you your wishes. God sees what you do in secret.
By God, don't keep talking like those who don't fear Him, because they think God hears them by the quantity of their speech.
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need before you ask.
"This is how you perform ablution and pray. 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name.
May my Lord make your kingdom answer, and may what you love come to pass on earth as it does in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who have sinned against us.
Protect us from sinning when faced with trials. Save us from the evil of Satan.
Forgive people when they wrong you. If you forgive, it is God who forgives you.
Therefore, if you do not forgive people their sins, neither will God forgive you your sins. Fasting.
As for fasting, do not make your faces grim like those who show off their piety. They darken their faces to let people know they are fasting. What I am telling you is true. Take their full reward.
"For me, if you've walked, don't eat, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face."
So that people don't know about your fasting. Only God sees you in secret. He will reward you. God sees your secret. Gather treasures for yourself in Paradise.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
On the contrary, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your heart is where your money is.
The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
Therefore if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will either hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be concerned about this.
We tell you, don't worry. Don't worry about your life and what you eat or drink. And don't worry about your body and what you wear. Isn't there more to life than food? Aren't there more important things for the body than clothing?
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
And why do you care about clothes? Look how wildflowers grow. They don't work or make clothes.
Good, you understand what I'm telling you. Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
If my Lord wears wild hemp like this, who will clothe you better than Him? After all, this hemp exists only today. Tomorrow it will be thrown into the fire. Your faith is too small!
Don't worry. Don't say, "What should we eat?" or "What should we drink?" or "What should we wear?"
People without religion run after all these things. Your Father in heaven knows what you need.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Don't worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be just when you judge people.
Don't judge people, so they won't judge you.
You judge yourself by the same standard by which you judge your siblings. You measure yourself with the same measure with which you measure others.
You see a speck of dust in your friend's eye, but you don't notice the log in your own.
How do you tell your friend "Let me get some dust out of your eye" when you've got a piece of wood in your own eye?
Hypocrite! First, remove the plank from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Search, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks receives. And he who seeks finds. And the door is opened to him who knocks.
Let's say your child asks for bread, which one of you would give him a stone?
Or if he asked for a fish, who among you would give him a live one?
Even though you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
In all things, treat people as you would like to be treated. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The great and the small.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to death and hell. Many people walk that road.
The gate is narrow and the way is narrow that leads to life. Few find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
"You know who they really are by what they do. 'Do people pick grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?'"
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You shall know a tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven.
On that day, they will say, "Our Lord! Our Lord! Did we not proclaim Your name? And did we not drive away the devils by Your name? And did we not work miracles by Your name?"
I'll say it clearly, "I don't know you. Stay away from me, you evil-doers!" The wise and foolish builders.
Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
The rain is falling. The water is rising. The winds are blowing and crashing against this house. It will not collapse. It is built on rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
The rain is falling. The water is rising. The winds are blowing and crashing into this house. And it's falling apart with a loud noise.
Jesus went on to say all these things. The people were amazed at his teaching.
Teach like someone with authority. Don't speak like their religious teachers.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus loved to come down from the mountain. A large crowd followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down, and said, "Lord, if you choose to make me clean, you can."
Jesus reached out and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" Immediately the man was cured of his disease.
Jesus said to him, "Tell no one. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." And he went and spread the word to many, so that he could no longer openly enter a town. But he was out in deserted places, and they were coming to him from every quarter.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded for his help.
"Oh my Lord," he said, "my servant is bedridden and cannot move. He is in great pain."
Jesus said, "Let's go heal him."
The leader replied, "My Lord, I do not deserve the honor of your visit to my home. But say the word, and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man in authority. I have soldiers who obey my commands. I say to this one, "Go," and he goes. I say to another, "Come," and he comes. I say to my servant, "Do this," and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such faith."
We tell you that many will come from the east and west. They will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
"As for those who think they belong to the kingdom, they will fall outside, into the darkness. There they will weep and gnash their teeth."
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go! Let it be done for you as you have believed." And at that very hour his servant was healed. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
At night, Jesus brought many people to the demons' dwelling. He drove out the demons with a word. He healed everyone who was sick.
He did it so that the words spoken by the prophet Isaiah would come true. He said, "He took up our pain and bore our diseases." (Isaiah 53:4) Following Jesus comes at a cost.
Jesus saw the crowds around him, so he gave his disciples orders to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then a Pharisee came to him. He said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered and said, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
Tali said to him, "Sir, let me go and bury my father first."
Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into a boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a terrible storm arose on the lake. The waves were beating against the boat. But Jesus was asleep.
The disciples came to help him. They said, "Lord! Save us! We are perishing!"
He answered them, "Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?" And he awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "Who is this man? Even the winds and waves obey him!" Jesus heals two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived at the other side of the lake in the region of the Gadarenes. Two men possessed by demons came out to meet him from the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.
"O Lord, what do You want from us?" they cried. "Have You come to punish us before our time of reckoning?"
Not far away, there was a large herd of pigs eating.
The demons pleaded with Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" So the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.
Those who were guarding the pigs fled. They entered the country and told all this. They told the people what happened to the men whom the demons had controlled.
Then all the people of the city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave them.
Jesus heals a man who couldn't walk.
Jesus entered a boat. He crossed to the other side of the lake and reached his city.
They brought to him a paralytic man lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, "This fellow is blaspheming!"
I know what they're thinking. He said to them, "Is what's in your hearts evil?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven," than to say, "Get up and walk"?
"I tell you, the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat and go home."
The man stood up and walked home.
When the people saw this, they were filled with awe. They praised God, who had given such authority to human beings. Jesus called Matthew.
As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him.
Then Jesus ate in the house of Matthew. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and His disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
Go and learn what this means, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to follow me. Jesus was asked about fasting.
One day, the disciples of John came to Jesus and said, "We and the Pharisees fast often; why don't your disciples fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
People don't sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. The new piece is cut from the old. This helps unclog the sink.
People don't pour new wine into old skins. If they do, the skins will burst. The wine will leak out, and the skins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new skins. That way, they preserve both.
In the midst of Jesus' speech, a synagogue ruler came. He knelt before Jesus and said, "My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, so that she may live again."
Jesus got up and walked with him. The disciples followed him as well.
At that moment, a woman came up to Jesus from behind. She was suffering from a discharge of blood. This had been going on for twelve years. She touched the hem of his garment.
She thought to herself, "All we need to do is touch his belongings. Then we'll be cured."
Jesus turned and saw her. He said to her, "Woman, do not despair," and said, "Your faith has healed you." And immediately, the woman was healed.
When Jesus entered the governor's palace, he saw the musicians playing their flutes there. He also saw the crowds pressing in and the commotion.
He said, "Go away. The girl didn't die. She's sleeping." But they laughed at him.
And the multitude were still outside, when Jesus entered, took her by the hand, and she arose.
News about what Jesus had done spread throughout the whole region. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus was passing by, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They answered, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes. He said, "May it be as you believe."
They could see Tuna again. Issa warned them sternly, "Make sure no one knew about this."
Alright, they spread the news. They talked about it everywhere in the area.
As soon as they left, they brought to Jesus another man possessed by a demon. He was unable to speak.
In order to banish the devil, he began to speak. The crowd was amazed. They said, "We have never seen anything like this in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." Few are the workers.
Jesus went through all the towns and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the good news of the kingdom. And he healed every disease and every infirmity.
Seeing the people, I felt sorry for them. They were broken and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is great, but the workers are few."
"Therefore, ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers into his field to harvest."
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve disciples. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then comes James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
These are Philip and Bartholomew, also Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. Add to them James the son of Alphaeus, and Judas.
The last were Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas was the one who later betrayed Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus appointed these twelve and sent them out with the following instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles, and do not enter any town of the Samaritans."
On the contrary, go to the people of Israel. They are like sheep that have no shepherd.
On your way, preach this message: 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.'
He healed the sick, raised the dead, cleansed those with skin diseases, and cast out demons. Your sisters came freely, give freely.
Do not bring gold, silver, or copper in your belt.
Don't pack extra clothes, shoes, or a walking stick. Let the workers take what they need.
In fact, when you enter a city or a village, look for someone who is willing to host you. Stay in this person's house until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet those who live in it.
If this house welcomes you, give it a blessing of peace. If it doesn't welcome you, don't bless it.
Some people might not receive you well or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave the house or town.
"I'll tell you what's true. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for this town."
"I will make you become like a lamb among wolves. May you be wise as a serpent and innocent as a dove."
Alas! The men are going to hand you over to their local courts. They are going to flog you in their churches.
Go to the kings and rulers for my sake. Testify against them and against those who are not Jews.
Therefore, when they arrest you, don't worry about what to say or how to say it. At that moment, God will give you the right words.
It's not you who speaks. It's your father's spirit that speaks through you.
Brotherhood kills brotherhood to survive. A father hands over his sons. Sons rebel against their father and kill them.
Everyone hates you, they complain to me. But he who endures to the end will be saved.
By the Lord, if people attack you in one place, flee to another. What we are telling you is true. Do not complete the journey through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
A student doesn't talk back to the teacher. And a slave doesn't talk back to his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for the slave to be like his master. If they hear the head of the household called "Beelzebub," what are those who live there waiting for?
So do not fear your enemies. Everything secret will be revealed. Everything hidden will be brought to light.
What is whispered in the dark, must be proclaimed in the daylight. What is murmured in your ear, shout it from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Won't you sell two birds for a single penny? And none of them falls to the ground except by Allah's will.
So that every hair on your head is counted!
Don't be afraid. You are worth more than many birds.
What does he have to talk about in front of people that he knows me? I also talk in front of my Father in heaven that I know Him.
Well, what should I say when someone says in front of people that they don't know me? I say in front of God in heaven that I don't know Him.
I don't think I came to bring peace on Earth. I didn't come to bring peace. I came to bring the sword.
Let's turn the sons against their fathers. And the daughters refuse to obey their mothers. And the daughters-in-law are against their mothers-in-law.
"A man's enemy is his own household." (Micah 7:6)
Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me doesn't deserve me. And anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me doesn't deserve me.
"And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
If anyone finds himself, he loses himself. And if anyone loses himself for my sake, he finds himself.
Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
If one receives a prophet as a prophet, he takes a commission as a prophet's commission. And if one receives a righteous person as a righteous person, he takes a commission as a righteous person's commission.
"If anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who follow me, truly I tell you, they will surely get their reward."
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus continued to teach his twelve disciples. Then he went on to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard about what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They said to Jesus, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?"
Jesus answered and said, "Go back and tell John what you have seen and heard."
The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those with leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.
"Praise be to the one who does not increase his doubt in my Lord."
Then Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
If not, what did you go out to see? Someone wearing fine clothes? No. Those who wear fine clothes are in the palaces of kings.
So what did you go to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, more than a prophet.
It's what is written in the book. It says, " 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.' (Malachi 3:1)"
"What I'm about to tell you is true. No one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born. But the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
From the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been suffering violence, and the violent take it by force.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you're ready to accept it, John is Elias who was supposed to come.
"She who has an ear, let her hear."
"So who do we compare people today to? They're like children sitting in the markets and calling out to people. They say,"
We played the flute for you. Yet you did not dance. We sang you a song of mourning. Yet you did not grieve.
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do. And people said, "He has a demon."
When the children of the world come, they eat and drink just like you. And people say, "He always eats and drinks too much. He's a friend of the lenders and the wastrels." Those who act wisely prove that wisdom is right. Cities do not reject guilt.
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent of their sins. He said:
Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
And what about you, Capernaum? Will you be exalted to heaven? No! You will be brought down to Hades. For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today.
"But I say to you, it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you." "Come to me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Dad. This is what you loved.
Daddy gave me everything. Daddy is the only one who knows his son. And those who know Daddy are his sons, and his sons choose to introduce him to others.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Be my disciples and learn from me. I am meek and free from pride. You will find rest for your souls.
My service is easy, and my burden is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On a Sabbath, Jesus was walking through the fields. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pluck and eat the heads of grain.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! It is not lawful to do this on the Sabbath. Your disciples are doing what is not lawful!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry?"
He returned to his master's house. He and his men ate the sacred bread. Only the lonely are allowed to eat it.
Haven't you read the law? It says that every Sabbath the priests in the temple must work on that day. But they are not considered guilty.
I'll tell you something more important than the structure that's here.
The book says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You do not know what these words mean. If you did, you would not bring charges against the innocent.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
Then Jesus went into their synagogue.
There was a man with a withered and distorted hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
The ruling says that humans are more valuable than sheep! Therefore, the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out. It became completely whole, just like the other hand.
The Pharisees went out and conspired to kill Jesus. Abdullah Al-Mukhtar.
Jesus knew all the plans of the Pharisees. So, he left that place. Many people followed him, and he healed all their sick.
Good, warn them not to say who he is.
This was to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had spoken. He said:
This is my servant. I have chosen him. He is the one I love. I am very pleased with him. I would give my life for him. Proclaim to all nations that everything will be made whole.
He neither argues nor shouts. No one hears his voice in the street.
It doesn't break a crooked branch. It doesn't extinguish a weak flame. It will fix everything.
"Nations will come to him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul.
A man possessed by demons, who was blind and unable to speak, came to Jesus. Jesus healed him. Afterward, the man was able to speak and see.
Everyone was amazed. They said, "Could this be David's son?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons only by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
I know what they are thinking. He told them, "Every kingdom divided against itself falls. And every city or family divided against itself cannot stand."
If the devil drives out the devil, he is fighting against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by what power do your people cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.
Therefore, if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
Or think about this. How do you enter a strong man's house and take what he has simply? You have to tie him up first. After that, you can steal his stuff.
He who is not with me is against me. And he who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them.
That is what I want to tell you. Every sin and every evil word spoken against the Lord will be forgiven. But blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come."
If a tree is good, its fruit is good. If a tree is corrupt, its fruit is corrupt. You can know a tree by its fruit.
O brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak any good? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
A good man speaks good words. These words come from the goodness hidden in his heart. An evil man speaks evil words. These words come from the evil hidden in his heart.
Good, you understand what I'm telling you. On the Day of Judgment, everyone will be accountable for every word they have spoken without restraint.
"In your words, you accuse or you don't accuse." Aya Yunus al-Mu'jiza.
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
"The evil and treacherous people demand a sign! But the only sign they will be given is the sign of Jonah the prophet."
Jonah was in the belly of a great whale for three days and three nights. Something like this will happen to the children of men. They will spend three days and three nights in the grave.
The men of Nineveh will stand at the judgment with this generation. And the Ninevites will stand up against this generation, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit leaves a person? It wanders through dry places, looking for a place to rest, but it doesn't find one.
As you said, "I'll go back to the house I left." When you get to the house, you find it empty. The house has been cleaned and organized.
Then the evil spirit goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself. They enter and make their home there, and the person's condition becomes worse than before. So it will be with this evil generation." - Jesus' mother and brothers
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and your sisters are outside. They want to talk to you."
Jesus answered and said, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus points to his disciples. He says, "Behold, my mother! Behold, my brothers!"
The one who fulfills God's desire in heaven is neither my brother nor my sister nor my mother.
The Farmer's Tale
On the same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered. So he got into a boat. He sat in it. Everyone stood on the shore.
Then he told them many stories and tales. He said, "A farmer went out to sow his seeds."
Sowing seeds in the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them all.
Some seeds fell in a place with rocks and not much soil. The plants grew quickly because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
Other thistles sprang up among the plants. The thorns grew and overshadowed the plants.
And the rest of the seeds fell into good soil. They produced a crop a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.
"She who has an ear, let her hear."
The students came to him. They asked, "Why do you talk to people in parables?"
"You have been given the opportunity to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but it has not been given to those outside."
Those who have this kind of knowledge will be given more. In fact, they will have abundance. But those who don't have this kind of knowledge, even what little they have will be taken from them.
This is why I work with stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
In it, the words of the prophet Isaiah are fulfilled. He said, "You will hear and not understand, you will see and not know what you are seeing."
"The hearts of those people have become callous. They hear with their ears, but do not listen. They see with their eyes, but do not perceive. They understand with their hearts, but do not comprehend. They may return to the Lord, and he will heal them." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see. And blessed are your ears, for they hear.
Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you saw, but they didn't. They wanted to hear what you heard, but they didn't.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message of the kingdom, but they don't understand its meaning. Then comes the devil. He steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed that was sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. These are the people who hear the word and receive it with joy at once.
But they don't have roots. That's why they don't last long. They quickly fall away from religion when troubles or trials come because of the message.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the word, but the worries of life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, and it does not bear fruit.
But others fell on good soil and brought forth fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. These are the ones who hear the word and understand it.
Jesus told the crowds another story. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like a man who sowed good seed in his field."
While everyone was sleeping, the thief came. The thief planted marijuana in the middle of the wheat field and then left.
The wheat started to grow and produce grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
"Sir," his servants said to him, "haven't you sown anything good in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?"
He said, "An enemy has done this." The servants asked, "Shall we go and remove the weeds?"
"No," answered the farmer. "While you're weeding out the grass, you might pull out the wheat with it."
Let the two of them grow together until the time of harvest. Then we will tell the workers what to do. This is what we will say to them: "First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to burn them. Then gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn." Tell them about the mustard and the
Jesus told the crowd another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took the seed and planted it in his field."
This is the smallest seed of all your seeds. But when it grows, it becomes the biggest plant in the garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest on its branches.
Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until it was all leavened."
Jesus spoke all these words to the crowd; he did not say a word that was not a parable.
So, the words spoken by the prophet were fulfilled. He said, "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter hidden things, things kept since the creation of the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the parable of the weeds.
Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
"He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man."
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds represent the people who belong to the devil.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world. And the workers are angels.
Mice will scurry and burn in the fire. That's how it will be on Judgment Day.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers.
To throw them into the blazing oven. There people will weep and gnash their teeth.
That the people of the Lord may shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. He who has ears, let him hear. Tales of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When one found this treasure, he hid it again. He was overjoyed. He went and sold everything he had. And he bought that field.
Now, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found one that was worth a great deal. Now he went and sold everything he had. And he bought this pearl. The parable of the net.
Now, the kingdom of heaven is like a net. It was thrown into the sea and gathered all kinds of fish.
When they pulled in the net, the fishermen gathered on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets. But they threw away the rotten fish.
This is how it will be on the Day of Judgment. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
So they can throw the evil people into the burning furnace. They will cry and gnash their teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure both new and old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus continued to tell these stories. Then he left that place.
He brought his hometown, Nazareth. He started teaching people in their church. They were amazed. They said, "Where did he get this wisdom? Where did he get this power to perform miracles?"
Isn't this the carpenter's son? And isn't his mother's name Mary? And aren't his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Aren't his brothers completely with us? Where did this man come from for all this?
They were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home."
What work had a few miracles going on because they didn't have certainty.
John the Baptist's head is severed.
At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he is able to do these miracles."
Herod seized John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias. She had been the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
King Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, for they regarded John as a prophet.
At Herod's birthday feast, Herodias' daughter danced before Herod and his guests. He was delighted with her.
He swore to her that he would give her everything she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the servant girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. However, he thought about his promise and his guests who were dining with him. So, he told one of his men to bring her something she wanted.
Herod ordered John the Baptist's head to be cut off in prison.
She brought him his head on a platter and gave it to the girl. Then she carried him to her.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed five thousand.
When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he withdrew to a solitary place. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus reached the other side, a large crowd gathered around him. He had compassion on them and healed their sick.
In the evening, the disciples came to him. They said, "He is not here yet." "As the day was coming to an end, he sent the people to go and buy food in the villages."
Jesus answered, "They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat."
"We only have five loaves of bread and two fish," they answered.
"Bring them here to me," he said.
Then Jesus directed the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of the fragments.
The number of men who were crucified was around 5000. Women and children were crucified as well. Jesus walks on water.
Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.
After he drove them away, he went up to the mountains by himself to perform ablution. Night fell and he was alone outdoors.
The boat was far, sailing beautifully on the calm sea. The waves were hitting it strongly because of the wind against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were very afraid. They said, "It's a ghost!" and screamed in fear.
Tuna Isa called out to them, "Everyone, be brave! It's me. Don't be afraid."
"Lord, if it is you," Peter asked, "command me to come to you on the water."
"Come," said Jesus. So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. He cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
When they boarded the boat, the wind died down.
Then those in the boat worshiped Jesus and said, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and landed at Gennesaret.
The men who lived in the house knew Jesus. So they spread the word everywhere in the countryside. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
They spread out their cloaks on the road and anything that touched the edge of his cloak was healed.
What gives people "impurity"?
Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem. They asked,
Why don't your students listen to what the elderly teach them? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered, "Why do you not follow my command? Instead, you prefer to follow your own instructions!"
My father said, "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said, "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus رجال رجال رجال رجال
On the contrary, it allows people to tell their families, "Any help that we offer is a gift dedicated to God."
We don't need to honor our parents with gifts. You nullify God's words to follow your instructions.
Oh, hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said,
"These people honor me with their words, but their hearts are far from me."
"Their worship means nothing to me. They only teach the rules of mere humans." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus gathered the people to him and said, "Listen and understand."
What goes into your mouth does not defile you, but what comes out of your mouth does.
Then the disciples came to him. They asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are plants that my Father in heaven planted, which you have not planted. They will be uprooted."
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Don't you understand yet?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
Alright, the words that come out of the mouth come from the heart. That's what makes one "defiled."
Bad thoughts come from the heart. They include killing, adultery, and other immoral acts. They also include stealing, bearing false witness, and backbiting people.
These are the things that make you "unclean." But if you eat without washing your hands, it doesn't make you "unclean." "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman who lived near Tyre and Sidon came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon and is in great pain."
Jesus said not a word. His disciples came to him. They pleaded with him, "Send her away. Don't let her keep on crying before us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman knelt before him. "Oh my Lord, help me!" she said.
Answer, "It's not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
"Yes, my Lord," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus walked away from that place. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain and sat down.
A large crowd came to him. They brought the blind and those who could not walk. They also brought the crippled, those who could not speak, and many others. They placed them before him, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were able to speak. Those who had disabilities were healed. Those who could not walk were able to walk. The blind could see. So the people praised Allah, the Most High.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion on these people; they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
His disciples answered him, "Where could we get enough bread in this desolate place to feed such a crowd?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and a few small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit on the ground.
The seven took the loaves and the fish and gave thanks. Then they broke them and gave them to the disciples. And the disciples distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Afterwards, the disciples picked up seven baskets of leftovers.
The number of men who ate was 4000. Women and children ate as well.
After Jesus had sent the crowds away, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus is asked for a sign or miracle.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
Answer, "At night you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather is nice. The sky is red.'"
And in the morning you say, "Today the weather will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you do not understand the signs of what is happening now.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And he left them and went away. The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The pupils crossed the street. They forgot to bring bread with them.
"Be careful," Jesus told them. "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students talked about this among themselves. They said, "He must have said that because we didn't bring any bread."
I know what my Lord said. He said, "O you of little faith! Why do you say among yourselves, 'We have no food'?
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets full of fragments you gathered?
Don't you remember the seven loaves for the four thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets full of fragments you gathered?
What do you want to say that you don't understand? I wasn't talking to you about bread. But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not warning them about the leaven of bread, but about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter says that Jesus is the Messiah.
The spirit of Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "What do people say about the Son of Man?"
They answered, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"What about you?" he asked. "Who do you mean by 'I'?"
Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered and said, "Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I tell you: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
"I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you shut on earth will be shut in heaven, and whatever you open on earth will be opened in heaven."
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus speaks about his upcoming death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples what would happen to him. He said to them, "He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised trabalho trabalho trabalho trabalho trabalho trabalho trabalho trabalho
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. "No, Lord!" he said. "This must never happen to you!"
Jesus turned to Peter and said, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus spoke to his disciples. He said to them, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself. He must take up his cross and follow me."
If he wants to preserve his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
What good is it if one gains the whole world and loses their soul? Or who can exchange their soul for anything?
The Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory, with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.
I'll tell you what's true. Some of those standing here will not die before they see the children of the house returning to their kingdom.
The form of Jesus was changed.
Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
Right before their eyes, his form changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes turned white as light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, let us make three booths: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
In the midst of Peter's speech, a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am very pleased. I am truly happy with him. Listen to him!"
When the pupils heard this speech, they were very afraid. They fell face down on the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said, "Arise! Do not be afraid."
When they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus.
They went down the mountain. On the way down, Jesus told them what to do. He said, "Don't tell anyone what you have seen." "Wait until my Son rises from the dead."
The disciples asked him, "Do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus answered, "Yes, it is true. Elijah must come and restore all things."
Let me tell you, Elijah has just come. People don't recognize him. They will do to him whatever they want to do. In the same way, they will make the son of man suffer.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy possessed by a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man came to Jesus, fell on his knees before him.
"Oh my God," he said, "have mercy on my son. He trembles hysterically and suffers greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water."
I brought it to your attention. They couldn't see it.
"You of little faith," Jesus replied, "how long must I stay with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He healed him at that very moment.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private. They asked him, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"
"How little your faith is! Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
"Please"
They went to Galilee. Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men."
They will kill him. On the third day he will be raised to life. Consequently, the disciples were filled with deep sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. There, the tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he does that," they answered. When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Where do the kings of the earth get their revenue? From their own children or from人民人民人民人民人民人民人民人民人民人民人民
"Without people," Peter answered. "So that children won't pay," Jesus told him.
I don't want to upset them. Go to the lake and cast your line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. Inside you'll find the exact coin you need. Take it and pay the tax for both of us.
