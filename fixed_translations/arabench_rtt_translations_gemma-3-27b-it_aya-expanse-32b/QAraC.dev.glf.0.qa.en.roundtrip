If my brother is blind.
He refuses to improve himself and to improve those around him.

No, no, no, no, I don't care what you say.

And you are very hungry.
Are you eating or not?
No, I will eat.
Tell me, has it happened before?
Your husband is too old to accept that.
I'm done with him.
This is our chance, our cars are old and embarrassing.
Try to talk to him, please.
These things are common and ordinary.
Fool! He lacks self-confidence.
Ha, scared?
What really bothers me
Is he in charge of the budget?
What is this project that he is in charge of?
It's a massive government project.
Hidden at the bottom.
I have the right to take the money.
Do you work in another ministry?
Mom, how could you forget!
And a day in the workshop
which means that I will
Consider me in!
It's not fair that I don't get anything out of this.
Won't I get anything?
That means I'm involved too.
We're all supposed to take.
This is a government project.
But your foolish son won't understand.
I'll talk to him.
The good that you reject
This is a government project.
This is your chance.
Just like everyone else.
A feast of luck lies before you.
Take your share.
He had barely a dollar in his pocket.
I heard it myself.
It is known that government projects are...
And its last third is plunder.
His son is healthy.
He went to Souq Waqif.
It cost him one lantern eighteen riyals.
They've budgeted for it.
For one hundred and eighty Qatari Riyals each.
They said we didn't make any mistakes.
You're getting bored of it.
Seek refuge in Allah from the devil.
Yes, but I think he changes his mind.
Inshallah! Oh my God.
He is the president and everything is in his hands.
And most importantly, don't forget about us.
We are your friends.
We have to be together.
A government project like this is an opportunity.
Sure thing! Ali.
We can't do that without you.
Don't worry, Ali!
God willing, everyone is included in the project.
Of course
Yesterday, I was chatting with our friends.
From your side
We are not concerned because you are members of the project committee.
Concerned about Saleh, the project manager.
They say that
Don't worry, Ali!
And tell your companions not to worry.
Oh my God! Abu Fahd?
This is good news.
But, Saud, don't forget!
No, no
Insha'Allah, everything will be alright.
Let Saleh agree to this first.
I'll take care of it.
I was wondering if I would get some benefit.
Is this possible?
Therefore, you are involved in the project as you work with us in the same department.
But most importantly, it should remain a secret between us.
And you found a plate of rice and meat in front of you.
Certainly I will.
Bon appétit! (Literally: "With pleasure and health")
What's wrong with you!
If you keep daydreaming like this,
It's not going to work.
This won't work.
Or questions
We're happy to help.
How are we going to get our share?
Is it logical?
What shall we call it!
Also, we're not the only ones who will take.
Every participant will demand their share.
Why not!
Don't be afraid, Saleh!
We're the ones who will set the budget.
What's the story with the land he bought today?
Is he the one who found it as well?
No one can afford to buy it.
Where did you get this information?
Call me today.
Because my brother's phone was turned off.
I said, "What's the matter?"
Tell your brother.
Another earth
The one next to the land he bought yesterday.
Sale approved
He said, "Please call him to confirm if he wants it, I'll book it for him."
He doesn't want to share the money with us.
What about our money?
We are considered participants with him.
Even if we weren't participants!
You're eating a big bite by yourself.
At least give some to your brother and mother.
I'm not begging you.
We are participants in the project as well, and we have the right to demand our share.
Tell her, tell her.
It's true that when the sultan came and asked for his share, he refused him.
But I didn't agree with him.
You must give him a share of the project.
Phase one.
You are no less than anyone else.
Project Committee Members
I heard him speaking to them.
They are introducing their brothers and friends.
I know that government projects are free for everyone.
We don't want a limited amount of money, that's all.
I'm from the capital.
His brother, the Sultan, can attend committee meetings if he wishes.
It seems that the committee members
Project budget
But we want to
Thank you.
Yes, Father Saleh
Your wife's brother!
You like it.
The project will benefit from it.
Let's remind ourselves.
We divided the task, didn't we?
You, Saleh!
I'll be in charge of the cement, bricks, and concrete.
And leave the rest to me, from water to electricity.
O people!
Take/Determine your share.
I swear,
Sometimes I decide to take an amount of money,
And sometimes I say
Let me take a cut.
No problem, Saleh, no problem.
Take what you want in any way you prefer.
The most important thing,
We, too,
You will be busy this week.
Let each person determine the amount of money they want to receive.
For example,
And after a few days, they change their minds.
And ask for another hundred thousand.
Well, but why is it like this, huh?
What do you think?
I agree.
Even the participants,
Focus on your looting work, ignore him.
There is also the money of orphans.
More budget.
Many people want to eat.
Who does he think he is?
What is this! This is your father's project!
Yes, he is the sultan.
Oh brother! Oh ruler!
Which means he is a participant.
Is it a last name?
Your friend Saud mentions a lot of names.
He continues to add names, saying, "Let's benefit them."
So, in which group do I add it, percentage or amount of money?
No, put it with the beggars.
%pw How much should you allocate to him! Put twenty thousand for him.
Yes, enough.
They even add a note here saying
He is our neighbor.
But, Saud's list is longer than Abdulaziz's list.
All of that will be considered part of the Phase One budget.
Discreetly, no one will notice.
Yes, there's also the list that my mom sent.
She calls every two hours and adds people without asking.
Lol, may God prolong her life.
My love, light of my eyes, my son.
God bless you, %pw is sick and poor.
But the woman has no money.
God bless you, I told you this is the last one.
Tell him it's a liver transplant.
Oh my God, wait, wait... How much is enough?
How enough is liver and residence and hospital!
About one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
How many livers will you transplant?
One, but my sister is expensive.
Yes, God bless you, put her name on the list.
Hussaina, yes yes, Hussaina bint Hilal.
You're giving her your own money!
Reassure him and tell him that I'm not taking anything from phase two.
Yes, one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
Dude! They're going to replace her liver with a new one.
He says, "He adds two thousand. I want to buy gifts for my daughters."
Two thousand
Write for me.
Yes, Husaina bint Hilal
I can embarrass you in front of your friends!
No, Mother.
I have a lot of work.
Later, I'll call you later.
The people who ate from the feast increased.
The infrastructure can handle the load.
Don't forget me.
Write the number you want.
I don't know.
It's up to you.
I am the chairman of the board.
And I say you deserve a million.
They decide that the project will start tomorrow.
And they will give us the installments continuously.
How much! We want to know!
They will give it to us all at once or in installments.
Why does she get more than us?
There's an electric shock or there's looting, it doesn't matter, the important thing is silence, we are waiting for them and they are coming.
He told you to stop talking, so stop talking.
You're not ashamed.
If you hear someone speaking
I'll sew his mouth shut.
You kept us for far too long.
You know this is money, it's not an easy topic.
How much was it before?
Fifty million
It seems you're taking a big bite.
You're the boss after all.
We don't want a headache.
Let's agree on the budget.
Mr. Saleh, through your speech about the project, we noticed that it is a project with high spirits and great importance as well.
And not just for this generation.
Yes yes
The first phase of the project will be launched tomorrow.
We would like to thank you for your presence and congratulations once again.
And I welcome
On this occasion
I am from the United Nations.
Where to? To the project.
Where are we then!
I don't know where we are.
The cup runneth over.
Don't you see that the officials spoke and people clapped for them?
We're at the official opening, what's the matter with you?
Alright, they've talked now, that means we're in the project.
Yes, we are in the project.
And people sweat.
And I don't know what they put inside these divisions.
Leave the box alone.
These divisions are the infrastructure.
The official opening of the International Beaches by %pw.
Third millennium, what's wrong with you?
I honestly don't know.
Yes, praise be to God, old age is a disease.
I wish I knew why they isolated me.
He's parking his car now.
I found this visit strange.
But when you told me
No one told me anything.
I saw it with my own eyes, there's a big farm over there.
Praise be to God, you are comfortable.
You receive checks while relaxing at home.
Why the tiredness, my dear? Don't let anyone trample on your thoughts, Manira.
You should thank your God, Manira, for having brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Saqr.
Don't worry about your share and invest it.
Look at my friend Hessa.
Her brothers don't give her a single riyal from her father's inheritance.
We don't act this way.
This is your legal right.
This is a matter of trust... Don't you trust us!
I don't know.
I am not satisfied with what my brother, Rashid, said.
He constantly reminds me of the check they give me every three months.
But, it's my right.
He always tells me.
You don't trust us.
Financial matters and inheritance issues must be clear.
If you're not happy, my love.
You know what he does to people.
And the mother of Salama is an example for you, O poor lady.
Who could believe she inherited millions?
Because of her brothers.
Money corrupts people.
But work is work, and it's your legal right.
And then what?
And we run the company.
Investment lands, real estate, and money.
No problems, no headache.
She said she was passing by the land, in the desert.
This is enough for her and more.
I fear that her husband, Nasser, is behind this.
What's the problem?
Your sister started *searching*.
This is the problem.
She's planning to get us into trouble.
It was kind of us to give her money.
Calm down, Sager.
We must find a solution to this problem. O Rashid!
In my head.
What is this?
My share of my father's inheritance
The charity they donate to me every three months.
Everything is clear.
No more than forty thousand.
As if they don't invest money.
I see, I see, I see, I see
Clear.
Clear.
They said, "Let's give her more so she'll be happy and stop asking."
Exactly, everything you said is true.
They give me a little at a time.
If you only saw their wives.
She has many different diamond jewelry pieces.
I don't have what they have.
They don't think I deserve my father's inheritance.
If you ask for it,
You're right.
Legal and legitimate right
I feel like they're stealing from me and lying to me.
I'm not comfortable with the way they're behaving.
Life is unpredictable, dear!
They exhaust me, they make me nauseous, my love!
Don't they know there is an accounting and a punishment?
And that God will punish them for taking people's money.
And be careful, don't mention anything about the court to them, my dear!
They will be happy.
Is it because of our large population?
That's why I'm telling you, dear!
Calm down.
Everyone has an apartment that looks like a skyscraper.
I just want my rights.
I want to build a mosque before I die.
And give zakat to the poor.
Mother of the Believers
Lower your voice, dear!
And don't mention anything about the court to them.
Or anything else
You know the reason!
At this time
Her rights are being taken away from her.
You were interrogating the accountant.
Who are you!! to ask him.
Answer them!
Yes, I am... No, no, I'm here for your sister.
The door through which I entered.
Don't frown.
Do you know the door you entered from?
No, no
No sorrow.
Oh, what a pity, Saad.
Manar, don't put yourself in trouble.
If you want your share of the company and properties, we have no objection.
Six hundred thousand
She was content throughout her life.
I'm sure he's her evil husband.
Since she is kind.
As if I were begging them.
It is a valid, certain, and known law.
He tells me it's either six hundred thousand or nothing.
Not fair.
Expect anything, Munira!
My father's company.
Eight buildings.
Without mentioning lands and houses.
He says only six hundred thousand.
By signing a waiver document
No, Ma'am! Manira
Don't be fooled and sign the paper, be careful, I warn you.
It is your right to know everything about the lands, the money, and everything else; it's none of their business.
But the company,
You're a partner.
You've just been fired from the company.
No one can stop me.
What do you know?
Is it your father's company?
Don't you see him shouting?
Let me in, I'm telling you.
Leave it, it's not needed.
He has a paper, I don't know what it is.
He's shouting at us, let him shut his mouth.
We're sorry.
My brother Saad is going to the office and explain to them, they don't know.
Please come in.
Would Mr. Nasser like to have a drink?
Please come in.
Certainly %pw
You're going to get us into trouble.
He will find out how much she has.
He will discover that they owe her four hundred thousand, not forty thousand.
Let's calculate it.
In sixty-nine months,
This is the problem, multiply it by three hundred and sixty.
Eleven million, five hundred thousand, two hundred.
Okay, what's in it?
Let him do what he can.
I'll tell him frankly.
Our money.
All those who inherited did the same thing.
Welcome to your hospitality, don't pay attention to what happened.
Welcome!
Here is the accountant, Samir.
Answer any questions Mr. Nasser may have.
The entire company is under your control.
If you want to come in, please do, don't ask for permission.
Thank you.
Rely on me.
Go get it, take it.
Let him see all the files.
You're supposed to take more than ten million.
They didn't even mention it.
Poor thing, she said.
That her father left.
Four buildings.
I thought they had three lands.
Every land is greater than the other.
"Allah suffices us, and He is the Guardian of all things, O my son!"
It's not fair what they're doing.
Don't leave them alone.
What can I do, Umm Salama?
I have to sue them, there's no other choice.
He will browse through some papers.
The case is adjourned.
Pay attention, my son! O Nasser!
Don't mention anything about the court.
Madam! You are here and the doctor is looking for you.
Rise up, O Mother of Sahlma.
Go to your room.
And all the Muslim patients
He told me.
Sorry, who's speaking?
Oh, I remember you now, yes, yes, I remember you.
Yes yes yes yes
What's up, brother!
No problem, thank you.
Now that he knows we have money, he's going crazy.
You think that this Abdullah whom I sent to them can...
Is he a close friend of Rashid?
He knows him well, for years past.
Can you believe Monira?
Even Abdullah, he gave me some advice.
Chase them and follow them.
Don't leave them alone.
Try to get as much as you can from them.
Do you know what Abdullah is telling me?
Not for people who live seventy or eighty years.
It's designed for people who will live for at least two hundred years.
Umm Salama, may Allah have mercy on her.
"God have mercy on her soul," she said.
Our population has not reached four hundred thousand.
The case may take ten years or more.
Do we have to be mummified to go to court?
This is he.
Yes, dear, are you sitting with them?
Good luck.
By the way, he's an old friend.
Life is short.
And I seek to benefit you.
And you come from a large and well-known family.
And deeply rooted.
Oh Rashid, we are friends!
Please go while I'm still calm.
Or you will be hit.
Go, forget about the topic of friendship.
Are you coming out or what?
Paid one hundred and ninety thousand for a diamond-studded jewelry set from the jewelry gallery.
Where did you get all that money?
They waste money on their wives.
And they deny their sisters their share of their wealth.
Do you still have hope, Nasser!
They fought with you.
When I spoke to him yesterday at the mosque.
Let me do what I told you.
Famous and well-established
"Maybe, why not?"
But, I also suggest.
May God bless this conversation with these bright faces.
O God, enlighten our hearts with that which is good for our worldly life and our hereafter.
You, listen
If you have something to say, except for the matter of my sister's share.
This is true.
It's better for you to go, or you'll get beaten.
I don't care what you say.
I begged you for months, and you refused.
I don't care.
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.
Give it to me.
Hello, hello
Don't listen to her.
She doesn't go to court.
After tomorrow
We'll give you a chance to see what you'll do.
Goodbye
Being kind to them is useless.
And they realized that their reputation was at stake.
We'll see what they decide.
Saud, are you busy tomorrow?
I've decided to take legal action against them.
I asked her to postpone it until tomorrow so that we can go to her tomorrow.
What is this?
You're right.
I asked why.
You want to go to court and sue us.
To get your share of the inheritance
Yes, I did that.
I wish you a beautiful life.
I wish you a full life.
Why, I told you we want to go the day after tomorrow.
Upon arrival, first park your car in the parking lot.
You see the security guards.
Go to the eighth floor.
The judges are on this floor.
Identification cards for all lawyers in the country.
I'm sure you'll need them.
Come here to mock us.
She wants to sue us.
Go to court.
Listen, Munir.
Sign a waiver for us.
Which one is good?
You know the way.
I showed you the way.
Come on, brother.
I forgot to give Mona something important.
This is today's Al Raya newspaper.
There's a very good article.
A woman wrote this, and I assume she's a doctor.
I want you to take a look, as a gift *from me*.
His marital status must be changed.
What a pity.
He has four children, but his house is miserable.
He will certainly be, risking all his wealth.
Invest in this project.
The one I never expected to start a project is Bu Khalid.
Eat, eat, all the sons of the new merchant, Bo and Waeld.
My love, do you want me to give you something to eat?
No, I'm fine.
Get up and move, I'll bring you some fruit.
Oh mother, I want Hamood's toy.
Bon appétit.
My son, Walid, brought some candy for your uncle.
Congratulations on the project, Abu Khalid! You deserve it!
My friends found an excellent accountant for me.
Thank you, thank you, my son.
Father, when we become big merchants, I want to have my own room.
See what he asked for, he has no ambition, my dear son.
Okay, I'll get you a large-sized BlackBerry.
Forget their wishes now.
Just like everyone else.
Instead of our miserable little house
First, let's pay off all our debts, then we'll see.
You look very happy, Abu Khalid.
He eats more than before.
He's a trader, how lucky he is.
All my father's hair.
Blessings to the project.
Leave some for my friends.
God willing, may God bless you.
I met a Japanese person, and I was among them.
While we were sitting, I exchanged seats with him, and he gave me a catalog as a gift.
Later, one of my friends saw him.
He said, "It's an opportunity."
Multi-purpose halls?
Always like this.
They are computer labs.
Click on the cinema.
If you want the field...
This is magic.
They were amazed, they all said yes.
I took a loan from the bank, some from my relatives, and sold my land, praise be to God.
Now that the committee has agreed,
Why didn't you ask for it since the ministry approved it?
Then an email will be sent to the factory.
He will call you when he arrives.
There is thyme tea.
Nothing, I'm still waiting in Ali's office.
And the secretary didn't call, brother.
Be absent for ten days.
It's a matter of luck.
My papers are ready.
The committee approved it.
Why don't you sign it?
Aren't you an authorized page administrator?
Why don't you go to him to get it signed?
I told you he can't.
Not only him, but all the staff there do the same thing.
Appearances can be deceiving sometimes.
You must thank God.
I was there trying to get the signature, and I was anxious.
Are you finished?
How am I supposed to finish this when Abu Fahd never shows up?
What can I do?
After that, I will lose my money.
I want him to sign as soon as possible to get it over with, I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid the manager is asking for you.
Saying I'm sick, anything.
I myself am waiting.
You say that while you were his secretary, what about us?
And give me your mobile phone number.
I'm the secretary, come in, come in, it's not him, what's wrong with you?
Don't call, you scare people, they thought it was the secretary.
No, we're still waiting for Bu Fahad.
%pw, I don't want to fix the toilet.
He is stupid.
O people, wait, wait.
Fully, completely.
He told you to be quiet, enough, shut up.
It was necessary for Bu Fahd to go to the airport.
How did he leave?
Let's see him at the car before he leaves.
What's his problem?
God helps you.
Wait for Bu Fahd.
Don't blame your father, my dear!
But he behaves strangely.
And if he does not receive the goods,
He won't be able to get his money back.
And now she needs it.
Where is he now?
What are you looking for?
Here, in front of you.
You're calling me in the middle of the night.
Brother, I've told you.
I told you.
Out of my hands, my daughter.
I know, Dad, but that's not fair.
The class will start next week at the university.
If I don't enroll, I'll have to wait until the next semester.
Three more months would be a waste of time.
My beloved, I am trying.
Don't you think I should go to the ministry every day?
Wait until Abu Fahd comes, Abu Fahd.
And I'll stay at home.
Don't you understand!
Don't call me during lunchtime.
This is the fourth time you've called me.
Are you stupid?
I know you need the money.
But, it is hoped that Abu Fahd will sign the papers this week.
And they will pay him the first installment.
I don't know what to tell you, my sister.
He woke up in a panic.
He walks and talks to himself all night in his sleep.
If Bu Fahd signs,
God helps him.
Therefore,
Bo Fahd must sign this paper this week.
What's he waiting for?
He comes to work once.
And he traveled for a year.
Farewell to the people's welfare.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, how is this possible?
Are you feeling better now?
Shattering me to pieces.
This unusual fever is dragging me, pulling me.
What does he want?
I heard that I'm going to the ministry.
To process my papers.
He told the staff that he would teach me a lesson.
And the time period is about to end.
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
Buraida's secretary.
I'd like to tell you that
Abu Fahd will come tomorrow, for sure.
As soon as I call you,
You come directly.
Good
You were never that kind of person.
I'm talking to you.
And your eyes on your mobile phone screen
I said that's a shame.
To feel responsible.
Even if you commit yourself
I'll take you back to your department.
Fifteen boxes of printing paper.
Fifteen boxes of paper for printing.
He is compassionate.
The manager is punishing him.
By taking him with us
Have you heard about the factory?
He will lose his money if they don't sign his papers today.
If he goes, the manager knows about it.
Hello, yes, tell me.
What if the manager asks about him?
We'll handle it, just let him go.
Bu Waleed
Go, but I'm expecting a phone call.
Tell me
God helps him.
Wait, people, wait, people, wait.
How am I supposed to know where he's going?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't move.
Don't sit.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't go to work.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Let's go look for him in Uzbekistan.
Room by room
Alley after alley
Please provide
Call the hospital, quickly.
Don't call the hospital.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
I have spent my entire life as a messenger, for many years, and even today.
Oh, how long it is, oh! Bou Sa'id
What were you thinking?
Perhaps about fourteen years.
As a sender
What a headache!
Sweating without air conditioning in the past years.
Do you think riding a bike was ever easy?
With a yellow mark
It was a very difficult time, Abu Abdullah!
Alas, my son!
But what can we do, son of man?
Abu Saad
Alright, sorry guys, the manager has arrived as he said, let's finish our work.
The manager has arrived, sweetie! Let's go.
Congratulations, Abu Saeed.
They said your son Khalid has been hired.
What did I tell you?
I told you, God willing.
Pigeon thief
I told you that when my youngest son graduates, I'll resign.
He graduated and got a job.
Praise be to God, I will finish my work.
You served correctly.
Praise be to God.
Change your mind, man! Bou Said
And you deserve it.
Thank you very much, Abu Abdulaziz!
I am truly grateful, ya Abu Abdulaziz!
O you
We did our duty.
Let them continue their journey.
You're right.
After all this age and work
Everyone is in a state of feverish coming and going.
Take it easy, Abu Abdullah!
After I leave here, my wife called me.
Celebrating my retirement
A coffee pot and some dates, what a wonderful thing.
When will we finish, son?
You're in a hurry because of the trifle, good Lord! Oh, Bou Said.
Don't worry.
The ready-made shopkeeper
I'm coming, for sure, goodbye.
I told you the contraption is ready, waiting for me.
I'll finish all your paperwork now.
This is your chance to introduce him today.
Their manager told me he would travel.
I'm not in the mood.
I don't even want to move.
Send it with someone else.
Now, you are officially free.
Thank you.
Now, you are free to rest.
Many thanks, Abu Abdulaziz, goodbye!
Congratulate me.
No more work.
That means you're free, Father.
Alright, please, Father.
Yes, Human Resources
Thank you, goodbye.
Zohra is throwing a party to celebrate her son's success in the exams.
She brought a cake.
I can't.
I myself sent my father to finish some papers for me.
Sana will be upset.
All right, Mom.
My father quit his job.
God helps him now.
Work hard, let him rest.
Let him rest.
He asked me to cook some knafeh.
I prepared it.
And I waited for him.
Fear God and have mercy on your father.
Your turn now.
He will eat it tomorrow.
He wants to rest.
You tired this old man.
As soon as he returns,
He was tired.
Don't bother me about them (singing).
Don't bother me about them (singing).
I wanted to take these papers to the bank on my way to work.
He said he would punish anyone who was late.
Of course, my love.
Go to your work.
Goodbye to this nose, and those small Chinese eyes.
Bu Sa'id
He sends you to a place every day.
As you wish, Umm Saeed.
You smell.
In my nose
"Snail seller, snail seller"
Why did you go to the central bank?
No, take it to the branch in the market.
And I go there.
Sure? I don't want to go there and be told it's not available.
Well, goodbye.
I got sunburned.
The sun beat down.
I entered my neighbor's house.
The maid introduced herself to me.
She asked me what was wrong.
What compelled you to do that?
No, Mother Saeed, I can't eat khunafrah right now.
Oh mother, where is father?
Back and forth
She told him which bank to go to.
They told him that some papers were missing.
I asked him to take a taxi.
Mom, we had a meeting with the director.
How is my father now, does he feel better?
I slept a little, and the headache is gone now.
I'm telling you upfront.
Leave your father, let him rest.
They are poor, Um Saeed.
They must stick to their tasks, they will be evaluated, what can they do?
As you wish.
%pw Bo Shahin
You could say I retired, but I didn't.
Why?
Before, in the past,
Misery is my fate.
Your children are adults.
I have to help them.
They used to tell me
You're wrong.
Do you think all young people without a father don't finish their personal tasks?
It depends on the job.
In some jobs, they allow you to leave to finish your personal errands.
May God reward you with good.
I'm close to you, the cafe behind you.
Where are you going, Abu Shahin!
I'll finish some paperwork for my son Saeed.
In this ministry, which is next to this cafe.
I'll take him to the land offices.
Goodbye
What's up, Mom? Okay, see you later, goodbye.
This won't help you.
I warn you.
I heard you say that to Saeed.
Your father is sick.
I don't care about you.
If your father doesn't complain
He is silent.
And don't talk about it.
You've tired him out, fear God.
Your very loud screaming woke me up.
Father, you were a government employee and know well what hoarding means.
And they write this first.
And now they are %pw, doing like this.
Tomorrow is the last day for loans at the Development Bank.
No, no, who said that?
Well, my son.
You believed his lies.
He says he has an inventory committee tomorrow.
What's wrong with you!
As you wish, %pw.
Go immediately to finish his work.
Nothing, nothing.
He has been silent since he returned home.
That's what he replies to me.
You have no shame at all.
I don't blame your father for being upset with you.
If you agree to this
Often, and may Allah reward you with good.
He was supposed to call you.
Why is he calling customer service?
You are the most respected among us, Father!
And I am grateful to you.
Please forgive him.
Let me teach him a lesson.
From now on, Dad!
And relax.
Little worm, little worm (singing)
Thank you, ...
Your approval, Father!
May God reward you with good.
We've decided that from now on,
We'll do our own paperwork.
Thank you all so much, may God reward you, praise be to God.
But please, Dad!
Consider him the last one.
But I can't.
Call me now.
Father, I won't go to the meeting. I hate meeting the minister.
The minister will be annoyed with you.
No, no, no, this can't be, you can't upset the minister, you must go, even before him.
I won't go any further, what can I say, I don't want to bother you.
Don't say that.
Your papers are with me, consider it done.
He'll be on his way once you're done with Saeed's papers.
Please, Father.
Consider this the last paper you'll do for me.
Happy to serve you, Father!
But your son is supposed to sign this paper.
You mean I have to give it back to you tomorrow?
I advise you to return it today.
And when they see the papers
You will have to wait for two months.
Don't give it to me to get it signed and I'll come back to you.
No, no, no, it's not necessary.
Just call him and ask him to come, just for two minutes.
I will finish it.
Do you know Saeed?
No, he's on vacation.
And he returned after sunset.
All our friends are there.
Whenever I ask a friend, "Where are you?"
He replied that he was with Saeed.
I'm waiting until the end of work.
Alright, man.
Why did you come to finish your paperwork yourself?
Why didn't you send your children?
Don't you have any children?
Are you alright, sir?
Please, sir, take them.
Thank you very much.
No use.
I will leave you.
And go to the nursing home.
I didn't want to tell them where I was going.
What do you intend to tell them, Bou Said?
I will write something else.
Yes, praise be to God.
He's from yesterday's generation.
She's not my sister exactly.
Why the tiredness?
I told him never to appear on TV or radio.
These conversations about "fighting corruption" got us into trouble.
God guides him to the straight path.
Okay, sister, goodbye, may God bless you.
Did he go to prison?
I was absent.
What can I say to you?
I think he called the program called Miles.
Talk to the man.
Called Khalid Jassem
And tell him to stop being corrupt.
His colleagues heard him.
He started talking about the government.
Even oil and money
I don't know what happened to him.
None of his friends
Those who were encouraging him to do that,
He left it.
May God guide him to the right path.
Sorry, I must go and cook now.
Welcome anytime.
Come, my son.
Sit here.
Stop the corruption, son.
I'm tired and fed up with this.
I've been in the hospital for two days.
You don't deserve this, Mom.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I didn't tell you about this.
What is this, Mom?
And he screamed.
This is an engagement.
God saved you this time.
I warn you.
Don't worry, Mom.
Let's just not talk about it.
Stop corruption.
Why did the manager fire him?
That's unfortunate, after all these years, you're firing me.
You're not listening.
Stop corruption.
Again, please.
Yes Salah
You are a reasonable man.
Those who follow public affairs and criticize.
Well informed
We've just laid off a few people.
And you are one of them.
There's nothing personal.
Well, goodbye.
A good brother
I hope your uncle, Manira's father, didn't find out.
He's already annoyed with you.
Who will define it?
If he asks you
His saying, "I work."
I told you they were going to fire him, didn't I?
I asked his mother, and she said he was still working.
Of course
His mother should say today that
What should we do with him now?
We cannot let our daughter suffer with him.
Whatever you see on the right.
I'll give him two weeks.
But, if he doesn't find a job, I'll take him to court to divorce my daughter.
Drink your coffee.
You only hang out if you have something in mind.
Frankly,
I want to go out.
You are forbidden to go out.
I know you're dying to
The spirit of the café.
To talk nonsense.
Go to your room and sleep.
And tomorrow morning, look for a job.
God willing, I will wake up early.
Oh Mother, I told you, I've gotten rid of that habit.
I swear
Oh mother, frankly, I'm a little bored.
And don't talk nonsense.
Act as if you were deaf.
He has changed.
What's wrong with you, man? Where's your voice? Why aren't you speaking like before?
We want to hear some of your speeches about fighting corruption.
Stop corruption.
Stop corruption.
Is Saleh here?
He must be sleeping.
Did my son make any mistakes?
We just saw him at the café.
What did he say?
Did the right thing.
Because there were a lot of people around him.
Just call him.
Don't waste your time.
If I see you here, I'll cut off your leg.
If it wasn't your fault,
That's why he didn't stop you.
I know you very, very well.
You as a person have just quit smoking.
Whether to speak or not, to stop corruption talks or not.
I warn you.
If I heard you speaking on a radio program.
Either be good, or stop corrupting.
Mr. Saleh, you are a good citizen, you have a very high sense of patriotism.
We can't hire you.
What can I do?
Excuse me.
Hello Saleh, how are you?
I wish you hadn't gone to the trouble of coming. We appreciate it.
Not exactly.
I yearn to hear it every day, stop the corruption.
You are a very brave man, you fear nothing.
Please say it, just once.
God bless you, I do.
Is it a cigarette? Just say stop corrupting, please.
He's begging you, do it for him, just once.
This is wonderful.
Now, my dear
Regarding the job
You are a loyal citizen, and very dear to us.
We wanted to call you to tell you.
He would have exposed you in front of people.
Are you serious?
All said, there are no vacancies.
They really wanted to hire me, but there are no openings.
And now, how will you save money for you and your mother?
And don't forget that
She has four children.
God helps you.
Don't give up.
Don't lose hope.
Never stop.
You must look for a job every day.
So my father won't get angry.
I'll take any kind of job, just for you.
I will never say "Stop corruption" again.
Stop corruption.
You don't know what he's doing these days.
I told you.
But you never listen to me.
God guide you.
I cannot go to the minister and tell him what this man is doing.
The minister will think.
Certainly he will think of it in this way.
You're right.
But, it's dangerous.
We have to do something.
They say he will replace you, know that such a rumor is very effective.
I'm trying to find a way to stop him.
I don't want anyone to feel like I'm supporting this.
I agree with you.
What's on your mind?
The only way to keep him from influencing our interests.
Have you heard about Saleh's anti-corruption initiative?
He lives in my neighborhood.
He will take care of that.
We miss your voice.
No good
I am a big fan of yours.
Salih is a very kind man.
And I hope soon.
He will return, and we will enjoy hearing his voice.
Even Sheikh Fahd himself is asking about you.
Tell me, Saleh.
Why did you resign?
I had some problems, some health and psychological issues.
Frankly speaking,
You are diligent.
I haven't heard from him in a long time.
How wonderful, please be kind.
Just once, do it for me.
I want to hear you talk about that.
Saleh says he agrees.
No, guys, it's really tough.
What's wrong with you?
The man is begging you.
Abdurrahman, I've already resigned.
Didn't you tell us you were looking for a job?
Okay, this is your chance.
Flatter him and let him hear your voice, and go ask him for a job the next day.
He will certainly hurry to you.
I want to help you.
Do you know what?
Forget it, go home.
No, no, no, we don't need your help anymore.
Hold on, my friend, let's discuss the matter.
No, we don't want to.
Okay, okay.
Well, if I had spoken for the last time now, I would resign, but I'll do it one last time.
What does Abu Fahd like to listen to?
What is the problem that concerns him the most? As you know, there are also many problems here, far too many.
What does he prefer to hear? Or does he prefer chaos, I don't know, tell me.
According to the contract.
Use his authority.
Eighty-seven centimetres = Centimetre
He destroyed it.
Don't interrupt me.
Why did the employee do that?
Where is number seven? Seven.
Don't interrupt me.
Number seven, the minister.
Why did the officer do that?
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters.
His brother's car garage
O people, stop corrupting.
Now that you're back, we'd like you to stay in touch with the program.
We're expensive people, I mean, this is the last time.
Because, frankly, I had already resigned.
Mother, didn't you say he resigned and that you prevented him?
Yes, my daughter.
Yes, my daughter.
The man called Stop Corruption spoke about it on the radio.
I didn't listen, but some people told me that.
I'm sure someone from the ministry leaked it.
Get rid of it.
He is free.
Alright, Minister.
Don't worry.
My entire day is dedicated to serving the ministry, may God bless you.
Did you hear him?
I only said that to you.
Ignore me.
He didn't speak to me.
Abdulrahman told me he would hire me.
He didn't speak to me.
You are very poor, Saleh.
I pity you.
I am Bu Fahd's secretary.
And I know the problem.
They used you to achieve their goals.
Unfortunately, they reached him.
Do you know who planned all this?
Your neighbour, Abdul Rahman.
He was responsible for all of that.
Abu Fahd will never hire you.
You will do the same thing to him.
As long as you're known.
No one will hire you.
I want to take you to court tomorrow, for divorce.
I've found a solution.
We are the best community in the world.
Free of any problems
No, we don't do that.
We don't have any problems at all.
We are pleased.
What is nepotism?
Everyone lines up in a queue.
Because that's the way it is here.
He gets more rights than a foreigner.
We don't rely on foreigners.
We don't have that.
Your effort and work make you the best, we don't have any problems.
Or an important officer
And he expelled you.
We don't have this here.
With my best regards
Saleh Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Bahili
Famous for fighting corruption.
I didn't want to eat dinner.
I was running and pulling at my shirt, tearing it.
He's jealous because you're wearing a new shirt.
His father saw him wearing the shirt we had just bought from Villaggio.
He pulled it roughly and jealously, tearing it to pieces.
He is kind-hearted and cannot bear to scold.
I believe
You, oh! I saw my child handsome and felt jealous of him.
It's not in his hands.
Why did you tear Walid's shirt?
"You saw him wearing a new shirt and got jealous, ask your father to buy you one too."
What's your opinion?
Why did you tear Wael's shirt?
I'm telling you.
Don't force your defeat.
Sultan, my brother
Why don't you hit him in the face too and disfigure him?
He's a little child, not your age, shame on you.
Is this a child?
Yes, a child.
He needs people to raise and fix him.
It's not just the left.
Be careful what you say, Sultan!
You think I'm a child, so you can teach me a lesson?
You are arrogant.
Bring up your child with good manners.
And if you cannot do that
I respect him.
I don't want to scold him in front of his wife.
And brothers
If Adol defeats Walid again,
I will punish him.
It's me who's wasting my time arguing with you.
Behave politely.
Let me go and show her.
The ignorant argue.
Where are the past days?
The intentions were clear.
Forgive us
Do you have a larger one than this?
No, no, this is the biggest one.
Leave everything and come now.
Come and see the predicament we're in.
Yes, but darling, tell me what happened?
Brother Ahmed, I'm sorry, I have to go home. There's an urgent matter and I must leave.
Adoul's pants have disappeared.
He is a hateful and bigoted person.
It's... It's the Sultan.
How would a child cut all these clothes?
Enough of God, I did not seek help from them, enough of God.
I'll show him.
Sit down, listen to me.
If you go and talk to him, he won't admit it and will say it was the child.
So, what do we do?
Walid, do you know how to ride a bicycle?
Yes, I know.
Walid, my love
Yes, I'm telling the truth.
But tell me
Where did you put the scissors, my dear?
Under his bed.
They destroyed it, may God curse their lives.
But I'll show him.
I won't be silent.
He is crazy, reckless.
At present
And do not change it.
But the computer is something else, I'll show him.
I won't be silent.
Do you think it's our son Adoul who broke their computer?
Ask him to come, let's see who's behind this.
Don't do it.
Go laugh at someone else, maybe your friends, not me.
I told you it's Advil.
And laugh at someone else, you! Cheetahs, not me.
My darling, please come.
The hearts were good.
And the intentions were clear.
Is there a child?
I don't go to look for friends.
Let them laugh at me, not at me, my God! Sultanou
Do not accuse me falsely.
Hold this pair of scissors.
Act with good manners.
Hello, Abdel Rahman, come quickly, my son!
Come and see your brothers Fahd and Sultan.
They fight every day, son!
I don't know.
At such a meeting,
We must be.
Contemplate our works carefully.
And the works of those before us.
We see,
Let it be a lesson to us.
We must learn from them.
Don't behave like children this way.
As big as a camel.
You have children.
Without prior knowledge
You are their role model, not them.
His role model is his father.
You, O Sultan!
And you, Fahd!
And I am your older brother.
To me
I'll make him pay for the computer.
I shook his hand.
You haven't forgiven each other.
No, I only shook his hand to escape.
From Abdulrahman's never-ending story
Where are you going?
I swear I won't leave him.
Did you make this tea?
Come out, don't hide.
Open the door, if you're a man.
Did I say that Abdurrahman made peace with you?
But, I swear to God, if he doesn't calm down, I'll destroy his room.
Your brother
Crazy
Your brother is crazy.
I'm Uri, hold the tea.
On his head
Be quiet, be quiet, stop oh my God! Children, they have no shame, they are hitting each other.
You're behaving like little children, stop it, son!
I swear to you, I'll show you.
He hit him, he hit him, oh! My son, what a big fool you are.
Blood, mother
You scared me with your screaming.
Oh God
Leave us alone.
What a pity.
Even though I reconciled you both.
I won't leave you.
When he came at night to reconcile them.
He didn't have time, my daughter!
Poor him.
Inshallah
He speaks fluently.
But, girls!
God guide you.
You must calm them down.
Do not provoke them to fight among themselves, oh girls!
What happened? I hope it's nothing bad.
You disappointed me, Abdelrahman!
I wanted to help you, not do the same thing.
You are the wise brother. Oh, my son, may God guide you.
Two consecutive strikes
Stretch out your arm.
You've embarrassed us, may God guide you.
Our neighbor Saeed is laughing at you.
Officer! We've told him repeatedly.
Don't believe him, officer.
They were throwing stones, all three of them.
Excuse me.
Don't do it.
Believe me, officer, I saw them *from my window*.
Did you hear him?
Means very far.
My brother was right when he said that...
I'm sorry, but now that you've signed that your children won't do it again,
Thank you, thank you.
Welcome, my brother, welcome.
Officer, how are you going to release them, I'm sure, believe me.
Listen to me.
I didn't want to say that in front of them.
Abdulrahman, the eldest brother
Is the assistant the ministry's agent?
The middle one is the head of a public body.
Take two Panadol tablets and rest.
Panadol! Officer.
Do you have two Panadol tablets here?
"Hazbunnallah wa ni'ma al-wakil" Translation: "God is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs."
"Hazbunnallah wa ni'ma al-wakil" Translation: "God is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs."
Enough of Allah as an enemy, He has exhausted me.
What is this? What is this percentage?
A child will throw that distance!
This is an adult man's hand, it looks like his father's hand.
Can you believe this?
He seems to be from a distinguished family, kind and polite.
That's because I come from a poor family.
So what?
He follows you.
He never takes his eyes off you.
And your annoyance
And you say that you weren't given the opportunity.
When I passed by, I looked at you, what does this mean?
Coincidence, you think!
You turned your head, and she turned her head, at the same time.
No, but there's definitely something.
I notice when you enter.
She seems genuinely happy.
Go ask her about a pen.
Give her your notebook.
I don't know her name, can you imagine?
Romantic, more than it should be.
Come on, man, it's the 21st century.
You're really desperate.
Frankly speaking
It's been a while since we sat and chatted like this.
No, this is the good news.
From now on, I'll have more time to sit with you.
But you must go and rest now.
Especially after yesterday's outdoor photoshoot in the desert.
We were exhausted, the horses were blown, I told the secretary I didn't want any press or TV interviews, no contracts.
I want to spend some time with my family.
God be with you.
Even when you're busy,
The first thing that came to my mind
I have the owner's number, I will call him today.
Where are you late to?
The villa is now sold, and the buyers moved in a few days ago.
I was busy with series and filming.
Umm Abdul Aziz says they are poor and...
This is what God has decreed for them, we will not interfere.
Good morning, Uncle.
What's wrong with you?
This car, my son, stops every now and then.
It seems to be the battery.
No problem, don't worry, I have a charger and I'll charge it for you.
May God reward you with good.
At any time, Uncle.
Peace be upon you
Walid is right.
Alright, starting tomorrow, I'll start looking for a villa nearby to visit you daily.
What do you want now?
Alright, enough already, man.
Take it.
What is your full name?
Rashed Abdullah
The same name?
I told your father that.
Your mother is right.
I was so happy when I found out that Rashid Abdullah, my favorite actor, is our neighbor.
Everyone loves him.
They say he is kind and humble.
The neighbor comes before the house.
I want to take a picture with him.
So that my colleagues believe me.
I couldn't believe our house was next to the actor Rashid Abdullah's house.
Speak to him, so that he may believe.
What a life.
What we used to see on television.
And we hope to see him.
Our neighbor, praise be to God, has become grateful, thank God!
If they need a sailboat, I have one.
Happy to help you, but come on folks, go easy on me, I'm still not quite used to it all.
You've heard about him.
That was a great kindness from him, may God reward him for his goodness.
Peace be upon you
Is it true that the transfer of some employees to the new branch of the ministry in Dukhan has been confirmed?
They told you who was moving?
I didn't hear the names.
But, what I heard and am sure of
Is Bouali among them?
My name!
But, we don't exactly know who we'll transfer.
I can't go, good luck, it's too far for me, I can't.
Whether you can or not, it's just work, man.
The committee is still studying the matter.
But if they choose you.
Thank you for visiting me, Abu Waleed, please come in.
Thank you, thank you, Bou Ali!
Sorry, the furniture is old.
We are neighbors today.
We're like family.
This is so kind of you, Abu Khalid!
May God reward you, Abu Khalid!
I've heard a lot about your kindness.
May God preserve this love forever.
But, my daughter!
I'm ready to browse the market on your behalf until I find the most beautiful and affordable furniture that suits you.
When? To be honest, our furniture is very old.
We have to change it.
Inshallah
I've told you this before.
If you need anything
Consider me your sister.
I wish I didn't cry for you.
Where did you go, my love?
I forgot to scold her when she called me yesterday.
Not because it tires you.
There's no more left.
I'll call you later, goodbye.
In fact, I was talking to her.
But these people are different from us.
They are rich, we are nothing compared to them.
Don't worry, Mom.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
And I'll give you the green light to propose to her for me.
I told you.
No, Mother, don't worry.
And she will come and ask me to propose to her.
I put the dinner in the living room.
If you want to eat
The driver will take her to the university now, God willing.
Didn't we agree that we're family?
Whose car is this, then?
And soon, God willing.
I called to thank her.
People of goodness, they love charity.
Yes, you're right. Oh! Dad.
Even our relatives don't treat us like that.
Of course! Is my name on the list?
Sure?
What a problem! Why do problems follow us?
I don't know, I'm confused now, after hearing this news, what am I going to do, I don't know.
Come on, come on, come on, let's go now, okay, okay, thank you, may God reward you, may God reward you.
What happened, Ali's son!
The committee met today.
And a list of the names of the people who will be transferred to Dukhan.
My name is listed.
Talk to the manager to get your name removed.
I think it won't be useful, oh my God! Um Ali, I think it won't be useful.
I spoke to him, he said no way.
Famous actor
Keep in mind that your name was never on the list.
May God bless you, thank you very much! Abu Salem
If that bothers you
I want to take a picture with you to show my children.
My children will be happy.
God bless them.
Can I take a picture with you, actor?
Certainly, God bless you.
Please, go ahead.
Certainly, I'm happy to help.
You and those you love.
You told me a couple of days ago.
Oh Mother, be ready.
Ready? Ready for what?
You're crazy, what's wrong with you?
She said, "I have no objection."
Let his mother come.
Go to them.
But, my son!
I don't want them to feel that we are poor people.
You must be modern.
I don't have any elegant dresses.
You put me in a tight spot.
Why are you showing off all these jewels? I've never seen you do this before.
Not me.
Mother of Ali
Umm Ali will give a speech for her son.
She wants some elegant clothes and jewelry.
She wants to show them that they are rich and wealthy people.
(Surprise) God willing
Good luck to her.
Inshallah, is this my wife? She's taller and bluer.
God willing, I'll listen.
You are a queen, God willing, a queen.
You should be ready, too.
They will ask you to meet her father.
I certainly won't go in this dress.
When will I wear my new clothes?
Oh Mother, be careful with her belongings.
It was kind of Wael's mother to give you her things, so use them carefully.
Yes yes
So we have to be like them.
Why didn't his mother go forward to propose to him?
That was for the women.
I have to go and meet the men.
As you can see, God blesses you.
Only the bisht is left, God bless you.
Kind people, they helped me.
They were cooperative, only the bisht remained.
I want to borrow it from you to complete the outfit.
Everyone stands with you.
Oh, come on, Brother Rashid, should I loosen it like this, or hold it tight?
No, look, first.
You must press this button.
I am holding my breath.
The garment (male attire) is loose, but
God bless you.
The left hand should be in...
The right hand is relaxed, like this.
You are holding the lower layer of the bisht.
Wow, wow
What a wonderful thing!
Your steps need to slow down a bit.
Oh my God! %pw, yes.
Now you look like a millionaire.
What they gave you, well, once more.
Put your left hand, like this, your left, this way.
Do you know my friend Aisha?
What's her story?
Do you know what she was telling me today?
She told me, "Because you're my friend, and I don't want us to be apart."
I will ask my brother to propose to you.
Tell your friend not to ask her brother and put him on the spot, and embarrass himself.
I see many suitors are interested in you these days. A few days ago, you told me that Sa'ad wants you for her uncle, and today this one wants you for his brother.
They want to take my lover.
While I just sit and watch.
Don't they know about our relationship?
No, they only know that we are colleagues.
Alright, then.
From tomorrow, they need to know.
Why did Waleed refuse?
I'm screaming.
You reject my son Waleed.
Actors are more sincere than you, two-face!
But you,
You act your whole life.
This doesn't reflect on you.
To serve people
People lied.
Wear costumes in life, in front of everyone.
I wore the bisht while acting on television.
It's either me or you!
You wore accessories, gold, and jewelry.
Play
To get married
What scene?
A man walks in front of his wife.
He wears the ghutra (traditional Arab dress) over the sides of his face.
Do not turn to a dead person, left or right.
He reminds me of your friend, the one you were talking about, who works with you in the same office.
Is he with a girl and a boy?
Why is he walking like that?
As they said,
God helps him, man!
Walk straight ahead, don't stop.
He has no personality at all.
He laughs, he's happy!
Show us the view of the city center.
No, no, no, no, what looks beautiful when you're sitting.
You look better when you're waking up, when you're standing up, get up, get up, get up.
Please, Thursday!
What's up, are you going to Doha?
Come, I want to talk to you.
Where are you going? Stay with us for a while.
His wife annoys him.
Are you satisfied with that!
O Fifth!
I turn it on, and if the presenter is a woman.
I'm changing the channel, I'm afraid you've gotten me into trouble.
I swear I'm at work.
I'm sitting with Salem, my coworker friend.
Talk to her.
She hung up on me, take it, take it.
She ended the call, and now she'll bother me.
Now she says I allowed you to talk to her because there's a woman with us.
Now you can throw me out of the house.
Get out!
You're not the first to get divorced.
No, no, no, I can't, brother!
I don't want to torment my mother in her grave.
He trusted me.
She said, "Do not divorce."
No, no, no, I can't, it's impossible.
Are you trying to find something?
No, no, no, please stay, stay.
You are completely crazy.
Don't drive me crazy.
Tell me, I want to know what's happening.
No, no, no, Mother, don't say that about him.
Above all, Salem is one of the best men in our town.
He's asking you for a divorce.
Even if he asked me for a divorce, would I be stupid to divorce him? This is unbelievable.
Thursday, you've officially gone mad.
Leave me, leave me, please.
I was talking to him, alone.
God guide you.
Poor man, it's so sad.
I want to give him an important message from the minister's office.
To whom do you want to give it, may God guide you.
No, nothing, nothing
Give it to me, I'll take it to him.
Regarding tomorrow's meeting with the women's delegation.
Women's delegation
What's wrong with you! Aren't you going to sleep today?
Hello, Salem
I am your brother, Khamis.
No, I'm speaking to you with genuine awareness.
Oh brother!
Remove my name, so I won't attend.
How can we remove your name?
The only person who can remove your name is the Honorable Minister.
It's a meeting at the ministry.
Official meeting
Who are you talking to?
Hello Hello Hello
Tell me the truth.
Who is the lady you were talking to?
Safety, safety, safe, I swear he was safe.
If you were talking to Salem
Will you speak?
This lying does no good.
Don't lie! Fifth
You're not telling the truth!
You're wearing casual clothes.
She thought I was talking to a woman.
What a miserable life.
God bless you, I wish you would call Salam.
Please, in order to believe.
You were asked to call.
It's none of your business.
Mind your own business, or you'll see something unpleasant.
I will complain to you.
Hello? You, or this one?
How can you bear living with a woman who is so sharp-tongued?
Let's start the meeting now.
Hassan went to call Khamis.
Okay, let's discuss the real estate budget first.
Let's begin.
May he find it.
He was terrified when he saw the ladies.
I searched the entire ministry and you were hiding here.
Let's go, let's go, people are waiting in the conference room.
I can't sit with the ladies.
Goodness! Thursday, how did your wife find out?
I'm afraid to call.
Oh my God, do you want to doubt me? Don't you understand?
If I don't answer her call, how will I get home?
Your wife calls at this hour!
Of course, since your company is large.
This project, which will be implemented by your company for our ministry.
It is one of the largest projects in the history of the ministry.
Oh people! Why is the table shaking?
No, I'm not tall, it's not the table, it's me.
You can answer your call.
Who is this?
Sorry, who do you want to talk to?
This is my phone, %%pw
I'll explain to you, wait, wait.
He fainted because he was afraid to go home.
Her brother came.
Tell him that your wife said not to come home unless you change your job and don't work with ladies.
That's why I sent a letter to the ministry to transfer him from our department.
Exactly, the minister himself told me that he approved it, what more does he want!
What's the story with his wife?
This is madness.
I ask him, "With whom are you speaking?"
I told you he was crazy.
What are you doing? Your wife and kids are coming back tomorrow.
I don't know what to do.
As long as you've done what you want, why fear going home and seeing your children?
She wants official proof.
Alright, give her the papers.
Okay, this is what I did, I sent the paper with her brother.
To see the minister's signature and verify.
God willing, we'll agree. If you agree, I'll be back home tonight, God willing.
Sister, this is the minister's signature.
What else do you want?
Work in the new department will start tomorrow.
Which means an office and a job, unlike the one he used to work in.
Where is this section, may God reward you.
Yes, God bless you, please go ahead, Minister.
Nothing, nothing, that one, on your right.
Yes, pw%, may God bless you.
Please come in, your office is ready.
Saud and Abdulqadir, God willing, a big office, yes.
Goodbye
Why are you asking for a transfer?
The whole department is women.
My wife.
No one can execute another's decision except the minister himself.
You have to work until the minister returns.
Oh brother, make a deal with your colleagues!
And address them by men's names, so that your wife may not know.
And I added two more for the new employee.
The new employee is a male employee.
A few days ago, the minister's office transferred a man to work with us.
Are you serious!
It seems funny, poor guy, a man working among five women, it seems funny.
They say his wife is very jealous of the women around him.
Blind jealousy
Poor thing, he needs it.
But he asked us to be quiet when his wife called, so we complied and didn't speak.
Yes, it's Abdelkader who is with you in the office.
Make sure it fits your size.
My son called, he told me my wife is coming to the office.
What are you doing?
Walk straight ahead, it's the first door on your left.
This is at the social welfare office.
With Khameesoo ***
Those are six employees.
And these are here, I'm sure he came to work.
These lies don't fool me.
My wife is jealous of the women around me.
Because I'm handsome.
May God guide you, O Sultan!
But we want to know how far we've come.
My uncle, I, and Saqr were at the bank yesterday.
for the project
Peace be upon you
Oh brother, I have an important meeting at work today.
Go to the kitchen quickly.
I'm ready and set to go.
In fact, your place is the kitchen.
Women must obey men.
A scorpion sting is painful.
This is important for the rain, look, look.
Look, my uncle.
Aisha, please contact the secretary and ask him to inform the staff.
The meeting has been postponed until tomorrow.
I hope it's not serious.
They keep issuing orders.
And we must execute.
They must realize that you are an important supervisor.
They have a lot of responsibilities and commitments.
They consider women as servants.
I have never seen people who despise women as much as they do.
In what age do they think they live?
They asked me not to go to work today, and to go to the kitchen to make tea instead.
Where are the servants?
And the other one escaped a week ago.
Even the maids couldn't bear their insults.
I understand them.
God be with you.
There are few banknotes.
Tea
Oh uncle, they mean to.
In fact, a villa complex makes no sense without a garden.
Alright then, the park...
Sister, before you go, I want to talk to you about something.
My beloved Fatoum, I have to go, I'm late.
Okay, tell me, what do you have?
Speak or I'll leave.
And run it at school.
A committee from the Ladies' Association attended today.
And the school nominated me to be in the league.
Are you crazy?
And you want to go to the league.
You know if you tell your uncle and brother about this, you won't see any good.
You are to blame.
We warned you.
Why don't you come and see me? It's been a long time since I last saw you.
It's been a year now, a year since I've seen you.
Are you married yet?
Oh God, guide him.
Who would agree to marry my illiterate mother with no certificate?
No, no, no, it doesn't matter if he's my mother, he's a man.
And Khamis is the son of Al-Aqrab.
Its sting is painful (scorpion sting)
He must also marry someone from the same social class.
A scorpion like him.
God helps you.
What can I do, Aisha!
Since the minister is away, all papers are referred to me.
Inform Mustafa, the head of the HR department, that I would like to meet with him tomorrow.
But the ministry's guests arrived today.
You have the schedule.
And now I'm free to talk to you, hello Aisha!
Yes, Mary.
Okay, I'm coming, okay, I'm on my way now.
Oh my God! Aisha
My brothers are the source of all these problems.
I don't know what happened.
No problem, my love. Cold compresses are necessary so your face doesn't swell.
Didn't we warn her not to go and talk to them about it?
I went to them, and they had beaten her.
Do you know if I tell them it's a football?
They had defeated you a long time ago.
Shame on you, you play football!
Next time, we'll break your neck.
Know who you're talking to.
The big scorpion.
That little one
Yes, uncle, I didn't hit Herm. Sultan hit him.
Did you hear this?
I chose economics and political science.
I chose graphics because they are in demand these days.
Architecture!
It's not your turn.
You had your chance.
Do not be greedy.
Alright, scorpion.
Hit her, break her teeth in her mouth.
Let me defeat her.
She is here with me.
Go to the scholarship department.
And cross out architecture.
Take your time.
To make sure
I spoke to Sultan and Saqer.
They don't mind if Monira gets married.
What else do you want?
Yes, our son Khamis deserves all good.
I'll arrange a meeting with them and let you know.
Your nomination to join the delegation.
I appreciate your personal circumstances.
But give yourself a chance to think about it until tomorrow.
Frankly,
They care about you a lot.
And your nomination by the minister.
He is right.
I know my brothers well.
They will never agree.
I'm amazed.
The car loan payment is taken out of my salary.
I support the household.
And she wants me to travel with her too.
Are we getting married this week?
What are you saying?
Foolish Thursday, he doesn't even have a school certificate.
She married and traveled with him.
Done, let's go.
This is shameful.
They will kill her if she refuses.
Oh son, I've told you many times!
Why don't you go?
Tomorrow, I will go tomorrow.
It doesn't matter, what matters is that he's a Scorpion's son.
Appearance doesn't matter.
I don't want to marry Khamis.
And go back to the kitchen.
Put it in the living room.
Madrid vs Barcelona tonight.
I hope Valencia doesn't defeat us.
My sources are reliable.
She is dedicated and hardworking.
What's your opinion on this?
What do you want me to do?
We have to go.
Please proceed to your offices.
Thank you, may God grant you a long life.
Long life
Serve coffee there.
Her Excellency the Ambassador
May God grant her a long life.
Welcome, may God grant you a long life.
Good evening, Your Excellency the Minister.
Yes, may God help you and prolong your life.
Did you wash the coffee cups?
Go pour coffee for Captain Imad.
And also
We will play in China after tomorrow.
Yes, Captain, I forgot to introduce you to my sister, Mary.
I'm going to a formal engagement party.
Are you stupid?
You don't know anything in life, and you want to marry a minister.
Say hello to %pw.
Yes, ma'am.
Pour it out and make a new one.
Actors' conversations
You know, even Mashael called me a few minutes ago.
What can I say to her?
Alas, Noof's role is not suitable for Masha'el.
Noof is a sixteen-year-old girl.
And Mishaal appears to be in her twenties.
Well, why doesn't she take Mary's role?
It suits her better.
Nouf is thirty.
We need to get rid of the overly meticulous person on the committee.
He's a troublemaker, and I'm sure he won't let things go smoothly.
He is precise.
He will talk about art, family values, moral art, content, etc.
Who chose him for this committee?
The minister was the one who formed the committee.
You, me, and Hamad can influence him.
No, no, no, this is impossible.
There's nothing to indicate that it's ours.
Even if he went and asked at the Ministry of Economy,
He won't find our names.
The company was registered in the name of Hamed's wife, God protect her.
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry, in fact, who is the head of the committee?
The last word is mine.
No, no, man, everything is fine, please come in.
I just talked to them and we agreed on everything.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, welcome Rashid, please come in.
As you know, this meeting is specifically to determine whether we will approve the series "Blackmail of Conscience" or not.
And it is produced by the Modern Touch Institute of Arts.
It's a nice, unusual and bold action series.
I agree with Hamad.
The story in the series is very beautiful.
I agree with you.
I liked it when she took the gun and killed her neighbor.
She wanted to hide the gun, so she put it in the car.
And he didn't know he was her son, he was intrigued, and when the police came.
And her son comes from school.
Kick a box.
He kicked it, and it flew into his mother's window.
Here comes the surprise.
This part of the box goes into the mother's room.
It's good that a local company is producing this advanced level of output.
We should encourage and support them.
Mr. Rashid, you didn't share your opinion with us.
You've left me nothing to say.
With all due respect to your opinions and reflections on the series, this is "conscientious extortion."
Exploitation of human values
Disgusting surprises
One and a half people per ring.
The other half is left for the next episode.
This series is written without social awareness.
It does not carry a moral message that helps society progress.
Tears flow, why do you have to make the viewers cry?
Sorry, Rashid.
You gave us your opinion, Ali gave us his, and Mr. Rashid expressed his.
It's clear from the meeting.
That there is an agreement between you and them.
I organized it.
Some people understand, and this is their field, while others have nothing to do with the field.
I oppose that series.
I'm afraid he'll get us into trouble.
Ignore him.
What he can do, he can't do anything.
I'll do what I want.
He gave me the bag and said it was from Ms. Samira.
I don't know what to do.
Impossible! Oh, Nasser!
About the new series we're producing soon.
What makes the driver rape the daughter.
For the many blessings we have received because of him.
The first blessing is the beautiful ring on your hand.
I'll show you the way.
That's why they refer to her as Hamed's wife. Who sent you the ring?
And your husband's role was to cover their backs.
He has a share of five percent of the production.
Nice role.
I just played a similar role, didn't you see "Lost Dreams"?
By the way
It's called "The Extortion" or something like that, I don't remember exactly.
Yes, extorting dreams.
Why are all the names similar?
Last year's TV series were all about girls.
You notice that every series has more than eight or even ten girls.
Your turn is secured.
You are very beloved.
Good luck.
Yes, Omar.
Yeah, okay, okay.
Sorry, my love, I have to go to work. I don't know what's happening there.
Eat and walk.
He said he wanted to meet me about a very important and urgent matter.
I must go.
I heard that Rashid met with the minister.
He spent half an hour with him.
And I told him that you would bother him.
I told you he complained about us to the minister.
What happened was that the minister's office called and wanted to meet me.
And I also fear that the minister will believe him.
I will meet with the minister.
The man came to clarify his viewpoint about the series.
That's all.
This is true, long live you.
But first, Your Excellency, I would like to say that it is unacceptable to speak about your colleague in his absence.
Everyone knows that Rashid is
He envies everyone around him.
He cares only about financial gain.
But that's his specialty.
But, God forbid, not every cultured person can deal with these technical matters.
Special Television Productions
Conscience blackmail, the series we're working on.
Mass production.
We will launch a media initiative at the Gulf Cooperation Council level.
Strong distribution
Of course, this is your field of expertise, and you know more about it than I do.
I promise you a great series.
He will defend our name.
Watch what the journalist Abdelhamid wrote, listen listen.
Also, one of the actors said
The series promotes unethical ideas.
This is limited to the decline of morals.
This is really bold and strong criticism.
They will be in big trouble if the journalist, Abdelhamid, keeps writing about them.
And if the people I accuse of that knew.
But they are smart, and they know how to handle it.
They are a gang.
We need to create our own website.
List all our company's activities.
What's the name of the company again?
From now on, you are the media advisor.
The conscience extortion series supervised by the Mercury Media Production Company is considered one of
A Quantum Leap in Arabic Drama
Because he carries ideas and moral values.
It's a series aimed at developing society.
It's the same journalist who criticized them a few days ago.
Is it possible for him to change his mind to the opposite view?
How can he accept that?
The journalist Abdel Hamid and others like him
Don't worry, Mr. Hamed.
He asked me what I thought of the series, and I told him it would be the best in the Arab world.
I hope so.
I feel like our series is going to be fire.
I don't know where he is.
One is packing his bags and ready to leave.
A lackluster start.
Your stories are always unrealistic, and the events never actually happened.
Love at first sight.
Your writers are foolish.
It can happen.
Your serial number is stupid, stupid.
What do you think?
It's a tragic matter.
Other bad series are no excuse.
I can understand this work from the first time.
These are subtle lines and dimensions, it takes a focused person to notice them.
By the way, it's a political drama.
It's a pity he was seen.
What's wrong with you?
I wasn't this nervous yesterday.
I was at Souq Waqif yesterday with Ali.
We were at a café.
I ignored myself.
Nasser, what do you think about what happened? The minister is upset, this is a big problem.
Within a week, we'll all be fired.
What a failed series, everyone who watched it said it was a failure.
I heard that Rashid is planning to visit him.
And tell him that the series is a failure and there are no exciting events in it.
This is a disaster.
Leave it to me.
Let's see what Nasser will do.
Listen, Eli!
From now on, I don't want any criticism of the series on your page.
Ellie, please.
A few days ago, I saw an article that not only criticized the production but also cursed it.
Don't make me angry.
I'm sorry.
I was on vacation that day.
I will never let them write that.
Frankly, I haven't received any message worthy of praise.
Once again, a great success.
Goodbye
My brother Rashid,
Should I believe you or the newspapers?
Conscience unburdening is the best TV production.
Long live, they have an agreement.
Listen to what the other newspaper wrote.
Do they also have an agreement with the viewers' page?
I almost had a heart attack.
Tell me in a bit.
Good luck, the minister is satisfied.
Frankly, Nasser,
Be ready to watch "The Compulsion Conscience 2".
No, no, no, no, enough, brother!
The series, he said, would not be written again.
He prefers to stay in his miserable job.
A second part, after all this trouble.
And the third and fourth as well.
What's wrong with you? Don't you want to benefit?
One of his friends told me.
Here I am
What can a wizard do?
I wish you further success.
Please share your thoughts on this success.
I thank God for this success.
They are the haters and enemies of our success.
I find this strange.
That this series wins awards while being a failed series.
But they are the experts.
They awarded prizes for it, so they must see what we don't.
Prepare a second part of the series.
Well, long life to you.
A real wizard.
You'll see, "conscience blackmail" will...
I saw you talking to the minister at the beginning of the event.
Do TV festivals lie as well?
I heard him say, "Be ready for part two."
It's the same thing.
They are taken to the bank to be washed and made clean.
All the weak, silly, and immoral series you watch.
He is nominated in Arab and Gulf festivals.
To clean it and award it, so that people consider it of high quality.
Yes, that's right.
As long as the judges are the producers themselves.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, praise be to God for your arrival.
It's true that we signed a contract with them, but they want to lower the prices.
Come to my office.
We are not a small bakery or a bread shop.
We are one of the largest bakery companies in the world.
We won't lower it.
Otherwise, we will terminate the contract.
We already signed a contract yesterday.
With the British company.
A cup of water.
As you wish.
He did a great job.
You will be the first person in the world to produce this product.
He is not only the best bread baker in the world.
I'll tell you.
How can bread be with (sosta)?
You can either open it with your hand or go to the kitchen and look for a knife to cut it, and you might hurt your hand.
So, he baked a zipper bread.
To put the cheese and close it again.
This is not bread, it's a pair of pants.
So, what do you think? In fact, it's a bread bag.
How can we remove that zipper?
If that's the case, one could say to their friend, "I ate two zippers."
Why weren't the Noor Mountains Hospital pastries delivered yesterday?
I know, but why didn't you deliver it yesterday?
The bakers who make it
Again, use the bakers.
This is what happened, sir.
Why are you shouting at him?
You're wasting your time with football and delaying my work.
You know your son loves football.
What's the problem, what's wrong with taking a few employees from the company to have some fun?
You have four hundred employees in the company.
Eleven starting players
Four substitute players, two administrative assistants, that's all, just seventeen.
And the team spokesperson.
Why are you upset with him?
But that's fine for now. Although the fans are the most important players on the field and they are the 12th player.
I'll let you enjoy their company.
We have already signed a contract with the individuals.
When did he first tell you that he wanted to play football?
I'm listening to you.
He did nothing.
No, you're only annoyed because he took some employees to play football in front of him and enjoy themselves.
I said he can't take on many employees.
Even if some of your friends need some staff, you can lend them to him.
Important bakers
Son, why do you take important bakers, this cannot be.
Next time, inform me before hiring any staff.
No, no, let Hamdi handle this paperwork.
He is in the hospital.
Why, didn't they teach you?
I finished work, and as I was getting into my car
Nasser called me.
I went to him.
He said they couldn't find a goalkeeper and they have an important match today.
He said he would find us a goalkeeper, and then we arrived at the stadium.
Wear the goalkeeper's outfit.
I've never played soccer, and I've never touched the ball.
That case
It's futile.
And we'll find you a job instead of wasting your time on football.
Let me explain.
Father, you want me to disband and end the team, right?
Yes, that's correct.
Okay, Dad, please, I beg you.
I can't dismiss the team, tomorrow is the final match.
No, no, no, he's right.
Do you agree?
Congratulations on the win.
Congratulations, Mr. Nasser, on winning the cup.
We wanted to know how you planned to win.
Look, I prepared the team psychologically, physically, and mentally, and the coach worked hard.
At the hotel
Congratulations to everyone, and there will be a celebration, as promised.
Your father looks happy.
I'm afraid it's just a matter of kindness and politeness.
Uncle Abu Nasser, firstly, we would like to congratulate you on the great victory of your team, the International Bakers Team.
For such stunning success
God bless you, no, no, no.
There's no picture without the thobe, wait, wait, just a moment.
No, no
He is wearing a bisht.
Your attention, care, and innovative ideas have played a significant role in this success, without a doubt.
And the coach's plan
But they played with a 5-5-3-2 formation in the final.
And as an athlete, you know that changing the game plan confuses players, yet Baker's team was not confused and performed brilliantly.
And the coach's plan
Ya Bou Nasser, as the first athlete of the International Bakers Team, what do you suggest the players do?
To infinity
Welcome, welcome!
Long life
They are welcome. Is Hamad Sultan with them?
They are welcome to come, but they must have dinner with us first.
Dinner, done!
Thank you, Abu Abdulaziz!
It is considered a contribution to the private sector.
The team is still young.
Don't envy me.
No, who?
Bu Abdulaziz
The motors we use in the factory.
You see.
I've wanted to meet him for a long time.
He introduced me to football, and I mentioned that to him.
I said to him, "Hey! Abu Abdulaziz"
You've never been interested in football your whole life.
What does that have to do with you?
The ball was always close to me, just fifty centimeters between us.
Has Bou Nasser arrived yet?
No, he hasn't arrived yet today.
There is a seminar on football injuries, he is the platinum sponsor, he must be there.
You will see more.
Did you see the building behind the bakery that he wanted to turn into a worker's residence?
Obsessed with football.
As usual, we tend to meet and interview a figure in the sports field.
This man inspires the bakery team with his great ideas.
What about the International Bakery Team? We heard you're undergoing a comprehensive overhaul.
Compared to offices, all efforts.
It's a small amount of money, just one million dollars for all this effort.
No man, be generous.
It's not my mistake, Brother Shahin.
My mistake.
So, what's my mistake?
You told me you needed players for the Gulf countries.
Prices in the Gulf are the highest ever.
Which means if the cost of the player is two thousand.
For the yacht, the cost ranges between three and four million dollars.
I didn't understand, explain it to me.
Receive my fax from here.
And read it to me when you have it with you.
My father bought four new players for the team, in addition to a new batch of four players.
You know, he's amazing. He can easily beat Billy and Ronaldinho.
But eight hundred thousand is written on it.
Yes, that's correct, God bless you, but a Turkish club set this price.
In the UAE, they sell it for one million and two hundred thousand.
Don't look at me.
Alright, can we inspect the goods?
Here it is.
Ankle
Okay, done.
No, no, no, I don't guarantee you.
He is fat, thank God, it's good that he is not skinny.
This is stylish and appropriate for the center.
The intercostal muscle
It's the most important muscle, a player is useless without it.
Thank you.
Tell the driver to take them to the Automatic Club, Automatic, I told you! Automatic.
Why?
Hamdi, let's go.
Congratulations, congratulations
These, God bless you, are small players.
Yes, we bring them from the African jungles.
We feed them and raise them, then release them into the playgrounds.
I'm happy, you can take it. Do you have a place for it or should I carry it in my pickup truck?
When he saw them pressuring us
The forward player was asked to play.
Kakakano makalali dende, la.
Ask the defender to play.
Kagumakakani Lolo is supposed to play.
He is a beginner coach.
Even if it's on Mars.
Spain! Even if it's a coach on Mars.
I like how he runs the game.
This must be on the way to the north.
There are rules to the game.
Even if it's just two days.
What's happening? Why are you shouting?
Your foolish son.
He is not convinced that the coach is not an expert in football.
Listen to her, she talks like Mitsu.
He learned that the offensive player, Ceolu Tekawawa, was a good midfielder, as Ahmed El-Tayeb said.
No one will give you a headache.
Just leave.
I know how to deal with him.
Why did the team lose their home game?
The team is supposed to think about changing the plan.
Since the players are not playing in their positions.
And player Takulamakakolalalu is in the wrong place, he should be moved to his usual position.
Ask the coach to change...
For the Hobaai tribe, it is a low tide.
Okay, okay, okay
No, no, no, no, what's happening at the stadium?
This isn't supposed to happen.
The coach must not do that.
Please postpone these issues until after the game.
People are watching this, it's happening in front of the camera.
Fourth goal for Al-Najah team, the ball entered the penalty area.
He scored the fourth goal and is the man of the match today.
This coach is stubborn.
He says, Uncle Bu Nasser no longer wants you as a coach for his team.
And you, be quiet.
I'm watching the game on TV, and you stay as a reserve player. Do as I ask.
Don't do that, it's not good.
We have a match tomorrow, how are we going to play without a coach?
What is your father doing?
Enough, Rashid!
What's wrong with you? You scared me, tell me what's wrong.
Divorce me, mother, divorce me.
"I divorce you! How is this?"
I don't know, Mother, I don't know.
Why did he divorce you? You were married for less than a month.
I swear to God, mother, I don't know, I don't know.
He divorced you without a reason!
Yes, Mother, yes.
I swear to God, mother, I don't know. Suddenly, he came and told me, "Go to your parents' house."
I asked him why he did that. He said, "You're divorced."
By God, I don't know what's happening?
They were married for only a month. What will people say about us?
I agree with you.
I don't know what to say.
I only know that he divorced her, from you now.
Sit. I'll be back in a minute.
Because of her high morals.
She insulted Barcelona.
Light of my eye, Abdullah.
He came to me crying.
He said she had disrespected Barcelona, a team he holds very dear and respects.
I insulted him and hurt his feelings.
He told me, "Mother, it's an insult to Barcelona," and I said to him, "Divorce her and I'll find you another wife."
I'll tell him that your daughter got divorced because she insulted Barcelona FC.
Just, that's why he divorced her, are you serious?
I don't care.
Is it easy to hurt someone's feelings?
A wife doubts her husband's loyalty.
Unbelievable! What I'm hearing!
We don't need a girl who doesn't respect international differences.
This time, he started mocking Messi.
Problems arise between couples, and we must address them.
Instead of one, there are a thousand girls.
The girls are many and wish to marry him.
Listen to me.
I don't want to listen to anything.
And please don't interfere. This is my son and I know him well.
I told you it's none of your business.
I'm upset with you.
Don't bother yourself, son, and don't think about it.
Instead of one, there are a thousand girls.
Why are you upset!
But when I remember her words
Real Madrid is better than Barcelona.
Alright, my love.
What's wrong with it!
Her name is Mona.
She was married for one month?
If I tell you her story and the reason for her divorce, you won't stop laughing.
To involve you with him, we need your attention.
What's attractive about a person like that, who divorced his wife because of a soccer team?
The hairdresser knows them and told me the whole story. Mom, don't involve me in this, I don't want to get mixed up with someone like that.
Okay, you're listening to hairdresser's nonsense.
Tell them I didn't accept.
Let her talk nonsense and say whatever she wants.
Wealth is coming to her.
I said to her, "Hey! Girl, don't stop your luck."
If it were just her wealth, I wouldn't care at all.
But she will stop her luck and ours with her.
This building
No one can say no to me.
Enough of this bad barber, by God.
They hear a rumor and spread it.
Don't listen to her.
Tell her and let her understand not to close the door of opportunity that's opening for us.
He knows how to convince her.
Are you kidding? Do you believe he divorced his wife because of Barcelona?
Forget all this nonsense and don't be crazy.
Don't miss the opportunity.
And perhaps she is the reason or something wrong with her drove him to divorce her.
Listen up! Girl, don't let go of the two-towered Abu from your hands.
What's this, O Father of Two Towers?
But when they get closer, they discover that they are two towers.
That's why his father was called Shahin Abu Borgin.
Welcome!
Oh my God, no, no, no. Sweet. Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, please. Thank you.
God willing, you will live long, they have taken the money, they signed and spent it.
Happily, you were absent-minded and seemed very busy, that was a month ago.
The first wedding was a month ago, this is a new wedding, he divorced her.
He was married and divorced as well.
Yes, this is his third marriage.
And this is his story, brother, be firm with him!
Oh my God! Man, this is a tough generation.
Opinion and Counter-Opinion
Congratulations, congratulations my daughter!
My daughter, don't forget your coat, I put it on top of the bag.
So you can take it with you on the plane.
Upon your arrival in London
Oh son, aren't you planning to go to London?
Hello, Mother.
Alright, that's good.
So you can come with us and shop as well.
Malaysia, Malaysia.
Malaysia, take the fur with you.
Goodbye, Mother.
What's in it?
I don't know.
I ask her and I don't know what's going on.
Oh my daughter, what's happening?
You did well to ignore her.
She is nothing.
On your honeymoon, you're supposed to be taken care of in every possible way.
Is it logical that she's sitting while you're pouring the water?
The cup is beside you, she doesn't hold it and let you drink.
You didn't have a good upbringing.
You should have told her from the day she was born, I only drink water from my mother's hand.
What's in it?
You look very sad.
And who is this lady with her?
Her name is Mashael.
Oh, her sorrow, she divorced during the honeymoon.
Won't you believe her if I tell you her story?
God bless you, Auntie. Thank you.
Your aunt asked, as well as your aunts.
Yes, but I don't know where my mother booked us?
Hello, Mother.
Where did you book us?
Because she wants to go there with us.
"There is no power or strength except by Allah."
Why did he do that at the airport, and why did he take the kids?
What happened between them?
You ask me, I don't know what happened between them!
Indeed, this is nonsense.
So, where is Manira?
She's in her room talking to this idiot.
Now she says she has been calling him for two days and his phone is switched off.
She just found it now.
We're waiting to see what he has.
How do you know he's annoyed? The boy is coming from outside, tired, and wants to relax.
Every day I tell my mom to peel the apples, but she doesn't do it. She upsets me every day.
And you know I don't like apples with their skin on.
It's she who peels the apples.
Hello, let me tell you.
You are divorced.
And one more if necessary.
Hello! My joy.
Hello! My joy.
Monira, what did he say?
Why are you annoyed too!
Call him three times and tell him you're divorced.
Be quiet, please.
I don't know, mom, who saw me at the disco in Spain and told him.
He has nothing to say.
Well, he has nothing to say.
You will dance twice or three times.
Let him die who divorces my daughter.
How did he divorce you?
Where are you going?
Where are you going? I'm going to vent my anger on this rude man.
She has a tail like a peacock.
Inlaid with gold, rubies, coral, and diamonds.
And the other girls are a toy in your hand and your son's hand.
They have no families and mothers who feel the bad taste in their mouths.
The one you mock.
And divorce her in a lawful manner, if you divorce her.
She didn't help you drink water, she's cursing Barcelona, divorce her and forget about her.
Who went to a nightclub?
Without shame and modesty
A ministry agent, Arab and Muslim.
He cares about his reputation and that of his children.
Stay still and don't move.
You have a bit of humanity.
It belonged to my father.
Who sells land like this?
Abu Sakr took it from Abu by force.
Why did he sell it?
God guides you. If Abu Saqr wants something, can anyone say no to him?
Leave it to God, man.
Please, go ahead.
Let's go, let's go.
What happened to your project, Abu Saad?
As you know.
Well, did you tell me last week that you were going to his office?
I told you, if you want to get your project off the ground, you need to start pushing it.
Abu Sakr, this great millionaire.
"%pw is what he eats? Anyone in this world eats?"
No problem, brother, we'll give him food, let him eat his fill and fill his belly, but the problem is how we can reach him.
And you must know the key to Abu Saqr, so that all the doors will open for you.
I meet him during the Umrah pilgrimage and greet him more than once.
You don't need to know how it works as long as you're going to pay for it and run your business; you just need to know the right time.
When the secretary told me that Abu Sakr was waiting for you for dinner.
I came immediately.
Abu Sakr, may God protect him, has a feast every day.
Oh man, anyone.
He enjoys gatherings and meeting with friends.
It's really nice to stay at this farm overnight.
Yes, Your Honor, this is Abu Nasser, the owner of the car dealership located behind the mall.
He wants to meet you, Your Highness.
I got the license.
Like my son who got his license.
Thank you, may God bless you.
Congratulations on your license, Sager.
God bless you.
Abu Sakr
I asked you not to disappoint me, say yes.
Just say yes, Your Honor.
As a gift for him.
And please, don't say no.
My work is going well.
That means you met him and talked to him easily.
Don't be stupid.
Yes, that's it, Abu Nasser.
Tell me the method, what did you do?
Circumstances helped me.
When we were sitting with him.
His son just got his license.
I have a small gift.
If it's about the car,
This is easy.
Come on, come on, take me to him.
Yes, it happened.
I just left the hospital.
He had his tonsils removed.
And he will certainly hold a feast.
Your son deserves health, Sharaf!
We hope he will get better, we hope he will get better if God wills, he will not see any harm if God wills.
And we met each other at the rosary shop.
I think so.
Man, we're starting to forget and grow old.
They told me your son Shahin was in the next room and has already left.
So, I thought I should visit you.
And I congratulate you on Shahin's health.
Listen, Your Highness, you must not go without dining with us.
I'm not in the mood for it.
Say yes or no.
Due to our dear son Shahin's discharge from the hospital,
In my Corniche Tower.
Just say yes.
My son, do not be stubborn.
Mom, don't try, I don't like business and I have no interest in it.
Who can start a business today without capital?
At the vehicle and crane agency, he said, let him just point.
Love is from God, and people love you because of your father's love.
Until university,
All the doctors love and respect your father.
Most of them are in his council every night.
What God wills, everyone loves your father, but you are evil to him.
My son, people take loans from banks to establish a company or a project.
Am I sitting in the supermarket?
Did you open a pickle shop?
This is also something new.
This is Sakr, the apple of my eye. He brought them to me yesterday and said, "These are samples. Try them."
He only took over their agency yesterday.
You see.
As he told me that all businessmen like me, may God make him love you all.
Yes, Your Honor.
On my way to the office,
I saw a new supermarket.
They were preparing it.
Frankly, I like it.
I don't know who owns it.
Congratulations, congratulations Uncle Sagar, congratulations!
God bless you.
In the name of God, In the name of God
Who is he to come as a partner and take it so easily (idiomatic expression).
You, you can now say no.
So, what's up?
What do I need to say?
Be her partner.
Do you know who his father is?
Who doesn't know his father!
I said I was a friend of Qasim Abbas, he asked me if I had business experience.
I said, "I have a bakery, thank God I earn my livelihood from it."
No, no, I don't like the name.
I didn't notice it.
No, my brother, the name is not beautiful.
So, this is a suitable name for Iranian bread.
Alright, great bread.
Qasim, we'll call it the Big Bread Bakery.
Wait for me a bit.
Peace be upon you.
Peace and blessings be upon you, Your Highness.
Excellent, excellent. Do you need anything or any assistance?
No, thank God, everything is fine.
Ayad, she's a new employee here!
Your Honor, I only sent her car for repairs, and then she came to take my car because she is an advertising agent in a marketing company and cannot do anything without a car.
Your car might need it too.
No, no, I don't need the car today.
Alright, no problem.
This is the age of science, knowledge, and study.
I agree with Dr. Rashid, everyone should have sufficient knowledge in their field, whatever that field may be.
Excellent, Dr. Sami!
Yes, Your Honor.
Study and study.
You're repeating what's in the books.
He didn't study either business or economics.
He has never read a book in his entire life, not even a newspaper. I have never seen him holding any paper in his hands throughout his life.
You all know who the sacrifice is today.
I didn't want to get into this business and %pw, but
Uncle Abu Nasser, he is still alive here before you.
Who loves him.
But there are people who were born to work and naturally love working.
You're right, Doctor!
Oh my God! Oh Shahin, I wish you were like your brother.
God is generous, God willing.
It's still early.
This depends on education.
No one is like you, Doctor!
Frankly.
How did Falcon, who despises trade, easily attain such great economic understanding?
If they count a hundred billionaires in the world today, they'll count them among them.
You know, boy! Abu Sakr?
They chose Socr for market horsemanship.
Peace be upon you.
How are you, Nasser!
Mohammed called me and told me that Abu Nasser is in the hospital.
Do you remember when you once told me that you heard Falcon, son of Hawk, wants to take over the car dealership from his father?
You no longer have the agency.
People are never satisfied.
His father helped him enter the market.
He opened his eyes to commerce.
Frankly, the doctor said his condition was critical.
This won't work.
Nothing will succeed.
Shocked or not, it's none of my business, I'm telling you, you'll divorce her, divorce her and you will.
Such a people exists in the 21st century.
We meet with our dear viewers with one of the good and giving men in this country.
A man who knows the way to the poor and deprived.
So, we have the founder and owner of the Sakr Charity Association.
Of course, if we speak about this organization, Your Honor,
We all know your noble goals that you strive to offer to the world and, of course, to everyone.
Without hypocrisy or a desire for fame, God forbid.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, we were recently able to deliver thirty sacrifices to our brothers in Africa.
And now, praise be to God, we are ready to deliver.
Seven boxes of sweets for our children in Gaza.
God willing, my lord, may God grant you many lovers.
My wife and I just left home.
But my wife will be passing by for half an hour to inaugurate her new project.
And I will wait for her.
It's okay.
Frankly, I love their atmosphere and I enjoy sitting with them. I have a lot of fun with them.
And the source of income for my children is.
He is my whole life.
I think you want to waste my time.
Stay away from trouble.
All bread is hot, hot bread.
Come on, people!
Such a people exists in the 21st century.
Such a people exists in the 21st century.
If one wants to dive, diving requires effort.
He needs brave men.
Souq Waqif District.
You deserve it, you deserve it, congratulations, congratulations.
God bless you all.
Praise be to God, everyone loves you, oh Shahin! Love is from God.
I want to say something, but I wish you'd tell me what.
On the occasion of the license, my son Shahin must go to the showroom and choose the best and most expensive car as a gift from me to him.
A breeze blew upon us from the valley's cleft.
O breeze, for love's sake, take me to my home.
Hello Fadi.
How are you, Anood?
No, no, no, no, no.
You told me the dress would be ready in a week, and yesterday you texted me saying it would be ready in ten days. How stupid!
And you want your dress with crystals, which takes longer.
And if God wills, you will start talking to Al-Anoud and ignore me?
How many lights do we have?
No, no, no, no, no, let the whole world be angry, but Anond will not be angry.
What else do you want, Fadi? They're starting to get jealous.
Oh my God, I love the way they speak, I'm jealous of them compared to our people.
Don't forget about me.
Is my dress ready?
Here you go, Fadi.
Thank you, my brother Fadi.
Brother Fadi, I'll stop by next week to pick up the dress, okay. Goodbye.
How can I assist you?
Send the dress to my home.
No, I didn't like it.
I went to Fadi's shop today, he's doing excellent work and the girls are coming and going.
Praise be to God, we have succeeded greatly in this project.
What's up?
Abu Nasser, my cousin.
What's up?
Look at the jealousy!
We never heard of him starting a project, so where would this bankrupt get the money from?
With mouths agape, they plunder!
And when he starts his work,
Are you sure?
I heard some rumors.
And if God wills, you won't do anything?
It's 7 a.m.
Do you want them to bring you breakfast?
No, thank you, I've already had breakfast.
I just want to talk to you about something.
I heard that you,
You want to start a business.
I don't know anything about these things, God guide you, my cousin!
Design, fashion design for women, something like that?
Who lied to you?
I am a businessman!
No, no, no, no, no, no, but, I.
You need advice, you need %pw I'm available if you need any help.
Thank you, thank you! Thank you, cousin.
Sorry, I must go.
Go ahead, Chief!
The first time you tell me if you need a raise.
So, Fadi! Clean the shop, don't I see you busy?
The shop is no longer sufficient.
You said you would rent the shop next door, trust in God and take it.
I wish.
Did they rent the shop next door?
Is there anyone named Khalaf Sultan Al-Seifi other than your cousin Abu Nasser?
No, what's up?
I'm from the Ministry of Economy. I saw his name on a transaction at my friend's place. His name is Esam and he's in charge of his papers.
Women's fashion design
Sure?
I saw the lease and his name was written on it.
What's in it, what's in it, what's in it.
What's wrong, what's wrong, what's wrong, there's a fault in it.
Your sick heart didn't stop you.
When I saw that my project was successful,
You said I must destroy it.
This is an open market for everyone.
%pw Abu Nasser.
Is he a shepherd? What does he say?
And I was testing you, did I tell you whether you intend to open a business?
I didn't lie to you, man.
Secrecy is the best policy.
I don't care about you or your demands.
But this doesn't lead you.
Man, this is fate, and everyone gets their fate.
You defeated me.
Come on, you're cousins.
No, no, no, Abu Saleh crossed the border.
You hit me in my own home!
Open to everyone!
You are brothers.
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
Bring in a Lebanese designer.
I am a lady, ask me.
I know our women, they love Lebanese men.
Oh my God! Madam, this looks amazing on you, no, no, no, this, this is unparalleled in all of Doha.
What a choice that suits you, madam, and from these beautiful words and the piece that is worth a thousand they sell it for thirty and forty thousand.
Yeah, act just like him.
As you know, the cabinet I made last year when I brought the Lebanese carpenter.
My lady! I will design for you a wardrobe unparalleled in all of Doha.
See, if you want to succeed
What's exactly his problem?
Why don't you know?
That means he stole from the clients.
Why don't you move to another place, boss!
Don't remember, don't remember, Fadi!
By this time, they will be playing by themselves.
It means we were defeated, no!
We must confront them!
And to regain our customers, whether they like it or not.
Do you have money to pay?
I'm paying.
I'm ready to do anything.
But most importantly, he won't defeat me.
This dress you chose is worth sixty thousand riyals.
Of course, without ties in the middle.
This is a gift from the designer, mine.
I placed a crystal on it for you. There are only fifty pieces of this crystal in the entire world, and this piece is very unique.
Of course there is no discount, our prices are world-famous.
No, of course not, who would do that?
Madam, wait, wait, what's the matter? What happened?
Leave us alone, Saad, leave us alone.
Is this something they do?
They killed us; we have no customers left.
This is called war, Abu Nasser!
We won't stand idly by!
We must fight them as they fight us and repay them in kind.
Tomorrow I'll take a loan from the bank.
And I will start a war against them, and you will see what I will do.
Abu Nasser won't stop this.
Check the ad!
Check the ad he's posting!
We offer two free evening dresses with every wedding dress.
He made four evening dresses with each wedding dress.
We publish a quarter-page ad.
See, place a half-page ad.
I don't know what he intended to do!
Believe me, Mother of Nasser.
No customer had entered their shop for six days.
No, and this afternoon they didn't open, they closed.
And you will hear that he put his shop up for sale.
I will kill him, I will kill him.
Even they can't sit there, sit outside.
Alright, drink your tea and go to him.
What tea calms you? I can't drink it, that's a problem.
Is there anyone who opposes you?
Someone, God guide them, intentionally sprayed this scent in the store.
And those are chemicals.
Are you sure someone sprayed a scent in the store?
You are cousins, you are adults and not children to fight like this.
He came at night and sprayed a foul smell in the shop, is that fair?
I didn't spray anything, it's your perfume.
Do not exceed the limit.
I signed an undertaking at the police station.
Don't worry.
This time,
I've prepared a hell of a plane for him.
Without anyone blaming me.
No, everything is fine.
This is what confuses me.
I swear to God, I don't know what's going on. This is the fourth day that only one customer has come into our store.
Oh my God, this isn't the shop, we have to go to the other shop, I've uncovered my face, may God guide you.
What did the doctor say to you?
The shop is empty and no customers enter the shop.
I don't know, it's like they put a spell on him.
Women and girls do not approach the store.
As if some magic had turned Saad into a beast.
Possible, anything is possible these days.
There is magic, and it is evil.
Okay, is he asleep or awake?
Go see him, brother! Go, I'm afraid the roof might collapse.
Alas! Sultan, you're lost.
I don't know, turn it into a dog!
Turn him into a monster!
Calm down, brother. Don't get upset.
I don't know what he did.
My love, tell me what you did to him. They say his friends have started collecting money and paying off his debts.
Its designer
Not Lebanese.
I told him, Did you tell him?
Don't you know where he is?
Stars are stars, and we desperately seek those additions.
Call him again, he might have an emergency.
What's wrong with you, what's wrong with you, Uncle Ahmed!
What's wrong with you, Ahmed! You're just sitting here while the director is shouting at me! What should I do? Where are the props you said you'd bring today?
It's better for you to leave me alone, I've called him and got a headache, even ask Mr. Abdullah.
First, don't shout, we're actors and we want to stay calm, we need to focus on our roles. Second, the man called more than once in front of me, just relax.
What are you saying, Mr. Abdullah, what are you saying?
Oh my God! Oh Mr. Abdullah, what should I do now? The director will end the scene and scream at me.
Alright, everyone! Alright, everyone!
We want to wrap up, but the extras who are supposed to be in this scene haven't arrived yet.
You don't want anyone to yell at you, right?
Do your work quietly and without shouting.
This is our situation, always screaming, since morning. We need to focus.
I've found a solution for you.
What do you think about managing yourself with a scene, and if God wills, I will bring you an actor who can do the role well?
It's true that he'll act in just one scene.
But this scene is the most important scene in the series.
But please, sir, go and shoot now, please.
But if you're not ready today, I'll resign.
Come on, let's go up the stairs.
I'm telling you something, in Filipino, is that okay?
You don't know Abu Walid, he'll resign immediately. He needs someone who appears to be elite, he must be elite and Qatari.
Dude! He'll wear a gutra and agal, no one will notice.
Are you serious, Alaa? You just want the easy way out. This is art that respects people's feelings and intellect.
Alaa gave you all the responsibilities, distributed the tasks, and you'll be comfortable.
Calm down, so we can think. Think with me, Reem, you might remember someone from your friends.
Who is he?
Ahmad, do you remember someone in the Power neighborhood named Saud al-Usraj?
Same as Saudi juniper.
Saudi cans!
The director said he needed a wealthy man of standing, and you say cans.
Dear, at the end of the day he's a supporting actor, you're bringing in a wealthy and imposing man for a bit part.
But with a little makeup, Rim looks like a different person, wearing a suit, a clean shirt, and driving a luxurious car.
I hope it's suitable.
How can we communicate with him?
I know their house.
Peace be upon you.
Happy Thanksgiving?
So, who is he?
Yes, yes, yes, that's it, that's it.
Yes, that's it. Thank you very much.
And now how is this going to work, Mother? There's no other fodder besides this alfalfa that Uncle brought from abroad.
Son, you have only what you are wearing.
My son, here it is inside the closet under my clothes.
Mom, people are waiting outside, what should I iron?
God help you, son!
This means I'll see you today and you'll be on TV.
Yes, Mom, they told me I'd be on TV as one of the elite.
Sit down, you bad boy!
Oh man. What's this? Spit on you.
Spray, spray.
Here it is, Mother.
Quickly, Mother, are you feeling better?
God willing, my son!
God forbid, may Allah give you some money.
God helps you.
Pray for me.
I'm bringing you Saudi cans, a Saudi laptop.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Is this Abboud, Fatima's son, Abboud?
Hello, hello.
Hello, Saud?
Performing the scene?
Oh, I hope he does the job well, calms down and shuts up, so they give you a complex role.
Tell me how your mother is doing.
She is not the same person who used to collect the tithe before.
Shame on you, shame on you, be quiet.
You are now wearing glasses.
You are an old man now.
You don't change, I'll regret nominating you.
The actors who played the role of Abu Abdulaziz.
He's here, they brought him, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Do your best, this is our manager, Mr. Ghafle Fazl.
The most important thing is not to be afraid of the camera.
Oh brother, I only fear God.
Don't worry, stay calm, listen to his instructions, and say yes to anything the director says.
Oh brother! Oh brother! Please, you'll play the role of one of the elite, one of the rich, got it or not?
Come here, boy! Come here, boy!
I'm talking to you.
He is too superficial, the role needs a sensible person.
Everything is acceptable from certain people.
Ask me why I speak this way.
Brother, we bought this for the shoot. Listen, I'll take you to the makeup room now and I'll coach you on the role.
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you.
Come here, please.
Introduce me to her.
Stop, stop, stop here here!
Praise be to God that you're here, come in, come in.
Boss, the car you need for the scene is ready.
Saoud, he will clean everything, he will fix it.
Let's run it again, and the assistant director is here to watch and assure the director.
Imagine yourself as a famous merchant.
You say this?
Yes, yes, I'm telling you, wait, wait, don't rush. I didn't expect this from you, boy! Abu Abdulaziz, say you're Abu Abdulaziz.
For our rights.
Beautiful, and you should know!
Let him clean my teeth, brother!
Abu Abdulaziz Falah Al-Marzook, Latif, will clean and complete the full name.
Sweet, go ahead, go ahead and think about it.
Consider your daughter a divorce.
Don't bother thinking about why she got divorced.
Your daughter is divorced, is she pretty? Is she pretty?
She's enchanting, rate yourself, we don't get married.
Why don't I spit on him?
Great, you're amazing and he remembers everything, amazing.
Let %pw clean my teeth.
How? Why?
Oh my God! Man, the homeowners surprised us and they need the hall, so the director decided to finish the hall scenes and shoot the exteriors later.
How is this? They don't want %PW!
Yes, they want to, they want to, but it's been postponed for later. They will film another scene, and we'll be right behind them, God willing.
Should I tell them to bring you some tea?
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you.
Good morning, Your Honor.
Hello, which tribe do you belong to, boy!
My name is Judge Salem Abu Shwe Shwe.
The Shawi are famous.
You deserve it.
He amuses me, my nose is big and also lips can be here.
Tell me, brother, about people with a high nose nowadays,
I take responsibility for myself.
If it were someone else, they wouldn't stop laughing.
Hold this for a minute.
Hello, Mother.
My mother is very sick, I must go quickly, oh my God! Oh brother!
You'll go with that clothing.
I don't have time, I told you my mother is sick, she is very sick and he says so!
Listen, you can do that, but when I call you, you need to come right away.
He and I, we can't leave the site.
Okay, okay, I'll try to find a taxi. Brother!
Which taxi? If you try to look for a taxi for a year, you won't find one.
Do you know we rented the car for the scene?
Since it's stopped, take it.
Oh my God! Brother, please give me the key. Mom is sick, give me the key, give it to me.
In the car.
I need a wheelchair.
Hold on, hold on, I'll get a wheelchair now, right now! Oh, sir.
I can tell you something, can I tell you something?
My mother is very sick in the car and I need a wheelchair, please.
Where is the patient? Inside the car?
My son, what happened?
Be quiet and don't speak, just look and remain silent.
Peace be upon you.
Nothing, just my mom, your grandmother, she has asthma, quickly.
I'll tell them to make the bed.
Okay, okay.
Don't bother.
Enough, for God's sake, what have you done?
All right, Rashid.
Take care of our son Rashid.
As you wish, come with me, Mr. Rashid.
Come with me, Mr. Rashid.
And I will take Mr. Rashid and do what is necessary for him.
This is expected of you.
I'll tell the nurse to come and see what His Highness would like to drink.
Come with me, Mr. Rashid!
Excuse me.
What should I do, there are so many people, just wait!
The problem is that no one cares about us.
Sir, what would you like to drink, tea, coffee, or cappuccino?
You're not the first, Nasser, the hospital security guard, to marry a Filipino.
Who told you I was rejected?
Not a single woman gives me any attention.
They philosophize and demand.
He doesn't have a certificate, I don't want your mother, what is this, I don't want your mother! Go find your friends.
Oh brother! There's a girl in the hospital, I like her.
If she ignores you, look for someone else.
Oh, brother! My heart is broken.
Your brother has fallen in love, would you believe it, when I see her.
Take this to Dr. Mohammed.
What's wrong with you!
Go now.
God damn you.
Your Highness, our aunt is now in perfect health.
You are a professional actor, Saud! Next, young men!
Well done, see how they applauded you and praised you.
Now, go change your clothes and remove your makeup.
Come on, man, forget about it. Come and sigh for me here first.
Yes, from now on, my name is Falah Al-Marzook.
Forget about this and write Saud.
Saud died.
From now on, my name is Fahad Al-Marzouk, Abu Abdulaziz.
God bless you, my dear.
Buffet one!
I did two.
Even I heard one of the bride's relatives say, "Wow, they're so classy. I don't think anyone could do something similar to what they did at the wedding."
Okay, my love, goodbye.
Look at this, Mom.
I must bring them something on the occasion of my wedding contract signing.
What's wrong, Mom?
Look at your brother who will bring us shame!
Yikes, this is embarrassing. By the way, it's cheap.
But this depends on our budget, which is appropriate.
Leave this for the servants to eat.
He wants to make us laugh.
It's good that I saw him.
This type is the free class, it's for the sophisticated community.
Approximately above average.
No, we want something unusual, something not everyone can afford.
Pardon me, my lady, one cannot blame those who do not know your capabilities (like me).
Shut up, just shut up. You don't know anything.
I'm afraid the money I have is not enough.
Don't embarrass us, pay with the credit card.
What luxury, it's very advanced.
Yesterday, Saleh signed his marriage contract.
Salih Nasser!
I am at your disposal, I am at your service.
This is coming to you.
They reserved the small hall for dining, and the food was disgusting.
Very cheap.
What she said about Saeed's wedding,
Certainly, everyone is saying the same thing.
This is what scares me!
Dear sister,
He's only concerned about money.
He doesn't care what people say.
He wants to make us laugh.
But we're supposed to bring something based on our budget and circumstances.
Do you know that some people take loans, sell their homes and cars just to throw an extravagant wedding, and to silence people's talk about them?
Leave it to us, cheap chocolate is fine, you were about to embarrass us with it.
You said the director liked the Chinese food and took it home.
Alright, if the bride's family says we choose the banquet hall and theater and prepare everything ourselves.
And you think we'll choose anything!
No, nothing, but the shop we used to go to has a very good price.
By the way, this shop designed Abu Thahab's wedding.
Has anyone used it before?
Frankly, once.
At the wedding of Mr. Mubarak's daughter.
No, no, no, we don't need anything used.
I need a platform that we will be the first in the world to use.
That means you want to excel.
Show me what you've got.
This stage is used for the first time in Qatar.
Inspired by the information revolution, like Facebook and Twitter.
Very modern and contemporary.
How much does this stage cost with the other arrangements?
I'll calculate it for you now, but not less than one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Mom, mom, with this project our money isn't enough. Everything is the most expensive, the best, and the most perfect, and all of this costs money.
Everyone does this.
Please be quiet.
What's the decision?
I mean, did you like this?
This is Noah's Ark.
Both are new, but Noah's ship is twenty thousand more expensive.
No, thank you, I think the mouse stage is much better.
Be quiet, no, I need Noah's Ark.
This is the wedding ceremony and its costs. By the way, we consider ourselves middle-class.
Do I have to pay for a theater costing one hundred and fifty thousand and a ballroom costing one hundred and fifty thousand, the one you reserved, what do you call it, the Royal Hall?
I didn't say box, but why is the display exaggerated and everyone wants to see each other and everyone wants to do better than what others have done.
It's a battle of bragging rights, and only wedding vendors benefit.
Who knows that everyone wants to be special, they exploit us and lie to us.
I swear I know one of my friends who says his brother has a wedding shop.
He says that the theater doesn't cost more than two thousand riyals.
I'm just waiting for this moment when his father says yes.
Well, do something.
Just like other young people who get married and manage their own affairs.
Hello, Your Highness.
How are you?
I know you love perfection.
That's why I'm calling you.
The first time I was in Qatar, it was designed by the world-renowned artist Peter Salomon.
A collection inspired by the nine planets.
I am from the solar system.
With Noah's Ark platform, you'll look amazing.
There is no such harmony, you will be the first in Qatar to use the nine planets.
Alright then,
It was one hundred and fifty thousand, and now?
Alright then,
May God increase your reward.
As desired.
Many expenses, my brother.
By the way, I couldn't get all eighty thousand.
All I've gathered is sixty thousand, and I took twenty thousand from my brother.
Thank you, thank you very much, my brother, Fahd!
How can we fix things, Fahd! As long as we boast at weddings, we're in trouble.
Without any boasting.
Of course, you will receive the invitations you want.
Okay, this week, God willing, we'll start with the invitations.
Our wedding will be better than theirs.
Mom, look at the invitations my son chose for the wedding.
Where does your brother live?
People now travel to countries just to design their invitations.
Unlike Amina's family, they went to Italy to design their invitation card, printed it, and then returned. Same for Manira's family.
They went to France, and even non-wealthy people go to Lebanon to bring back their invitations.
The system in the country works this way, do you want us to be different?
So, which country do you want to travel to?
We saw some wonderful invitations.
Frankly, it's expensive, that's all.
But it's unique and no one has done it before.
Shine, I don't like it.
Gold is much better, shiny.
Oh brother, if he can't afford the wedding expenses,
So why get involved?
And leave all this boasting and showing off at weddings, and all these expenses that are of no benefit.
The only ones benefiting from our madness are hotels and wedding planners.
That's it, he's leaving, poor thing.
Let me get it for him, he might not find anyone to bring it to him.
Come on, I'll take you.
Thank you, Abu Nasser!
Oh brother! The bride's family has to support you.
I tried once, just once.
They were told there that there was no need for a banquet hall in a very well-known hotel.
Why, you found our daughter on the street, and there are people no better than her.
This is the problem, everyone is looking at each other.
Who told you I got married?
At least they don't have that arrogance.
It's all about a simple party and a few expenses.
Come on, man! These days, they're getting married on Facebook.
Cheaper and less expensive.
This means you won't marry from your country.
Forget about it, do you want me to go crazy?
You will see.
If I don't invite Abdullah Roaished or Nawal to my son's wedding.
Damn her, she won't be better than me.
I'd like to ask you something, dear.
If your son has a Rooshid number, give it to us so we can contact him.
Okay, my love, thank you very much, goodbye.
Mom, we agreed on the DJ, why did you change your mind?
And will Umm Nasser be better than me?
Did you forget who she is and who we are?
The people who were below us have become better than us.
That's not how it is, Mom. Just look at my brother Saleh; he's breaking my heart, and they're not putting too much pressure on him.
Frankly, he broke my heart.
Really!
In the hospital! When and which hospital?
I don't know, suddenly I fell.
I heard that and fell immediately.
He has no point of view, and no one can blame him. After I had arranged everything and informed people, he simply said he didn't want a wedding.
He wants to embarrass us.
What did the doctor say?
He will embarrass us, and he wants to cancel the marriage.
God willing, everything will be alright.
Don't break her heart.
My son, you are a man and you are the provider.
Go, comfort her.
I swear to you, if I said this to Abu Yusuf, his heart would stop beating.
You know why the minister kept Abu Yusuf until now.
By the way, he was supposed to retire three or four years ago.
No problem, he will help me.
By God, you're crazy.
Understood, what do I want from him now?
And it will allow him to hide the papers and data, until you return the money.
They call it amount cooling postponement.
I won't speak, and I don't know why you're panicking.
There's nothing to worry about, and I'll return the amount to you at the end. I'll return the amount to you.
You know what they call me, you know what they call me?
Disciplined, disciplined.
Oh my uncle, oh my uncle, I tried, but there's no other way but this.
If I give you and later give the auditors,
They are relentless in their scrutiny, they will take me, quickly, quickly.
Quickly, the tablet, the tablet, the tablet.
You ate, you ate the pill.
No, no, God willing, from 7:30 we will be in the hall to receive guests.
No, no, we will definitely be there.
I'm going to throw a wedding for my son that will be the talk of all of Doha.
Surprise!
Alright, dear Fatima, I'll call you later.
I'm worried they might envy you, my son, if you walk in on them tomorrow in that thobe!
So, Mom, is the length of the thobe suitable?
The police are here!
I hope there are no mistakes.
Police, stay here and I'll be back.
God is enough for you, Salouh!
Forget about your wedding.
Marriage cage, now I'll enter the prison cage.
They discovered the document I hid for your loan, and now suddenly they've discovered me too.
Why are you upset!
You're going to hear about much worse disasters than this.
What will we say then!
A respectful and honest employee
Whoever loves their job, the ministry has contracted a company to perform maintenance.
Out of concern for his job, he went and inquired about the materials.
He discovered that the cost was four hundred thousand.
He will save one million six hundred thousand for the ministry.
And the minister punished him! No, no, no, I don't believe it.
Why can't you believe!
Here is Saad.
Of course he has all the news.
He was fired from his job.
What happened to the world? Where are the values?
They say he called his office manager.
And he said, "Let her work instead of Uthman."
And who is she?
She is the daughter of the director of the same company that offered the maintenance contract.
Which Uthman discovered that?
No, no, no, no, this is unbelievable.
You're always amazed, what a surprise, Saleh!
Who does this company belong to?
For whom?
That's how it is!
What are you saying!
It's not about what I said, it's about this poor employee, Uthman. What did he do wrong?
His mistake is that he is honest and loyal!
Do you think the manager is in his office?
Yes, he left a while ago.
What's happening in the world!
We started seeing some strange people.
I agree with you, Uthman doesn't deserve that, but there's nothing we can do about it.
It's not fair, Your Honor. He has seven children and no passport.
He earns his living from this job! What will he do now and where will he go?
Do you know what happened?
The new employee hired by the minister.
I entered Uthman's office and started working. Poor Uthman came to collect his belongings, but I stopped him and said, "Go, and I will send your things with the tea boy."
Where is he now?
Oh my God, things have reversed! Uthman?
This is the reward!
This is God's will and destiny.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.
Great God, O Generous One! O Uthman, God will not let you down, goodbye.
What's up? You don't look good!
I know, I know you're very sensitive.
What a job! I can't work, I'm leaving now.
It's an opportunity for me to visit my mother and bring you the things.
I don't want you to stay upset like this.
Why are you shouting at me? I'm your mother.
I'm not shouting at you, I'm asking you.
How is this acceptable, by what right do you go with him? Is he your husband, father, or brother?
The world has changed, where do you live?
I don't know, Mother!
You're crazy.
You have liberated people, the Earth has become a small village, where do you live!
What can I say!
Be modern, live in the present, and don't be backward.
Hurry up and get the stuff from the car! Go, don't look at me and lock it.
Is something wrong? Saleh! What's the matter with you?
No, you're not fine today.
I shouted at the poor maid, it wasn't her fault.
You know I didn't mean it.
No, no, no, I'm not hungry.
To forget the disasters I've seen.
Dear, don't cry.
The president is a bit annoyed.
We are honoured by your presence, Your Honour.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Hard work and perseverance.
Correct, awesome.
The most important thing,
The most important thing for me in this ministry
Exactly! Your Honor.
Tell me, what's the use of an official who doesn't take bribes?
He is useless.
That's why I want all of you.
No place for honest, principled people with outdated values.
If I ever discover
He will only blame himself.
Justice is a principle, no matter the reaction!
That's why I want you to cooperate with me.
If you are in doubt.
Just tell me.
We are thieves and sons of thieves, and no one can compete with our sisters.
If Nour doesn't take a bribe one day, she steals government tea before going home.
Excellent, excellent, bravo. This is what is expected of all of you, I don't want her to be the only one like this, I want all of you to be like her.
God bless you.
That's why I want you to leave the purchasing department and become my office manager.
Frankly, you know how to pick, you've chosen the right thief for the right place.
Enough, Mother of Saud, enough! Don't torture me anymore.
I don't want to live in prison.
But God is sufficient against sedition, He has seduced me and made truth seem fair to me.
And he told me to be honest.
You are a father.
Why did you bother with honesty and loyalty?
Throughout your life, you've been a thief and a slacker.
It's good that I wasn't virtuous.
Let me talk to your father.
Never do it again.
One must be on the straight path, he bribes, steals, and spends on hypocrisy to live comfortably.
My father was arrested because all his money was illegal.
Stop, stop.
Is this something to wear!
We are a respectable family.
Shame on you.
Where is your stomach?
Why wasn't it discovered?
You are not ashamed, you are shameless.
I'm shy about wearing the brother's dress.
Are there shy girls these days?
Why are you shouting?
Look what your daughter is wearing!
Would a respectable lady wear something like this?
And will you walk in the street without showing any part of your body?
I've had it with her; she doesn't listen to what I say.
I've never spared support here.
I bought her some transparent clothes she didn't need.
I warn you, if I ever see you anywhere below the knee,
Since you are aware of the situation, never blame me for the results.
We are here, God bless you.
I wish he were playful and mischievous.
He is like his father.
As you can see in front of you,
He is a very good man, how can we find someone like him.
Don't worry, Uncle, I'm smart.
What a good man. Frankly, I love my daughter Sarah very much and care about her future.
Only after we heard about it.
Praise be to God, she has a very bad reputation.
I returned home at 3:30 a.m.
And I returned home at 5 a.m.
Hello, hello, what's this! Hello.
Come and pick me up from the bar.
Start your car's engine and come pick me up from the bar.
This is the first time I've seen a father who doesn't obey his son.
Stop this, Dad. Start your car, I'm waiting for you.
Mary, I love you.
I love you too, you disappeared, disappeared, disappeared.
Basically, basically, my father, Dad is here.
Where is he?
He is brave, unlike my father who doesn't enjoy it.
Allow me to introduce you to my friend, Majid.
No, Dad, Abdulaziz was my ex-boyfriend.
Welcome, please come in, it's a golden opportunity.
Arab and Israeli satellites
It was discovered that many Palestinians had not cut their nails.
Based on the commitment of the State of Palestine in the comprehensive peace agreement,
In any case, the United Nations meets today to discuss Israel's request to send special inspection committees to examine Palestinian fingerprints.
To see if their nails are long or not.
There was a condition that nothing should be cut, torn, or cause bleeding.
State of Palestine
I call on the entire international community to visit Palestine.
From the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
Made of cork.
Olives, man!
We press the olives like this, like this we press the olives.
We and our Arab brothers appeal to the international community.
To conduct inspections of Palestinian nails.
And now, let's start the voting.
No, no, no, no, don't go that far, no.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Salih, Salih, what's wrong?
What did you dream about?
I dreamed of the upside-down world.
O Rashid! Your personality must be strong.
Now, brother, what's the number of this school where you'll be working tomorrow?
I am a teacher like you.
Why didn't I change my school since I started teaching?
Be specific, brother!
But the problem is his weak personality.
By the way, the teachers with him are the ones who complained about him.
That's enough, brother!
That's why you see him calm.
Later, he started teaching.
It wasn't ketchup, but mayonnaise with %Pw.
Oh brother! We're not talking to you to make you angry,
We're telling you this because it's your last chance.
And he told me that I accepted Rashid, even though his personality is weak.
He is shy and very good.
Whatever he is, he is a citizen.
Why are you quiet now, brother?
Because everything you say is true.
Everything you say is true.
From tomorrow,
A new Rashid.
Mr. Rashid,
You are absolutely right.
Alright, forget about it.
And from tomorrow,
Yeah, this is good. And what's next?
Here I'm telling you,
I am a teacher who does not like mistakes.
Let's assume a boy jumps up and tells you what the other boy said at your previous school, and the inspector is there.
And take your bag!
Slowly, slowly, you break the door.
Well, one learns from one's mistakes.
From the first minute,
Here I'm telling you,
I'm nervous.
The decision is mine!
Shut up!
It seems he just said, "Shut up!"
Did you hear him?
He said that Professor Rashid expelled me.
It seems he said, "I don't care, but he will see, I don't want to see your face here in class."
Teacher, don't you know who he is?
Who is whose son?
Here comes Mr. Rashid.
Saw it?
Teacher, the problem is if his son tells him.
Well, where do you usually see him sitting, sitting during the break?
You might find him in the seating area, sitting down.
Above the chairs.
Chairs, chairs.
At the end of the day, man remains human.
But you shouted at me!
Friends joking, you're joking with me.
My father is abroad and will return next week, and when he returns, I will tell him.
No, no, no, no, O Abdurrahman, may Allah preserve you.
We, we are friends. By the way, the very delicious berry ice cream, you might not try it. It has a little sourness, but it's wonderful.
Okay, go and get your wallet quickly.
The only thing I fear is that he will tell his father.
You said his father was abroad.
Yeah, he's out. His dad doesn't come back? They took his dad's stuff and kicked him out!
I hope there won't be dire consequences.
I carried his bags and brought them to him, gave him your phone number, and told him, "If you need anything, call me. I'm your friend."
Yeah, just.
What?
You're the ones who told me.
Scream and pretend you are strong.
Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.
O Rashid!
Name, you can sleep, you can sleep, don't bother yourself, sleep.
Mr. Abu Nasser, Mr. Rashid is in the bathroom.
One juice.
Come here, come here, come here, come here, give me.
Go, quickly.
Put them on the table.
That all people are equal.
That's why I've gathered you, so I can hear your opinions about the party.
How can one guarantee a boy?
This is going to cause a problem, that is, he is calling.
At three o'clock.
And this, hello. He hung up, I swear he was joking.
Faster, faster.
Peace be upon you.
Stand with the inspector, sit.
Yes, I'm at your service.
Hey! Oh, teacher, please, come here, teacher!
Are you done screaming?
I'm not mocking! Dude, I'm just asking, are you done yet??
Whether you're done or not, where is your respect for the teacher? By doing this, you are devaluing yourself and the teaching profession.
Okay, okay, fine, fine.
And you're raising your voice too?
Yes, I'm raising my voice, first you need to know who this young man is?
Faster, faster.
Just two cars.
Two cars, no, no, I want four or five cars. Spread out, spread out, we have enough space. Go, go, go.
He thinks he owns the neighborhood!
Abu Nasser used to do this, but he doesn't do it now.
God helps him.
I am the school principal here.
It is known about Abu Nasser.
We used to give all the teachers extra lessons.
Except me.
Who is the principal of the school here?
You are the manager, God guide you, what's wrong with you?
Put your leg out.
I didn't put it in your head, it's on the chair. Oh, my brother!
What do you mean?
No need, I swear I truly want to relieve you.
What do they call it?
So, what do we do with you now?
Act better for your own sake, and you will take extra lessons whether you like it or not.
What's wrong with you? Get up, get up, get up, get out!
Okay, I'll leave.
As you like it, we told you, man!
We must put him in his place.
Wait, my people, wait!
Don't blame us, Abu Saleem!
Goodness! Abu Naif, you are the sheikh of the neighborhood, and it is your duty to prevent him from crossing the line.
I am not my father's son.
I'll see what I can do with it.
Faster, faster.
Goodbye, Your Highness.
Wow, when did he buy this new car?
I told you this, but you didn't believe me.
He shaved his mustache and his face turned red.
Can you believe it, when he came I didn't recognize him, but when he spoke I recognized him by his voice.
Did you know he was promoted last week?
In other words, he is responsible for eight schools for boys and girls.
What is this magical secret? Ask him to tell you, what is the secret that got him out of the bottom!
I've been telling you since day one,
When I teach, I don't want to hear any noise.
Not even a breath.
Be polite.
And you too, answer me, and you too, argue with me. Get out of my face, get out, get out, get out.
When you are appointed a minister, look for a good staff to work with you.
So, don't tell me to come and take this job.
Either the other job, no brother gives me options, different jobs and I choose the most suitable job.
My brother is a minister!
I swear, I don't feel right after the call I received.
Everyone is congratulating me.
What are they saying, oh Mother? May God guide you.
This is very common. Every minister hires his friends and people automatically.
From this side, don't worry, we are honored to meet you %Pw.
They know I'll become a minister.
So, they are bribing me, this is just a pacifier.
Luck will come to us, a treasure, a treasure will open up for us.
The big earth.
Come on, everyone is going to congratulate the new minister.
Come on, come on, come on.
Congratulations, Your Excellency.
With my congratulations, sir/madam.
Congratulations, Minister. You deserve it.
You deserve it, Your Excellency the Minister!
O brothers! The responsibility is great, hopefully God will help us bear it.
As they say, you're very qualified for this job (a figure of speech).
She left after Abu Saleh's phone rang.
He was far from him.
Forget about it.
I'm surprised at how much he loves him now?
And Abu Sultan is not naive.
Yes, I opened the car door for him.
Well done, you've done a lot!
We are waiting for our brother to become a minister.
I told you, Mother! But you don't believe me.
You were saying they were café stories, café stories.
After her husband's death, she said I envied her husband.
God forbid, God forbid.
Yes, you have nothing to say, you have nothing.
Mom, let's go, I've had enough!
What do you mean when you say "That's none of your business"?
Just relax.
I cut them off because they were making me nervous.
Yes, they are right.
But I didn't want to say that in front of my mom, you know she tells everyone.
You blab everything you hear; they call it being a sieve. We don't want any scandal.
So, what guarantees for you, if he steps down from power, that he will put you in his place?
Because I asked for it.
If he's out of the office, you'll be the first candidate.
What assures you they'll kick him out?
No, I'm very sure about this.
Don't worry, I saw him outside the office just as I see you now in front of me.
You will make him a magic potion.
But the plan in my head is foolproof and effective.
It's the burn and kick plan.
I'll make him attend every event that takes place in the country.
By that time, he will be burned out, and when he is burned out, he will be removed from office. And when he is removed from office, he will be expelled.
I swear to God, brother, I don't know how or what to say to you!
Your visit is an invitation, an invitation that reflects your love for your homeland.
Do you think so?
Today you are a statesman, you must always be present.
You must participate in everything, sorry sir, sorry, sorry.
Before I forget, thank you for the lamb you sent me yesterday.
Come on, sir, this is a simple sheep, not your place. What do you think, sir, will you come with me today?
The man is waiting for you outside!
Frankly,
I don't want to go.
I am sick, I am tired of boasting, I am weary of it.
You are a minister today, and he is right. As he said, you are a prominent figure in society, so make a distinguished position for yourself!
God sends you this kind man.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Don't take my picture.
Take, take.
Today I'm taking him to a poetry night and a wedding, and they took at least a hundred pictures of him.
I'll tell you later about something really nice to take with it.
Listen, I've also arranged a very nice educational activity for you.
Yes, this is it. Let it shine, I want it to shine, shine, shine until it glitters. I'm looking for that glitter.
Seller, thank you. Congratulations, congratulations. Blessed bicycle. %PW Picture, happy picture. Take a picture, take a picture. Don't take my picture, I'm far away, take it.
This is the bicycle.
A blessed beginning and congratulations, greetings to your happiness.
Picture, picture like this. You are fat, fat sir.
Nothing, God bless you.
Go to page two.
No, he doesn't know him.
It's a national participation.
God does what He wills.
This is the fourth friend who has called me today.
Everyone praises your activities; Um Khalid calls you the vibrant social activist.
Yesterday, I heard a hurtful word.
The party that Abu Sultan took me to yesterday.
A celebration for the young children's swimming victory.
Someone was telling his friend,
They thought I hadn't heard them.
This minister said.
I want to buy a birthday present for my son.
Hello, hello.
I see you, sir, in the newspaper every day.
Correct, correct,
You brought light with you when you came to this place, I'll give you a discount on everything you want.
Whether you want to pay or not, no problem.
This means you won't be wandering around and getting to know your minister.
I, I am Abu Saleh, the minister.
Abu Sultan didn't come to pick me up, I'm waiting for him.
And he sat me in the front row, then went to the car to rest.
We don't need anything from him, may God guide you.
Oh woman, God bless your parents, ask him. I'll call you later just to make sure again.
And you're calling yourself.
People are making discounts for us.
I told you.
This job is great.
As soon as this man comes to get me!
The minister's happiness annoyed me, may God guide him.
Hello, hello Your Excellency the Minister.
No, but I'm feeling a bit tired today.
Alright, if you're that enthusiastic, we're at your service.
We are at your service, but my brother Saad will take you around and hopefully he can find a party for you or something similar.
So, a party?
No, no, today we don't have any activities.
No, we don't.
Okay, where can we meet?
Yes. Thank you, thank you.
Is there anyone I can ask?
God help you.
Sleep and rest.
Wait a moment, Saad.
Anything, even a henna night?
Yes, this is good.
There might be extra time.
Take it! Put it in the cabin and look for a photographer to take some pictures of his face.
Okay, goodbye.
What did you find for him?
I don't know, some reserve league match. Let him sit alone in the stadium!
"What's this! This minister is a curse upon us!"
Great, that means he reached the top.
His end is very near when he becomes the talk of the town.
Your Highness, he has become much more popular than you.
Your Highness, if you go somewhere and take Abu Saleh with you,
Oh, Your Highness!
Shining star.
We'll stop it and bring it back to its normal size.
The minister came, came, came. The minister came.
Don't take pictures! Don't take pictures! I swear to God, if any of you take a picture of me, I'll break you. I'm not coming out.
Smash their cameras, I don't want any pictures.
She sends you her regards.
As they say, I missed the train.
This is Khalid, my brother.
"There is no power or strength except by Allah."
Why?
This is the first time I see him.
The first time you see it!
The first time I've seen him in years.
Oh my God.
Is this Khalid?
I haven't seen you in a long time, come to me, my love.
What to do? He's very attached to her.
There is no power or might except with Allah; you keep returning to the same issue.
Get up, get up and don't give me a headache. I came back from the wedding at 3 a.m.
Let me rest and don't make a big deal out of it.
Your brother is a girl.
I swear to God, I'll tell my father. Look at yourself, you look like a girl.
This means he was playing, playing.
Yeah, he was playing, you know, playing with the makeup palette.
And this is Saud; I know what to do with him.
Alas for Khalid, I wish all children were like him.
About these campaigns and the mischief they create about his brother.
Come here, my dear brothers, come and greet.
How are you, my love?
No, dear, we're not going to Spain this summer.
Who are you talking to?
Fahd is from Kuwait.
Oh, Hamada!
Listen to what I'm saying.
"There is no power or strength except by Allah."
I'll let my dear Amal choose for herself.
But honestly, what do you think?
I say that the one overlooking the sea is better.
So that in the near future, if we buy a yacht, we can set sail directly from our home to the sea.
Us and our children.
Please, you must set a wedding date.
Possible, just a year and a few months.
Why does your brother put on so much perfume?
Frankly, I noticed your brother Khalid, I don't know.
But he is completely different from your brother Saad.
Different or not, my dear, everyone is free in their actions.
And your fiancé is backward, he doesn't know that there are unisex perfumes.
Let your fiancé keep his opinion to himself.
I don't care.
Unbelievable, Khaled!
Your scent is not a perfume used by women.
You even use their colors.
Why are you doing this, Khalid?
Indeed, you have nothing to say.
Mom, why don't you want to believe anything about him? Don't you see his actions and behavior?
Now perfumes are unisex.
Here I warn you.
Have you seen the Bluetooth?
I heard about it from my friends in the council; they say it's very common in Doha.
I've heard about it, show us.
You have to see it, and I'll tell you later.
Look how that girl dances!
Look at the moves!
These are girls! Look at this one who says she dances well and do some moves, do you know who she is? She's Khalid Mohammed's cousin.
My aunt's daughter, Khadija.
Alright, you'll see what I'll do to him.
I'm waiting for his brother Saad now.
Why? Let him come and see for yourself, let Saad come! I'll send it to him via Bluetooth so his family can see it.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, hello, hello.
Of course, you were defeated.
Why is my cousin sitting this far away?
Nothing, but is your Bluetooth on?
No, but I'll send you something.
No, thank you, Amira.
He ran away from his family.
You're crazy, Saad!
I will travel tomorrow.
You won't see my face in this country.
Where are you going by yourself?
What are people saying?
They will say our son has left us and traveled, don't cause us a scandal!
Really?
And what your son Khalid did is honor and glory!
Isn't it a scandal for a man to turn into a woman?
I can't face people if they say this is the brother of the pervert.
Tell him he travels for treatment, or for study, or for work, or even if he thinks about committing suicide.
The most important thing for me is not to live in a place where scandal chases me every day.
So, where are you going?
What matters to me is where I go.
This is the end.
The second one, we don't know where he is, and this one here is packing his bags to travel.
Even we don't know where he's going?
What did you expect it to be?
What's wrong with you? I brought you to comfort me, and you're throwing hurtful words at me that break my heart.
I was telling you to take care of him.
Don't leave it to the servants.
You don't know anything about it and you were busy.
My father is busy with his work and has left the responsibility to you.
You are right, Mother.
No hope for your sister?
In this, you are right.
What Khadija did has tarnished our reputation among people.
I don't see anyone.
Did you say something to him?
This is the biggest flaw in my father.
We are in the strange, bad case of eternity.
I told him.
Put it on a CD and give it to him.
Only when I'm going to the airport.
I'm very worried about him.
Our house must reach that point, oh my God! {Aml.
Don't be surprised.
Khulud and her peers do not care about their families' reputations.
And the reputation of their brothers and sisters.
Whatever religious values call them.
They go dancing and having fun.
In the evil swamp.
Oh my God! My son, I am perplexed.
Goodbye, Father.
Save yourself, my son!
Yes, Father, I have a small gift for you.
A gift for me!
Now put the CD in the laptop, I'm scared of what will happen, come with me!
Present, Mother.
It's impossible that my dad is still watching the CD, it's only three minutes long.
He may go out.
Where will he go? There's not enough time to go anywhere.
Answer me, what's wrong with you, Abu Saad?
Father!
Alright! Oumayma,
If I search, I will fail.
To find someone with your morals,
But forgive me.
God help you.
I see you floating on the surface!
Yes, my love.
We live in an age of freedom.
The age of human rights, and no one owes us anything.
If anyone has one riyal, they can get a thousand! Oh, light of my eyes.
Of course, I can handle it. God bless America.
Do you know that salaries are high now?
One thousand two hundred.
God is sufficient for you; whenever I speak to a driver, I ask him how much is your salary?
My salary is very low.
Whenever he sees me, he starts complaining, saying that his salary is low and not beneficial. We agreed with him that his salary would be seven hundred, and you increased it by a hundred when he got the license. What more does he want?
I told him, "When you complete one year of work, we will increase your salary."
He seems greedy, and we're going to have a tough time with him.
Stop it, stop it, shut your mouth, be quiet, just be quiet, give it back and get rid of it.
That word is easy for you, very easy.
So you'll let him bother you, I hate going out with him in the car.
Alright, leave it to me.
You've told me the story now, I'm the man of the house. Shh, stop, you too be quiet, I'll handle this.
Come, I want you outside, go!
Come and stand.
What did I tell you?
I said your friends shouldn't come to your room. Did I say that or not?
Oh boss, this isn't my friend, he's my uncle.
He came for five minutes and will leave, God willing.
Five minutes!
Keep this in mind!
Don't tell the lady I need a raise, I need a raise!
Everything in the world is expensive now.
When did I give you eight hundred?
Boss, I have a lot of problems at home.
Those drivers in Doha earn one thousand one hundred, one thousand two hundred.
It might be thirteen hundred.
Wait, I'll think.
Listen, I'll raise my voice by a hundred percent and silence you, I won't shout at you.
What do you say I raised you an extra hundred, go get a job!
What did he say?
I'll tell you.
A hundred is no use.
Two hundred is no use to me.
I'm afraid of that, O Screen.
Why are you afraid?
All the drivers fled.
Because they work abroad for three or four thousand.
What's the problem? When you work at home, it's not beneficial, but when you work outside, you make more money.
I'm very scared.
Look at those, they are all drivers.
How much is the price?
Two thousand five hundred.
But I'm afraid of the police who will take me and put me in jail.
No, don't be afraid.
I guarantee you.
I was wearing the abaya and was about to go out.
I was calling, but now no one is answering me.
He opened his room and the wardrobe was empty.
Monira's maid ran away for a year.
I will only say, God is sufficient for him.
Alright, I'll come to you.
I went to the police.
If you report, you bear no responsibility.
We'll do our best.
And you too, look around the neighborhood, you might see him and let us know.
Yes, he will make money and when he is satisfied, he will surrender himself.
We bring them in, we pay for them, and we provide them with clothes, food, and driving lessons.
It's none of his business.
The match is about to start, come in, it's better to enter now.
Yes, we were worried.
These foxes, foxes aren't easily caught.
Do you know that if more than three don't sign up, it means we haven't won, we need ten or fifteen.
This is blatant mockery, blatant mockery. Let's be clear, this is blatant mockery.
This is their level. If they don't score more than three goals, it's not the Foxes.
Take it from me.
In ourselves, in the players, and in the performance.
They have nothing, they should thank God if they score less than three, they should thank God.
Any goal, these are just appetizers. Our team is still hungry, this is the Foxes team, leave us alone, man.
You've scored a goal now, and you're relaxed and happy now.
Do you think there are other goals as well, or does it stop here?
This fox is very good, it's very smart. It goes here and there and no one can catch it, it'll spin your head. This fox eats the chicken.
No, I don't have a car.
You are my friend.
Did you hear what he said?
This fox is very problematic.
It's impossible to catch him.
Yes, sir!
Do you know or not?
He is a fan of the Foxes team.
He sometimes appears on the show "Energy and Vitality."
They will win today and you will lose.
I swear I will defeat you. The Foxes team never loses, it's always the winner.
Fox, what do you think of the result today?
Why are you asking me about the result?
It's over, the foxes are the winners.
The birds came to take their livelihood as they flew.
Let's be realistic, don't say the foxes won and let's fly away.
These are foxes, my friend.
This fox takes the chicken and eats it.
You didn't see, Your Highness, what he did on the field.
The audience never stops laughing at him.
It's clear in the arena, and thank you for listening.
The true fan with genuine loyalty to the club.
He hangs out with wealthy Qataris who go to malls and similar places.
He invited me for a cup of cappuccino.
What a strange world! Oh, human.
The boy gave me five hundred riyals and paid the bill.
Tell us the poem you composed about our match against the frogs.
Thank you to all the listeners here.
You are a frog.
Aren't you ashamed that my team beat you by four?
Use foul language, use foul language about the club and the team and see what happens!
Don't say that!
When one of the foxes was expelled
The reason behind that is a rule.
He expelled a player from the Foxes team.
I changed his name from Hakim to Ahmak.
Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the listeners here.
Every month, we would gather to choose the best fan.
Great, who did you choose to honor this month?
The board members of the club will decide.
They are not children, and each one of you is the size of a camel.
I manage this big club. Fox.
Come on, come on and look at the driver who escaped from us, he's on TV, come on.
Is this it?
One speaks fluently, the other is mute.
What do you think, is this a pen or a watch?
Now, I know how to get there.
The audience left.
Follow him.
Turn here.
He was driving fast.
We've lost him now.
Great!
Be quiet, you don't decide. I'm the master of this house and I'm the one who decides.
We need to be sure.
Majid Abdulrahman Al-Subaie
Yes, yes, yes, God bless you.
I am from the Subug tribe.
Buy it and register it under my name. No, no, no, no, I don't want to live in it, I already have a house.
I only want to invest.
Because the investment price is rising, God bless you.
How can I assist you, my people, what do you want?
God bless you.
Come in, everyone! Coffee?
You don't have any words, God bless you. You don't need anything, God exalt you.
You say you're sure, is that good? He's about to embarrass us in front of the elite!
I'm very worried.
Oh my mother, oh my mother, I am a mother.
Now, what your father will do to us, I don't know.
I didn't mean it, Mom!
Oh mother, please don't tell father.
Your father will turn the house upside down.
Of course, he will kill you now.
Mom, I swear I didn't break it on purpose.
Mom, why don't we buy glue and stick it?
What are we gluing, my son?
How can we find something similar? I don't know where your uncle bought it, it was a gift.
I'm worried about you from him.
Oh mother, I'm afraid he'll hit me.
Close the door until I find a solution to this problem.
Quickly, go to your room.
Blind, blind, blind! Are you blind!
You blind fool, you broke the masterpiece, you blind fool?
Mama, hasn't your father come?
No, my God! His daughter didn't come. What happened to you?
He ran away from home, afraid of his father.
This is not true. Show some empathy for the boy!
This is not upbringing, may God guide you, my daughter!
What should we do now, Mother?
I don't know what to do!
I don't know, but I was worried about the cars on the street.
God protect him, I think he went to the supermarket or went to the neighbors to play with the children.
Yes, he is kind, good, and popular. Oh, my daughter!
No, my daughter, seek refuge in Allah from the devil and don't worry, God willing, everything will be alright.
Well, goodbye, my daughter.
Where is his father?
My father is going to hit me.
Oh grandmother, my father is killing me with his beating.
Don't panic, my dear.
Don't panic, dear.
I won't let him hit you.
I didn't mean to break it.
Come, my son! Come and drink some water and rest in my room.
Your face turned yellow.
God guides him, God guides him. Come with me, my son, a little.
O Generous God.
I'm afraid my father will come here.
Come on, son, don't worry.
No one interferes in raising my son.
This is my son, and I raise him the way I want.
But the poor buyer is anxious, trembling, and terrified of something he didn't intend to do.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
Let him see!
The bag accidentally hit the vase, believe me, he didn't mean to.
You! You must support him!
Don't talk about him to me, please. Forgive him this time, his state of fear is tearing my heart apart.
But where, where is he now? Why is he here at this time?
He is not here.
He's here! Where?
Come on in!
No, no, I'll take it to my brother today.
Why don't you bring something new instead of the old one!
Come on, Nasser! Brother, let's play!
And your mother says you're studying!
My dad just wants me to play this and then we'll study!
Don't you have an exam tomorrow?
Yes, Father.
Come on, dad, go ahead and ruin the game.
Come on, man, don't take it seriously. Come on, come on, man, let's study.
What? What are you saying! Listen to me,
If I go, I'll call your uncle Abu Waleed now.
No, no, no, no. Don't tell my uncle, don't tell my uncle, no!
I don't care.
I'll tell him you don't listen to me.
Let's go. Everyone takes their book and starts studying.
Alright, Dad, put your phone in your pocket. We'll study, Dad, but don't tell Uncle.
Oh mother, I'm really very confused. I don't know what to do?
I fear that if he finds out, he will cause us trouble.
Of course he will ask me, why are you taking him to the hospital?
So, what's the problem if you tell him?
If he finds out that Waleed is wetting the bed, he will kill him.
Oh, Mother! He is the one to be blamed. All this is his fault.
Oh my daughter, it has a psychological impact.
The boy is not a child anymore, he is now twelve years old.
Alright! My daughter.
You'll come to have lunch with us and I'll give him some hints.
And I will see his opinion.
Her mother went to Bahrain to buy abayas.
Just an argument, my daughter.
Fun and shopping.
She says he wets the bed every night.
My son wets the bed every night and you don't tell me the story.
He told me I had to take him to the hospital so they could treat him.
Her husband is stupid.
He doesn't understand anything.
He is right.
They need to take him to the hospital, son, so they can find out what he's suffering from.
And look for a good dry hose.
He beat him until his screams could be heard by the last person in the neighborhood.
Sit down!
Eat! My daughter, eat.
No, I didn't say anything.
Take it, go quickly and wash, I'll bring you some clothes. Go!
Please, if you please.
I must punish them.
Don't interfere!
You call this a pass?
Khulood got forty-nine out of fifty.
Is this a pass?
But their grades are good.
He told them they would be punished if they didn't get fifty out of fifty.
Please, don't take them to your brother!
They must be punished.
They are my children.
Alright, uncle, uncle, this is the last time.
Why don't you bring the fifty from the fifty, fifty from fifty?
Give him another one.
I tell him, don't go to public places with us.
Yesterday we went to the hospital and they told him not to enter. It's forbidden for you.
You're different, don't go with us.
Be quiet! Let me punish his brothers.
Stop, uncle, I'm about to die, stop, stop, stop, stop. I'm about to die, stop, uncle.
Let me punish you.
Remember, this is not a punishment. What you'll see at the end of the year if none of you get fifty.
I will empty the pool.
I'll fill it with oil.
Where is your certificate? Where is your certificate?
They said it would be ready tomorrow.
Khaled Abdul Rahman.
Alright! Well done, Khalid.
Faisal Abdullah Rashid.
Excellent, Faisal!
God bless you.
You are an outstanding student, and you were second in your class.
The professor is crying because he got forty-nine out of fifty in math.
The professor is afraid of his father because his father wants him to get a perfect score.
O son! I am speaking to you!
Contact, reach out to his classmates.
He said he saw him by the school entrance.
Call, call your mother, she might be at your grandfather's house.
No, he didn't go there.
So, where is he? Where is he?
"There is no power or might except by Allah."
What's up? Bro!
Ah, of course he failed and he's afraid of his family.
He did not fail, rather he was an excellent student and was second in his class.
Yet he was terrified to go back home.
Because he only lost two marks in math.
God have mercy on him.
Walid, Walid.
Walid, Walid.
Oh Wael, come!
Forty-eight, forty-nine, you lost a point or two, it's okay. I won't say anything, I won't scold or hit you. Oh Waleed,
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

Saudi Arabia leads with 24% of global reserves.
Then Libya, the United States of America, and Nigeria.
Three percent each, and the rest of the world combined with fifteen percent.
And thus
In addition to production
And perhaps this is one of the secrets and reasons behind the major industrial nations' attempt to seize control of this region and its countries.
And above them is the United States of America, the largest consumer of oil in the world.
However, oil prices are on the rise.
Concurrently with the decline in the value of the US dollar.
Which is taken as a unit for pricing oil.
Where yesterday, the price per barrel reached
This led to increased revenue in producing countries while
To increase its inflation rate
Where inflation in some of those countries reached fifteen percent.
The most important source of energy in the world.
Prices of commodities and the cost of living
In a direct conversation with the Deputy Prime Minister
Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry
Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah
For viewers who wish to participate, they can contact us on the program's contact numbers.
Honorable Deputy, welcome.
I'd like to start with you on the unprecedented prices oil has reached.
Where might prices be heading?
Of course, the question of how high prices might go is a perplexing one.
Or what we call the power of the market.
Isn't it OPEC?
And not the producing countries?
Neither the producing countries nor OPEC have anything to do with oil pricing.
Is the only relationship of price between supply and demand?
So far, supply and demand have little to do with it.
So, what are the factors?
There are other factors besides supply and demand.
What made investors
I feel a lot of pressure and have turned into oil and gold, or what is known as "commodity marketing."
Investors lost confidence in financial markets.
And gold as well.
We have seen gold rise from $350 in past years and has now reached $970.
And as I mentioned before, around one hundred and nine dollars.
But they are all on the rise, and if they fall, it will be only a slight decline.
Let me remind you that in the first quarter of this year
Which quarter is expected to see a drop in prices due to weakened oil demand?
But we saw the market in a strange and volatile state.
In the second quarter and at the beginning of spring, it rises above one hundred dollars.
But this means that the previous factors that determined the rise in prices in winter and consumption have now changed, and other factors are at play.
and economic growth
At the same time, we see oil prices rising to this level.
You mentioned political factors and said that political tensions play a role in this.
Iran. Do you think Fallon's resignation is in light of political complexities?
What was accompanied, and today led most activities of American newspapers and world press. May affect oil prices.
Yes, one hundred percent, and today?
Today, we are in the age of globalization and influence comes swiftly.
Unrealistic factors may influence.
And causing some disruption in the market
Also stirring up some political rumors.
He said there was no plan, but he didn't rule out other options that might apply to Iran.
And markets always react to uncertainty.
Of course, there is no certainty now that America is at war with Iran.
I am among the people who don't see this situation.
And perhaps there are those we have not seen, what will happen in the future.
But we, who work in the energy sector
We see that these political tensions
In the world's oil supply
In return, there is a very profitable supply.
This indicates that oil is going into storage.
There is absolutely no shortage of oil supplies.
Perhaps preparing for the next war.
In light of this reassuring picture you're presenting about supply, indicating that there are no obstacles to it.
In case President Bush and the United States decide to change their plan.
This is something else.
Prices will soar to particularly record levels.
Oil prices may reach
Global oil reserves
You are here, today represents the most important gulf.
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and other Gulf states
Today they represent more than 60% of oil reserves, and that is definitely confirmed.
You today
If a very minor accident occurs.
Therefore, it indicates
Which means that in the event of any war with Iran, it would mean that there is no guarantee of how high oil prices will rise.
God knows, he might arrive today, we arrived without him.
Wars up to one hundred and seven and one hundred and ten dollars, and it may jump to one hundred and ten, God knows.
Today, oil, as I told you, is under political and psychological pressures.
And speculators took advantage of these tensions.
I only invest in oil.
Or what is called such has not been invested in a real investment of course, neither future buying nor future marketing.
It is called olive paper.
And they are all guesses on rice paper.
Its total production is around three hundred thousand barrels or less.
These people might be pushed towards more purchases rather than more upgrades.
I wish April were April Fools' Month.
I hope there isn't one.
It is said that Cheney is coming to the region, and this is at the top of his agenda.
Shini is the owner of this project, as stated by many politicians and media personalities.
I didn't know what was in Cheney's bag.
And I cannot predict what will be in it, in other words.
Will he ignite the war?
America is in transition.
And why doesn't the son do something else?
Let's see what happens. If the matter is about April, April is coming soon, but how many weeks until we enter April.
And the world may pay the price.
And America is a huge consumer.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the tough number.
You can't roll this number.
The cost of their production is very cheap.
Compared to West African countries, most of which rely on
The Gulf, no other country in the world can
Listen, we've been hearing this talk from the West and the United States for many years.
Use
Until the last drop of it, and do you remember the story of the Caspian War?
Whatever these dreams.
When you sit with Westerners in a small circle
You hear them speak in a different way.
What are they saying?
On supplies, the importance of the region, and the value of reserves.
When I asked a European official, I said: "It's strange that you talk among us in closed rooms."
Not the same way you talk to people.
Or the media, he said: for political reasons.
And of course, there is what is called double standards or two languages.
The language you know is Arabic, and the countries of the Gulf are known as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, which include Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.
It is as important today as Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The largest producer and exporter of oil in the world.
And her entry.
Despite all this
Leader of the Central Region
Declaration of war on Iran.
Even with an air war or airstrike as they say
In the supplies
You are not late, you are very generous.
I don't agree with what you're saying.
We don't deal with Westerners at all.
We deal with America.
Where are the good prices?
Regardless of the nationality of this market.
I mean non-renewable energy.
For (i.e.) kindness.
Arab generosity
Please, give it to me.
Observers say the real price of oil is
That is due to the rise in oil prices.
Oh citizens of the Gulf, OPEC, and the Arab states
You are very generous with Americans, and you insist on sticking to their currency.
I said the price of oil should be seventy dollars.
I said the actual price for the decline of the U.S. dollar ranges from sixty to seventy.
Okay, the price is now one hundred.
One hundred and nine because the dollar dropped by thirty percent.
And now its price is over a hundred dollars.
If we take the percentage and the ratio
No one denies that.
And one of the main reasons
Compared to the decline of the US dollar
If we take
This is a comparison.
Oil prices
Because of the United States of America.
Of course, it's in our interest at the moment for the dollar to fall.
A weak or stagnant U.S. economy, the U.S. "can't do anything."
So, what happened to this economic weakness and recession?
And you too become like that.
The United States is cutting benefits on the dollar.
Why the insistence on linking oil to the dollar?
Let's talk about the reason for linking the price of oil to the dollar.
The first, more than 100 years.
Who started exporting the first barrel of oil exported from the United States of America.
And it was exported in dollars.
And it has been from the twentieth century until today.
Pricing oil in dollars
Historically, it became
And since the world has been interacting and setting prices for a hundred years past.
And which today makes Norway the third-largest oil producer.
And export oil.
Russia is the second-largest exporter of oil.
And the production of the North Sea field in Europe.
Pricing is in dollars, not in other currencies.
Everything is changing in the world, and there are other sources and information pointing to something other than this.
You are the Gulf countries.
You have secret agreements between you and the Americans.
And oil became the real cover.
This is true and does not exist.
And these agreements
The status quo will persist as long as oil remains the cover for the dollar, with the United States continuing to support these regimes.
This is not true and there are no secret agreements.
Today let's take OPEC.
You have sixty-six percent respectable MPs.
Among thirteen countries.
Out of the eighty-five barrels, forty percent are allocated to OPEC.
There are many countries that are large producers of oil.
Outside OPEC
What are the obstacles to pricing in another currency?
Look for pricing in another currency.
Isn't this when adults decide?
You, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, are a star.
Today's OPEC class is like everyone else's.
There are sixty percent.
Even if we assume that OPEC wanted that.
There is an agreement among all oil-producing countries.
There is a trend and an intention towards change.
What kind of attempt?
But now these countries cannot change the pricing currency.
Except in the case of an agreement between
What is the impact?
Let me now speak why European.
Don't export their oil.
From the North Sea or Russia or Norway in euros or rubles.
Because it's in their interest, their currency is high and expensive.
On the contrary
Here is where they lost.
With one euro they issue one and a half barrels.
No, you are the loser because your currency has dropped since it's pegged to the dollar.
He is also a big loser, a huge loss.
The currency union here in the Gulf has a historical connection.
Remember when the dollar was the strongest currency in the world?
And the connection is now lost when you talk about disengagement.
It's like marriage when we get married.
And if you want a divorce, it's not an easy matter.
Not here.
Or you've tied the knot with the dollar in a Catholic ceremony.
And costs must be examined in some way.
It was professionally inspected and examined.
Similarly, Kuwait dismantled twenty-five percent of its currency in dollars.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar
It may adjust its exchange rate.
Today we are talking about the subject, but this means that you do not intend to study the subject or think about it.
Of course, the exam differs, as His Excellency the Prime Minister stated.
He stated that the Qatari currency is undervalued by thirty percent.
Be in this study.
There's no direction you can go in this matter alone.
Kuwait has gone its own way; why don't you follow in its footsteps?
Economists say it is more profitable for countries and their people than losing.
But we
And nothing else.
for these four Gulf states to announce
Everyone believes.
And by that I mean those who support him personally.
He will support it.
It must be included in the study.
In itself
What was made by one or two countries.
Until the time of issue.
That won't save the situation now.
Of course, there will be experts conducting this study.
And they will be the ones
We are not experts, this requires a political decision.
Let's wait and not rush now, see what happens today.
People started, you know.
Of course, on a collusion website.
Honorable Deputy, the inflation rate in Qatar in 2007 reached 14 percent and will reach 15 percent this year.
Ate people's salaries, swallowed their wages, the wages of the workers here.
Salaries of residents in Qatar have eroded by thirty-five to forty percent.
We'll be back after the break to find out the extent of the salary increases.
We have staff in Qatar at least for the coming period, so stay tuned.
Welcome back to "Beyond Boundaries" for today's episode in which we host the Deputy Prime Minister, Qatar's Minister of Energy.
And industry, Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah, on the massive increase in prices.
in oil that brought tens of millions of dollars to the Gulf states and producing countries
I am writing about oil, and my question was about the upcoming increase in employees' salaries. However, before this increase, I would like to provide you with some important information.
The United Arab Emirates has a reserve of seven and nine-tenths billion and produces two and six-tenths.
Tons and the report in the Kuwait Times is an economic report, and Gulf revenues are among the largest.
Saudi Arabia's revenue projections for the year 2008 are $109 billion.
And it was
One hundred and seventy last year, sixty-six this year in the UAE, and it was expected to be seventy-five.
Kuwait is sixty-four, and it was fifty-four.
One quarter of oil plus fifty-five billion.
As other reports have mentioned, without any envy, I mean we don't envy His Excellency the Deputy.
Iraq is forty-seven billion.
One and a half trillion
In terms of spending, it was one and a half trillion dollars.
Gulf countries exported goods worth one thousand billion, or one trillion dollars.
The dollar was a kind of import.
The United States' investment was three hundred billion.
And nine out of ten billion.
In Bahrain, it was three percent.
In 2007, in Oman, it was 6.5 but it will rise to 7, and in Qatar, it was 13.75 but it will rise to 15 percent in Qatar.
That means those living in Qatar can expect higher costs of living, goods, and prices.
Life is being consumed, and prices are rising to high and higher rates in Qatar.
We empathize with everyone.
So the solution must be
And the solution means that it aims to control inflation.
That means you'll increase their salaries by 50%.
No, they'll say you're against raising salaries.
This is not true.
In the cabinet, against raising salaries.
That there is a problem and that the solution must be the optimal solution.
And it's not a quick fix.
Well, there's a balance between the two.
And that will be all.
The most important thing is to solve the inflation problem.
And here in Qatar, there is a committee.
His Highness directed the formation of
And he places
And lays a strong foundation.
To solve the problem and control inflation
The most important thing at the moment is to control inflation.
Inflation
If you don't control it
But, Mr. Deputy, now
The one specialized in market research and published last February, just days before
Among them because of the salaries for
Now you will solve the problem of inflation and let inflation devour these people's incomes.
Many of them now
Entering other countries
Raise our salaries, then solve inflation and lower them again.
I repeat what they say, which balances the subject.
But now
It's not a temporary solution.
Increase it by a larger amount.
Therefore, here.
To end inflation
Boredom will always remain.
Due to the massive increase that occurred over the past year, isn't it?
The second point is
And those who work in the private sector are not like those who work in the public sector.
The private sector is very neglected.
Now, this question of increase must also be considered fairly.
I don't know where I got these notes from.
We live in Qatar, Your Excellency, not in Germany.
I'm telling you the opposite, the private sector has started paying today.
"That most" or "That the majority"
Some Qataris who were working in government offices have moved to the private sector.
Due to high salaries.
He is facing a problem.
To move to the private sector because it is more vibrant and dynamic.
And it offers good salaries.
Attached to what is called market forces.
Or market power.
They don't come with very high qualifications.
They don't come to Qatar because Qatar has low salaries or low expenses.
Or with expenses they come.
Alright with our clear understanding.
I don't predict events, and I'm not saying there's a raise in salaries.
There is no hope either.
To control inflation
Let's give her some time.
In controlling inflation
And with God's permission, this is what was said about the report, that Qatar was in two thousand and eight.
God willing, we say that.
We see that these numbers will change.
Spray some of it on the people.
It's a professional process.
Of course, with professionalism and everything.
From inflation
Due to spending
Many different projects.
Let me take some questions from the audience and I hope everyone asks a straightforward question. Abdulaziz Mohammed from Morocco, what's your question, brother Abdulaziz?
Depends on the ruling families in the Gulf.
Therefore, I don't think the justification for that is an OPEC dispute.
Secondly, the total oil revenue goes directly to the governor.
Then to the royal family and the rest will be spent on development.
In the absence of accountability, the situation will remain unchanged.
Peace, mercy, and blessings from God.
Hello, my brother Ahmed.
I won't belabor the point. The brother mentioned aspects related to systems and rulers, and the issue of the Qatari riyal's peg to the dollar or other Gulf currencies to the dollar, but
America wants to globalize the world and have it pledge allegiance to her.
American weakness has become apparent, and Sino-American trade has reached eighty-two billion dollars.
In addition, the European Union with eighty-six billion dollars.
This means that all trends in global politics are against the dollar.
And we are paying the price of its consequences now as Arab countries and Gulf oil states.
It will end with a confrontation with America.
Among the advanced countries of the world, such as China and Russia and others, the issue may become...
Purely military
The bombings include Chinese bombs, Russian bombs, Japanese bombs, and also American bombs.
Many thanks for this clarification and information.
Your question, Muhammad, is...
Welcome, your question
Can you turn down the TV and ask your question?
Okay, your question is...
But from what I saw, His Excellency insisted on not replying.
The topic is about not being tied to the dollar because the dollar is declining.
With God's permission, he will reach the bottom.
He is a good man.
He should not follow the style of the Arab brothers.
Thank you, Brother Mohammed, thank you. Now we request the final intervention from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. Your question, Ahmed, is...
Good evening to you as well.
Thank you and thank you for the great interview.
What is required, God willing, things will improve.
It's true that we all face problems, not just in salaries.
Salaries, God willing, will improve matters.
Alright, tell me your question quickly.
Your line will be intercepted, do you have a question?
All that is due to the rise in prices, and the increase included all goods, all exported.
I am from European countries.
We have factories and laboratories in the Arab world.
Thank you, Ahmed, thank you for your time.
Now the issue of rising prices is an important issue.
Regarding supporting the poor, the man told you, "Stand with the poor, Your Highness."
Anyone who doesn't have a billion here is considered poor.
Here for some brothers we are.
Who doesn't know Qatar?
For the State of Qatar, this is not true.
Today, anyone coming to Qatar can see the indicators.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar?
Highest growth indicators in the world
Where does this wealth go, and what do you do with it?
What falls within the scope of the response?
When the Moroccan speaks, he speaks in an unreal and non-realistic way.
The person who doesn't see with his eye.
If he came and saw Qatar and how huge developments are taking place there.
As a big growth, you are right, you are asking.
And everyone has the right to
And since you are few in number, where will you get people from?
Does that really mean you'll be importing the surplus from China, for example?
No, we will not issue, God willing.
The state is built on a plan and ...
Complete independence from the money coming from oil and gas, and everyone knows that oil and gas will run out one day.
that Qatar will become
It is considered one of the best achievements in the Arab world.
Today as well.
Focus on
And which will have a great impact.
After oil and gas
So you're not mimicking Dubai.
Every country has its distinctive features.
In the State of Qatar, we focused on education.
In the components
There will be a medical city where people come for treatment.
There will be an adaptable media city.
Of course, the world today, today we must build.
Build a vision.
Beyond Oil and Gas
There were fatal errors.
Unfortunately, we did not welcome this mutation because it took us by surprise.
And we were not prepared for it, neither in terms of personnel, technology, nor even education.
Now it has changed after thirty years.
And better yet
Today there is a vision.
"And a peg"
And vision
Thank you, Honourable Deputy, and I also thank our audience.
We hope that you will continue to follow us, and we trust that we have provided you with what is necessary.
It seems that Qatar's foreign policy is unclear to many observers.
Qatar enjoys special relations.
At the same time, Qatar had and still has relations with Israel.
From the Islamic Resistance Movement "Hamas"
And Qatar presented.
Started.
The largest Arab country
What angered the regime in Egypt
To the extent of accusing Qatar of conspiring against Egypt.
Moreover, Qatar was not far from important files.
Like Darfur, the Houthis in Yemen, and even Israeli prisoners.
Shalit's release, Qatari foreign policy reached out to him in a way that angered the most powerful Arab states.
And what kind of power do you put in such a position?
These achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
Or contact us through our website www.Aljazeera.net
Welcome, Your Excellency.
On September 22, 2007, to Saudi Arabia.
The visit marked a shift in the relationship between the two countries, at least over the past two years.
Redrawing the borders
Wash what was stored.
This is what was mentioned.
In the newspaper or magazine of Al-Hijaz.
That was concluded with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in which you resumed contact and the Saudi ambassador returned.
To Doha
Your initial presentation was too long and required many answers without your final question.
I believe you gave it to her.
Especially on the Saudi topic.
What is flour?
Saudi Arabia is very important to the State of Qatar.
Between the two countries
I spoke about the silence of the island.
I talked about a revolutionary movement.
I think these matters have been clarified on both sides.
And we accepted the explanation.
In the State of Qatar
Conflict with Saudi Arabia
It was always limited in scope.
From perspectives
And thank God, this was thanks to the wisdom of the two leaders.
King Abdullah and His Highness the Prince
Noticeably in the Gulf
Over a hundred years ago
It was bright, honorable, and based on trust.
I want to define the scope of misunderstanding between the two parties.
This issue was addressed and there were no conditions.
In solving any issue
But there was understanding and there was sincere intent between the parties.
To resolve this pending issue
And their relationship is not seasonal but strategic.
We hope it doesn't continue, but evolves.
Nice diplomatic talk.
Saudi Arabia withdraws its ambassador from Qatar.
I'm not used to speaking in a diplomatic way, otherwise I would have prevented a lot of problems.
I always say what I believe.
Saudi Arabia, so it's not diplomacy but attestation.
The topic of the island falls under media.
Between the parties, many countries got involved in the middle.
Believing that it might take getting points by stripping them from other countries' accounts.
Or at Qatar's expense
Or at the expense of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
For reconciliation within the Gulf house.
I mean, unlike before.
It's part of a political agreement.
No, no, there was no agreement, only an agreement of love and interest.
But otherwise, you can ask the island management.
Have you built strategic relationships with Saudi Arabia to prevent what happened before?
It originally relied on a close strategy.
Can we say it in one, two, three, and four?
And there must be unity.
Some disputes were settled on this basis.
Between some Arab countries and attempts to reconcile other differences.
Because now, if we observe the differences in the Arab world, they are all differences based on different points of view.
When we have a viewpoint on a certain policy in a certain procedure in a certain issue, and another state has a different opinion.
It is considered two points of view.
Some observers see that you enjoy criticizing Saudi Arabia.
His criticism
Were you tired and decided to take a different path, and from there moved to a bigger country, which is Egypt?
Okay, same idea.
No, no, we don't enjoy either this or that, we have nothing to do.
To deal with any party in this manner
I mean, the reasons for the dispute with Saudi Arabia are over.
There is a great deal of understanding between them, and I know that.
And you know that we stayed.
And there will be some kind of model.
But Saudi Arabia
Let me put this under two lines.
You started disputes with the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram, issue eighteen, last April.
The Egyptian Official Gazette
In a comprehensive investigation, it was stated that the inquiries had been extended.
In Hezbollah's network, a sabotage plot was uncovered.
Targeting Egypt, three countries are involved: Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
And a media buzz known for its conspiratorial role
Qatar, the smallest Arab country.
Conspiring against Egypt
We respect.
And his struggle over the years.
I'm not saying this to manipulate anyone emotionally.
Let me finish, I'm not done yet.
We can
Egyptian President
And who is cautious?
On Arab relations
The first point
Gaza issue.
As they say, and as we admit.
Qatar is
A smaller-sized state
It could be part of these plans.
Because we have suffered from interventions by other countries in the past, and I don't want to go back to that.
After the intervention of some countries in domestic affairs.
Therefore, the policy of His Highness's government
Now that they've discovered what they call a conspiracy.
What I'm trying to say is that for the house, God can protect it, Syria and Iran can defend themselves, I'm not going to defend them.
If the situation stabilizes in Egypt.
And why would Qatar want to change or interfere in such a matter?
And the pyramids do not bring things out of nothing.
It was said that the small state of Qatar sought to undermine Egypt's role and its relations with Turkey and the European Union.
And you sought to organize a conference parallel to the Arab Summit to steal the spotlight.
And you're using a media outlet, which is Al Jazeera.
Yes, please.
With Hezbollah
And we are uncomfortable with that.
But I can say that we're certain.
"That we"
The principle is non-interference in such circumstances.
They oppressed our brothers in Egypt, and that's why we hold the Egyptian authorities accountable.
The dispute with some members of the Egyptian government
But some officials have problems with
By what?
I'm coming to that.
Days of the sweet scent of peace, the cause of peace, and us.
Was previously held in Egypt.
And later with us.
Because of Israel.
We have a disagreement with him.
You have no quarrel with Israel.
And now, because of the conference, from that day on.
Any Islamic conference, any Arab conference, they have sensitivity.
This is an allergy.
Why don't you sit with them?
Let me finish.
We always hope for the best.
We discovered that this is an allergy.
Or three
Gaza Conference, which was held.
Egypt does not want to be held in Qatar.
Not Arabic
I'm in Qatar and there's a summit in Kuwait, we told them that.
The Palestinian people are under attack.
For more than two weeks
But we hold it before any arranged conference, the Kuwait conference where we were the first to attend.
People are being killed and
And with procrastination
The conflict began.
Not even a small country can
I know there are some brothers in the government, and this is also an insult to Egypt, not to anyone else.
When they said this later on.
Okay, you're on the island.
The Israelis had reported the day before that there was a cessation of hostilities in place prior to any speeches, any individuals, or anything else.
What is this?
Brother, let medicine and food enter through the beating our brothers had to endure.
Once they said the gate was secure.
No trucks allowed.
As soon as they tell us there's an agreement from the other side and that they have to come.
Now is not the time we want to bring up Fatah or Hamas.
I don't care about Fatah or Hamas; we've been concerned about the one and a half million who are being beaten.
And those who have no medicine.
When we started talking about this topic and the Gaza conference.
Qatar's intervention in the matter affects the Egyptian regime.
It's not interference.
We did not say how Egypt would resolve the situation, as that falls within its own jurisdiction.
An official said, "We uncovered a major plot through this."
He hasn't told us what the plot is yet.
We, meaning this is official.
He tells us that Egypt is of great importance.
Well, we understand that Egypt is a large Arab country, and we always say that Egypt is a big country.
That's why we always ask a lot of questions of a big country.
Because Egypt is ours.
And I was invited to a conference where there was also provocation for them.
We weren't invited to the conference.
Reconstruction of Gaza
We coordinated and took a unified stance.
People are suffering in Gaza.
Forbidden, I know Turkey entered things through Israel.
I would be happy to see him enter through our brothers in Egypt.
They are part of us.
And if Egypt wins or does good political work
We believe that this is in the interest of Qatar and the entire Arab world.
Egypt's stability is very important to us.
If he does a good job, that's important to us.
Let me finish your question, your presentation took a quarter of an hour.
Now it's that you've lost me but
No, I'll tell you, I'll tell you now anger.
Upon you from the Egyptian regime's officials
We are responsible for the failure of the Qatar summit.
The second thing is that they are the ones who failed at the Qatar conference.
King Abdullah had the wisdom he desired.
And he wanted to make peace.
That's why they intervene and prevent some countries from attending.
I have said this word to our brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia because we
Do not contradict Saudi Arabia even on this point.
Because, as shown, there are internal problems.
Or an official
Among high-ranking officials
A large country finds it hard to believe that a small country is doing such things.
It means he was there for you.
To take on any role
Darfur is part of the national security of Egypt and Sudan.
The five major countries decided.
Any country other than Qatar would be suitable.
But these sensitivities will only exacerbate the situation. Why must you interfere in everything that's close to you?
We want to resolve this allergy, take an antihistamine, they should tell us what this allergy is.
Why this sensitivity?
That some brothers from the government
They want, they have an internal holiday.
They want to draw attention to a plot in Gaza, a revolution.
As the English say, it's the Italians' fault.
Whenever something happens
Not only for instructions but also for analytics.
We know what happened because
The issue must be resolved locally.
And it was not resolved.
No, my priority is my country.
My priority is to first investigate the reasons that concern my country.
Then check if I have enough time.
And to investigate the causes that concern my Arab nation.
Or Qatar tried to reconcile.
And thinking about any Arab issue can contribute to it as much as possible.
Why is it provocative? Why isn't it taken in good faith?
I can't fix you.
I can explain my point of view.
Don't throw it at me.
From our perspective
What emanated from his heart.
Let me finish.
When an initiative for reconciliation was announced and all the presidents gathered in Kuwait, we hoped for something good, and I welcome this.
There are dictations.
Of course, the Egyptian official who clarified his heroism.
In a report, television interview, or something similar, I will not respond to him.
Because I have an answer for every point.
But to maintain the minimum of relations that bind us and the Arab interests.
It is also a response to the call mentioned by the Servant of the Two Holy Mosques.
But what I can advise him and others is
And they try to correct their mistakes, whether from within or without.
In politics, economics, or otherwise, just as we have our mistakes in politics and economics, no one is infallible.
Because they accuse Qatar of all these charges.
Do you deny the existence of a relationship between Qatar and Hezbollah?
This is a funny topic.
To distort Egypt's relations, undermine its role, and disrupt its engagement with Turkey and the European Union.
While we are primarily a small number.
If we can pull this off.
This is not correct.
There are some accusations directed at you personally.
To pay money to the prisoners held by Shalit in exchange for Qatar taking over Shalit and surpassing the Egyptian role in this matter.
They always accuse us of paying money, but we didn't pay any money and we didn't talk to anyone about paying money.
But this situation
We support Egypt in resolving the issue, just as we support Egypt and continue to support it in resolving the Palestinian cause.
It is he who allowed the Palestinian president to reside until the issue is resolved.
We were there and among the first to support the State of Qatar.
In the meantime, and in order for Palestinian institutions to remain in place until the conflict is resolved.
And we said that
"He was at the Arab League, but he said no, we achieved this because we believe that some people don't want this."
But we did it cleverly.
Is he addressing his boss?
His Prime Minister
I honestly don't know if there's a problem.
I don't know which one of us it is.
They decided now in the twelfth issue in last April exclusively with Al-Shorouk newspaper.
The political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a satellite news channel to counter media outlets, so-called Al Jazeera, and put an end to
It's a matter of days and everything will be over.
Are you afraid that Al Jazeera TV will become a thing of the past?
Do you mean that we are now living in a political adolescence?
You also visited Saudi Arabia, and the Emir of Qatar sat with the Saudi king.
We didn't negotiate with them, and they didn't negotiate with us.
We treated them like brothers.
A small state's settlement in favor of the large state Egypt.
There is an important point we need to clarify regarding Saudi Arabia.
The relationship between Qatar and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is different.
And then we'll talk.
Well, what about the relationship between Qatar and Egypt?
We rely on him heavily.
Let me be frank with you.
Or is it a disagreement on the main policy?
I hope it's not a personal issue, because we have no personal issues. I told you, we respect the Egyptian people.
If I asked you, you'd say there are two problems: Gaza, and what else?
This situation has affected us all severely.
We want to solve this from a psychological perspective, meaning to resolve this impasse.
Published in some newspapers
Minister of Foreign Affairs
In the presence of Prince Saud al-Faisal
We talked about everything.
But it's clear that things got worse and weren't resolved.
No, no, listen.
I cannot tell you about our relationship with Egypt.
They blame us, and that's their right as our brothers.
And we cannot blame them for that; it is their right as our young brothers.
With this great homeland, we do not wish to compare ourselves to any other great homeland.
I mean, Egypt is big enough for satisfaction.
It's not a matter of life or death, but for the solution to come from heaven.
For us, if there is anyone waiting for satisfaction.
Or wait for a way.
In Qatar
You will deal with neither nobles nor brothers.
As a great nation, yes, we are proud of Egypt as a great nation.
But if there is someone who misleads someone else
I know Israel is doing this to us.
Also, is the previous American policy under the previous administration for me or against me?
So I think they don't want to imitate Israel or America in this matter.
Also, if we take their policies, they are under pressure from third parties as well.
Often, let me finish.
We understand and know that even a large country has some limitations.
What controls your policies?
We have no movement, only one thing moves us.
Qatar's internal affairs, this is our internal matter.
And whenever we can help the Arab world, we will.
Sources of power: the island and Al Udeid base.
You could say this isn't strength?
Our faith in God and our trust.
Or seeing our Highness the Prince
We don't want to disturb anyone.
Let me finish, we don't want to cause any problems for anyone.
And we don't want to compete with anyone.
They can say what they want, Qatar is great or not.
But we have a point of view.
First, we expelled the Israeli office and closed it down.
At first they said, "Close the office," so we did. Then they got upset and went to complain to the Americans. Do you believe these people?
Join the team called the Devil's Team.
What they say.
Americans, Europeans, and my friends—we know how to deal with them.
Plots
That was made.
This is a flaw. We've reached a certain point, and then what?
Tell me now.
In points, how will you solve the problem with Egypt?
And based on the fact that Egypt plays a significant role in the Arab world.
We believe it is important to consider the matter.
And I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak was cautious about that.
But some of the crew
I must leave.
Occupying Egyptian public, government, or other opinion or leadership with nonsense.
And focus on Arab and Egyptian interests.
Are there any steps?
We are behind them, not ahead of them, because they are a great nation.
In the near future
Frankly, I can't imagine how this will happen.
And I know there's a time for reason.
And there will be a time for either of us.
If it's from me.
Or them
Great Arab interests brought them together.
One day we will find this out.
Do you mean that life is still moving forward?
Meaning, we won't respond in the same Egyptian style you're using.
If someone lends us a hand, we'll give them an arm.
Now His Highness Sheikh
We were never used to running.
Unless it was well-founded and we were ready to go to Egypt.
Standing with Egypt
There are many rumors about Egyptian workers in Qatar and how they were affected by this matter.
And there are contracts for Egyptians working either in universities or high-ranking positions.
You know it's not our habit to cancel work and back out on this matter.
Because these people have nothing to do with this matter.
This is a market that is seeing changes in orders, they are canceling one order and adding another.
It's supply and demand, and there are other nationalities that have increased and others that have decreased.
Okay, a quick answer.
The office was there.
We've disturbed the office, so it's best we leave now.
But we had rung him up on the days when they had a campaign, all our losses in negotiations with Israel were because of this office.
So we closed it, and let them fix it with Netanyahu.
He was a guest.
And among them were the ambassadors accredited to any foreign state, as is our custom to invite them all.
So it wasn't an official invitation to honor Gabriela Shalev.
No, we didn't honor her before when the relations, as they say, were good. We'd like to honor her now, but it's become a bit difficult.
There's no compelling reason to reopen the office during this period.
The office will reopen when there are no further reasons.
You have achieved great success.
Who made it the size of Egypt?
Egypt imposed this.
Let me be clear with you, our relations with America are strategic.
In some matters, this
What's the most important thing?
There are issues in our region regarding the resolution of some matters over which we had disagreements with the previous administration.
Now we have high hopes for the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe there is great hope in this administration.
Serious about advancing the peace process and serious about resolving the Palestinian issue.
They are our friends, and we don't deny it.
What is happening in Iran? And what could its impact be on the Gulf and on you?
Iranians must decide how to solve their issues.
Among them
In their usual way, and I'm sure they'll overcome this crisis.
Iran's stability is similar to what the Emir of Qatar mentioned.
It is important for our region, the Gulf region, and we share the same borders with Iran.
Of course, we have special relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because our country seeks peace and stability for this region.
And we intervene whenever anyone wants to change the Doha Agreement.
And I believe that Saad Hariri said
Now it's over, and what remains is the strategic talk between the president.
And Lebanese groups
How to see
Yemen has no role for you or they have taken a position.
Listen, it's known that we supported unity while most of the Arab world opposed Yemeni unity.
We are the only Arab country and Gulf state that stood with the unity of Yemen.
And to the south, we spoke with Yemen, and His Highness the Amir sent me twice to meet the Yemeni president.
I explained to him that our goal is to stabilize Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
This agreement was not respected, and I don't want to say what each party did.
But what really affected me
Was it Qatar that took this position and then was accused of paying money to the Houthis and senior Yemeni officials?
Because we don't interfere in such matters.
And whoever stands with unity does not stand against it.
Another goal is in the interest of Yemen, whether politically, economically, or otherwise.
We don't mind, but to be honest, I'm shocked.
Because I went more than ten times during the fighting, His Highness sent me among the Yemenis to Yemen.
Unfortunately, this is a strange accusation.
The time is up, but briefly tell me these problems that occurred to you due to your pursuit of solving problems, will it change your policies of intervening in other Arab problems?
If only His Highness had listened to me, I think it wouldn't be necessary.
There was a big show once.
Over five billion dollars at that time, if we had invested it, it would have been fifty billion dollars, better than a headache.
But I say it with faith, because perhaps the time is now in the Arab world.
Not allowed under these circumstances.
Thank you very much.
Perhaps even exceptionally with Sheikh Hamad's situation.
What happened to the agreement in Doha?
How did the Doha Miracle happen?
To mandate the committee and provide it with all necessary support.
To discuss Lebanon after the Israeli invasion.
When there was an Arab consensus
We went to New York and were able to make the decision with a little balance.
And we looked into this in Doha so that both parties would be keen.
We tried as hard as we could not to hear him, otherwise he wouldn't be there.
Because we knew the committee, we knew.
The reality on the ground and we know what the problem is after we sat with the Lebanese for long hours.
I believe it's a common success.
But there was a determination.
I believe that Lebanon's problem is that the atmosphere of the region directly reflects on it.
Whether peaceful or non-peaceful
Lebanon was supposed to be the specific location for this.
Under these conditions
And unfortunately
External repercussions
I can say that the problem between Lebanese, even if there is a problem, won't be the first one.
Well, Sheikh, I know that perhaps the time is not now and maybe it's too early to talk about behind-the-scenes, but
What happened when you came here?
Stop, somewhat, talking about the engagement in reality now.
You didn't delay even for a second.
I knew exactly what was going on, even the Lebanese leaders were telling me what had happened.
Not from the beginning.
When I spoke to His Highness
I told him if we went to Lebanon.
I will present the idea that he graciously approved and supported.
Where will all the Lebanese leaders be present?
Because here in Beirut you'll have to go to each person's area separately.
While they are in the same hotel and the same place.
And they met on the same plane and talked.
So we created this atmosphere, but from the beginning, our idea was
And this was the most important decision the two of them had made.
Of course
And I felt this from the Arab League.
So we must be honest brokers.
Praise be to God, I think this has proven to everyone that Qatar has made an effort.
On both sides.
To reach a fair solution for both parties.
And that there will be a solution and no one will lose.
Before you make any move.
The consultation was held at the Arab League and we found great support.
From what we have done.
And I told him while we were there.
If we succeed in Lebanon, we'll take them to Doha.
And he advised me.
To freeze them and confiscate their mobile phones.
We were able to get them there, and the brothers in Syria also supported the situation.
And I told you from the beginning that without Arab support, the committee can't do anything.
Why did they want the solution?
I believe that the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that occurred.
And this is the time.
There is tension in Somalia. There is tension in Sudan.
There are many things going on in the world.
And whenever we extinguish a fire
It would be in the best interest of the Arab world to avoid foreign interventions.
We do our best.
He sends troops.
Even if he's a soldier.
For example, I think this is a topic.
There's a point of discussion.
He always said that solving the Lebanese file
Saudi-Syrian Agreement
To stop the Arabs, I mean Qatar and the Arab League.
Could what happened in Lebanon lead to serious reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Syria?
I need a self-assessment in the Arab world.
Due to Arabic variations.
And any agreement between two Arab states.
And we tried this.
In the war of seventy-three
When Arabs agree on a solution to a problem.
I think it's interesting.
Saudi Arabia and Syria play a significant role in Lebanon.
Both parties must
Gain wisdom.
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because we here in the Arab world face many great challenges.
Everyone is playing in our yard.
We have no power or might.
And how can we stop playing in the square of Arab countries?
As Arabs, we have at least a minimum of agreement.
Unfortunately, we complain.
While we watch
Our disagreement as Arabs and the absence of trust among us; trust is missing between Arab countries.
and the Arab states
It's not so much betrayal as it is a kind of...
Jealousy, what is the word?
This is a matter that needs support from everyone, I mean, I think so.
Alright, will you make this wish come true and actually call for an Arab summit?
We suffer when you suffer and rejoice when you rejoice.
He came in the middle of the conversation.
So, is it possible to play a role in repairing the situation between Damascus and Riyadh even if?
Eager to find solutions, and I'm sure of their wisdom.
They may reach an understanding.
Among them in many cases.
There was consensus in politics, and I am sure that, God willing, this will continue.
Relations have improved.
It takes a step from both sides.
But I can't be sure that's what's happening now.
I am sure that if Arabs focus on resolving disputes among Arab countries and the problems of some Arab states that I mentioned earlier.
Optimism and a sense of pride for the citizen in the existence of a general Arab awakening.
But I can't say what happened in Lebanon.
It can be interpreted on the ground that there is an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
There might be an American-Iranian escalation, and perhaps other cases.
Will you still be afraid of him in the coming months?
We, as Arabs
We cannot only deliver food and medicine.
Electricity for the people.
We in Qatar are ready and His Highness is always prepared.
More than one and a half million Palestinians are besieged.
And we do not want them to have weapons or support.
They do all this.
No electricity.
And we give it to the Red Cross to deliver it to the Palestinians.
With the Palestinians, we only provide them with food and medicine.
And our rivalry with them can continue.
And I hope that Palestinians on both sides will put the national interest first.
Leave illusions behind.
The Palestinian rift is now a deep wound.
To find a solution.
But they didn't do that.
This is a dangerous matter, they must adhere to the Mecca Agreement.
And they have to ask even to go again to Mecca and Saudi Arabia.
And this disagreement was resolved.
They won't benefit.
And any promises from any party
I wish there were a solution, but
Our position is known and has been conveyed to all concerned parties that we
We will not be a part of it and we will not accept being a part of any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with her.
But we are a sovereign state and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone is looking out for their own interests, but these interests won't harm them or us.
We believe that the destiny of the Gulf should be in clear harmony with the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf.
Iran seeks cooperation and peaceful neighborhood.
But when Your Excellency says that Qatar is not a party.
Any details or clarifications?
Just a sign.
No, never.
Alright, I'd like to go back to the Lebanese file if that's okay.
Frankly, Your Excellency the Minister, we were facing a big deadlock, but we reached a solution in the last few hours.
Some linked what happened to what was announced.
The information might be disparate and unrelated, but that's what happened.
That led you to this conclusion.
What happened in Istanbul, do I know if it has specific dates before?
So you knew there were negotiations?
Continuously seeking a solution.
Undoubtedly, the support of the Kingdom is very important.
And change negotiation tactics.
These negotiations were led by her.
Leading to a positive outcome, we gathered some parties from various sources.
And we started talking.
There is an Arab and Qatari approach in this paper.
Tell me what's wrong with this paper.
And we started talking about the subjects one by one.
In the last moment, overcome the obstacle and keep going.
But the prince met with the parties.
I got rid of this obstacle.
And there was a solution.
We heard a word from the Emir of Qatar at the opening session in Doha.
You don't consider your role now.
Listen, the most important thing is that we stay out of the spotlight.
We have no territorial ambitions.
Or even to have control over another state or something like that because our state
Our size... We are proud of ourselves and believe that we can contribute to solving problems with our colleagues.
But in the Arab world, this is very important.
For countries to be
I want them to do something, and it's important.
Allow some small countries to take on and support this role.
Excellent in some things, good in others, and less than good in some.
The last question, Your Honor.
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority?
"Security or Reforming Hostility"
or confront Israel
We stop playing in the Arab court.
We are fixing our problems in the Arab countries.
To choose an active member in Iraq
To calm things down
Nationally and regionally
But if we become stubborn
Or he will have any hope.
Thank you, His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, for this meeting.
And international efforts to end the ongoing war on Gaza.
We start by requesting you to convene a meeting of the Council of the League of Arab States at the ministerial level.
As if you'd changed your mind about
Request for an emergency Arab summit
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. First of all, I am delighted, my brother Hassan, to be on this program.
Despite the humanitarian situation
Facing our brothers in Gaza.
Circumstances demand a lot from us.
Qatar did not ignore the Arab summit.
In fact, when we went with the idea of the Arab summit previously.
Not only the Security Council resolution, but also through
It should not be stepped on or underestimated.
Let me rephrase it in another sentence.
And we learn discipline.
That the street can no longer bear it, if we forgive as officials responsible for the Arab street.
That will not be tolerated.
When we were in Egypt
There were between ten and eleven written approvals.
Some spoke at the meeting and it was possible to hold a meeting.
Let's keep it as long as there is an Arab consensus.
And I don't blame them if, in a meeting, they might have a point of view.
And how can the problem be solved?
Because it will be solved.
This is the important matter.
Because our goal is not promotion and advertising, but discovery.
Does that mean I didn't underestimate the summit?
We even ask ourselves
We'll go to put pressure on the miserable other side.
The previous and subsequent Security Council resolution, but let's just stay on the topic of the Arab summit, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Speak clearly that the situation may require an Arab summit with whoever attends.
We found that the majority of our brothers support holding the summit.
With whom is he coming?
And I have no idea what they mean by "moderation."
We are the only nation.
Only the Arab nation, if we go to any nation in Asia or Latin America.
Unsolved
That were classified as moderate states
And what is moderation in our view?
Will you abandon the Palestinian cause?
Just because we don't like them.
Are we interfering in the affairs of the Palestinians in some way?
No nation allows interference, whether good or bad.
Like Hezbollah, and who knows, maybe another movement will emerge tomorrow.
Does he ask?
And can we accept them as part of the Arab body?
As if it's our destiny to engage in an internal Arab conflict.
Alright, then let's go to the Security Council.
There is no decision in the Security Council.
I hope that after Israel finishes its mission
Well, the second Arab ministerial meeting I was invited to attend.
Which was dominated by discussions, disagreements, and sharp arguments.
There is an important point.
This is not important.
When we call for a meeting
About terminals.
No peace anymore.
Is the minister ready for that?
Because there's a party telling you we should wait.
But we are in an Arab initiative.
Freezing peace negotiations with Israel.
We say that we are in a party that says we will lose in this.
There is a greater loss than the one we have incurred now, but we have always been respectful, polite, and abiding by decisions since the days of the truce.
You say that disagreements are unimportant.
There was someone who wished that Hamas could be destroyed and something like that.
This expresses a political stance more than it does a disagreement between one minister and another.
Unfortunately, that's what happened.
But not everyone.
I don't want to speak for others.
It is important to be men to ourselves and men to our nation.
We follow the policies of our countries.
Who does these kinds of things on his behalf?
I think
I think they won't respect us in the end.
Yes, is there anyone doing things on behalf of the West?
No, and I hope I don't accuse anyone, I don't want to accuse anyone about this.
After the Security Council resolution
What is his agenda?
The situation began with a decision of Arab efforts.
And the disagreement here is if Israel implements the decision immediately.
We can say that there is a decision.
But Israel did not implement the resolution.
Are we ready now to go and ask for Chapter Seven? I know for sure there are difficulties.
He is not questioned by the international community, even if he is asked.
He will be shy.
The situation
Make sure they did something for the Jews and the Israelis.
To restore their rights
This is the current Arab situation.
If the Arabs don't go to the Security Council.
And we agree to hold a summit and make decisive decisions.
And the West will try to influence us.
Because we are in the Arab world, and there are a lot of people, and you can see how the Arab street is reacting to this.
But this decision is important.
With the issue of contacting our chiefs one after another.
In the end, they said there was nothing and that he was lying.
Alright, if we're now like Germany, otherwise, shall we demand it?
They don't have to pay any compensation because they initiated the attack, just say you have incorrect information.
And hundreds of thousands were killed.
This is because you are a weak Arab party.
We went as Arabs, some of us.
Work hard on how to
For his contribution
As much as it is destined and God's will.
If the Arab nation says, "If you send forces to Darfur, we will send forces to Darfur."
Arabs considered, or some considered, the decision 1860.
And our colleagues worked hard to get the decision passed.
Issued by the Security Council
I don't want to say whether it was a victory or not.
And what will lead to
Let's assume that victory...
What will we do?
We're supposed to not be included with the rest of the resolution.
But I assure you that we will comply with the decision.
Unfortunately, you will comply with the decision even though you shouldn't.
Even after the Israeli rejection, Israel came and agreed.
This means us.
Will you have an alternative, or better yet, are you the one calling for a ministerial meeting?
I don't believe in the Arab nation.
In the meantime, he is open to alternatives.
And I don't think the Arab nation is ready.
In implementing the Gaza blockade
For various political reasons
To make one faction prevail over another in Palestine instead of reconciling them.
We start by trying to make plans.
Once they met, I don't know, some European and Arab intelligence agencies or something like that, without mentioning names.
And once they did that, I mean we engaged.
In implementation
What is required of us from the West?
But if we go
I want there to be order in this.
Of course, I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about...
The follow-ups because the Gaza issue started two years ago, not now.
I'll speak about the topic two years ago but specifically regarding the decision.
Do you have reservations about his conditions?
Not issued or implemented
We weren't invited.
They might think we have a different perspective.
It was required that everyone agree on the same viewpoint.
It's not necessary for everyone to share the same viewpoint, but I think those who went made an effort.
And we thank them for that.
Regarding what happened in Gaza two years ago, there were fewer parties involved.
The victory of one group over another among those who participated in the siege of Gaza.
Do you really agree with the statements, insinuations, or accusations that have been made here and there?
About a real Arab conspiracy with everything that's happening now in Gaza.
We were partially informed.
Through the case, let me tell you that we are completely in the dark.
But I know.
The Palestinian conflict
He was fed at both the Arab and international levels.
And if it weren't full of fuel, they wouldn't differ much.
And that was after the elections.
And Hamas came and took control.
By a majority vote
I should've given them a chance and seen.
Do they want reform, or are they still revolutionaries who only know weapons and fighting?
But the day they came
At the level of the Arab world, some of our brothers believed that these extremist movements should not reach power.
Some say that an assault has just occurred.
Did Hamas, who breached the truce, make it, or those Palestinians from Gaza who breached the truce?
Truce
He remains while the people of Palestine in Gaza starve for two years.
No problem.
For reasons relating to Israel's security
It's clear we don't want them in power, but that doesn't concern me in Qatar.
But what about the rest of the people?
And then who decides?
These or those, not every country has sovereignty in choice.
Our government
The main problem is
But I'm sure it could have been solved.
If we had worked hard, we would have worked hard to ignite the conflict.
But it is clear that we were asked to allow one group to excel over the other because this group...
We consider them terrorists or we consider it.
Everything that happened led to
Even the promises they made to the party that they would provide them with a decent life.
They didn't do anything for them.
We return to the international and Arab efforts exerted to put an end to what is happening, as you mentioned.
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has rejected so far.
And there's the Egyptian Initiative, that one.
And Egypt is in Cairo.
Those Egyptian efforts
Not at all, it's not a loophole.
That is required for a high-ranking position.
Egypt's borders are also adjacent to Israel and Palestine.
That we
And we will not stop the chaos now.
In Gaza, we are bringing people together to stop the chaos in Gaza because
This is not the path to peace.
Must be
Therefore, we always ask them for a big role.
What was announced?
Does that mean you can't assess the initiative now?
Either to give a chance for success or to study.
I believe in his chances of success.
If the brothers in Egypt are able to
Bring Palestinian perspectives closer together.
The person who should discuss the initiative is the affected party in Gaza.
Because he is the one who can say yes or no.
And this is an important point.
When Resolution 1860 was issued
This is an Arab-Palestinian problem we have.
We don't want to hear about any party.
But I really wanted it, when the Palestinian delegations went.
And when they went to the league, they asked to have someone from Gaza with them.
To show the Israelis that these are our brothers and that we are with them.
This is an important point.
We don't allow authority.
Our goal should be, not to build our policy.
To stay in power.
The sheikh now.
I don't know if it's possible to discuss the Egyptian initiative since you haven't reviewed its articles yet, but
Do you think, in principle, that this could be suitable as a mechanism to implement UN Resolution 1860, as some people have stated?
Balanced role
Now, not tomorrow or the day after, because
Each day passes.
There will be bloodshed for our brothers there.
Therefore, we do not want to delay or have the Israelis delay on this matter, and when they finish their mission we will put forward this initiative.
And I am sure that the brothers in Egypt know this and think about it deeply.
I want to clarify everything I said.
Now we have to solve this problem.
And not in the way Israel wants.
I've been drawn to the Turkish role since the beginning of the crisis.
Does it express?
Arab vacuum
Undoubtedly, it's an eye-catching position.
And he has an Arab depth.
An Introduction to Arab Disability
We are aware of an Arabic disability.
Part of it was due to disagreements.
Partly due to differing viewpoints, everyone believes their perspective is the correct one.
And another person thinks that his point of view is better.
No conscience, how do you allow people to respect and know that there is an Arab decision?
Or they will chase us one by one.
The last one will say no, it's okay, we'll give them two or three extra days until we contact them and bring the colleagues up to speed and solve the problem.
We must move beyond this and not accept it.
Hamas may have mistakes, but we will deal with them.
At the Arab level
But for now
At least we say no to them.
Within the required stance for the State of Qatar, and positions such as, we will return to this point later but
And also in the playground at the same time you heard
Yesterday, Khaled Mashal, the head of the Political Bureau of the Hamas movement.
First, everything Brother Khalid Meshaal said was unnecessary, with all due respect and appreciation to him.
Why don't you sit with Khaled Mashal and talk to him as Arabs?
We'll go to him at the Arab League and tell him.
This is an important conversation.
I am from Hamas.
Imposing conditions, Israel also imposes conditions.
Let them impose conditions, aren't they allowed to impose conditions while Israel can?
First, what do you think of this Arabic gift?
We are cows and should not listen to this people once, they say De Gaulle did not listen.
It's completely different; first and foremost, de Gaulle liberated his country.
By himself or with his allies, he liberated his country from a blazing occupation.
Now, what are we talking about?
Is this the Arabic gift that is supposed to?
Leaders must represent the views of their people.
The Arab people in all those demonstrations we have witnessed.
Can be fulfilled from these required rows.
Also, many who criticize Qatar in this situation demand that
What's going on with the actor while the office is still open.
They don't speak the same language.
To cut ties, we will go with all Arab countries.
Sever the relationship, and all connections, even if someone claims there's a treaty.
They just want Qatar to sacrifice itself.
That we
This is more important than the relationship.
Not only in this decision, but in this decision and in harder decisions.
From this decision
It means we should have a unified Arab stance.
For others
No one sells to another with the aim of achieving spiritual, material, or similar gains.
Yes, before we close this file on this subject, there are also countries that have taken individual steps.
Hugo Chávez is a different case, he has disputes with the United States.
Our people do not need us to remind them.
Five permanent member ambassadors presented arguments about these films.
We're done with that, and the street now knows better.
With the high ceiling, His Highness the Sheikh
Or demanding that the Lebanese forces confront the Israeli aggression, and so on.
Do you think it might work if it's framed within a single Arab framework?
But we call for an Arab stance that makes people respect us.
I don't think the Arab countries are ready to fight.
"Nor that we encourage"
How will you unite Syria, Lebanon, and other countries when there are Arab states that don't even talk to each other?
There must be.
A shift in Arab relations.
This is the current policy now among Arab states.
It's still there, but I think it's already expired.
In goals
The important issue
And we know how the Lebanese structure is.
There is no doubt that Lebanon
He gave an example if it regained its territories.
The situation in Gaza will be different, they are still
Surrounded on all sides
This siege
Give a different nature.
Yes, I mean here the goals for Israel mean the procedural goals for Israel.
One day he beats someone, another day he punishes someone, and another day he pleases someone.
An example of this is what happened in Lebanon; it is not a good example for them.
The sample solution that became in Lebanon.
I consider it good.
For Gaza
The problem in Gaza or Palestine is easier to solve than in Lebanon.
Those who differ among themselves, should we recover our land today or tomorrow?
Their disputes revolve around power.
On the distribution of power
That differs because they are closer to each other intellectually.
More than a Lebanese intellectual.
Therefore, the solution is much easier.
And herein lies the problem.
His Highness Sheikh
We have only a few minutes, so let's finish this up as best we can.
And a diplomat.
How can this process end?
I am a Palestinian from Gaza.
Let me tell you.
Or refuses
And help.
They didn't walk with us.
It will be an Arab failure.
In strategic terms
But on the Palestinian side
There were some efforts, but we didn't see a full initiative.
Not before, not now, why?
The problem is not as much about the initiative as we feel.
We help those who solve the problem without mentioning Qatar, as some people have an issue with naming Qatar.
No need to organize a summit, as there is already one scheduled for March.
If we take an initiative, we'll be better than our brothers. I don't think so.
And not pressuring them.
Because history will not forgive us if we pressure them.
We are going through this initiative, and we have seen all parties where there was a meeting on the fourth day and it was postponed due to the Security Council.
We hope, God willing, to make progress and wish that our Arab brothers will assist us as much as possible in this matter.
We hope to eliminate him from the competition.
Arab competition
In heating up matters due to their dispute with the Sudanese government at the time.
And these are our problems, well, we fight among ourselves and disagree.
I don't want to go through this.
In Kuwait, in the coming nineteenth month, I believe, of course, in the Arab situation.
As you know, as mentioned, and as explained by your excellency.
Is the entire Arab atmosphere supportive? Is this the first economic summit?
His Highness the Prince
Of course, we attend any summit held in a sister country.
And we do not object to attending any summit.
But he is not afraid to become a political summit.
Of course, taking into account that time imposes itself.
It's too late even if it's in ten days.
Are you talking about the Palestinians after they were beaten for twenty-five days?
Will be
Won't they say that the Arabs weren't able to achieve that?
We said that
We said that
With all due respect, this summit has been programmed and we are committed to it.
I guess we
The Arab street is against us.
In our way that we have taken
Therefore
Enter in peace.
And say, "This is all there is, and it is guaranteed."
For this meeting
Thank you, audience, for watching.
Coverage of the ongoing war on Gaza continues. Goodbye.
A few days ago, a celebration was held for the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani
In Doha and contributed to the preparation of a special bill.
She was also a member of numerous local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
I have also delivered over seventy-five lectures, workshops, presentations, and a published article in Arab and international journals.
Initially, I won't agree on the term currently used.
To refer to people with disabilities, do we say "people with special needs" or, as you said, "people with disabilities"?
Good evening first.
Derived from a culture of human rights or a rights-based perspective, because persons with disabilities
Because she treated disabled people as people first.
Human
Then it led to his disability in trying to adapt to society.
The medical concept was predominant at that time.
Move towards the concept.
Special teaching and educational methods emerged.
This category has become
That's why we started calling them people with disabilities.
The standard rules from which they are derived.
The role of the Special Rapporteur in monitoring the implementation of this document.
And accelerated the pace until the appearance of the international convention, which was legally binding and distinguished from the rules in this regard.
And he set a fundamental condition or basic rule for this term.
That treats these people as humans, as people.
With the change in terminology as mentioned, is there a shift in society's perception of this group?
Yes, it is measured in a way.
Varies from region to region.
But the distinctive thing about this is...
That the Arab world was distinguished or differed.
However, legal trends include human rights, which exist, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons are probably lack of financial resources, right?
Of course, that's what I wanted to say, that culture exists but there is a lack of resources and sometimes a lack of political will.
Sometimes laws, but
But unfortunately, awareness is somewhat low, and there is no culture of human rights.
Ten percent of the world's population are disabled.
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities in developed countries are of working age.
And unemployment suffers.
I mean during my visit to Darfur.
Or with mines and weapons
Males are one degree better.
In addition to disabilities, they will be in remote and isolated areas.
Therefore, there are many institutional trends working in this field and trying to raise.
Awareness and Realizing the Right to Education
Instead of creating a lot of religious centers, somewhat.
They went on to establish rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
This is one of the things we are grateful for through our work in the office.
I tried with the current organization in Qatar.
To develop an agenda
Or include these humanitarian organizations' agendas to encompass those centers.
In light of the deteriorating conditions of persons with disabilities in the world
I can't name it, and I agree with you that there's a decline.
If there is a setback in the Arab region due to the state of disability.
Placed in the social context and in the political and economic context, we cannot expect the conditions of people with disabilities to be
While they are from marginalized groups.
In a country as I told you, like Gaza and Darfur.
On the contrary, I cannot assert that there has been no improvement in the situation.
And it was actually implemented on the ground, and if I can give an example, I would like to say
Qatar Red Crescent
We agreed that projects include
People with disabilities who have health issues within this strategy, and there are other programs.
We tried to include that as well.
On the ground, within the framework of action of organizations.
Kamal Kiro is with us now from Syria, welcome.
Good evening, I am Suleiman Kiro.
Solomon Kiro, excuse me, come in, Solomon.
My warmest regards to you and Madam Hafsa.
First, is there a mental barrier in the laws of the United Nations?
Cognitive impairment means that a healthy person has become a stressor that leads to cognitive impairment.
My son was left disabled due to torture and imprisonment, resulting in mental retardation. He is still undergoing treatment, six years later.
I know that there are around four hundred people, including children and the disabled, in the prison.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
In fact, I
Because they know them as they know their own children.
And the whole meaning without making themselves.
And there are values in the West.
Agreed upon, but people...
Some of them are apostates or do not follow the wisdom of Islam, and their testimony is not accepted.
Many thanks, Naif Saeed from Kuwait.
We go back to our guest for comment.
In the calls, Suleiman wondered if there was any mental impairment.
Yes, it's in the global ranking.
Regarding disabilities, and of course intellectual and mental disabilities as they are called.
Among these disabilities are sensory disabilities, meaning visual, auditory, or physical impairments.
Of course, as mentioned, disability is...
Interaction and reaction occur in a social context.
In the Arab world or any other regions
Certainly, processing the disability took a long time.
Even at the United Nations level
For example, during my experience and work as a special rapporteur, among the issues I tried to address and work on
In other words, it's everyone's right.
So that they may provide them
and various qualifying aspects to ensure they can join schools, as well as work organization.
Working in the field of vocational rehabilitation, which includes people with disabilities.
There were some improvements.
Especially after the reform
Generally, they are found in this international committee.
Me too, I mean as the special rapporteur.
The fact that my work was positive for me, even if it wasn't directly related.
Who supported this position?
I have seen him at many meetings, for example the international conference.
Rights of persons with disabilities
Disabled by these constraints or these shortcomings
For example, with regard to legal capacity.
This is one of the main points in the world of disability.
Unfortunately, the United Nations delayed it a bit during preparation and drafting.
Regarding institutions and agencies
For example, and I'll conclude with this.
I am governments of the world and non-governmental organizations members in the United States.
We have completed another survey.
In United Nations organizations and agencies in various regions
To find out how much disability is on their agendas.
If budgets are allocated, there should be inclusion for people with disabilities.
Human rights
And not just development issues.
We're receiving more calls. With us now is Meshri Naji from Algeria. Welcome, Naji.
You too
I wanted to ask my sister who exactly should be blamed.
I wanted to ask, I am originally physically disabled.
Alright, we'll direct this question to Naji Mishri from Algeria, thank you very much, Ahmed.
Welcome to the Greek hellebore.
Good evening, madam, good evening to your guest.
Healthcare, housing, seasonal clothing, and even welcoming them in seasonal tourism, this is what happens in Europe.
Will a mental patient be counted as disabled?
Especially those who can harm themselves or others.
Everything we're discussing falls within the realm of unproductive debate, thank you.
Sister Hassa mentioned the financial deficit.
In poor countries, especially in Africa and Latin America, I demand.
Establishing an international fund to support people with disabilities and allocating one percent of the net profit of every institution in the world.
This must be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
It will work to address the shortage faced by many people with disabilities, war victims, and others.
Thank you very much, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Mashri was wondering and mentioned his problem, stating that he is a person with special needs.
At the local or national level, that is, through Algeria.
The needs within the community must be met by the community itself.
Are these the same rights that should be granted to anyone else?
In other words, the right to life first, then the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education.
Therefore, I appeal from here and from this platform to governments, Arab governments in particular.
In the interest of the citizen and the individual
To ensure
Those needs and rights are within existing agendas.
No, there is no need to create any new devices.
To meet the needs of people with disabilities or not to, if the state.
And they can already be committed to performing.
I advise him first to return and refer to the competent authorities at the government level, if possible.
Because that falls within my national scope and should be within this scope.
You mentioned the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but there are many countries that have signed it but are not committed to it.
And here we have a caller's question: Why are there no laws?
It is certain that we are in a human society, which means there are many mistakes and much that is correct.
Certainly, many agreements and specifically many treaties do not entail a literal obligation to comply.
Or an ideal commitment for many countries that have joined many such as the CEDAW Convention and others.
But there are breaches and violations, and we know it.
But the question remains of adopting and organizing an agreement.
First, we will ensure the presence of awareness at the very least.
This awareness starts at the top of this pyramid with the decision-makers.
Officials, then gradually growing until it reaches the whole society.
In addition to the issue of our commitment to prepare reports and submit them to the United Nations.
The issue of knowledge, understanding, and a high degree of consciousness.
To the reports I worked on as a rapporteur at the United Nations were
Yes, from what I've seen and noted, there is interest.
So, there is a relative advantage to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
So I advise, encourage, and invite.
It is also important for people with disabilities to be...
And we will listen to what Ali Obeid Al-Sanari, President of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute, has to say.
Mr. Naji Saghrna will speak about that. Welcome to Mr. Naji and Mr. Ali as well.
Peace be upon you
And peace be upon you too.
With me is Mr. Ali Obeid Al-Sanara, Chairman of the Board of Directors at the Qatari Cultural and Social Center for the Deaf.
led by Her Excellency Sheikhha Hessa
Former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
As a deaf person from Qatar.
And in fact, Sheikhah Hessa, the President, had a long history.
The international agreement you are referring to now is, in fact,
Great benefit for all people with disabilities around the world.
Especially the Arab world.
And I wish as a deaf person
These countries are to implement this international agreement.
That will serve people with special needs, and it is essential that
Indeed, there should be someone who can activate this agreement in all states.
Obaid Al-Sanari, President of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute
We stop.
And here we continue our discussion after a short break, stay with us.
Share your views on important economic, political, and sports issues, as well as a variety of other topics.
Al Jazeera Direct Text Messaging Service.
Dear viewers, welcome to you and our guest today, Sheikhah Hessa Khalifa Al Thani.
Disability International Support Fund
Disability and the obligation for all countries to provide funding. What do you think of this proposal?
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Fund.
Unfortunately, these contributions are very weak.
Mission to monitor the implementation of normative rules
When I worked there for six years, there was no meaningful support.
Only from China and Austria.
And I always mean to thank this country for its support.
The main supporter of the country is my own, Qatar.
Who established the office, through which we were able to carry out many activities and projects. Praise be to God.
Yes, this lack of support indicates that...
I mean, as we mentioned at the beginning, and this point is always raised.
The conditions of ordinary people
So how is taking care of people with disabilities or caring for the disabled called?
It means that there is a realistic, genuine, and serious commitment.
In all circumstances, in all categories
People with disabilities, refugees, children, and displaced women.
All this may actually bring us to what is called a degree.
Equality of opportunity, participation, and equity.
And there are always voices that demand and never tire or get weary.
In the Islamic and Arab region, why don't we allocate a part, sorry.
In favor of these programs and projects
As he has presented it, and I thank him greatly from this platform.
Islamic Development Bank
Within the allocated budget
Non-compliance with what you told me regarding the payment of financial dues.
Does the funding allocated to assist people with disabilities cover developing countries and Arab states only, or?
Even developed countries don't provide.
I mean, the person before me, the Swede, yes.
Also some countries of the European Union
And of course, there are many countries, especially in the Arab region, that may not...
Even with the knowledge of this special course
In my case, I mean what happened.
In Sweden and China
In the Arab region, unfortunately, there were many promises, but alas, there was only one state.
We will talk about the Arab region, but
We have more connections with us Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar, Hamad welcome.
Peace be upon you
And you too
Welcome Dr. Sheikhah Hessa.
Almost ten.
We noticed that this girl suffers from a psychological disability.
What is your role towards a girl who suffers like her?
With her colleagues
Sometimes, even when we maintain
What is your role towards Qatari girls' children?
Many thanks to Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar, and Kروانan Bahjah from Kuwait, you are most welcome.
As they say, Sheikhah Hessa.
Why don't we keep our oil in the dark?
People with special needs can be relied upon.
And we can help them.
We have massive financial components.
We can break down the psychological barrier between us and them.
Boosting individual morale
And spend it on this noble cause.
This if we truly believe.
Thank you and appreciation to Sheikhah Hessa for all her efforts and everything she has done during her tenure as a Special Rapporteur.
With sincere gratitude and appreciation to her, and thank you to the State of Qatar for all it has provided for people with special needs.
Thank you very much, Aisha Mohammed from Qatar.
Peace be upon you, Professor Wasila.
And peace be upon you too.
And to your noble guest
Her Highness Princess Hessa
My question concerns prevention.
As they say, prevention is better than cure.
There is another level of disability, apart from wars and traffic accidents.
The genetic level may be due to families marrying their cousins.
I think it's a large percentage.
Leads to disability
Thank you very much, dear Sharif from Tunisia. Now I return to our guest.
The first caller was Hamad Al-Marri, and he was wondering.
Where does a girl with a disability go, a psychological disability?
And to whom should he go?
In every country
Certainly, there are services provided for all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether they are mental disabilities as mentioned or any psychological disabilities.
For schools
Previously, there was
Or I mean, private education in the Ministry of Education, which is now the Supreme Council of Education.
The flag-bearer Sherif from Tunisia pointed out something truly important.
and scientific research and so on.
Not only from the programs of institutions working in the field of disability, but even within campaigns.
Programs for ladies
All this has attracted many campaigns and programs to reproductive health.
I've talked about this aspect.
Adopts healthy strategies
Based on awareness.
To show the danger of marrying relatives
And genetic factors
I believe it was implemented in the State of Qatar.
Customs and traditions, but it certainly takes some time.
Especially in tribal societies.
But over time there will be a reaction against it, but some kind of legal commitment is necessary.
Yes, I interrogated Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and suggested allocating one percent of the budgets of Arab states.
To help the disabled, let me first
Yes, there is a statistical estimate carried out by the World Health Organization for the world as a whole.
There are approximately forty million people with disabilities, or thereabouts.
Half of them are women.
But these numbers are doubling.
Like studying in South Africa where they observed and proved.
Certainly, the statistics that emerged from the Iraq War and the Gaza War.
For every person killed, three more are maimed.
And since the Arab region has become the undisputed region of conflicts.
Even the suggestion presented by Crowan Behjat
One percent won't be enough.
To help people with disabilities in the Arab region.
The issue of percentages of people with disabilities or other marginalized groups.
Frankly and honestly, I don't think it fits with
That requires addressing their problems and needs.
It was confirmed that people with disabilities are the most neglected.
Disabilities were previously not taken into account by governments.
Correct, and this is linked to the culture of society and sometimes societal constraints.
When conducting the census by
Stakeholders
There is a person with special needs at home.
The only question asked was: Is there a person with a disability or not?
The relevant department and the concerned individuals therein
We cooperated in preparing the model.
We recommend more details.
First, specify the gender of the person with a disability, is it male or female?
Did he get help or not?
In fact, even if the figures are correct, we haven't reached an accurate conclusion.
Moreover, attention and care should be continuous. Fatima Al-Dosari is with us from Qatar. Welcome, Fatima.
And peace be upon you too.
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a child with special needs.
And I thank our esteemed Emir, Sheikh Hamad.
And his wife, Sheikh Moza, for embracing this category.
I'm truly proud to receive all this care and attention.
For her significant role
Latifa Al-Masefri, welcome!
Because they represent significant disturbances in society without awareness and without treatment.
Many thanks to Latifa Al-Mosaferi from Qatar for joining us today with Naseem.
Abdulkareem from Jordan welcomes Nesim.
Continue, Karim, we're listening to you.
And peace be upon you too.
May God bless you, and to be honest, I have an intervention.
First, I am a sound specialist and have worked in the State of Qatar for almost four years.
We had a month-long awareness campaign for speech and hearing issues.
We held conferences, lectures, and awareness campaigns about hearing impairment.
Now I want to talk about Jordan; I lived there for almost three years.
Frankly, he offers new and good services.
Frankly, it offers new services, whether material, moral, or non-material.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education, and resources.
Ministry of Education in public schools
In addition to our private institutes
They receive good support.
Okay, do you have a direct question? It's just due to time constraints, I apologize.
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan, there are excellent services, and I think they are outstanding.
Can you comment on viewers' questions?
A person working in this field.
Relevant to the subject.
I will also return to the issue of the agreement.
What is required once it obtains ratifications and accedes to it.
As a duty of the state or these organizations
Because it is based on the issue of the rights of these people, regardless of
And frankly, what
What can be done during that period for people with disabilities and why?
And now she wishes she had spoken.
Of course, I hope so.
I hope that this research or survey will measure this and that more high-quality research will be conducted in this area.
Also, it became clear to me from this experience.
Six years of experience
And coordination between Arab countries as well.
They also have roles, it's not just about rights, they receive rights.
Sheikhessa Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, the United Nations Special Envoy on Disability, thank you.
We now have the presenter from the League and Cup Channel, Lana on air, good morning Lana.
I am also pleased to welcome the distinguished captain in Umm Salal, Captain Ali Qasim.
Welcome, Ali!
Welcome %pw
Good morning
I'd like to open the floor for congratulations. Everyone can feel free to congratulate Lana, please.
I had a five-hour studio session, and another two-hour one the day before.
I congratulate Qatar, the land, the government, and the citizens. They deserve this international achievement.
I may have the opportunity to congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
And his heir apparent, Sheikh Tamim
Yes, of course, Lana. You are in the field of sports and one of the experts in this area, and you are very knowledgeable about these matters and this field.
Because even our file
And competitive, meaning we deserve the six-vote margin between us and the United States, fourteen votes for Qatar and eight for the United States.
That was because our file was rich, comprehensive, and supported by many ambassadors, very well supported, for example, by the stadiums.
Perhaps some people were afraid, and perhaps there were some bullies, like in the United States.
And some countries may be willing, do not need to provide venues, and prepare some projects specifically for this event.
Because they are already prepared.
But they were concerned about this point.
Captain Ali, as athletes, I think this is a very significant achievement for sports people.
It will affect the economic, political, and health sectors, I assume.
But, as athletes
What does this achievement mean to you?
Of course it's a great achievement, especially for us, you even saw how the non-athletes were very happy.
God willing, Ali, tell me about the moment the winner was announced.
I was coming out of practice and we were listening to the radio station.
My friend and I were waiting for the announcement.
While driving the car and listening to the radio
The moment they announced that Qatar and...
We both screamed, and of course the skylight was open.
So my friend removed his body from the car roof.
We were screaming, everyone was looking at us, we turned on the lights and started our own celebration.
We started the celebration from the beginning.
Alhamdulillah, it was a very special day. I think all the channels focused on this event a great deal.
Lana, of course you were involved in this event.
Especially the sports channels
How did they celebrate this occasion and what was their reaction?
There were many media outlets and channels from all over the world.
He became a prominent teacher, very clear on the map, and Qatar gained fame.
Certainly, Ali, the presence of the player in the team is very important.
And I suppose it's a responsibility that should be taken seriously.
What's your opinion on that specific point?
Okay, Ali, do they mention the required attributes to join the league?
Now there are more upcoming sports events.
And we must prepare a strong generation.
He has solid foundations and well-planned football tactics.
So, what are the rules and principles that a player should possess to distinguish their character?
And I believe professionalism encompasses everything from
Rigorous and continuous training and discipline
All these are basic things that help him focus all his efforts in matches or in training.
I believe each stage has a unique feature.
It has a unique sensation and taste.
Talk shows and sports programs, which do you prefer, and where do you find yourself?
Great.
This keeps you fit and teaches you how to maintain your health through exercise, which is the most important part.
Also, everyone watches football matches, and you'll automatically love them when you enter the stadium.
Is that limited to one aspect of the work of those in the media?
Doesn't it limit you in some way?
It's an open field, not just for football.
It's all exercise, but exercise is great.
Ali, there are also some other important matters we'd like to discuss.
Haven't you wished you could go back ten years to reach 2022?
Yes, didn't you wish for that?
Of course, one dreams of this very thing now because it's the World Cup, and now any player
Anyone who watches World Cup matches will be happy, so imagine if they were playing in the World Cup?
I hope they succeed in meeting expectations, and this is their chance.
What do you want to say as a professional player, Captain Ali? What do you want to tell them from the bottom of your heart?
We love having you with us.
As I just mentioned, I'm currently on vacation, but
His return to the leagues after a twelve-year absence from the Gulf Cup championship.
You had a beautiful comment from Qatar TV and lovely memories.
God willing, Qatar TV has become like a university from which a large group of media professionals graduate.
Our Dorina is brave and we hope he wins many different awards.
Let's talk about an important point regarding Umm Salal Club.
How are you there, how are you, I hope you are well.
Sure, praise be to God, frankly.
Yesterday, of course, in the studio, we talked about many players.
So, I think some of the young men who were watching us thought you...
Required
It is very common in the Qatari league for players to move to other clubs.
I think I got a good offer in Umm Salal.
I managed to secure a spot in the Asian Cup with the team, praise be to God.
And my situation is very good with the team.
How can we make sports a social affair?
In addition to Qatar, how can we make women, children, and youth interested in sports?
Connects everything, every sports supplement.
Women play a role in all sporting fields.
With expansion, every individual, whether young or adult in this society, realizes the importance of sports.
About eleven or twelve years, until we reach this event, is enough.
We have more new generations.
The generation is growing up, but we need to raise a generation aware of sports from an early age.
We get aspire, aspire is an active entity.
Essential for the new athletic generation
We just have to be determined and move forward.
And football in particular.
How can we engage the audience to interact in all the different club matches?
Frankly, the lack of audience attendance is a problem we suffer from in the Qatari league.
But the problem is attendance, and the Qatar Football Association still hasn't found a way to attract the public.
What method should we use to attract them to attend those football matches?
It depends on the individual; some people don't like coming to university.
The media plays a crucial role, by the way, in the public's abstention.
And now they use a ticket or collect points here.
No, no, the Football Association has a plan and many steps to attract the audience.
Some clubs have ways to attract the audience, like Al-Rayyan, but Al-Rayyan is a popular club and doesn't need to attract the audience.
Some clubs have %pw, and some club administrations organize some activities and events.
For the public, to motivate them, I think those are the only ways.
The players, I mean the new generation.
To love what they do and believe in their abilities, and as you said, they don't just need financial support, they also need more moral support.
Many thanks for this wonderful meeting, God willing.
So, we'd like to hear your final thoughts on Qatar winning the bid to host the 2022 World Cup, Lana, please.
I would like to reiterate that Qatar is always supportive, and
I hope, Captain Ali, that you will say your final word that you would like to say in this meeting.
Congratulations and I wish you further success.
Thank you, Captain and player Alaa, I wish you success in your sporting progress and life, God bless you.
And I love sports more.
The episode will be about young talents.
Some young people see that these songs are popular nowadays, but they have a very deep and great history.
A group of young people are singing Arabic or English words.
Today we'll talk about this with a group of rap enthusiasts.
We will get to know them better through the live interview that will bring us together.
Welcome, dear viewers, to our program, wherever you are.
For years, a new type of singing has dominated the Arab and Gulf scene.
Coming from the west, particularly from America, which is the birthplace of rap.
Before we start talking about rap singing,
There is boldness in using any word without reserve.
Anyone can rap.
For writing song lyrics,
Most rappers write their own lyrics.
So, we'll get all these many and necessary details from two people who have entered this field forcefully.
They introduced a wonderful musical band.
Yusuf Al-Naemi and Salman Abdullah, good morning, Yusuf.
Welcome, good morning Salman.
Good morning, hello.
I'm very happy to have you with us through this program.
And of course, through the topic of rap singing.
Yusuf, how did you get involved in this?
We discover that there was no rap in Qatar.
In a better way.
Speaking on behalf of the citizen.
Including fun, sadness, and political topics.
Yes, I can say that rap,
And these words, I believe, are when the artist paints a picture, and the poet writes a poem.
The singer can sing and the musician can play any musical instrument.
Do you think there is acceptance from Qatari society, and from Gulf society, for this type of speech?
Two thousand ten.
Do you feel that people like buying CDs for rap music?
A variety of ages.
There are families and many people who listen much more than they used to.
There was something like a website.
How many are you in this band so far?
This means that each of you can say words, write poetry, and perform rap.
As you can say, the singer, the rapper,
It is he who sometimes plays, write the words.
Ah, okay!
I request to listen and tell him that I recorded this song.
Okay, all these songs that you produced, Salman, and Yusuf, and, anyone else in the same band.
I didn't think it would be on a CD and available in stores.
But you know, if someone is lonely, it means I'll have to make the album and release it on the market, so it's difficult, commercial recording and procedures.
Well, why didn't you think? You're twenty-five years old and it's always one person clapping.
There must be two, you, God willing, have twenty-five hands, may God protect you all, young men and brothers.
You are creating a CD, and you can market this CD through more than one website online.
You have Facebook, YouTube, and also local newspapers.
I think it contains thirteen songs.
Registration is not as it used to be.
A bit old, but it was clear.
It was of poor quality, not like the current quality, but it was clear.
He made about fifty CDs.
There is rap, I can't say it didn't exist because there might have been some young people who knew this art ten years ago.
It's not the strength of the recording and I think the distribution at this time, now it's different.
Especially since there is diversity in music, and a wide range of techno music genres nowadays.
Those men and those artists who produce a collection of wonderful songs.
We would also like to talk about the parties you attended.
Look, the party we attended in Doha, it was one.
It was organized by Al Sadd Club and they were very cooperative.
We glanced at the audience.
We were surprised, we didn't expect such a large number.
And we were also surprised by the presence of more families.
More than the youth
The organization was excellent.
We were a bit worried because this was happening for the first time in Doha.
We didn't expect such a large turnout.
The audience reaction was fantastic.
It took a long time, so there were many songs.
Alright, let's listen to something, or a song I wrote, that the audience, especially the youth, love.
Let's hear a few words so we can present them to the audience.
Can we hear it live?
Take your time.
Advance, Salem.
The problem is that it's random.
Let's listen.
I don't know.
We are here in the Doha Morning Show.
It's fun to come to the show in the morning.
Salman is an expert, and this is his fifth year practicing rap.
Even if people don't like it.
They have no idea about that.
The words are random.
Okay, for the songs I performed, give me some of your previous lyrics.
So, not all songs are random, or what they call in English, "Free style."
They are in sync.
But when we sing, some words are carefully chosen.
Thank you, let's see.
We can say, good morning my homeland, good morning Doha program.
We are live on television, for the public.
To see what one two one will offer.
Together from Doha's morning
The beautiful song I just heard.
I insisted that the youth distribute it everywhere and online.
I really appreciate that. When will you release it?
Teamwork
Everyone composes, for themselves.
He will not find it easy to execute.
Everyone has the right to write.
Certainly, I think that every artist, whether a painter or a poet, always...
He can also write it for the love of sport.
Or love of the homeland
And I'm sure you participated in the National Day.
Through beautiful songs, you represent the youth of Qatar.
Doha is expected to shine in welcoming the Asian Cup, and there will be a celebration on the Corniche.
Celebrating this occasion
We're broadcasting these clips live.
"Welcome to the Asian Cup, Doha"
From Doha Airport until now.
Let's take a look at these live stream clips together.
Reception, audience, our children, students
The Asian Cup arrived at Doha airport this morning to continue.
Preparations for hosting the massive continental event
Let's go back to our guests, Youssef and Salman, and we are delighted to have them with us.
They are from an Arab Gulf rap group, aren't they?
Can we call it that way?
Currently, frankly, we
We're throwing a party, but it's not definite.
But, you're working on a party that will be announced, God willing, Youssef.
Insha'Allah, but this is not yet confirmed, we are still in the beginning.
You are still at the beginning of your career. I wish you all the best, and be assured that our program will support you wholeheartedly.
Also, Salman, where do you all, twenty-five people, meet?
Where do you meet, and how do you put all the ideas together?
Certainly, there are some shared songs.
It is not necessary for someone like Salman or Yusuf or any of you to sing a complete song.
There must be cooperation among you all.
Frankly, it's difficult to get the twenty-five together in one place.
I start by contacting Youssef and the other guys and ask them to gather in one place.
Think about the song and the lyrics.
And there's another way.
I register my spot.
And he continued.
So he recorded it and sent it back to me.
And look at other experiences.
Collect some songs by famous artists.
Do you benefit from their experience and techniques?
Certainly, we always
Artists have been doing this for years and have experience in this field.
We listen to them, learn techniques, and try to come up with a unique style.
Because if we do the same thing, with the same tone and the same phrasing,
We don't produce anything new, we want to do something that is...
So we benefit a little from them.
Yes, there is also a large group of Gulf youth, in the Gulf.
In a primitive way, let's watch the report together for benefit and enjoyment, let's watch it together.
These talents that some people possess are mysterious.
Using extremely primitive tools
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah al-Dayyel
This is one hundred and fifty kilometers.
I'm from the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
He has good experience and ability.
Identifying shallow groundwater sites
Over 100 meters deep
You know well that drilling wells is very expensive.
Determining the suitable location to dig the well, but with the expert, one can.
Discover, or locate
Groundwater sites
Since ancient times
Our fathers and grandfathers
They resorted to experts to find wells.
To dig
Abu Ibrahim's techniques in searching for groundwater
They are not modern techniques.
Or soil analysis in laboratories
He relies on God's grace in his work.
And its underground springs
Pomegranate seeds.
Pomegranate branches or fig branches.
Now, the process of discovering water tables is scientifically applied.
To end the broadcast, this is the end of the live transmission.
Come back again.
Go back
So, from here we start marking.
And here, the broadcast ends.
It requires great experience and patience.
In order to be able to determine the sensitivity of the device's motion.
I've been to many places.
Which means a success rate of ninety-five percent.
Of course, in this way and using copper bars.
And there is no precise scientific explanation for
This method
What is truly astonishing is the success rate of those who practice this primitive profession.
Over ninety-five percent
In the search for shallow groundwater reservoirs
Glory to God, who taught man what he did not know. This report is from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Who got their own band and more than one CD?
Whether online or by phone
Sometimes there are competitions between Gulf countries such as Qatar vs Bahrain and Qatar vs Kuwait.
They produce a stronger song with a more intense theme.
When dealing with a problem, etc., there are many issues.
I see him as a role model.
Inshallah
And at the same time, we want to
Broadcast a wide range of songs
As much as possible
From time to time, let's keep in touch with you.
To keep up with the band's latest news.
But let's focus on the band's name.
He's a rapper.
Let's go back to our guests at the corniche and the beautiful atmosphere.
We are live with you via this direct link.
Wherever you are in Konrich, you welcome the Asian Cup.
We are proud of them and the wonderful arts.
It addresses various social and psychological issues of youth.
But he has only two with us in the studio.
I'm sure they'll represent the rest.
Yusuf and Salman, welcome again.
Sometimes subscriptions expire.
We tried to contact the company, but no one is responding.
As a musical group, you should develop yourselves; people in
Facebook and YouTube
and other similar sites
Band name
You'll find us among the first search results.
Organize and work together on this wonderful production.
She pairs and matches images with songs, and are these personal images?
Or you can simply download it from YouTube and video-hosting sites, which one can follow.
Some do, we've done it before.
There are many songs.
The obstacles you face, such as the lack of a supportive company or a website.
You desperately need a place where you can all come together as a band.
What are your wishes, and what do you want to achieve and attain?
Those who care for us
Arrange an album for us.
I hope it becomes official.
Because we spent five years.
Gently, no more.
Yes, we've collaborated on some things, some series.
We hope it improves.
And let there be someone to support us and stay with us.
Yes, Salman, we also want to know what your wishes are.
My only wish is to produce a video clip.
We wish you good luck.
We hope all your songs become famous in the Middle East.
This is a beautiful and very popular art.
And he carried a message, as you just said.
Good luck, and I wish you all success.
Say hello to the group, and we wish you good luck.
We'll finish with the anthem they produced especially for the program.
This is the KDEGMR Doha program.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This lady Bobo KG with SKT is one hot body.
We can say, good morning my homeland, good morning Doha program.
We are live on television, for the public.
Don't forget, the show airs at 9:30, everyone must watch it.
To see what one two one will offer.
Together from Doha's morning
Produced by Hassan Neama, presented by Shaima'a Al-Hamdi.
The director is Nasser Al-Maliki, and the guests are Qatari rappers, of course.
It can be repeated again and used at home.
Like a cart or a shopping basket.
While shopping at the supermarket
When you put any item, or anything you want to buy in
A large screen will appear displaying the components of this product.
That was a great idea and practical too.
Just a barcode, and a scanner in the shopping cart detects the item.
And made shopping easy for the buyer.
He can get all the details on the screen.
I suppose it raises health awareness.
When the device is with you or in the cart.
Ingredients
Any warnings, side effects.
Full details.
Or ambition, for example, there are a number of projects, about four or five.
Dealing with traffic issues.
It addressed traffic congestion and other issues such as the parking problem, and it was very creative and beautiful.
Insha'Allah, the Culture Center for Children.
Mr. Abdullah, let's discuss the various activities that will take place in the coming days.
Yes, there are also surprises, but we will discuss them briefly.
Ideas, I'm not sure if you want me to mention some of the submitted projects or
For example, for underground transport, the great idea is
As soon as the man left his house, he found an elevator.
They gathered at one point.
I assume that all the viewers are enjoying the images displayed now.
Children's Creations
Exactly, it's like an ATM.
For women, for example, I have a card.
I'm putting it in, and saying that I need a T-shirt.
This is, for example, some shops, or if you lose things at home, like the key.
Lost, like the office key.
We have a primary goal set by Her Highness Sheikh Moza.
Her Highness the Princess
At an early age, this is of great importance in project design.
Three hundred selected children
We have also invited speakers and orators.
Yes, it was she who hosted the closing ceremony.
To promote their programs, we really need to open the doors to interested children.
And then they can start.
We need their presence there to support us, that's our priority.
These programs and activities serve that central idea.
Children have diverse and varied skills.
Self-development
Okay, do you have any collaboration with youth clubs in Qatar?
There are also science clubs in Qatar.
Of course, all our programs are based on the exchange of ideas.
All of this is a professional partnership.
Along with other community service institutions specialized in developing these talents.
Engagement of all stakeholders
Photography Society
The Creativity Center for Girls, and the Office of the Secretariat of the Cabinet also played a very important role.
Yes, they played a significant role in explaining Qatar's vision.
And training children on it.
Engaging and encouraging children, as each program relies on institutional partnerships.
According to the head of projects and establishments.
And what changes it?
Our presence here in Katara gives us a strong boost and support.
And faster.
We are currently, in collaboration with Katara, preparing for some projects that will be ready for launch within the next two months.
Of course, there is cooperation in many programs.
Especially when it comes to reading.
Chairperson of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs.
And we are running it, especially since we are in the setup phase.
To build a promising future for all children, the next generation, and youth.
What is your final word of advice for parents and children watching us now who are interested in joining the center?
What we offer them now
Sometimes our children come up with ideas that we shouldn't dismiss.
We must take their ideas into consideration, no matter what.
Because when we take it seriously, it will develop, or at least we will encourage the child to think.
So it's important to provide care and attention to the child.
And spiritually as well, our problem is that most parents
Support him.
Encourage him, so we encourage the parents.
To pay more attention to the child's imagination, today's children are the roots of the future.
We took a tour of the exhibition and while we were looking at their projects.
We lived the dream.
Dreams and thoughts were the product of a vivid imagination.
And dreams come true, many of them have come true and become reality.
Praise be to God, we wish our children who were there all the best.
Our hearts are with you.
Inshallah
From various ages and nationalities
Up to seventy projects
He is considered a pioneer and deserves to be implemented.
To speak more broadly about this national exhibition
And the Center for Children's Culture as well.
Mr. Abdullah, speak to us briefly about the exhibition.
There were many activities, for sure, what could you say about them?
The children presented a new pattern of expressing nationalism and loyalty to their homeland.
Under the patronage of the Minister of Education.
On the tour of the exhibition
It will grow until 2030.
We started training children to envision Qatar's National Vision 2030 across all three of its pillars.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, environmental development
First, to know Qatar's position in thirty-twenty.
Then, to start thinking about
Creative ideas and how to be innovative.
I suppose they already have a broad mind.
But when we help him
I suppose their minds will grow more and more.
Sir, I have launched the exhibition under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation, Facts or the Nation of Tomorrow."
The slogan says "Dreams of a Generation."
It will be part of Qatar's future, Qatar's tomorrow.
We felt that when we were strolling with the children, when the child says to the minister,
I want you to open my project, and I invite you to visit my project for twenty and thirty.
A child thinks with a gaze towards the next twenty years.
They express their love for their countries in the field they are interested in.
There should be some activities, events, and competitions.
Someone won the Stars of Science award.
There were also first-prize winners from the Arab League.
Certainly, all children.
On the sidelines, there were various performances on a set schedule.
To display the projects they have done
There is a large attendance, a very unique presence.
Stars of Science
Some of the winners of the projects that participated in the exhibition.
Who won one of the major prizes?
Which forest or reserve is the most innovative or creative?
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
The colorful ball is also part of the children's dream and vision for Qatar's future.
It's a 2030 idea.
How can a child contribute with a creative idea for the 2030 Project?
The main idea is that there is a slice in the ball.
The referee gives a colored warning.
For example, the referee can monitor the ball's movement.
Or the playground is transformed by this electronic slide.
Installed in the ball.
There are creative ideas, of course, the main idea, some might ask.
And projects
We always say, we've reached this stage.
Developing skills and broadening their horizons.
Giving them an idea of how to express nationalism through these projects.
Give them confidence in how to present the project, engage with the audience, and explain its idea.
In a field he loves, being engaged in something he enjoys is an accomplishment.
Offer support, we thank him for that.
Which is now in the development stage.
Also, the public, the committee, and some officials supported the projects.
First, no, it was the second, because of this girl.
Pipes, passageways for the audience underground, and the way spectators enter need to be arranged.
A very large protected forest.
Where visitors can wander and see animals and reptiles.
Also, there is a sensor attached to some animals to examine their condition.
There is also the marine environment, and the way of entering is also innovative.
One of the reasons for her success is also her broad and detailed imagination.
All this qualified her for victory.
There is also a person who talked about an underwater tourist city.
City of Butterflies
A forest on Earth.
and many tourist ideas
Very interesting.
Perhaps this is a need in their minds, at this time, perhaps in the year thirty.
In the future, that will be achieved.
Three projects.
It was adopted by the science club, and they said these are the projects we need to work on.
There is a project regarding the excess water from air conditioning units.
Let's see the Arab newspaper.
The article says, Qatar University celebrates graduation.
The presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al-Mahmoud.
Minister of Education and Higher Education, and Secretary General of the Supreme Education Council.
Dr. Shaikha Bint Abdullah Al-Misnad, President
A new record for the university indeed.
Qatar University and Calgary University
There are also great news about our students.
It is an educational achievement, and we wish them success, God willing, in all specialties.
He is considered among the young, rising actors in the Qatari drama scene.
How long, also classifications and colored threads.
The actor Abdel Hamid Sharshani is considered one of the actors who made themselves.
If it's not convincing,
He will not be chosen for projects within Qatar.
Currently, actor Abdel Hamid Sharshani is participating in the series "Deadly Feeling" and "Classifications Part Two."
We are pleased to have him as our guest this morning.
In order to be able to talk to him about his participation in these two works and about his experience in general.
Welcome and good morning.
We are happy to have you on the Doha Morning program. This is the first time I meet you, and this is your first time on Doha Morning.
With people who work hard for the program.
And you, Mrs. Lisa.
Welcome to our discussion. Before we begin, let's
Alright, let's see.
I am a responsible and executive man.
And I enforce the laws.
The only thing I can tell you is,
Give me the bisht.
Listen, why are you asking me?
Go ask them, if anyone agrees that you don't bring the bisht.
Of course I have another question as an introduction, but since we've watched this part of the series, it falls under the first category.
He pointed out that Khalid ibn al-Walid...
Some historians link the famous poet Imru' al-Qais to the city of Marrat.
A lot of things and information about that city in Saudi Arabia.
For more information, we will watch this excellent report by our colleague Abdurrahman Marshud.
Let's see it together.
So, it is indeed a testimony of people who know about flattery or favoritism.
As an affirmation of the history of this city or that.
As far as we see her effects, and as far as we hear about her from storytellers and poets.
Classic and modern, this thus serves as an important record added to the city's annals.
The city of Marrat is one of the cities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Historically, it is an ancient town founded in the pre-Islamic era.
There was a debate among historians about how to name it?
Some believed that it was named after the famous poet Imru' al-Qais al-Kindi.
And the table that was named after him.
The date of its foundation is unknown.
In the time of ignorance.
The most distinctive feature of the city of Marrat is Mount Kumait, which has been the subject of many proverbs.
Because it's in the city and close by.
Stop. These are historical places.
This view is considered a tourist attraction in Saudi Arabia.
The municipality of Marrat has made great efforts to make
A garden on this mountain
And seating areas for locals and everyone in the kingdom.
Named after the Prophet's companion Khalid ibn al-Walid (may Allah be pleased with him).
To fight the apostates and Musaylimah the liar.
One of its historical landmarks is Wadi Kamit.
It's a place where spring water gathers and is stored for a long time.
It was one of the most important sources of water in the past.
Among its archaeological landmarks, as well as the Doha Heritage House.
The city of Marrat has a history dating back to pre-Islamic times.
He was famous for his influenced poets.
With its beauty, ruins, and the famous mountain of Qumayt.
Abdulrahman Al-Marshed for the Doha Morning Program,
The city of Marat, north of Riyadh.
We return once again to our dear guests.
I hope you can tell us and the viewers about those methods and means.
Initially, I stated that our infrastructure is uniquely exceptional.
We open a file for him and register him with a specific record in our system.
Email him.
This report covers the range of increased attention, typing speed, reading speed, and overall distraction.
The guard gets a full report.
Alright, this report will be added to the student's record.
Logs into his son's online account.
He sees his son's progress.
He can see his grades and his interest in teachers.
To truly appreciate the intelligence of this beautiful girl.
To be able to bring most of the children in the center and send them our best regards.
Who joined this center with a professor there?
To know her intelligence and the level she has reached since joining the center.
Of course, this year.
Focus on one task at a time, and after Ramadan.
But of course this affects the accounting of other works, always.
There are people who watch TV only during Ramadan.
He stays awake watching TV as people change their worship months with the TV.
Ease up, ease up, a relief chain, ease up, let them do one action every two years, is that better?
Of course.
I hope they like me in Ramadan.
But I would like to extend my warmest regards to all of you.
And God willing.
And with plays as well.
From drama to fashion.
A fashion show was held in Katara, the Cultural Village.
Of course, we still love you and have all our appreciation and loyalty.
And develop the abilities and skills of children more.
Different from the diverse schools in this generous country.
We have a model and we spoke to our guest whom we hosted previously.
Now we have Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Abdulsalam with us. Welcome and good morning.
How are you, Amnia?
I'm fine.
Which grade are you in now?
Professor Ibrahim, to start, could you please introduce us to the course offered by the center?
And Omnia is an example of that.
We will also try the technique or method that Ms. Nesma talked about with her.
Do you sense a difference in his thinking?
Do you feel that these skills and methods,
Things regarding his mental skills, or even his educational level, will change.
Scientific methods
Including initially testing the child with an international test called the TONI test before starting anything in the program.
I also start the second part of Tony's test.
We can measure the level or the change in the student's level through it.
Now a test or something like that will be conducted.
A wish will be calculated and answered immediately.
Of course, Amany knows nothing about the questions.
We surprised them with this thing.
Of course, I have another question to start with,
We would like to ask about your participation in the second part this year.
What is your contribution, can you tell us about it?
Of course, after we presented the series classifications of the first part,
Alhamdulillah, I've been lucky in several roles.
Mr. Ghanem,
Distribute roles with CEO Ashraf Shahata in addition to Mr.
It's an opportunity from Tara for artistic production.
For the youth.
Mr. Ghanem nominated me this year for
Of course, each episode is different.
I have several episodes where I'll be playing different characters.
On the contrary, this is a wonderful experience. In this job, we have...
One of Kuwait's pyramids, Mr. Saad Al-Faraj.
We have actors from Bahrain, Abdullah Malik, Ali Al Gharair.
Like Ali Mirza, we have
You also have a group of young actors like Abdullah Adham.
Yes, among our young actors, we have Abdullah Al-Aasim.
This happened a year ago, and last year we did two works a year.
This might be the reason why I asked you before the broadcast. You have represented, since 1997,
But you couldn't achieve anything, or your ambition to act.
Praise be to God for everything.
Did you study acting or was it just a coincidence?
No, I do it as a hobby.
I discovered my talent for acting within myself. My beginning was supported by the artist Abdulaziz Jassim.
He is one of the actors who consider me their son.
If you need anything, call him.
We were in all of his shows.
We worked hard, praise be to God.
Now, without Tara, a very special thank you to Mr. Abdulrahman Al-Sulaiti, and a very, very special thank you to Mr. Abdulrahman.
If we compare ourselves to Kuwait. In Kuwait, there are between twelve and sixteen new actors appearing every year. Why?
They have.
Of course, thank him very much for giving a lot of opportunities.
But, let's assume,
Let's talk about the other series, we had an idea about categories.
We need to know more about the deadly feeling.
And also the foot.
We have a sample, and with us is the processor Professor Abdulaziz Al-Muyouf Al-Tamimi.
To carry out these procedures live on air.
And we can see how we can deal with the person. Allow me first to say good morning to Mr. Sabhi bin Hamza, welcome.
Welcome and peace be upon you.
So let's start with you, sir, please.
Inshallah.
In the name of God.
We hold hands.
We see tension.
It's like a painting or a message from God Almighty, revealing all the parts of your body.
From the inside and its problems.
Sometimes you feel dizzy.
Headache and dizziness.
Loosen your hand, loosen it. Keep your nerves relaxed, yes.
By doing that, Mr. Abdulaziz, you will discover something specific from his hand that he suffers from a certain disease.
On his left side. His ears, he has a non-severe inflammation of the middle ear.
There is pain! What does that mean, Mr. Abdulaziz?
Ear. Do you have an ear problem?
Since I was born and since I was a child.
Do you have pain here as well?
It's the sinuses!
Do you have a pain in the nose and a headache here?
I have a headache here.
He has a sinus problem.
It gives him a headache between the eyes.
Weight increases without food.
My thyroid gland is not functioning properly, and you feel lethargic and sluggish all the time, as if your body is heavy.
I sleep a lot.
Either oversleeping or laziness, you always feel sluggish.
You always have tonsillitis.
It exists. Look at the vibration, you notice the vibration.
He's under a lot of stress and you never walk barefoot, it might be the last time.
Are you from Tunisia?
Wow, you've mentioned things about him.
Is this massage beneficial for children as well?
The mother's thumb, praise be to God, is similar in size to the child's palm.
Most children are not sleeping, why?
When you pick him up, he doesn't like it, but people think he does. He has gas in his stomach, God bless you.
By the time the mother puts her thumb, extend the thumb.
In the child's palm.
The hands are parallel and the child is parallel to them.
Let's see it so that every mother can learn this move.
You'll start by pushing like this. Right and left, and right and left.
This topic is about the child, about, about, about the child, and he is cute.
Well, regarding discoveries, you have discoveries specifically tailored for women.
As we mentioned, in every household, there is a ninety percent ratio of women, may God protect them.
First of all, the first warning is about ceramic and even flooring.
When we walk barefoot on ceramic, it's fine to walk barefoot, but walking on uneven ground is dangerous.
Walk barefoot! The evidence is when ceramics were used in homes, health problems increased.
Because it's cold and flat.
When the floor was carpeted, there were problems, they suffered from asthma.
It has increased.
A woman should take care to focus on walking barefoot on the ankle.
This is the foot and ankle region located at the back, the ankle.
From here, this foot and now under the ankle.
This is the first discovery, and the second discovery is a way to facilitate delivery.
Just focus with me for a bit.
In her seventh or ninth month.
Generally, once you reach the delivery month.
That means they don't come on the eighth, the eighth is dangerous, and the most dangerous thing is walking barefoot.
A pregnant woman should be cautious about walking barefoot.
If she's on time,
I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Satan, "And shake the trunk of the palm tree towards you, it will let fall fresh dates upon you."
We already know that Mary, we know that her provision comes to her.
I even discussed with scholars who told me: Why are you changing the interpretation of Ibn Kathir?
I told them, "I give you the idea that God has placed in this science, and He inspires me."
Shake the palm tree trunk towards you, when the tree shakes, what does it look like?
It's sharp as nails or thorns.
When you shake the palm tree, the wombs, the area of the wombs, are here in the middle.
It's the intestines. They give orders to facilitate childbirth and reposition the fetus.
The fetal head is elevated or its position is changed to allow for natural delivery.
Praise be to God, this is one of the benefits of this fruit.
Grasp the hand and begin to relax it.
Some take it as a habit, others know it is a science.
Therefore, they are afraid to tell you and you don't believe them.
Yes, Mr. Abdulaziz, your discoveries are important.
But I'd like to ask you one last question because time has flown by so quickly.
If anyone wants to contact you, or anyone else, or any specific email address, or you.
Okay, the mobile number is available in the control room. If anyone wishes to communicate with Mr. Abdulaziz, they can contact us after the program.
Of course, on Qatar TV numbers, so he can call us and get this number.
I was created solely to serve people.
If we believe in this conviction, God will bless your work and guide people.
I have sins like any human being, and I do everything you can imagine. I am a normal person.
Nevertheless, we aspire to more good.
We always think of good.
Dear viewers, I hope you enjoyed this segment on reflexology and hand massage.
Also through the foot.
We saw a live demonstration of how the device detected the diseases this person was suffering from.
And what he suffers from. I hope we can benefit from him, and if anyone wishes to communicate with him, they can read more about him online.
The way it will be implemented, whether in the coming days or years, and whether it will include more schools.
Good morning
How do you evaluate this experience?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
The fact that obesity in Gulf countries has become a big problem.
So, we were afraid that Qatar would become the fifth state with them.
This program, frankly, got the first lady in New York.
I visited Doha and it has a program for this.
They showed it to us, we approved it, and said it was perfect.
Our students along with students from New York, Spain, and England,
Therefore, we can observe the level of our students in Qatar among the countries of the world, and this is what we aspire to in the future.
Because we encourage students to eat fruit.
He stops exercising.
Of course, the fifth week is a family meal with your family.
Kill two birds with one stone (proverb)
In the sixth week, he tells us what he has gained from this experience. Praise be to God, we are at the end today.
We are happy with the students.
You know they were three independent schools, for boys Abu Obeida,
Independent for girls, Rania.
With high spirits.
The family was more aware, and their siblings were enthusiastic at home and started eating this food just like them.
It becomes a transitional culture between the student, and he transfers this culture to the home and to his family.
Go tell them, give me this or teach me this.
The training team or the person who provided this information to the students,
How did you select him and how was the communication with the student established? Who initiated the communication?
Yes, there were many parties that helped us, and God bless them.
We have brothers at the diet center who teach them about food, healthy food of course.
And learn with Lady A'isha Al-Tamimi the etiquette of the table.
How they arrange themselves, how they prioritize!
To learn cooking, sports, or education about the value of healthy food.
That was in the form of separate lessons or curricula.
How were these ideas conveyed to the students?
In various ways, some within the school,
We organized a day at the beginning of the program in the Aspire zone, where we gathered all the male and female students.
This is not about any particular person, but we are all responsible, responsible because they are our children.
These students, how they handle it at first!
I initially said that the results were satisfactory.
Is it sufficient to have three classes or specific periods in those schools?
Now, when you start an experiment in the world, it doesn't start on a large scale.
It starts with a reasonable scope that has all the properties; sons, daughters, independent, and private.
Since it is not suitable for our culture, environment, and family circumstances, such as their acceptance of certain things for their children and rejection of others.
They want to participate in it primarily, and frankly, it's very important.
The student who is twelve or thirteen years old, this is the right time for him to get to know his health.
This is a struggle for many people who want to be thin, but they imagine it to be impossible.
Some of the actors we see in the movies are very thin, he says this is impossible, no!
We talked in detail, but there were many weeks we couldn't cover.
And through the morning of Doha, we can remind them of that.
And fruits that contain vitamin B, which you can get from fruits and vegetables.
Therefore, one should know the benefits of fruits and realize that if they consume them, their health will improve, and thus their morale will be high.
With regard to fruits, they went to the supermarket and picked out their fruits.
So, that's a point.
It is diverse and of course they compete, each school was creative with its different ideas through its teachers.
Spirit of competition.
We provide them with guidelines and everyone must innovate.
Do teachers train the students, or do you have specialized staff?
I built them, I built them.
But the teachers were adding, for example, some schools like Abu Obeida said they would make Saturday for student activities.
This is a day outside of school hours, they are deciding and adopting it, and a sophisticated school said they will have a parade.
They said they would have a healthy cooking day for the girls, but they didn't force the boys to do healthy cooking on their own, the girls were more skilled at this.
Moreover, I would like to thank Al Rayyan Water Company for providing all the water free of charge to schools, Al Rayyan Water Company in this regard.
Of course, water is much healthier because it needs to cleanse its body of all these toxic substances that enter it daily through water.
We said the third week.
Which means his body is moving.
He might be playing soccer or basketball and he doesn't know that this is the game I love.
True, true, exactly, and some might want another game, they may not like team games.
Welcome to our live broadcast.
Mr. Abdul Aziz Al-Jaber, founder and director of the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Association, is welcome to join us.
In which, of course, we try to focus as much as possible on important topics.
We would like to introduce and inform our dear viewers about Multiple Sclerosis.
Because this name could be embarrassing for us too.
More women have this than men.
All available treatments now are preventive treatments.
The white blood cells that are supposed to protect us start to
It kills us by striking the nerve cell.
Let me make it easy for the audience, it's like a wire.
Covered by a layer called myelin, let's assume it's a nylon layer.
Of course, this generally leads to dizziness and double vision, diplopia.
It also led to digestive and respiratory problems.
In the worst-case scenario, it leads to madness, or to quadriplegia or hemiplegia.
Of course, the treatments.
The most important functions of the body will be significantly affected.
Or from this disease a disease called multiple sclerosis.
Some theories say it spread through a virus.
The disease is not infectious.
Not transmitted to children.
Some consider it a disease depending on the region.
The equator, for example, was excluded from this disease.
Currently, we have some cases of this disease on the equator.
This disease so far has no cure because its cause is unknown.
So far, scientists have been unable to determine the cause of the disease, and thus find a cure for it.
Now the process is reversed.
They try to avoid the impact of the disease itself on the human body.
In other words, they start working from the back.
We might be a bit afraid of this subject, which we can say that this disease comes suddenly.
Is there a specific group, a group that you feel this illness has spread within a specific group?
Internationally, he was ranked between twentieth and fortieth.
Currently, the international community has reduced the number of cases of the same disease from twenty to fifteen.
Because it has started to include young people up to the age of forty.
However, man does not recover from it.
Of course, as a society, we are open to alternative medicine and Prophetic medicine.
Yes, through the association, the Multiple Sclerosis Association in Qatar.
Why do we have this society?
There was a large gathering, so I thought of forming an association for this subject.
Of course, I'll give you some random numbers.
In Kuwait, it is said that there are sixteen thousand cases.
A thousand cases.
The rest of the Gulf countries range between one hundred and three hundred.
When I was diagnosed five or six years ago,
My number was sixty or forty-six.
Are there any symptoms indicating that the patient is actually suffering from this disease?
We're not certain it's a virus, which is why we don't want to commit to a particular theory, that's the point.
The other point is how can I know if I'm suffering from it or not.
This is very difficult.
I am perplexed. Alas! Mr. Abdulaziz, in an attempt to understand a specific point.
