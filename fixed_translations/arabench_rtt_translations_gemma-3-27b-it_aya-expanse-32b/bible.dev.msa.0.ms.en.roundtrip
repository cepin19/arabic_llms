And Jesse was the father of David the king. And David was the father of Solomon, whose mother was Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah.

Hezekiah is the father of Manasseh. Manasseh is the father of Amon. Amon is the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jehoiachin and his brothers. In those days, the people of Judah were carried away captive to Babylon.
Then the lineage continued through Jehoiachin, who was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zephaniah was the father of Jecoliah, and Jecoliah was the father of Azariah.

Eliezer was the father of Mahath. Mahath was the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph, and Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Messiah.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. And there were fourteen generations from David until the carrying away into Babylon. And there were fourteen generations from the carrying away into Babylon until Christ. The birth of Jesus Christ.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Yusuf, was a righteous man. He did not want to expose her to humiliation in public. So, he intended to divorce her secretly.
But while he was thinking about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.”
"You will give birth to a son. You must name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."
All this was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through the prophet,
The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel, which means "God with us."
Joseph woke up. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary into his home as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.
The Visit of the Wise Men to Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod. After Jesus' birth, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They said, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
So Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, sent and killed all the children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men.
"In Bethlehem in Judea," they answered. "That is what the prophet wrote. He said,"
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, yet out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times."
Then Herod called the Magi secretly, and ascertained from them the exact time the star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem. And he said, "Go and search carefully for the child. When you find him, tell me, so that I too may go and worship him."
After the wise men had listened to the king, they set out on their way. The star they had seen in the east went ahead of them. It finally stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they went back to their hometown by another route. The Holy Family flees to Egypt.
After the Magi had departed, Joseph had a dream. In the dream an angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph got up, took the child and his mother Mary during the night and left for Egypt.
So they remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, "Out of Egypt I called my son" (Hosea 11:1).
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. He became furious and issued a decree regarding Bethlehem and its surroundings: "Kill all male children two years old and under." This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
Thus was fulfilled the word of the Lord spoken by the prophet Jeremiah.
A voice was heard in Ramah, a voice of bitter weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more. (Jeremiah 31:15) The return of Jesus' family to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who were seeking to kill the child are dead."
So Joseph got up and took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.
But he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, and he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee.
And he lived in a city called Nazareth. Thus was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophets about Jesus, "He shall be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way of the Lord.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent from your sins! For the kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke. He said, "A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from the region along the Jordan River.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Bear fruit that shows you have turned from your sins.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ I tell you, out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
The axe is already laid to the root of the trees. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, calling you to repent of your sins. But after me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
His winnowing fork is in his hand to clean the threshing floor and to gather his wheat into the barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.” Jesus went on to say:
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River, and wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this, to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented.
And as soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
Jesus is tested.
The Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, where he was tempted by the devil.
After forty days and forty nights of fasting, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
He said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up, so that you do not dash your foot against a stone.'" (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered, "It is also written: 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said, "If you worship and obey me, I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus, and angels came and attended to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was arrested and imprisoned. When Jesus heard of it, he withdrew to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth. He went to live in the town of Capernaum, which was located beside the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
And thus was fulfilled what the prophet Isaiah had said, who said:
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the Gentiles dwell! Land by the Mediterranean Sea! Region beyond the Jordan River!
"The people walking in darkness will see a great light. For those living in a land of deep darkness, a light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1, 2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." The calling of the first disciples by Jesus.
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers. They were Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting their net into the lake. They were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," said Jesus, "and I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
From there, he saw two other brothers, James and his son John, and their brother Andrew. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, when Jesus called them.
Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
His fame spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from severe pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were violently shaking. Others could not move at all. And Jesus healed them all.
A large crowd followed him. Some people came from Galilee, from the Decapolis, from Jerusalem, and from Judea, while others came from across the Jordan.
Jesus gives blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds, went up the mountain, and sat down. And his disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said,
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are those who have renounced pride. They will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
"Blessed are you when people hate you, and exclude you, and revile you, and disparage your name on account of the Son of Man."
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great. Likewise, they persecuted the prophets who lived before you. You are the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
People don't light a lamp and put it under a basket. Instead, they put it on a stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
Similarly, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. Jesus fulfills the law.
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
What I am determined to say is true. Heaven and earth will pass away before one jot or tittle of the law perishes. Not even the smallest stroke of the law will perish until all things are accomplished.
Do not neglect the least of these commandments, and do not teach others to neglect them. For if you do, you will be least in the kingdom of heaven. But if you keep and teach these commandments, you will be great in the kingdom of heaven.
This is what I say to you: You must be more righteous than the scribes and the Pharisees. If you are not, you will surely not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder.
You have heard what was said to those who lived in ancient times: "You shall not murder (Exodus 20:13). Whoever murders will be accountable."
But this I tell you: Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Again, whoever says to his brother, 'Raca,' will be answerable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.
"So if you are presenting your offering at the altar and remember that your brother has something against you,"
Leave your offering before the altar and go first reconcile with your brother, then come and present your offering.
Suppose someone brings a lawsuit against you and takes you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do so while you are still with him on the way. If you don't, he may hand you over to the judge. The judge may hand you over to the officer. And you may be thrown into prison.
What I'm about to say is the truth. You're not leaving until you pay the last penny! Liar.
You have heard that it was said, "Do not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your eyes than to have your whole body thrown into hell.
If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. Divorce.
"When a man marries a woman and then divorces her, he must give her a certificate of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But I say to you, whoever divorces his wife causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. A man must not divorce his wife except in the case of sexual immorality. I swear to you.
Again, you have heard what was said to your people long ago: "Do not break the covenant that you made with the Lord. Keep the vows you made to him."
But this I say to you: Make no such promises at all. Make them not in the name of heaven. That is God's throne.
Do not make it in the name of the Earth. That is the footprint of my God. Do not make it in the name of Jerusalem. That is the city of the great King.
And do not swear by your head. You cannot make even one hair white or black.
Let your 'yes' be 'yes', and your 'no' be 'no'. Anything beyond that comes from evil. Be kind to others.
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this is what I tell you: Do not resist an evil person. "If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to them as well."
If someone sues you for your shirt, let them have your coat as well.
If someone forces you to walk one mile, walk two miles with him.
Give to him who asks of you. Do not turn away him who would borrow from you. Love your enemies.
You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' (Leviticus 19:18)
But I say to you: Love your enemies. Pray for those who persecute you.
"So you shall be sons of your Father who is in heaven. 'He makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.'"
"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even tax collectors do the same."
"If you only greet your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Even the Gentiles do the same."
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Giving to the needy
Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them; otherwise you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, so that they may be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
When you give charity, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
So your charity should be in secret. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer.
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by people. What I am about to tell you is the truth. They have already received their reward.
When you pray, go into your room, close your door, and pray to your Father who is unseen. And your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you. Your Father sees in secret what you do.
When you pray, do not babble as the Gentiles do, for they think that by their many words they will be heard.
Do not be like them. Your father knows what you need before you ask him.
"This is the way you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
Deliver us from sin when we are tempted. Save us from the evil one.
Forgive people when they wrong you. For if you do, your Father in heaven will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses. Fast.
When you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces to show others that they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face.
So that people do not know that you are fasting, except your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees what you do in secret will reward you. Gather treasures for yourselves in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Instead, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your heart will be where your treasures are.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. You will hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money at the same time. Do not worry.
I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink, nor about your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
And why do you care about clothing? Look how the wild flowers grow. They don't work or spin clothing.
But I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these.
If God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'
Those who do not fear God run after all those things. Your Father in heaven knows that you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when you judge others.
Judge not, and you shall not be judged.
You will be judged by the same standard by which you judge others. You will be measured by the same measure with which you measure others.
You see the splinter in your friend's eye, but you pay no attention to the log in your own eye.
How can you tell your friend, "Let me remove the splinter from your eye," when you have a piece of wood in your own eye?
You hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks receives. He who seeks will find. And the door will be opened to him who knocks.
Let's suppose your son asks for bread. Which one of you would give him a stone?
Or suppose he asked for a fish. Which one of you would give him a snake?
"If you, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!"
In all things, do to others what you would have them do to you. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The great and the small commandments.
Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many.
But the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
You can know their true nature by their actions. "Do people gather grapes from thorns? Do they pluck figs from thistles?"
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You shall know a tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'
Then I will say to them plainly, 'I never knew you. Depart from me, you workers of iniquity!' Wise and foolish builders.
Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
The sky rains. Water rises. The wind blows and strikes that house. But it doesn't fall. It's built on rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not do them is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
The sky rains. Water rises. Winds blow and strike that house. And it falls with a loud crash.
Jesus ended by saying all these things. The crowds were amazed by his teaching.
He taught as a sultan, not as their teachers.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down, and said, "Lord, if you choose to make me clean, you can do it."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I want to heal him," and commanded, "Be clean!" Immediately the leprosy left the man.
So Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." And he went away and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the word, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded for his help.
He said, "O Lord, Your servant is lying in bed at home and cannot move. He is in great pain."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The centurion answered, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man of authority, and I have soldiers who obey my commands. I say to this one, "Go," and he goes; and to another, "Come," and he comes; and to my servant, "Do this," and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly, I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith."
I tell you that many will come from the east and the west. They will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
But those who think they belong to the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman centurion, "Go! Let it be done for you as you believed." And at that very hour his servant was healed. Jesus healed many.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying in bed, with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He did this to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had said: "He took up our pain and bore our diseases" (Isaiah 53:4). Following Christ comes at a cost.
Jesus saw the large crowd around him. He instructed his disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then a Pharisee came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
Then another disciple said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into the boat, and his disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a fierce storm swept across the lake. The waves crashed against the boat. But Jesus was asleep.
The disciples went and woke him, saying, "Lord, save us! We are perishing!"
He answered, "Why are you so afraid? It is your faith that is lacking." Then Jesus got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "Who is this man? Even the winds and waves obey him!" Jesus heals two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gadarenes. Two men possessed by demons met him. They came out of the tombs. The two men were so violent that no one could pass by.
"Son of God, what do you want with us?" they cried. "Have you come to torment us before our time?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was grazing.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" So the demons came out of the men and went into the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.
Those who were tending the pigs fled. They went into the town and told everything, and told what had happened to the men who were possessed by the demons.
Then all the people of the city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who couldn't walk.
Jesus got into the boat, crossed to the other side of the lake, and arrived at his hometown.
Some men came bringing to him a paralytic, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
So some of the scribes said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Get up and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up! Take your mat and go home."
The man stood up and went home.
When the crowds saw this, they were amazed. They praised God for giving such authority to human beings. Jesus chooses when.
As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man called Matthew sitting in the tax booth. "Follow me," he told him. And Matthew got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
Go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ (Hosea 6:6) ‘I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.’ They asked him about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came and said to Jesus, "We and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast."
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
People do not tear a piece of new cloth from an old garment to patch it. The new piece would tear away from the old. That would make the tear worse.
People don't pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will spill, and the skins will be ruined. Instead, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved. A dead girl and a suffering woman.
While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of the synagogue leader and said, "Your daughter has died. Don't bother the teacher anymore." Jesus overheard this and said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed."
Jesus rose and went with him, so did his disciples.
At that moment, a woman approached Jesus from behind. She had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years. She touched the hem of his garment.
I thought, "All I need to do is touch his clothes. Then I'll be healed."
Jesus turned and saw her. He said to her, "Woman, do not lose hope." "Your faith has healed you." The woman was healed at that moment.
When Jesus entered the governor's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the noisy crowds.
He said, "Go. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd had left, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
News about all that Jesus did spread throughout that region. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I can do this?" They answered, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith let it be done to you."
Now they could see again. And Jesus sternly warned them: "See that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it everywhere in that area.
As they were leaving, another man who was demon-possessed was brought to Jesus. He was unable to speak.
When the demon was cast out, the man spoke. The crowds were amazed. They said, "Never has anything like this been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the prince of the demons." Few are the workers.
Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the Kingdom of God, and healing every disease and sickness.
When he saw the crowds, he felt deep compassion for them. They were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and every sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. First comes Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then comes James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
Then come Philip and Bartholomew, as well as Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. There are also James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus.
The last two are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas is the one who would later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve with these instructions: "Do not go to the Gentiles," he said, "and do not enter any town of the Samaritans."
Instead, go to the Children of Israel. They are like lost sheep.
As you go, preach this message: 'The kingdom of heaven is near.'
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse the lepers. Cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.
Do not carry gold, or silver, or copper in your belts.
Don't take a bag on the trip. Don't take extra clothes, sandals, or a walking stick. The worker should be given what he needs.
When you enter a town or village, look for someone willing to accommodate you. Stay with this person until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet those inside.
If that house welcomes you, give it your peace. If not, do not bless it.
Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or town.
What I am determined to say is true. On the day of judgment, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city.
I send you out as sheep among wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
Beware! People will hand you over to the local courts. They will flog you in their assemblies.
You will be brought before rulers and kings because of me, and you will be witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.
But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time, the right words will be given to you.
You will not be the speaker. It is the Spirit of your Father who will speak through you.
Brothers will deliver up brothers to death, and fathers their children, and children will rise up against parents and cause them to die.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But those who endure to the end will be saved.
When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am about to tell you is the truth. You will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
A student is not better than his teacher. Nor is a servant better than his master.
It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and enough for the servant to be like his master. If the master of the house is called Beelzebul, what will they say of the rest of his household?
Therefore do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known.
What is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father's will.
He even counts every hair on your head!
So do not fear, for you are worth more than many sparrows.
What if someone says in front of others that he knows me? I too will say in front of my Father in heaven that I know him.
But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my Father in heaven that I don't know him.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to set a son against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
A man's enemies are the men of his own house. (Micah 7:6)
Whoever loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. And whoever loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
"Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it."
Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
If anyone welcomes a prophet as a prophet, they will receive the reward of a prophet. And if anyone welcomes a righteous person as righteous, they will receive the reward of a righteous person.
"Truly I tell you, anyone who gives you a cup of cold water to drink because you are my disciple, will by no means lose their reward."
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus finished teaching his twelve disciples. Then he set out to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect another?"
Jesus answered, "Go and tell John what you hear and see."
The blind receive their sight. The lame walk. Those with leprosy are cleansed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised to life. And the good news is preached to the poor.
"Blessed are those who did not abandon their faith because of me."
As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
If not, what did you go out to see? A man clothed in fine garments? No. Those who wear fine garments are in the palaces of kings.
"What did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet."
He is the one who was written about in the book. It says, " 'I will send my messenger ahead of you to prepare your way' (Malachi 3:1)."
What I am about to tell you is the truth. No one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born, but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful people lay hold of it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you are willing to accept it, John is the Elijah who was to come.
"He who has an ear, let him hear."
What shall I compare the people of today to? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling out. They say:
We played the flute for you, but you did not dance. We sang a funeral song, but you did not mourn.
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you eat and drink, and people say, "He is possessed by a demon."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they say, 'Look at this glutton and drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Those who act wisely prove that their wisdom is good. Cities that do not repent of sin.
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent of their sins. He said:
Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you, on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades. For if the miracles had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained until this day.
But I say to you, it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. Come to me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. This is what you wanted.
My father gave me everything. The Father is the only one who knows the Son. And the only ones who know the Father are the Son and those the Son chooses to make known to them.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
"Be my disciples and learn from me. I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls."
"My service is easy, and my burden is light."
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On a Sabbath day, Jesus was going through the grainfields. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pick and eat some of the grain.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. Yet your disciples are doing it!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him?"
Then he entered the house of God, and he and his men ate the sacred bread, which was not permitted except for the priests.
Haven't you read the Law? It tells how the priests in the Temple are to perform their duties every Sabbath day. Yet they are not considered guilty.
I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.
The scriptures say, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You do not know the meaning of these words. If you did, you would not file lawsuits against the innocent.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
Then Jesus went from there and entered their synagogue.
There was a man with a withered and paralyzed hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
Man is more valuable than sheep! That is why the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other one.
But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Jesus, the chosen servant of God, to kill him.
Jesus knew of the Pharisees' plots. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to tell anyone about his identity.
That was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, saying,
Here is my servant, whom I have chosen. He is the one I love; I am pleased with him. I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
He will not argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
It will not break a bent branch. It will not extinguish a flickering flame. It will fix everything.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
A man possessed by demons, who was blind and could not speak, was brought to Jesus. Jesus healed him, and the man was able to speak and see.
All the people were amazed and said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man drives out demons only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. And every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
"The devil drives out the devil, so he wages war against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?"
"You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by whose power do your disciples cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges."
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
Or think about this. How can you enter the house of a strong man and simply take what he has? You must first bind him. Then you can rob his house.
He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.
And this is what I say to you: Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. This person will not be forgiven, either in this world or in the world to come.
A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
"A brood of vipers! How can you who are evil say anything good? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."
A good man says good things. They spring from the good within him. And an evil man says evil things. They spring from the evil within him.
But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.
"By your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned." The miracle of Jonah.
Some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you."
He answered, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
"Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. Something similar will happen to the Son of Man. He will be in the tomb for three days and three nights."
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, there is one here greater than Solomon.
What happens when an evil spirit departs from a human? It wanders through desolate places seeking a resting place, but finds none.
Then he says, "I will return to my house that I left." When he arrived there, he found the house empty. The house had been swept and organized.
Then the unclean spirit goes out of the man, and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself. They enter and dwell there, and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation. - Mother and brothers of Jesus
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers were standing outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to speak to you."
Jesus answered and said to him, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples. He said, "Behold, my mother! Behold, my brothers!"
"Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
The Farmer's Tale
On that very day, Jesus went out from the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. He got into a boat, sat in it, and all the people stood on the shore.
Then he told them many stories. He said, "A farmer went out to sow his seed.
He scattered the seeds on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was not much soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
Other seeds fell among the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plants.
And some seeds fell on good soil, and produced a crop, a hundred, or sixty, or thirty times what was sown.
"He who has an ear, let him hear."
The disciples came to him. They asked, "Why do you speak to the people in parables?"
He answered, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given."
Whoever has this kind of knowledge will be given more. Indeed, he will have abundance. But whoever does not have this kind of knowledge, even what he has will be taken away from him.
Here's the reason I resort to stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: "You will indeed hear, but never understand; you will indeed see, but never perceive."
"Their hearts are calloused; they cannot hear with their ears. They have closed their eyes, so that they cannot see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn back to the Lord and be healed." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I am determined to tell you is true. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they did not see it. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they did not hear it.
Listen! Here is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message of the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes and steals what was sown in their hearts. Those people are like the seed sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky ground. These are the ones who hear the word and receive it with joy at once.
But they have no root; they last only for a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.
And others fell among thorns. These are the ones who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy. But they have no root in themselves, and only endure for a while. For when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. These are the ones who hear the word and understand it. They produce a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown. The Parable of the Sower and the Soils.
Jesus told the crowds another story. "This is how the kingdom of heaven is," he said. "A man planted good seed in his field."
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The servants of the master came and said, "Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?"
He said, "An enemy did this." The servants asked, "Do you want us to go and pull the weeds?"
"No," the owner replied. "While you're weeding, you might pull up the wheat along with the weeds."
Let both grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: "First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat. Bring it into my barn." Parables about the mustard seed and the leaven.
Jesus told the crowds another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took the seed and planted it in his field."
It is the smallest of all your seeds. Yet when it grows, it is the largest of all the plants in the garden. It becomes a tree. And the birds come and rest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until all the dough had risen."
Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables. He did not say anything to them without using a parable.
Thus were fulfilled the words which the prophet spoke, saying, "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter hidden things from the foundation of the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the parable of the tares.
Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He answered and said, "He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man."
The field is the world. The good seed are those who belong to the kingdom of God. The tares are those who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows it is the devil. The harvest is the day of judgment. And the workers are angels.
Weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove from his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.
They will cast them into the fiery furnace. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. He who has ears, let him hear. Parables of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.
And again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found one that was very precious. So he went and sold all he had. And he bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
And again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea, and gathered every kind of fish.
When it was full, the fishermen pulled it to shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets. But they threw away the bad fish.
This will be the case on the Day of Judgment. The angels will come. They will separate those who did evil from those who did good.
The wicked will be thrown into the blazing furnace. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he left.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began to teach the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. They said, "Where did this man get this wisdom? And where does he have the power to do miracles?"
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? So where did this man get all these things?
They never liked him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, and among his relatives and in his own home."
He performed few miracles there because they had little faith.
John the Baptist's head is cut off.
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod arrested John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, who was the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they believed John to be a prophet.
On Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced for him and his guests. He was delighted with her.
He promised her by oath to give her what she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very annoyed. However, he remembered his promise and his dinner guests. So, he ordered one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod ordered John's head to be cut off in prison.
His head was brought on a large platter and given to the maid. She then carried it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus feeds five thousand people.
When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he withdrew to a solitary place by boat. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus landed on the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep compassion for them. He healed their sick.
When evening came, the disciples approached him and said, "There is nothing here but a boy with five barley loaves and two fish." "Send the crowd away," Jesus replied, "so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus answered, "They need not depart; give ye them to eat."
"We have only five loaves of bread and two fish," they answered.
He said, "Bring them to me."
Then Jesus commanded the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples picked up twelve baskets of the fragments.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. Women and children also ate. Jesus walks on water.
So Jesus immediately made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.
After sending them away, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
The boat had already moved away from the shore. The waves were hitting it hard because the wind was blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were terrified. They said, "It's a ghost!" and cried out in fear.
Jesus immediately called out to them: "Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Lord, are you?" Peter asked. "If it is you, command me to come to you on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!"
Then Jesus reached out his hand and touched him. "Your faith is small," he said, "Why did you doubt me?"
When they boarded the boat, the wind died down.
Then those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes.
The men who lived there recognized Jesus. They sent word throughout all the surrounding countryside. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
They pleaded with him to allow those who were sick to touch the hem of his garment, and everyone who touched it was healed.
What makes people "unclean"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked:
Why don't your students obey what the elders teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the command of God, but prefer to follow your own teachings?"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) and also, "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death" (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9).
But you teach them to say to their parents, "Any help anyone of us gives you is a gift dedicated to God."
Therefore they need not honor their parents with their gift. You nullify the word of God by your tradition.
Protesters! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said:
"These people honor me with their words, but their hearts are far from me."
"Their worship means nothing to me. They only know one thing: human laws." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to Him and said, "Listen and understand."
What goes into your mouth does not defile you; what comes out of your mouth, that is what defiles you.
Then his disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered them, "There are some among you who do not belong to God. Therefore, they cannot be from God's family."
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind guides. If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you not yet understand?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other lusts. So do theft, bearing false witness, and slandering others.
These are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands doesn't make you "unclean." "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
There was a Canaanite woman who lived near the cities of Tyre and Sidon. She came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon. She suffers greatly."
Jesus said not a word. His disciples came to him and pleaded with him, "Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman knelt before him. "Oh God! Save me!" she said.
He answered and said, "It is not meet to take the children's bread, and cast it to dogs."
"Yes, Lord," she said. "Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus feeds four thousand.
Jesus departed from there and walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up into the hills and sat down.
A large crowd came to him, bringing with them the blind, the lame, the paralyzed, the mute, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.
People were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. The weak were healed. The lame were walking. The blind were seeing. So the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have great compassion on this crowd. They have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
His disciples answered, "There is nothing here but five loaves and two fish." "How far away from a town are we?" they asked Jesus.
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and a few small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks. Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples picked up seven baskets of the leftover fragments.
The number of men who ate was 4000. Women and children also ate.
After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus is asked for a sign or miracle.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, and asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He replied: "In the evening you look at the sky. You say: 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'"
In the morning you say, "Today will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." Then he left them and went away. The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The students crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring bread.
"Beware," Jesus said to them, "of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils discussed this among themselves. They said, "He says this because we brought no bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying, and he said, "You of little faith, why are you talking together about having no bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of fragments you gathered?
Don't you remember the seven loaves for the four thousand? How many baskets full of pieces did you gather?
How is it that you do not understand? I was not talking to you about bread. But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not warning them about the leaven of bread, but about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter says that Jesus is the Christ.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered, "Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I tell you: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus speaks about his upcoming death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem. There he will suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes; he will be killed, and on the third day he will be raised.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This shall never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
Truly, the Son of Man is about to come with the glory of His Father and His angels, and will reward each according to their works.
What I am about to tell you is true. Some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
The appearance of Jesus was transformed.
And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves.
Before them, his appearance was transformed. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.
And suddenly there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three booths: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were greatly afraid. They fell on their faces and prostrated themselves.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said, "Arise. Do not be afraid."
When they lifted up their heads, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. And as they were going down, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell no one what you have seen." "Until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The disciples asked him, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "That is true. Elijah is coming to restore all things."
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy possessed by a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man came to Jesus. He knelt before him.
He said, "O Lord, have mercy on my son. He is shaking violently and in great pain. He often falls into the fire or into the water."
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.
"You of little faith and evil!" Jesus answered. "How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring the boy to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed at that moment.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we cast out the demon?"
He answered, "Because your faith is so small. What I am about to say to you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死

They met in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him, and on the third day he will rise from the dead." The disciples were deeply distressed. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. And there the tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he does," he replied. And when Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "From whom do the kings of the earth collect duties and taxes? From their sons or from others?"
"From others," Peter answered. "Then the children should not pay," Jesus told him.
But we don't want to anger them. So go to the lake and cast your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. You will find there exactly the coin you need. Take it and give it to them as a tax for you and me.
