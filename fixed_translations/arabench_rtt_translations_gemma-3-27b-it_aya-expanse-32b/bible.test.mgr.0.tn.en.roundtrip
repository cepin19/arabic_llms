Jesus called a little child to him and put him among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

Whoever welcomes a child like this in my name, welcomes me.
But what if one of these little ones who believe in me were to stumble? Woe to that person! It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around their neck.

If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into hell with two hands and two feet. In hell, the fire burns forever.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The parable of the lost sheep.
Don't mess with one of these kids. That's all I'm saying. Their angels in heaven can go see my father in heaven anytime they want.
"Please"
What do you think? Imagine someone has 100 sheep, and one is lost. Wouldn't he leave the 99 in the fold and go search for the one that's lost?
"I don't know how to tell you this is true. If he stops that victim, he'll be happier than if ninety-nine other victims hadn't been lost."
Take it easy on your dad a bit. He doesn't want anything bad to happen to these kids. When he does something annoying, just ignore it.
If your brother sins against you, go to him and tell him his fault, just the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won him over.
Well, what if he doesn't want to listen to you? Take along one or two others. The Bible says, "Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
Why should he listen to witnesses? Tell it to the church. And why should he listen to the church? Do not treat him as a brother. Treat him as you would treat someone who does not fear God or who extorts money.
I'll tell you what's true. What's closed on earth, is closed in heaven. What's open on earth, is open in heaven.
Okay, that's what I'll tell you. If two people agree on anything they wish for in this world, God in heaven will grant it to you.
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am among them." A relentless servant.
Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered and said, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy times seven."
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who collects all the money his subjects owe him.
Before the king's reign began, they brought him a man who owed him millions of dollars.
The man couldn't pay. So his master issued an order. He had to sell himself, his wife, and his children, and everything he owned to pay off the debt.
The servant fell on his knees before him. "My lord, give me a chance," he pleaded. "We'll pay you back everything."
He felt sorry for him and forgave him the debt, letting him go.
Fine, now this servant went out and found another of the worshippers who owed him a few dinars. He pounced on him and began to choke him. He said, "Give me back my money!"
The other servant knelt on his knees. "Give me time," he begged. "I will pay you back."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay back his debt.
The other servants saw what happened. They were very upset. They went and told their master everything that had occurred.
Then the master called the first servant. He said to him, "Wicked servant!" "I forgave you all that you owed me because you pleaded with me."
Didn't you have to show mercy to the other servant as I showed mercy to you?
In anger, his master handed him over to the jailers. He will be punished until he has paid back everything he owes.
This is how my Father in heaven will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
A large crowd followed him. He addressed them there.
Then some Pharisees came to Jesus and tested him. They asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two, but one. Therefore, a person should not separate what God has joined together.
They said, "Did Moses command a man to divorce his wife and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But from the beginning it was not so."
This is what we tell you. Any man who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. A man can only divorce his wife if she has been unfaithful to him.
The students told him, "If that's how it is between a man and his wife, they'd better not get married."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of celibacy. Only those whom God has helped to live without marriage can accept it."
Some men cannot have children because that's how God made them. Some people have children for others. And some choose to remain childless to serve the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept this, let him come." Little children were brought to Jesus.
People brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray over them. But the disciples rebuked the people.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he went away from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?"
"Who are you asking me about beauty?" Jesus answered. "There is only one who is beautiful, and that is God. If you want to enter paradise, keep the commandments."
"What is it?" the man asked. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
"Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"I have fulfilled all these commandments," said the young man. "What more shall I do?"
Jesus answered and said, "If you want to be perfect, go and sell all that you have and give the money to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
When the young man heard this, he walked away sadly. He was very rich.
Jesus said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the students heard this, they were very surprised. They asked, "What can be disposed of?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
"We've given up everything to be able to follow you! What reward will we be given?"
"Truly I tell you," Jesus said to them, "in the renewal of all things, the sons of the kingdom will sit on their glorious thrones. And you who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
Many who arrive early return late, and many who arrive late overtake.
The Tale of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He agreed to give them the usual daily wage. Then he sent them to the vineyard.
Around nine in the morning, he went out again. He saw other people standing in the market doing nothing.
He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will give you what is right."
They left. "He left once around noon and at 3 o'clock he did the same thing."
Around five o'clock he went out and found the people still standing. He asked them, "Are you going to stand here all day with nothing to do?"
They said, "No one has hired us." He said to them, "Go work in my vineyards too."
In the evening, the landowner told the man who was in charge of the workers, "Gather the workers and give them their wages. Start with those who were just hired, then go to those who were hired first."
The workers who showed up around five o'clock were paid. Each one received the usual daily wage.
Consequently, when those who had just started working came first, they expected to receive more. However, each of them received the usual daily wage.
When they received it, they wanted to complain to the owner.
"Those people who just started worked only for one hour," they said. "We paid them the same as us. We did most of the work and stayed under the scorching sun all day."
"The companions made one of them a judge. He said, 'O my brother, I will be just with you. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?'"
Take your money and leave. I want to pay the people I hired now the same wage I paid you.
Isn't it right for me to do what I want with my money? Do you feel injustice because you donated a lot to people?
So the last will be first, and the first last. Jesus speaks again about his imminent death.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
"We are going to Jerusalem," he said. "There, the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death."
"They will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked, flogged, and crucified. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks a favor of Jesus.
The mother of Zebedes' children came to Jesus with her children. She knelt down and asked him for something.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Grant me that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and the other at your left, in your kingdom."
"You do not know what you are asking," Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the cup I am about to drink?" They answered, "We can."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten disciples heard about it. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them."
"You should not be like that. On the contrary, whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant."
And whoever wants to be first must be your slave.
Be like the sons of men. He did not come to be served, but to serve everyone. He came to give his life to free many people. **Those who are blind will regain their sight.**
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed him.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stopped and shouted at them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
"Sir," they answered, "we can see properly."
Jesus felt great compassion for them. He touched their eyes. Suddenly, they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
By the time they reached Jerusalem, they came to Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two disciples.
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. As you enter it, you will find a donkey tied there, with its colt beside it. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone tells you anything, tell them, "My Lord needs them. The master of the house will send them directly."
This was to fulfill what the prophet had said. You say:
Say to the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your King is coming to you; He is humble and riding on a donkey, And on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
The disciples went and did what Jesus told them to do.
They brought the donkey and the colt. They placed their cloaks on them. Then Jesus mounted the cloaks.
A very large crowd spread their coats on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people went ahead, and some followed him. They all shouted: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest heaven!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowd answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleansed the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area and began to drive out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and also the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written in the Torah, the Lord says, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you have made it a 'den of robbers.' (Jeremiah 7:11)"
The blind and the lame came to Jesus in the temple, and He healed them there.
The chief priests and teachers of the law saw the miracles he did. They also saw children in the temple courts shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw this, they were indignant.
"Can you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," answered Jesus. "Haven't you read in the Scriptures, 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus went away from the crowds and left the town to go to Beth’any, where he spent the night. The fig tree withered.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw an olive tree on the road. He walked to it, but found nothing on it except the leaves. Then he said to it, "Don't bear fruit anymore!" Immediately, the leaves withered.
When the pupils saw this, they were amazed. They asked, "How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen."
If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer. Jesus' authority is established.
Jesus entered the temple courts. While he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will ask you one thing. If you answer me, I will tell you what little things I am about to do."
"Where did John's baptism come from? From heaven or from men?" They argued the point among themselves. "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'"
For the men? They were afraid of the people. Everyone thought that John was a prophet.
So Jesus answered them, "I don't know him." Jesus said, "That's why I can't tell you what power I do these things with. It's the story of the two sons."
What do you think of this? Once upon a time, a man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, today go and work in the vineyard."
"I can't," the son replied. But then he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing. The son answered, "I will go, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two did the will of his father?" They answered, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
Go, John, to show you the right way to live. And they did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. I saw this. And many did not repent of your sins and believed him. The story of the provider.
Hear another tale. Once upon a time, there was a man who had a piece of land. He planted a vineyard on it, built a wall around it, dug a pit to make a press in it, and constructed a watchtower. He rented it to some farmers and then traveled away.
When the time for the harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, to collect his share of the produce.
The inhabitants kidnapped their slaves. They beat one of them. They killed Khor. They threw stones at the third one to kill him.
Then the man sent other servants to the tenants. He sent more than he had sent the first time. The tenants treated them in the same way.
In the end, he sent his son to them. He said, "So that they may respect my son."
But the villagers saw the owner's son coming. They said among themselves, "This is the one who will one day inherit all the owner's property. Let's kill him so that everything will be ours."
They took him again and threw him out of the party. Then they killed him.
"With the talk that reaches the owner of the property, what will he do about these tenants?"
"So that he may remove the wicked people," they answered. "Then he will rent the vineyard to other vinedressers. He will give them their share of the harvest at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth its fruits.
Whatever falls on this stone will break. And the stone, when it falls on what falls on it, will shatter it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' words. They knew he was speaking about them.
Keep looking for a way to do it. But be afraid of the crowds. People believed that Jesus was a prophet.
An Eve's Tale of the Wedding
Jesus told them other parables. He said,
This is how the kingdom of heaven is. A king prepared a wedding for his son.
The Abbads sent invitations to the people who were invited to dinner. The Abbads told them to come, but they refused.
Then he sent out some more servants. He said, "Tell those whom I invited, 'I have prepared my dinner. I have slaughtered my fattened cattle and all is ready. Come to the wedding feast.'"
As for the people, they didn't care. One went to his field, another went to his work.
The rest captured his slaves. They treated them badly and then killed them.
The king was very angry. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those who had killed and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The feast is ready, but those I invited were not worthy to come."
Go to the corners of the streets. Invite everyone you meet for dinner.
The servants went out into the streets. They gathered all the people they could find, good and bad. The hall was soon filled with guests.
The king entered to inspect the hospitality. He noticed one man who was not wearing festive clothes.
"My friend," he asked, "How did you enter here without a wedding dress?" The man could not find anything to say.
Pasha said to his servants, "Tie his hands and feet. Throw him outside into the darkness. Outside, people weep and gnash their teeth."
"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."
The Pharisees went out. They plotted to entrap Jesus in His words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You don't care what others think, and you don't let them tell you what to say or not to say. You don't seek favor from anyone."
Let's put it this way, what do you think? Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their cunning. He said, "Hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes. He showed him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words are these?"
"Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's, and unto God that which is God's," they replied to him.
When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away. Marriage is at the resurrection.
On the same day, the Pharisees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe in the resurrection of the dead.
"Teacher," they said, "this is what Moses commanded: If a man dies and leaves no children, his brother must marry the widow. He must father children for his brother."
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second, third, and all the way to the seventh brother.
In the end, the woman died.
When the dead rise, whose wife will she be? All seven were married to her.
Jesus answered and said to them, "You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God."
When they die, they don't get married. Their families don't marry them off. They are like angels in Paradise.
What's the story about the dead coming back to life? Haven't you read what God said about that?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them like one who had authority, not like the scribes. The most important commandment.
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees had been unable to answer Jesus. So they gathered together.
One of them was an expert in the law. So he tested Jesus with a question.
"Teacher," he asked, "what is the most important commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important recommendation in everything.
"You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your kinfolk. Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"All things written in the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments." "Who is the Son of Christ?"
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
"What is your opinion of Christ? Who is his father?" "The son of David," he answered.
He said to them, "Then why does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,"
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." (Psalm 110:1)
"If David called him 'Lord,' how is he his son?"
No one could answer it. From that day on, no one dared to ask him another question.
Jesus judges the Pharisees and teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and his disciples.
He said, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat."
So you have to obey them. Do everything they tell you to do. But don't do as they do. They don't practice what they preach.
They want to tie heavy loads and put them on people's shoulders. But they don't want to lift a finger to move them.
Everything they do, they do it for people to see. They wear small boxes on their foreheads and arms containing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they let their braids hang very long from their skirts.
They like to sit in the place of honor at banquets. They also like to be in the best place in the synagogue.
They like to be greeted in the markets. They like people to call them "Lord".
But they can't call you "God". You have only one God, and you are all brothers.
Don't call anyone on earth "Father." You have only one Father, and he is in heaven.
They cannot call you "teacher." You have one teacher, and it is Christ.
The most important among you is the one who is your servant.
He who raises himself, God lowers him. And he who is lowered by God, He raises him.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, and you hinder those who are trying to enter.
"Please"
Alas for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and then you make that person twice as much a child of hell as you are.
Alas for you, blind guides! You say, "If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing; but anyone who swears by the gold of the temple is obligated."
You're blind and foolish! What's more important, gold or the structure that sanctifies the gold?
You have heard that it was said, ‘Swear an oath by the altar, and your oath is binding; but swear by the gifts on the altar, and your oath is not binding.’
O servants of the blind! What is more important? The gift? Or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
So whoever swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it.
And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.
And anyone who swears by Allah, swears by Allah, the Throne, and He who sits upon it.
Alas for you, teachers and hypocrites! O pretense! You give God a tithe of your mint, dill, and cumin, but you have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
Oh blind guides! Remove the smallest speck from your food, but you swallow a camel!
Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of extortion and self-indulgence. You clean the outside, but inside you are full of greed and excess.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish, and then the outside will be clean also.
Alas for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! Hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but inside are full of dead men’s bones and everything unclean.
It's pretty much the same with you. From the outside, you seem to be doing the right thing, but inside, you're full of mistakes. You pretend to be someone you're not.
Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous.
And you say, "If we had lived in the times of those who came before us, we would not have done what they did. We would not have been complicit in the killing of the prophets."
This is a testimony against yourselves. You admit that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
So complete the sins that those before you have begun!
O nest of venomous snakes! How can you escape the judgment of Hell?
Behold, I send to you prophets and wise men and teachers. You will kill and crucify some of them, and scourge them in your synagogues, and drive them out from city to city.
So, you will pay for the blood of all the innocent people shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
What we're telling you is true. All this is going to happen to the people living now.
Jerusalem, Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I wanted to gather your children, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Look, your house is empty.
We say to you, do not see me unless you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." (Psalm 118:26)
Signs of the End Times
Jesus went out of the temple. He was walking away when his disciples came to him. They wanted to draw his attention to the temple.
"Do you see all these things?" Jesus asked. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There his disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end of the world?"
Jesus answered, "Be on your guard! Beware of those who deceive you."
But when the Christ comes in his own name, you will not receive him. Instead, you will say, "He is a deceiver!" and will not believe in him.
You hear about wars. You hear people talk about future wars as well. Don't be afraid. These have to happen. But the end has not come yet.
Countries fight countries. Kingdoms fight kingdoms. People starve. There will be earthquakes in many places.
All this is the beginning of labor.
How can people hand you over to be killed? All nations will hate you because of me.
At that time, many people were abandoning their faith. They were hating each other. They were handing each other over to the enemy.
It appears there are false prophets. They can deceive the masses.
Because evil will increase, the love of everyone will grow cold.
But he who endures to the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world. It will be a testimony to all nations. Then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of "the abomination that causes desolation" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Then those in Judea will flee to the mountains.
No one even needed to go downstairs to their house to get anything.
No one in the field had to go back to get their coat.
Alas for the condition of pregnant women at that time! Alas for the nursing mothers!
Don't wish to fall in love in winter or on a Saturday.
You are always tormented these days. It is worse than any other affliction from the beginning of the world until today. And there has never been anything like it before.
If time were not shortened, no one would survive. But for the sake of God's chosen people, it will be shortened.
At that time, someone may say to you, "Look! The Christ is here!" or, "There he is!" Do not believe them.
So that they may show themselves to be false Christs and false prophets. So that they may perform great signs and wonders. So that they may try to deceive God's chosen people, if they can.
Look, I've emptied the bucket for you.
So if someone tells you, "He's far out in the wilderness," don't go looking for him. And if someone says, "He's deep inside the house," don't believe it.
The lightning that comes from the east can be seen in the west. It's the same when the children of the world come.
Eagles gather wherever there is a dead body.
"The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will tremble." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. And all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with great power and glory.
That He may send His messengers with the trumpet's blast. That they may gather His chosen servants from every direction. That they may bring them from the farthest reaches of heaven to its lowest depths.
I take a lesson from the fig tree. As soon as its branch ripens and the leaf appears, you know that summer is near.
In the same way, when you see all these things happening, you know that the end of the world is near. It's right in front of your eyes.
I'll tell you what's true. The people who lived in that time didn't die before all these things happened.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. No one knows the day or hour except God.
No one knows about this last day or this hour. Even the angels in heaven do not know. The diver does not know. Only God knows.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. The same thing will happen when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were getting married. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They did all these things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They didn't know anything about what was about to happen until the flood came and took them all. That's how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
Two men in the field. One is captured, the other is left behind.
A woman is going to grind tuna with a mortar and pestle. One will go and one will stay.
So, stay watchful. You don't know on which day the Lord will come.
You want to understand something. The homeowner was about to explain what time the thief would come. If he had posted a guard, he wouldn't have let his house be robbed.
So you also have to be prepared. People will come at a time you least expect.
Let's say a master puts one of his servants in charge of other servants in his house. This servant's job is to distribute food to them on time. The master is looking for a trustworthy and intelligent servant for this task.
The servant used to meet his master and serve him when he returned.
I'll tell you what's true. The master will give this slave responsibility over everything he owns.
For the evil servant, what if he says to himself, "My master will be delayed for a long time."
Let's say he starts beating other servants. And let's say he eats and drinks with those who drink a lot.
The master of this servant will return on a day the servant does not expect. He will return at an hour the servant does not know.
"Let the master cut the plans. Let him assign a place where the hypocrites will go. There the people weep and gnash their teeth."
Tale of Ten Maids
Here is what the kingdom of heaven will be like at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. Five were wise.
Their stupidity led them to take their lamps but not bring oil with them.
The wise people took the oil in jars with their lamps.
The bride didn't come for a long time. Because of that, the guests didn't finish their food and fell asleep.
In the middle of the night, someone shouted, "Here comes the groom! Come out and greet him!"
Then all the virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.
The fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
"No," they replied. "It might not be enough for everyone. Instead, go to the oil sellers. Buy some for yourself."
They went to buy oil. On their way, the groom arrived. The ready girls entered with him to the bride. Then the door closed.
After a while, the rest of the bride's friends arrived. They said, "Sir! Sir! Open the door for us!"
But he replied, "What I'm telling you is true. I don't know you."
So, stay vigilant. You don't know the day or the hour when the groom will come. The story of three servants.
Now, let's talk about how the kingdom of heaven is like. A man was going on a journey. He called his servants and entrusted his possessions to them.
He gave $10,000 to one. He gave $4,000 to another. And he gave $2,000 to the third. The man gave each of the servants the amount he knew the servants could preserve. Then he traveled.
The servant who received the ten thousand dollars immediately invested his money. He made another ten thousand dollars.
He who wins $4000 wins an extra $4000.
But the man who had received $2000 went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money there.
After a long time, the master of these servants returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who was trusted with ten thousand dollars has made ten thousand dollars more. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with ten thousand dollars. Look, I've grown it to twenty thousand dollars."
His master answered, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!"
The man who had $4,000 also came. He said, "Sir, you sent me with $4,000. Look, I've made another $4,000."
His master answered, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!"
Then came the man who had taken the two thousand dinars. He said, "My lord, I knew that you were a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed."
I was afraid. I went out and buried your money, a thousand dinars, in the ground. Here, take what is yours.
His master said, "You wicked and lazy slave! Did you know that I harvest where I did not sow? Did you know that I gather a harvest where I did not scatter seed?"
"Wisely, I should have deposited my money in the bank. When I returned, I would have retrieved it with interest."
Then his master ordered the other servants, "Take the $2000 from him. Give it to the one who has $20,000."
He who has, gets more. He gets more than enough. And who doesn't have? Even he who has, they take it from him.
'Cast this worthless servant into the outer darkness. There, in the darkness, people will weep and gnash their teeth.' The sheep and the goats
The Son of Man is coming in his glory, and all the angels with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne.
All nations will be gathered before me. People will be separated into two groups, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the camels.
He puts the decorations on his right and the flag on his left.
The king will say to those on his right, "Father, bless you. Come, take what has been prepared for you. This is the kingdom that has been prepared for you since the creation of the world."
I told you I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I told you I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I told you I was a stranger. And you invited me in.
You gave me things I needed. You stayed up with me when I was sick. You visited me when I was in jail.
Then the righteous will answer him, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you a drink?"
When did we see you a stranger and invite you? When did we see you in need of things and give them to you?
When have we seen you sick or in prison and went to visit you?
The king replies, "What we're telling you is true. Anything you've done to one of my brothers, you've done to me."
Then he will say to those on his left, "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels."
I was telling you I was hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I was telling you I was thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger. You did not invite me to your house. I needed things. You did not give me anything. I was sick and in prison. You did not care for me.
And they also say, "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and not help you? And when did we see you a stranger or in need of clothes, or sick or in prison, and not assist you?"
He answers, "What we're telling you is true. Anything I haven't done for the youngest among them, I haven't done for you."
Let them go and suffer forever. But those who did the right thing, God will grant them eternal life.
The plan to kill Jesus
Jesus finished saying all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man is about to be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They made a plan to cleverly frustrate Jesus. They wanted to kill him.
"But not on the feast day," they said. "The people may cause a riot." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon, who had a skin disease.
A woman came to Jesus with a flask of very expensive perfume; she poured it on his head as he sat at table.
When the students saw this, they got angry. They said, "Is this a waste of time?"
The perfume tuna could have been sold for a high price. The money could have been given to poor people.
Jesus knew this. So he said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good thing for me."
There will always be poor people. But we won't always be here.
She poured perfume over my body to prepare me for burial.
What we are telling you is true. What you have done will be spoken of everywhere the good news is proclaimed throughout the world. They will tell it in his memory. Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
One of the twelve went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He asked them, "What will you give me, and I will deliver Jesus to you?" They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that moment, Judas began to help me so that Jesus could greet them. The Last Supper.
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
He answered, "Go to the country of the one man. Tell him, 'The teacher said, 'Soon it will be time. We will celebrate Easter in your home with my students.'"
The disciples did as Jesus had told them. They prepared the Passover meal.
At night, Jesus was at the table with the twelve.
In the middle of eating, he said, "What I'm telling you is true. One of you is going to hand me over to my enemies."
The disciples felt very troubled. One by one, they began to say to him, "Surely not I, Lord?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me."
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. Woe to the one who hands over the Son of Man! It would have been better for that person if he had not been born.
Judas was the one who would betray him. He said, "Not me, Lord, not me?" Jesus answered, "It is you."
In the midst of their meal, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, and broke it. He gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take this and eat; this is my body."
Tony took the cup. He thanked them and passed it on. He said, "Each one of you drink from it."
This is my blood of the new covenant, shed for the forgiveness of sins.
That's what I say. From now on, I won't drink wine with you again until I drink it with you in my kingdom, goodbye.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus says Peter will fail.
Jesus said to them, "This very night, all of you will fall away on account of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
"But after we rise from the dead, we will go ahead of you into Galilee."
Replied Peter, "Everyone else can escape because of you. As for me, I can't."
"Truly I tell you," Jesus answered, "today, even this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times."
But Peter said, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny that I know you." All the other disciples said the same thing. Jesus prays in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
He took Peter and the sons of Zebedee with him. He began to feel sad and troubled.
He said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
He walked a little farther. Then he fell on his face and prayed, "Abba, Father, all things are possible to you; remove this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. He asked Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
Watch and pray. Lest you fall into sin when the Lord tests you. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Jesus went away again a second time and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cup may be taken away from Me, let it be taken away, but not as I will, but as You will."
Then he returned. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. And he prayed the same prayer for the third time.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand. The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of sinners."
"Come on! Let's go! That's the one who will hand me over to them!" Jesus is arrested.
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the twelve. A large crowd was with him, carrying swords and clubs. The chief priests and the elders of the people had sent them.
Judas, who was about to betray Jesus, made a sign to them. He said, "The one I kiss is he." "Seize him."
Judas immediately went to Jesus and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." And the men went forward and seized Jesus and bound him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' followers reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus told him. "For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
"Do you love me to the point where I can't ask my father to help me? He would send me an army of over 70,000 kings right away."
"Therefore, how will the scriptures be fulfilled? They say that it must happen this way."
At that time, Jesus spoke to the crowds. "Am I leading a band of armed men against you?" he asked them. "Was it necessary for you to come with swords and clubs to arrest me? Every day I sat in the temple teaching. And you did not seize me."
So all this was done to fulfill what the prophets had written. Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was taken to the high council.
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.
Not far away, Peter followed Jesus. He went into the courtyard of the high priest and entered, sitting with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole council were looking for evidence against Jesus to use against him, and they wanted to kill him.
But they found no evidence, although a group of false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses appeared.
They said, "This oppressor said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God. I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Do you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Yes," Jesus said. "Just as you say, but listen to what I tell you all. In the coming days, you will see my son Adam seated at the right hand of the Almighty. You will see my son Adam coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! What further need do we have of witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy yourselves!"
"What's your opinion?" "He must die!" they answered.
Then they spat in his face. They struck him with their palms. And the others slapped him.
They said, "Tell us, Christ! Who struck you?" Peter said he did not know Jesus.
Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant girl came to him and said, "You were with Jesus of Nazareth."
But before them all, Peter said it wasn't him. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate that led to the courtyard. Another woman saw him. She told the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Zada said it wasn't. He swore nicely, "I don't know these two!"
After a while, the ones who were standing there went to Peter. They told him, "He must be one of them," they said. "Your way of speaking gives you away."
Then Peter began to curse and swear. He vowed, "I do not know this man!" Immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Judah hangs himself.
It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They bound him and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. Feeling remorse and great sorrow for what he had done, he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
"I sinned," he said. "I convicted an innocent man." "So what?" they replied. "That's your problem."
So Judas threw the money into the temple and went away. Then he went and hanged himself.
The chief priests took the coins and said, "It is not lawful to put these into the treasury, since they are blood money."
They decided again to use the money to buy a piece of land for burial. People from other countries will be buried there.
And that is why it is called the Field of Blood to this day.
Then the words which Jeremiah the prophet had spoken were fulfilled: "They took thirty pieces of silver. That was the price set on him by the people of Israel."
"They paid me thirty pieces of silver, as the Lord commanded me. So I took the silver and bought a potter's field, as the Lord directed me." (Zechariah 11:12-13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus answered Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked Jesus, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "Yes, just as you say."
But the chief priests and elders, when they accused him, he answered nothing.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear the accusation they make against you?"
But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge. The governor was greatly amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people could choose whom they wanted.
At that time, they had a famous prisoner named Barabbas.
When the chief priests and the crowds had gathered, Pilate said to them, "Which one do you want me to release for you? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called Christ?"
They knew the leaders were Jews. They knew this because they had greeted Jesus with their hands.
At one point, while Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message. She said, "Don't have anything to do with that innocent man. I have suffered greatly in a dream because of him."
So the chief priests and the elders persuaded the people to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.
"Which of the two do you want me to divorce?" asked the governor. "Both," he replied.
"So what shall we do with Jesus, called the Christ?" asked Pilate. And they all answered, "Crucify him!"
"What? What did they do?" asked Pilate. But they cried out all the more, "Crucify him!"
When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"
All the people answered, "We and our children have incurred the guilt of his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas. But he had Jesus scourged and handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus to the palace, called the Praetorium. All the other soldiers gathered around him.
They took off his clothes and dressed him in a red-purple robe.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him. They said, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
They spat on him. They hit him on the head with a stick again and again.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They dressed him in his own clothes again. Then they led him away to crucify him. Jesus is nailed to the cross.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon. They forced him to carry the cross.
He went to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means "place of the skull."
They gave Jesus wine mixed with gall to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
They crucified him and divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They sat and guarded him in their place.
They placed the written accusation against him over his head, which read, "This is Jesus, King of the Jews."
Two criminals were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by hurled insults at Jesus and shook their heads. They mocked him.
And they said, "Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and come down from the cross!"
In the same way, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him.
They said, "He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
It depends on my Lord. My Lord saves him right away if He loves him. He is the one who said, "I am the son of God."
The very same way, the robbers who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. The death of Jesus.
From noon until three, the entire country was covered in darkness.
Around the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" That is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those standing there heard Jesus call. They said, "He's calling for Elijah."
At once one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The rest said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."
After Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, he died.
At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn from top to bottom. The earth shook. The rocks split.
Tombs were opened. Many of the righteous who had died rose to life.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus rose from the dead, they went into the holy city. They appeared to many people there.
The Roman centurion and those who were guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and all that had happened, were terrified. They cried out, "Certainly this was the Son of God!"
Not many women were there, but they were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to help with his needs.
Mary Magdalene was there. So was Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of James and John, whose father was Zebedee. Jesus was buried.
As the sun was setting, a rich man from Arimathea came. His name was Joseph. He had become a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
Place her in his new tomb he had hewn in the rock. Roll a large stone against the entrance of the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb.
The day after was the day after the day of preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
"Sir," they said, "we remember what that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will rise from the dead.'"
"So give orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day, or his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first."
"Take a few guards with you," answered Pilate. "Go and make the tomb as secure as you can."
They made the tomb secure and put him in it, then rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and sealed it. They assigned guards to watch over it.
Jesus rises from the dead.
Now the Sabbath had ended, and dawn on the first day of the week had come. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
There was a great earthquake. An angel of the Lord descended from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled back the stone and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so terrified that they trembled and became as still as corpses.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified."
He's not here! He's gone, just as he said! Come and see the place where he was lying.
Run quickly! Tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' That is what I have told you.
So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy. They ran to tell his disciples.
Suddenly they met Jesus. He said to them, "Peace be with you!" Then they came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." The guards reported this to the chief priests.
At a time when the women were on their way, some guards entered the city. They reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they devised a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
"If the governor hears this report, we'll bribe him. That'll protect you from trouble."
The soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' last commands to his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they worshiped him. Yet some still had doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
"Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And be sure that I am always with you, until the end of time."
John the Baptist prepares the way of the Lord.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago, the prophet Isaiah wrote, "Behold, I send my messenger before you. He will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord. Make his paths straight.'
And so John came. He baptized people in the wilderness. He preached to them about baptism and repentance from sins. God would then forgive them.
All the people from the region of Judea went out to him. All the people from Jerusalem went with them. When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. And he ate locusts and wild honey.
This is what John the Baptist preached: "After me comes one who is mightier than I, so mighty that I am not worthy to stoop down and tie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee. John baptized him in the Jordan River.
Jesus came up out of the water. At that moment, he saw the heavens opened, and he saw the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice called out from the sky. It said, "You are my son, and I love you very much. I am proud of you."
Immediately, the Spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness.
He was in the wilderness for forty days. There he saw the devil. The wild beasts did not harm Jesus. The angels protected him. Jesus chose his first disciples.
After they had imprisoned John, Jesus went to Galilee. He proclaimed the good news of God.
"The time is fulfilled," he said. "The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent ye, and believe the gospel!"
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting their net into the lake. They were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," Jesus said. "I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further. At the same time, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat mending their fishing nets.
Immediately he called them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, and went after Jesus. Jesus drives out a demon.
Jesus and his companions went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
People were amazed at his teaching method. He taught them as if he had authority. He did not speak to them as if they were scholars.
At that moment, a man in the Jewish assembly shouted. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said:
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? We know who you are—the Holy One of God!
"Be silent!" Jesus said firmly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it left him with a scream.
Everyone was amazed. They asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching! With great power! Even commanding the jinn and being obeyed!"
News about Jesus spread quickly throughout all Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. Immediately they went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother was lying in bed. She had a fever. They told Jesus about her.
He went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. The slave women are gone. Then she started serving them.
That evening, after sunset, they brought to Jesus all who were sick and those possessed by demons.
All the people in the city gathered in front of the door.
Jesus healed many of them. They had various diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a quiet place.
It was still dark, for the dawn had not yet broken. Jesus got up and went outside. He walked to a garden where he could be alone. There he prayed to the Lord.
Simon and his companions went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted, "Everyone's looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages. I must preach there also. That is why I have come."
Jesus walked through all the region of Galilee. He preached in their synagogues and cast out demons. He healed a man with leprosy.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. He knelt down and begged Jesus, saying, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep compassion. He reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do this." "Be clean!"
Immediately, the disease left him. God healed him.
Jesus sent him immediately. He warned him sternly.
"Don't tell anyone about this," he said. "Go and show yourself to the pasha. Offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded. That way, you will be a witness to the pasha and to all the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely. He spread the news everywhere. Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He remained outside in desolate places, but people still came to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a man who couldn't walk.
A few days later, Jesus again entered Capernaum, and the people heard that he was at home.
The people gathered in such large numbers that there was no longer any room. There was not even any space outside the door. And Jesus was teaching them.
Four of those who came were carrying one who could not walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, letting the man down on a mat, they placed him in front of Jesus.
Jesus saw their faith. He said to the man, "Your sins are forgiven."
Some of the jurists were sitting there. They were thinking.
Why is he talking like that? He's saying bad words! God is the one who forgives sins!
Tuna Isa sensed what they were thinking. He said to them, "What are you thinking in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say to this man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your bed and walk'?
"I tell you, my friend, that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus said to the paralyzed man,
"I'll tell you what," he said, "you can stay. Take your things and go home."
The man stood up and picked up his mat. Then he walked, and everyone watched him. Everyone was amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this!" Jesus chose Levi.
Once again Jesus went out beside the Sea of Galilee, and a great crowd followed him. He began to teach them.
Then he went out a little further, and saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office. And he said to him, "Follow me." So he got up and followed him.
Then Jesus ate dinner at Levi's house. A large group of tax collectors and "sinners" ate with him and his disciples. They were among the large crowd that followed Jesus.
There were some Pharisees and scribes sitting there who were critics of Jesus. They saw him eating with "sinners" and tax collectors, so they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this. So he said to them, "Those who are well don't need a doctor, but the sick do. I didn't come to call those who think they are right with God to follow me. I came to call sinners to follow me." Jesus was asked about fasting.
The disciples of John and the Pharisees fast often. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "John's disciples fast often, and the Pharisees' disciples fast often. But your disciples do not fast. Why do they not fast?"
Jesus answered and said, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People don't put a new patch on old clothes. If they do, the new patch will tear away from the old. This makes the tear bigger.
"People don't pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be lost. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins." Jesus was Lord of the Sabbath.
On a Sabbath, Jesus was walking through the fields with his disciples. The disciples began to pluck the heads of wheat.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is not lawful to do this on the Sabbath. Why are your disciples doing it?"
Reply, "What did David do? He and his men were hungry. They needed food."
This was at a time when Abiathar was high priest. David went into the house of God and ate the hallowed bread, which it was lawful only for the priests to eat. And he gave some to his men also.
Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.
Healing on Saturday
Again Jesus entered the synagogue, and a man was there with a withered hand.
Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They watched him closely. They wanted to see whether he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus said to the man with the weak and twisted hand, "Stand up in front of everyone."
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say about the Sabbath? Is it right to do good or to do evil? To save a life or to kill?" But no one answered.
Jesus looked around at them with anger. He was very distressed because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and his hand was restored as good as new.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how they might destroy Him. The multitudes followed Jesus.
Jesus went with his disciples to the Sea of Galilee. Large crowds from Galilee followed him.
The people heard about all that Jesus was doing. Large crowds came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and the region around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowds, Jesus told his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. This would keep people from crowding him.
Jesus healed many people. That's why those who were sick pushed to touch him.
When the people who were possessed by demons saw him, they fell down before him. And the demons cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus charged them that they should tell no man of him. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up a mountain and called to certain people to come to him, and they came.
He appointed twelve of them and called them apostles. From that time they were with him. And he sent them out to preach.
They had authority to cast out demons.
Jesus examined the twelve apostles. Simon was one of them. Jesus named him Peter.
There were Jacob son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
There were also Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus. There were Thaddaeus and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was one of them. He was the one who later betrayed Jesus to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebul.
Jesus entered a house. The crowd gathered again, and it was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about this. That means they went to get him and make fun of him. They said, "This man doesn't talk anymore."
A group of scholars were present. They came from Jerusalem. They said, "He acts by the power of Beelzebul! And he casts out demons by the authority of the prince of demons."
Jesus said to them, "How can Satan drive out Satan?"
If a kingdom fights against itself, it cannot stand.
If the family is divided, do not be steadfast.
