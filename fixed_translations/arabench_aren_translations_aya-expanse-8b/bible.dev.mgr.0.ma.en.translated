The first chapter speaks of the ancestors of Jesus Christ.
These are the names of Jesus Christ's ancestors: David, Abraham.
Ibrahim, son of Isaac, Isaac, son of Jacob, Jacob, son of Judah, and his brothers.
Judah begat Peresh, and Peresh begat Zerah by Tamar; and Zerah begat Carshena.
And Aram was the son of Shem, and Shem's son was Ham, and Ham's son was Noah.
And Salmon begat Boaz from Rahab, Boaz begat Obed from Ruth, and Obed begat Jesse.
And Solomon, the son of King David, was born. David had conceived Solomon from the woman with whom Uriah was married.
Solomon was the son of Rehabeam, Rehabeam was the son of Abijah, and Abijah was the son of Asaph.
And Asa had a son named Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat had a son named Joram, and Joram had a son named Azariah.
And Hezekiah was the son of Ahaz, and Ahaz the son of Yotam,
And Hezekiah was the son of Manasseh, Manasseh was the son of Amos, and Amos was the son of Josiah.
And Josiah was born in the land of Babylon, while his father and mother were among the Jewish exiles there.
And after they returned from Babylon, Yehniah was born to Shaltiel, and Shaltiel to Zerubbabel.
Zarbabel was the son of Abihud, Abihud was the son of Eliacim, and Eliacim was the son of Azariah.
And Azur, son of Zadok, and Zadok, son of Ahim, and Ahim, son of Eliud,
And Eliud was the son of Eliezar, Eliezar was the son of Metan, and Metan was the son of Jacob.
Jacob was Joseph's son, Mary's husband, who gave birth to Jesus, who is called Christ.
All these generations, from Abraham to David, are fourteen in number, and from David to the time of the exile to Babylon, fourteen more, and from the exile to the birth of Christ, fourteen more. The birth of Jesus Christ.
Thus was the birth of Jesus Christ: Mary, being betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit. Luke
And Joseph, her fiancé, was a God-fearing man who did not want to expose her, so he decided to part ways with her in secret.
And as he pondered these things, he saw in a vision an angel of the Lord who said to him: "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
"Behind her, a son was born, and they named him Jesus, for he is the one who will save his people from their sins." (Luke)
And all this happened so that the words of the Lord might be fulfilled through the prophet's mouth, who said:
"She will give birth to a son, and he will be named Emmanuel, which means 'God is with us'."
And when Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him, and he married Mary.
But he did not go in to her until she had given birth to a son, and he named him Jesus. Luke 2:21
The second chapter, the scientists of the stars came to see Jesus.
And when Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea during the reign of King Herod, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, following a star.
Kaisolo: "Where is the king of the Jews who is born? For we have seen his star rising in the east, and we have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was frightened, as were all the people of Jerusalem.
And he gathered together all the religious leaders and scholars of the law, and asked them, "Where is the birthplace of Christ?"
And they answered him, "Bethlehem in Judea, for it is written by the prophet:
And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who will govern my people Israel."
And after Herod sent the wise men of the stars to seek the child, they inquired about the time when the star had appeared.
And after they sent them to Bethlehem, he said to them, "Go and take care of the child. And when you find him, come and tell me so that I too may go and worship him."
And when they heard the king's words, they went. And it came to pass, as they looked toward the east, they saw the star which they had seen before, and it went before them until it came to the place where the child was, and stopped there.
And without seeing the star, they were very happy.
When they entered the house, they saw the child with Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. They opened their treasures and offered him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
And when they understood that he meant not to return to Herod, they departed by another way and returned to their own country. Jesus' family fled to Egypt.
And after the scholars had left, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said to him: "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child to kill him."
Yusuf struggled with the boy, and after midnight, they traveled to Egypt.
And he remained there until Herod died, to fulfill the word of the Lord spoken by the prophet, "Out of Egypt I called my son." Herod killed the infants in Bethlehem.
When Herod realized that the wise men from the stars had come to look for the child, he was greatly troubled and ordered the killing of all the boys in Bethlehem and its surroundings, from two years old and down, for he knew from the wise men from the stars the time that had been fulfilled.
And thus the word of the Lord came to pass through the mouth of the prophet Jeremiah, who said:
From Ramah, you hear wailing and mourning in great abundance; Rachel weeps for her children, and refuses consolation, for her children are dead. The family of Jesus returns from Egypt.
And when Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; and he sent, and gathered together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, and inquired of them where Christ should be born.
And he said to him: "Take the child and go back to the land of Israel, for those who sought to kill the child are dead."
Joseph took the child and left him in Egypt, and then returned to the land of Israel.
But when Meli heard that Archelaus had been appointed to rule over Judea in Herod's place, he feared returning to the same fate. And when God warned him in a dream, he went to Galilee.
And there came one to a city called Nazareth, where he dwelt, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, saying, He shall be called a Nazarite. Mark 1:24; Luke 2:39; John 1:45
The third chapter of the Gospel of John introduces John the Baptist, who testifies to the light (Jesus), and declares that he is not the light, but serves to prepare the way for him.
And you, Liam, John the Baptist went into the desert of the land of Judea to preach to the people.
Tell them: "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand." When?
And this is the man of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke when he said, "A loud cry in the wilderness, and a voice saying, 'Find the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.'"
And John's clothing was made of camel's hair, and he had a belt of skin, and he lived on locusts and wild honey.
And people came to him from Jerusalem and from all the region of Judea, and from the areas beyond the Jordan River.
They sought to please the king of Jordan, and they confessed their sins.
And John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to him, and he said to them, "You brood of vipers, how are you to escape the coming judgment of God?
Show your repentance through your good deeds.
And don't think you're seeing things: I am Abraham. I tell you, God is able to make sons of Abraham out of these stones. John
Now, the fruits are hanging on the tree branches, and whenever a tree doesn't bear good fruits, it's cut down and thrown away. When?
I will baptize you with water, but the one who comes after me is mightier than I am, and I am not worthy to untie his shoelaces. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
"And the rain-bearing cloud guides me with it in studying and gathering the grain in my barns, but the straw, I will burn it, for the blessing that has never been poured." (John baptizing Jesus)
And afterward Jesus went from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
But John did not leave him and said, "I am the one who needs to be baptized by you, and you are coming to me to be baptized?"
Jesus answered and said to him, "Now it is not right for you to do so, but we must fulfill God's will." And he allowed John to baptize him.
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, went out of the water. And the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming on him.
And you will hear the voice from heaven say: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Matthew 12:18; 17:5; Mark 1:11; Luke 9:35
Chapter IV: Satan Tests Jesus
And after these things, Jesus was led into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil. Hebrews
He fasted for twenty-four days and twenty-four nights, and then hunger came.
And Satan came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread."
And Jesus answered him, "It is written in the Book of God: Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God."
And afterward Satan entered into the holy city of Jerusalem, and stood on a high place over the house of God,
He said to him: "If you were a son of God, throw your head down, for it is written in the Book of God: 'God will command His angels over you, and they will support you so that your foot does not strike against a stone.'"
Jesus answered and said, "It is written in the Second Book of God: You shall not put the Lord your God to the test."
And after Satan appeared to a man on a very high mountain, behind which were the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said to her: "I will give you this only if you prostrate yourself before me and worship me."
And Jesus answered him, "Go in thy way, Satan! For it is written in the book of God: 'Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.'"
And after that, Satan left him, and some angels came to tempt him. Jesus went to preach in Galilee.
When Jesus heard that John the Baptist was arrested, he returned to Galilee. Matthew
And Jesus left Nazareth and made his home in Capernaum, by the sea of Galilee, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali. John
Thus it came to pass that what the prophet Isaiah said was fulfilled.
"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, by the sea, by the way of the Jordan, the land of Galilee, of the people who walk in darkness."
The people who lived in darkness saw a great light, and those who dwelt in the land of death, in the gloom, a light shone upon them.
From that time on, Jesus began to tell the people, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near." Matthew 3:2 Jesus chose his first disciples.
And as Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who was called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting their net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
They left their windows open and followed him.
And afterward, he went out and saw two brothers, Simon Peter and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. And he called them,
They left their boats and followed Jesus. Jesus taught and healed.
And Jesus went about all the country of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of weakness among the people. Matthew
He left the news of his departure throughout Syria, and he brought relief to the sick who were suffering from their illnesses: the possessed, those with mental disorders, the lame, and he healed them.
And many groups from Galilee, the ten tribes, Jerusalem, the land of Judah, and from beyond the Jordan River followed him.
Chapter V: The Sermon on the Mount
And when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain. And when his disciples came to him,
And he began to teach them, saying:
The happiness of the poor is in the spirit, for they have the kingdom of heaven.
The sadness that they are going through, God will comfort them.
The meek shall inherit the earth.
Those who are hungry and thirsty for God's obedience, they will be satisfied.
Those who show mercy will be shown mercy by God.
Those with pure hearts will see God.
Those who help people live in happiness are called the Children of God.
Those who reject following the path of righteousness, for they have the kingdom of heaven (1 Peter 3:14)
And do not be surprised if people slander and oppose you, and speak evil things against you falsely, as if it were something good in their eyes. 1 Peter 4:14
Rejoice and leap for joy, for your reward is great in heaven, for thus it was with the prophets who were before you." (Matthew 7:52) The urgent matter on earth and the light of the world.
You are the salt of the earth; but if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled under foot. Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34,35
We are the light of the world; a city on a hill cannot be hidden. - John
And there is not even one who lights a lamp and puts it under a bushel, but on a stand, so that it may shine on all who are in the house. Mark
So let your light shine before others, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven." - 1 Peter 2:12 (NIV)
He doesn't expect you to follow Moses' law or the laws of the prophets, he didn't come to abolish them, but to complete them.
We tell you the truth: the sky and the earth will change, not a single letter or dot of the Law will change until everything in it is fulfilled. Luke
Whoever does not do even one of these little commandments and teaches others to do so will be the smallest in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does them and teaches them to others will be great in the kingdom of heaven.
And I tell you: unless your obedience surpasses that of the scholars of the Law and the Pharisees, you will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven." (Paraphrased)
You've probably heard it said to the younger ones: "Do not kill, and whoever kills will be held accountable."
But let me tell you: those who worry about their brothers should control them, and those who say to their brothers, "You are of no use," should be controlled in the great court. And those who say to their brothers, "You fool," deserve the fire of Hell.
Or else, you bring your gift, place it on the altar, and meditate on doing what is right in regard to your brother.
Leave your gift in front of the altar and go reconcile with your brother in the lobby, then come back to give your gift.
Make peace with those who are accusing you. No one will be left on the road to court, before you reach the judge, the judge will put you in the hands of the guard, and the guard will put you in jail.
I'll tell you the truth: you won't leave here until you settle the other debt you owe." Corruption
You've heard it said: Don't spoil it.
But let me tell you: whoever sees a woman with desire, he has corrupted his heart with her.
Otherwise, if your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. For it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. When?
Or else, your hand will be cut off and thrown at your feet, for it is better that you lose one part of your body than that your whole body be thrown into hell. (Matthew 18:8; Mark 9:43) Divorce
And another thing: A man who divorces his wife, especially needs to give her her share. When?
But I say to you: whoever divorces his wife for any reason other than sexual immorality, will be in danger of falling into immorality; and whoever marries a divorced woman will also be in danger of falling into immorality." Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11,12; Luke 16:18; 1 Corinthians 7:10,11 (NIV)
You heard again that your ancestors said: "Unless you keep your oaths, die to the Lord with your oaths."
Now, I tell you: Never swear, not even by the sky, for it is the throne of God, Jacob.
Not even on the earth, where his feet stand, or in Jerusalem, the city of the great King.
And don't swear by your head either, because you can't even return a single strand of his eyelash as black or white.
But if your words are yes, say yes. If your words are no, say no. And any words beyond these are from the devil." (Revenge)
You have heard it said: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
But I tell you: Do not return evil for evil, but whoever slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other to him as well.
And if someone wants to sue you to take your clothes, leave them your suspenders.
Or else, there's one thing that will push you to take a thousand steps with him, walk two thousand with him.
"Give what someone asks for, and if someone wants to borrow from you, don't refuse them empty-handed." They want their dues.
You have heard it said: Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
But I tell you: Don't seek revenge, but leave it to those who have been wronged.
So that you may be like your children in the heavens, for it is He who causes the sun to rise over both the righteous and the wicked, and who causes rain to fall on both those who do good and those who do evil.
If all you do is what you want, what reward do you have? Is this not even done by tax collectors?
Or else, you'll only be left with your own company. How are we any better than others? Is this how even those who worship idols act?
"Be complete, as you are in the sky complete."
Chapter Six: Charity
"Do good not for people to see, but for your own reward before heaven. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." (Matthew 6:4)
If you want to give charity, don't do it in public like hypocrites do in mosques and alleys so people will praise them. I'm telling you the truth: they've already earned their reward from people.
But if you give me something as charity, your left hand not knowing what your right hand does.
"So that your charity remains secret, and He who is in the heavens, whose sight nothing escapes, is the One who will reward you." (Prayer)
And when they pray, they do not pray as the hypocrites, who stand in prayer in the mosques, only to be seen by people. I tell you the truth: they have already earned their reward from the people. (Luke 11:43)
As soon as you finish praying, go into your house, close the door, and pray to your Lord in secret. It is He who will reward you for your deeds.
And when they pray, do not be like those who merely recite words without thought, like those who worship idols, believing that the more they speak, the more God will listen to them.
"Don't be like them, because the stars above know exactly what you need, even before you ask for it."
And thus we pray in this prayer: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be thy name."
And your kingdom comes, and your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
The bread that provides our daily sustenance.
And forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us.
And we preserved, so that we would not fall into the experiment, and we saved ourselves from the devil.
If you do not forgive others their mistakes, your own mistakes will not be forgiven in the heavens.
"But unless you forgive people their mistakes, your own mistakes will not be forgiven in the heavens." (The Fasting)
"Unless you remain silent, do not look sullen like the hypocrites who wear a grimace to show people they are fasting. Let us tell you the truth: they have earned their reward from men."
But when you finish fasting, grease your hair and wash your face,
"Even if you walk among people while fasting, those who know your secret will reward you. The one who knows everything, no matter how hidden, will give you your due." Treasures in the sky.
Do not amass for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust corrupt, and where thieves break in and steal. — Jacob
But gather for yourselves treasures in heaven, where they do not fade away or get rusted, and where thieves do not break in and steal them.
"Wherever your treasure is, there your heart will be." - Noor al-Daat
The eye is the lantern of the soul. If your eye is good, your whole soul will be illuminated.
But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. If the light in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!" God and wealth
No one can be a slave to money, no matter if they prefer one over the other, or if they are loyal to one and betray the other. That's why we can't be God's slaves and money slaves at the same time. Don't let money control you.
And on this, I say to you: Do not let your concern be for your life - what you will eat or drink, or for your body - what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds in the sky; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns. Yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Who among you, if they bear the burden of worry, can add even an hour to their life?
And why do you use worry for clothes? Look carefully at the roses in the field, how they grow, they don't struggle, they just twist.
But let us tell you the truth: even Solomon, in all his glory, never wore anything like these roses.
Oh, how few are our beliefs! If the spring in the field, which we see today and which tomorrow will be thrown into the fire, God has dressed thus, how can we not dress ourselves well?
And on that account, do not despair and say: What shall we eat? Or what shall we drink? Or what shall we wear?
Even those who do not know God seek this, and your Lord knows that you truly need all of this.
But their hearts are far from the kingdom of God and its purpose, and all this will be added to you.
Do not burden yourselves with worries for the day after tomorrow; let tomorrow take care of its own worries. And each day brings its own blessings, unburdened by the worries of the past."
Chapter VII: Do Not Judge a Person
Do not judge others, so that they do not judge you.
Where there is judgment, there will be authority over you; and where there is expression, it will express itself to you. Mark
Why do you notice the straw in your brother's eye, and ignore the beam in your own?
And how are you going to tell your brother to leave the straw in your eye, when your eye has a stick in it?
Oh, this hypocrite, he only hides behind the veil of time, at this very moment, you should see clearly to remove the straw from your brother's eye.
"Do not give the sacred thing to dogs, or they will harm you and bite you, and do not throw your essence to the oath-takers, or they will defile it with their feet." They asked, they searched, they knocked.
They asked and you gave. They searched and found. They knocked and the door opened for them.
The path one walks is what one receives, the one who turns away will be locked out, and the one who knocks on the door will have it opened.
Whoever among you is asked by his son for bread will give him a stone.
And if he is asked for a favor, will he give it?
Come on, if you're not even able to give your children good things, how can the ones up in the sky give good things to those who ask for them?
As you wish people to do to you, so do to them; for this is the law and the prophets." (Luke 6:31) The Narrow Door
Enter through the narrow door, for the door that leads to destruction is wide and easy to enter, and many enter through it.
How narrow the door and how steep the path that leads to life, and how few find it. The tree knows from its fruit.
Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing but are inwardly ravenous wolves.
Know them by their fruits. Can you gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
Thus, every good tree bears good fruit, and every bad tree bears bad fruit.
A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
A tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown away. When?
"This way, you will know them." (Matthew 12:33) We should do God's will.
"Walk the talk, they say: 'My Lord, My Lord!' He will enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but whoever enters it is the one who does the will of Heaven."
For you, the day, many will say to me: "Sir, Sir! Are you prophesying in your name? Did we go mad in your name? Did we perform many miracles in your name?"
Here is the translation of the given text: "This is what I'll tell them: I've never known you! Stay away from me, you meddlers! Two days is a long time."
The way one listens to my words and acts upon them is like a man who builds his house on a rock.
And when winter fell and the rivers overflowed, a strong wind blew and the rooster of the house crowed, she did not flinch, because her roots were set in the rock.
And he who hears these words of mine and does not act on them, is like a man who builds his house on sand.
And when winter fell and the eyes overflowed, a strong wind came and the rooster's crows, they huddled together, their fear strong.
And when Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, Mark
As he was teaching them, he was not like their religious scholars, but rather had his own authority.
The eighth chapter, Jesus the Revealer, is a man of courage.
And when Jesus had come down from the mountain, great crowds followed him.
And when a man of the tribe of Judah approached him, he fell on his face and said, "My lord, if you wish, you can make me clean."
He stretched out his hand and touched Jesus, saying, "I wish I were clean!" And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was clean.
Jesus said to him, "Be careful, and do not tell it to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony for them." The servant of the captain of the army was healed.
And when Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion of the Roman army came to him, earnestly seeking him.
He said: "Sir, my servants at home are lying in bed paralyzed and suffering a lot."
He said to him, "Come, let us go and see him."
The military leader replied: "I don't deserve, my lord, for you to enter under my roof, but just say one word and my servants will be at your service."
Even though I am here ruling and I have soldiers ruling under me, I would say to this one: Go! And he goes, and I would say to the other: Come! And he comes, and I would say to my servant: Do this! And he does it.
When he heard Jesus, he was amazed, and said to those who followed him, "I tell you, I have not found such strong faith even in Israel."
And I said to you that many from the east and the west will come and dine with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. Luke
"As for those who should have been in the kingdom, they will be outside in the darkness, and there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." (Matthew 24:30)
And afterward, Jesus said to the centurion, "Go! As you have believed, it shall be done for you." And at that very hour his servant was healed. Jesus healed Peter's mother-in-law and many others.
When Jesus entered Peter's house, he found Peter's wife lying in bed, suffering from a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She rose and served him.
And when he finished the evening prayers, many people possessed by madness came to him, and madness left them through a word from him, and he healed the sick.
And thus is fulfilled the saying of the prophet Isaiah: "He has taken our infirmities and carried our diseases." How then should those who follow Jesus be?
And when Jesus saw the great crowd about him, he commanded his disciples to go to the other side of the sea.
He approached one of the religious scholars and said to him: "My lord, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered and said, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
He told another of his disciples: "Master, let me go dig a grave."
But Jesus answered him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead!" And Jesus gave a great cry.
And when Jesus had entered into the boat, his disciples followed him.
A strong wind blew over the sea, so strong that even the mast of the boat bent, and Jesus was asleep.
They approached him with his disciples, and they woke him up and said to him, "Free us, our master, for we are dying!"
He said to them, "Why are you afraid? Is this a lack of faith?" And then, he stood up and walked on the sea and the wind calmed. The world was at peace.
And the men marveled, saying, "Who is this that even the wind and the sea obey him?" Jesus cast out the devils from both men.
When Jesus reached the other side of the sea, into the region of the Gadarenes, two men possessed by demons came out of the tombs, and they were so violent that no one could pass that way.
And they said to him, "What is between us and you, O son of God? Why have you come here to torment us before our time?"
And one of the alliances was a large straying in a place near the end.
And they desired to kill Jesus, and laid a plot against him, saying, "If we let him go, all will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away our nation and our heritage."
He told them, "Go!" and they went in, and the whole piece of the cliff gave way and fell into the sea, and they drowned in the water.
The freed men fled and went to the city, where they reported what had happened, and what had befallen the men who had been driven mad.
And all the inhabitants of the city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they desired that he should depart from their country.
Chapter IX: Jesus, the Revealer, Paralyzed
And Jesus got into the boat, and crossing over, he departed and came to his city.
They brought to him a man who was paralyzed and lay on a bed. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
A few scholars of Islamic law were concerned and said: "This man is speaking words of disbelief!"
Jesus perceived their thoughts and said, "Why do you have such thoughts in your hearts?
It's easy to say: Your sins are forgiven, but is it easy to act and walk?
"But I will show you that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins." And he said to the paralytic, "Get up, take your mat and go home."
The man struggled and walked to his house.
And when they saw the crowds, they were afraid and gave glory to God who had given such authority to mankind. Jesus chose the time.
And as Jesus was passing by, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. And he said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
After Jesus' meal at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and sinners came to him and sat down with him and his disciples. Luke
When the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
And he heard them, and answered and said, "It is not those who have health who need a physician, but those who are sick."
Go and learn the meaning of these words: "I truly desire mercy, not sacrifice, for I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners." (On fasting)
Then came some of John's disciples to Jesus and asked, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus answered them, "Can the guests at a wedding fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom is taken from them, and then they will fast."
You can't patch an old garment with a piece of new fabric; the patch will only shrink and make the tear bigger.
And even if no one is making new wine in leather bags in front of them, for if it is done in them, the wine will leak out and the bags will be ruined. But we make new wine in new bags, so that neither the wine nor the bags are lost." - Mary, the mother of Jesus' words.
And when they told him this, a leader came and fell on his face and said, "My daughter is dead, but come, put your hand on her and she will live."
Jesus and his followers struggled together.
And a woman was there who had been suffering from bleeding for twelve years. She had come behind Jesus and touched his cloak.
As she pondered, she said to herself: "If I don't find a way out, I'm in for it."
And looking around, Jesus saw her and said, "Daughter, your faith has made you well." And at that very hour the woman was healed.
And when Jesus came to the governor's house, he saw that they were using money to bribe the guards, and the crowd was causing a commotion.
Tell them: "Get out of here! The girl isn't dead, she's just sleeping!" They laughed at him.
And when Jesus had cast them out, he took the little girl by the hand and lifted her up.
Farewell to the news, for this whole atmosphere is filled with it. Jesus has healed both the blind.
And as Jesus was walking on that day, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, O Son of David!"
As soon as he entered the house, the blind were brought to him. And asking them, "Do you believe that I am able to heal you?", they answered, "Yes, Sir!"
And it came to pass, as Jesus opened his eyes, that he saw their faith, and said unto them, According to your faith, it shall be unto you.
As their eyes were being dulled, Jesus rebuked them and said, "You have eyes, but you do not see."
But they came out and started spreading the news in that whole area. Zizon is catching up.
And they did not come out until they brought to him a man possessed by a demon, blind.
And when Jesus had cast out the devils, the mute spoke. And they were amazed, saying among themselves, "Never have we seen anything like this in Israel!"
The Pharisees said, "A demon is casting out a demon!" Matthew 10:25; 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15 - The trial of Jesus
And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and healing every sickness and every disease among them. Matthew
And when he saw the crowds of people, he had compassion on them, for they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them. Mark
He said to his disciples: "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore, pray the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest."
"Eva asked the harvest lord to send the harvest to her harvest."
Chapter Ten: Jesus Sends His Disciples Out.
And after Jesus had rebuked his disciples for their inaction, he gave them authority to drive out demons and to heal people from every kind of disease and illness.
And these are the names of the indifferent apostles: first, Simon, nicknamed Peter, and his brother Andrew, James, son of Zebedee, and John, his brother.
And Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
And Simon Peter, and Judas Iscariot, who would betray Jesus.
And Jesus sent them out, saying, "Do not go into any town of the Gentiles, and do not enter any house of Samaritans.
But he went to the injured sheep of the people of Israel.
And as you go, tell the people that the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, and cast out devils. Take it for free, give it for free.
What you carry in your pockets is not gold, not silver, not copper.
No luxuries, no elegant clothing, no fine shoes, no canes, or similar for the servants; for they deserve their food. 1 Corinthians 9:14; 1 Timothy 5:18
And neither the city nor the square that you entered should you trust, look for someone who deserves to host you, and stay with them until you can leave on your own.
If you enter a house, greet its owner.
If they don't deserve your greeting, your greeting will return to you. If they do, your greeting will reach them.
Otherwise, they won't accept you as owners of any house or city, and they won't listen to your words. Leave here and shake off the dust that's under your feet. Deeds

The student's way is better than his teacher, and the servant is better than his master. Luke
Blessed is the student who is like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they call the master of the house Beelzebul, what will they say about his family? Matthew 9:34; 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15
Do not fear them, for the hidden will be revealed, and the concealed will be brought to light. Mark (or Marcus)

"Whoever gives one of these children, even just a cold glass of water, is still my student. To tell you the truth, it doesn't reduce their reward."
The chapter describes how John the Baptist sends his disciples to Jesus.
And when Jesus had finished giving his commandments to his disciples, he departed from them to go and teach and preach the gospel to the Jews.
When John in prison heard of Christ's deeds, he sent his disciples to ask him.
He said: "Shall we wait for him, or shall we wait for someone else?"
Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you have seen and heard."
The blind shall see, the lame shall walk, the deaf shall hear, the mute shall speak, the dead shall live, and the poor shall hear the gospel.
"And the happiness of those who don't disturb you."
And when his disciples John were gone, Jesus began to speak to the multitudes about John, saying, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A man dressed in loose garments? Behold, I tell you, there are many who dress themselves in loose garments and wander about among the tombs."
And what do you see? A man wearing a thin garment? Those who wear thin garments, they live in the palaces of kings!
What did you come out to see? Is it something important? I'll tell you, it's more than just a prophet.
And this is what God said in His Book: "I will send My Messenger before you who will guide you to the right path."
And I tell you, not even one of those born of women is greater than John the Baptist, but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From John the Baptist to this day, the kingdom of heaven is growing with power, and the strong are trying to seize it. Luke
The prophecies of the prophets and the law of Moses foretold even to the time when John the Baptist came.
Except you repent, John the Baptist is the Elijah who is to come. When?
He who has ears to hear, let him hear!
But how can we trust this generation? They're like kids in the market, shouting at each other and talking.
We blew you up with the lira and you didn't even move, and we cried for you and you didn't cry!
In John's way, he ate and drank nothing, and said: This is the way of the devil.
Man was born to eat and drink, they say: This is food and drink and companions, apart from the taxmen and the corrupt! But God's wisdom writes righteous things in its account." Woe to those who do not repent.
And at that time, Jesus began to say to them, "I am the bread of life; whoever comes to
Woe to you, Korzin! Woe to you, house of Sidon! If the miracles that were done among you had been done in Tire and Sidon, how much longer would they have persisted? They wore sackcloth and ashes; #11:21 they wore sackcloth and ashes: to show their repentance.

And at that hour Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children.
Oh Father, thus it was your will.
The Father has given me everything, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son, and whoever the Son reveals him to. John 3:35; John 1:18; 10:15
Come to me, those of you who are tired and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Shake off your prejudices against me and learn from me, for I am cultured and humble, and you will find peace for your souls.
"My mood is good and my load is light."
Chapter 5: Jesus teaches on the Sabbath
And leaving them, he went into the fields on the Sabbath day, and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.
And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, "Behold, your disciples do things which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!"
Answer them: "Didn't you read what David did when hunger seized him and those with him?"
How did he enter the House of God, and how did he eat the bread they offered to God, which was not meant for him or for those with him, except for the religious leaders?
And what if they (the religious leaders) read in the Torah that on the Sabbath day, while they serve in the house of God, they profane the Sabbath, and even if that's not their fault?
But I tell you, there is something here greater than the temple of God.
And if you understood the meaning of the verse I am saying: I want mercy, not sacrifice; if you do not blame those who have no fault.
"Wherever man is born, God is the Lord of the Sabbath." Jesus was revealing Himself on the Sabbath day.
And he who had been lost walked towards their prayer house.
They found a man with a paralyzed hand. They asked him and said, "Is it permissible to seek treatment on Saturday?" They asked him to find a charge against him.
Answer them: "Suppose one of you has a single sheep that falls into a pit on the Sabbath; would you not lift it out and take care of it?" Luke
"Eva, the value of a human being is much greater than a sheep! And that's why doing good on Saturday is permitted."
Jesus said to the man with the withered hand, "Stretch out your hand!" And he stretched it out, and it was restored, like the other hand.
The Pharisees conspired together on how to kill Jesus. Jesus is the chosen one of God.
And when Jesus had heard it, he departed thence, and followed him great multitudes, and he healed them all.
And he advised them not to tell anyone about him.
So that the words of the prophet Isaiah may be fulfilled:
Here is the translation of the text: "Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul finds great delight. I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall declare justice to the nations."
I don't argue and I don't complain, until the point where his voice is barely heard in the alleys.
A split reed does not bend, A wick that releases smoke does not light, Until justice prevails, it will not be overcome.
And in his name, they will make the nations tremble at his feet." Jesus and Beelzebul
Some people brought to Jesus a man who was blind and had a withered hand, and he healed him, so that he could speak and see.
And the people were amazed and said, "Is this not David's son?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This is how madness comes out, only through Beelzebul, the prince of demons." Matthew 9:34; 10:25
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
If Satan comes to drive out Satan, Satan will be divided and against himself, and if he is divided and against himself, how will his kingdom stand?
If not, I'll be in Baelzebul, we'll go mad, who is this one who takes your children out with him? For this, your children will judge you.
But if I were not from God, I would be leading you astray, for the Kingdom of God is among you.
How can someone enter someone's home, steal their belongings, and not get caught, and then steal their house?
He who walks with me is for me, and he who does not gather with me scatters. Mark 9:40
That's why I tell you this: Every sin and every blasphemy will be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks a word against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come." - Luke 12:10
Planting a good tree will bear good fruit, and planting a bad tree will bear bad fruit. It is the fruit that identifies the tree. When
"A true speaker! How can you say nice words when you're not even nice? What comes out of the heart speaks through the mouth. When?"
A good person takes out the good things from the good treasure in their heart, and a failed person takes out the failed things from the failed treasure in their heart.
And remember: All empty talk that people engage in will be held accountable for on the Day of Judgment.
"Whether you speak or remain silent, your fate will be determined by either praise or blame." The scholars of religion and the Pharisees wanted to see a sign.
And there were two of the scribes and Pharisees who came near and heard them arguing. They said to Jesus, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from You." When
He said to them, "A wicked and corrupt generation asks for a sign! But no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. When
For just as the whale remained in Jonah's belly for three days and three nights, so will the human child remain in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
The people of Nineveh will follow them on the day of judgment of this generation and testify against them, for they were given a chance when the Greeks warned them, and here is one of the Greeks present now.
And the Queen of the South will come and follow after this generation, and will witness against them, for she came from a distant land to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, here is one greater than Solomon.
The way to get rid of the devil within a person is to search for places devoid of water, where there is no comfort to be found.
Saying: Let's go back to the house I left, and when we return, we will find it empty, looted, and destroyed.
And kimchi and kidi with seven kinds of madness are worse than that. And when they enter, they settle down, and the state of that evil man becomes worse than his initial state. This is what will happen to this generation that does evil as well." Jesus' brothers and mother
And every time he was talking to groups of people, a mob and his relatives came and stood outside, wanting to talk to him.
He said to one of those present: "Here are your brother and sister standing outside, wanting to speak to you." [12:47] This verse is not found in many of the older manuscripts.
And Jesus answered him, saying, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"
He pointed with his hand towards them and said, "Here are my wife and sister."
"Those who do their will in the sky, they are my brothers and sisters and friends."
The chapter discusses the various types of farming.
And when day was well advanced, Jesus went out of the house and stood by the sea.
And a great crowd gathered around him. Because of the press, he got into a boat and sat down, and the great crowd stood by the sea. Luke 5:1-3
He returned to them with a lot of things made of mud and straw: "This is a man who went out to farm."
And when the wheat had ripened, they threshed some of it in the field, and the birds came and ate them.
And the seeds fell on different grounds; some were hard and lacked much soil, and immediately they sprouted as the soil was not waterlogged.
And when the sun rises, they burn, and if they don't have walls, they dry out.
They fell into thorns in the midst of the forest, and the thorns pierced them.
And some fell on good ground and bore fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.
"He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"
They approached him and asked, "Why are you talking to people in a foreign language?"
He answered them and said, "I give you these things that you may understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but they have been given to them so that they may not understand them.
To those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance; but from those who have not, even what they have will be taken away. When?
And I was talking to them about the immediate consequences when they see, but don't understand, and when they hear, but don't comprehend.
And thus the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled: Though you hear what you hear, you will not understand, and though you see what you see, it will not benefit you.
As the hearts of this people are hard, their hearing is faint, and their eyes are closed, so they do not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their hearts, and they return to me to be healed.
But your eyes are glad when you see, and your ears when you hear. Luke
"Give you the truth: Many prophets and righteous people long to see what you see and hear what you hear, but they have not been granted that." - The parable of the farmer.
"Hear now the meaning of the parable of the man who sows."
Those who hear the words of the Kingdom of God but do not understand them, the devil comes and steals what has been sown in their hearts, and this is what is compared to the seed that fell on the path.
And he who plants in the rocky soil, that is he who hears the word of God and accepts it with joy.
But the Word of God did not take root well in his heart, and his faith remained for a short time; and when trials and temptations came, he quickly turned away from faith.
And he who is planted among thorns, it is he who hears the words of God, but the world and the love of money choke the words of God, and he bears no fruit.
"But those who are planted in the good land, they listen to God's words and understand them. They bear fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold." (Parable of the Sower in the wheatfield)
And Jesus gave them another parable, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
And when the people were asleep, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away.
And when the crops grew and the ears appeared, the weeds also became visible.
They brought the servants of the master of the house and showed him: "Sir, isn't it the good seed that you sowed in your field? But where did this weed come from?"
He answered them: "This enemy did this." And his servants said to him: "Shall we go and chase him away?"
And he answered them, saying: No! So that the grain does not get choked with weeds.
Let the corn grow with the weeds until harvest time, and at that time we say to the harvesters to gather the weeds first and tie them into bundles to be burned, while the corn is gathered and taken to my storage house. » (An example of mustard seed and an example of yeast)
And he told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field.
"Waxa ay halkan yahay in ay ahaa qurux ah ee cibaadada, markii ay u dhammaan ay u noqon doonaan geedka ugu weyn ka hor, ilaa in ay daawo oo samada u yimaado inay ku qor doonaan geedkii ay u dhammaaneen."
And he gave them another parable, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman takes and hides in three measures of meal, until all is leavened." Jesus spoke in parables.
And all this Jesus did to teach the people, and without parables he would not have taught them anything.
To fulfill the statement of the Prophet: "With the dawn, we speak and announce all that was hidden from the day the world was created." The meaning of this metaphor is...
And when Jesus had left the crowd, he went home. And his disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field!"
And He answered them, saying, "The one who sows the good seed is the human child,
And a field is the world, and good wheat is the children of the kingdom of God, and weeds are the children of the devil.
The enemy who sows the tares is Satan, the harvest is the End of Time, and the reapers are the angels.
And as the grass grows and burns in the healthy way, so it will be in the end of time.
He will send his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom all the things that cause sin and all those who commit them.
They throw them into the abyss of health, for there will be no escape from crying and grinding teeth.
But those who obey God will shine like the sun in their kingdom. So, whoever has ears, let them hear!" The parable of the treasure, the pearl, and the net.
And the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. A man found it and hid it again, and from his great joy he went and sold all that he had and bought that field.
And it is like the Kingdom of Heaven to a merchant who seeks fine pearls.
And when he found a very precious stone, he sold all that he had and bought it."
And the kingdom of heaven is like a net that the fishermen cast into the sea, and gather all kinds of fish.
And when they grew up, they went out as fishermen by the sea, and they sorted out the good ones from the bad, keeping the good and throwing away the bad.
And thus it shall be in the end of time: Angels shall come and separate the righteous from the unrighteous.
They throw cities into the abyss of illness, where tears and the gnashing of teeth will be. The new and the old treasure.
Jesus soliled his disciples and said, "Do you understand all these things?" And they said, "Yes!"
He said to them, "Behold, this is it: every scholar of the law knows the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a house who brings out from his treasure new and old things." Nazareth did not accept Jesus.
And when Jesus had finished this speech, he departed thence.
And he returned to his city, Nazareth, teaching in the synagogues, and everyone was amazed, and they began to ask, "Where did he get this wisdom and these miracles?"
Is this the carpenter's son? Is this not Mary, and his brothers are Jacob, Joseph, Simon, and Judah?
"Do his sisters live in our city? Where did he get all this from?"
They were not surprised, but Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own family" (John 4:44).
And there is not much room for miracles in that place, as they have no faith.
The chapter of John the Baptist's death, quarter of a century.
At that time, Governor Herod heard of Jesus.
He told his servants, "This is John the Baptist, whom you have followed from death. That's why miracles are performed through him."
Here is the translation of the provided text: "Now Herodias, the sister of Philip, Herod's wife, had an affair with him. Luke"
According to John, he said, "It is not right for you to marry her."
And Baghi wanted to kill him, but he feared the people, as they believed him to be a prophet.
At Herod's Christmas party, Herodias' daughter danced, and she pleased Herod.
That's why he swore to give her what she asked for.
As her words echoed, she commanded Herod: "Bring me the head of John the Baptist on a platter!"
The king was sad, but before breaking his oath, and in the presence of the people, he ordered that she be given what she desired.
And he sent the one who beheaded John to prison.
They put it in a basket and gave it to the girl, and she took it.
Then his disciples took his body, and buried it, and went to tell Jesus. Jesus fed five thousand.
When Jesus heard these things, he departed thence in a ship to a solitary place. And when the crowds found out where he was going, they followed him on foot from the towns.
And when he stepped off the boat, he saw a great multitude of people, and he turned to them and healed their sick.
And when evening came, his companions approached him and said, "The situation is fine, and we are in this desert, so let's tell the people to go to the circles to buy food for themselves."
But Jesus said to them, "There is no need for them to go. Give them something to eat."
He said to her: "All we have here is five pieces of bread and two fish."
I told them: "Look at this!"
He commanded the crowds of people to gather around him. And God gave him five loaves of bread and two fish; he looked up to heaven, gave thanks, and broke the loaves. He gave them to his disciples, and the disciples distributed them to the crowds.
They all ate until they were full, and then they gathered thirteen full trays of bread.
And it was those who ate five thousand, without counting the women and children. Jesus walked on the water.
And Jesus commanded his disciples to go into the boat immediately and go before him to the other side, as the crowds were pressing upon him.
And when he sent them away, he went up to the mountain alone to pray. He stayed alone until evening came.
And the small boat of the students was far out at sea, and the waves overwhelmed it, because the wind was against them.
And when dawn had come, Jesus went to his disciples, walking on the sea.
When the students saw him walking on water, they were amazed and said: "This is a mirage, it's a ghost!" and they were filled with fear.
At once, Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Be of good cheer; I am he; do not be afraid!"
And Peter said to him, "Lord, if it were not for you, I would say to you, 'Come across the water to me.'"
And Jesus said unto him, "Come." So Peter got down out of the boat, and walked on the water and came toward Jesus.
But when he saw the wind was strong enough to tear him apart, he started to drown, and he cried out: "Save me, O Lord!"
Gradually, Jesus stretched out his hand, touched him, and said, "You of little faith, why do you doubt?"
And when they set sail, the wind calmed down.
And those in the boat fell down before him and said, "Truly, you are the Son of God." Jesus healed many who suffered from various diseases.
And when Jesus and his disciples had crossed over to the other side of the sea, they came to the region of Gennesaret.
They were known to all the people of that land, and they spread the news far and wide, and they brought him their sick.
They asked him to come, even just for a moment, and he came, even though he was trembling.
Chapter 50: Discussions on the Custom of the Elders
And afterward, two of the Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem, asking him:
Why don't your children follow the custom of the elders? Because they don't wash their hands before eating.
But he answered them and said: "Why do you obey the will of God and follow your traditions?"
May God protect you: Be careful in your words, and whoever speaks ill without a just cause should be punished.
But we say: Whoever says "I have nothing to give you" - that which I can help you with, I have given as a gift to God.
He no longer has an excuse to be careless with it. Thus, you make the Word of God a matter of custom.
O hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you and said:
People of this people only praise me with their mouths, but their hearts are far from me.
"It's useless for them to worship me, since they teach teachings that are not the commandments of people." The things that make a person free.
Call out to these people and say to them: "Listen and understand:
"What goes into a person's mouth does not make them dirty, but what comes out of their mouth does."
And his disciples came to him and said, "Did you know that the Pharisees were disturbed when they heard your words?"
And He answered them, saying: "The seeds that you did not sow will spring up, those in the heavens will fall."
Leave them! Those who are blind lead the blind, and if the blind lead the blind, they will both fall into a pit." Luke
Peter said, "Show us the meaning of this parable!"
He replies: "And even if we're done, do you still not understand?"
And don't you know that whatever goes into a person's mouth goes into their stomach, and then comes out again?
What comes out of the mouth is what comes from the heart, and it's what makes a person noble. When?
The sad thoughts just come from the heart: like the murder, the corruption among married and unmarried people, theft, perjury, and slander.
And this is what makes a person unclean, but eating with unwashed hands does not make a person unclean." The faith of the Canaanite woman.
And Jesus went out from there and walked along the Sea of Galilee towards Capernaum.
And there came to him a woman from among those people, with disheveled hair and wearing tattered clothes: "Have mercy on me, my lord, son of David! For my daughter is possessed by a demon that torments her greatly."
But he didn't even answer with a word. They approached him with their fists raised and demanded: "Send her back as she is, because she's not following us and keeps talking!"
Jesus answered them, "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
But his wife came and prostrated herself before him and said: "Help me, my lord!"
And he answered and said, "It is not reasonable to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
The woman said: "Oh, my lord! But even the dogs eat from the puddles that form in the fields that don't have water."
Jesus answered and said, "Your faith is great! It shall be done to you as you desire." And at that very hour her daughter was healed. Many people were amazed.
And afterward Jesus went away from the sea of Galilee, and climbed up into the mountain, and sat down.
Many people, including the lame, the blind, the crippled, the deformed, and others, came to him, and they laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
And the crowds of people were amazed as they saw the blind regaining their sight, the lame walking, the crawlers rising, and the blind receiving their sight. They praised God, saying, "This is the wonder-worker, the Messiah, Jesus!"
Jesus looked at his disciples and said to them, "Stay with this people, for they have been with me these three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."
They said to him, "Where will we find bread to feed such a large crowd as this?"
Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They answered, "Seven loaves and a few small fish."
And Jesus commanded the crowd of people to go to the land.

They say to themselves, "We didn't bring this bread with us, so this talk has no relevance."
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Why do you have such little faith? Why do you say, 'We have no bread?'"

From that moment on, Jesus began to show his disciples that he had to go to Jerusalem, to suffer greatly at the hands of the priests and leaders of the religious establishment, and especially to be put to death, and on the third day he would rise from the dead.
Peter dragged him aside and began to confront him, saying, "By no means, my lord, that this should happen to you!"
He turned to Peter and said, "Get away from me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not thinking about God's matters, but about human matters."

And Jesus came near them, and touched them, and said, "Rise, do not be afraid!"
They shook their heads and saw no one but Jesus alone.
And when they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, "Do not tell anyone of what you have seen until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
