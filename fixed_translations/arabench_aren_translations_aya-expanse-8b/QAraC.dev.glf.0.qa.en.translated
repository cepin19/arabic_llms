I'm saying the things you don't want to understand, Saleh.
Any problems Saleh opens up the space opens up your mind the space around you the space people are in what's going on in the world what's going on around the world
If my brother is my uncle.
And whoever doesn't strive to develop themselves and develop those around them.
O Saleh, do not be stubborn.
No, no, no, I don't need you.
And she walks on the road.
And it passes like two drops of water.
And you, what are you doing?
Eat or don't eat.
No, eat.
Here is the
I don't know where I'm living.
I don't want to do it with him.
This is our chance, God willing, our cars are old and their models have failed.
Try, you, try with him after a while, and whoever hands you over.
These are normal and known matters.
The bull is just the one without a personality.
By God, it's scary.
I'm shaking with fear here.
He has the budget in his hands.
What is this project he's working on?
A large government project
Underneath and what's visible.
I have the right to take
You are a minister and he is a minister in another department.
Mom, you forgot.
A day in the market
That means "I mean" in English.
I consider myself a contributor with them.
Nothing illegal comes out for me, wow.
And I don't have anything.
It means that I am contributing afterward.
The translation of "المفروظ كلنا ناخذ" is: "It's obvious that we all take."
This government project
He finally understood his son's condition.
I understand him.
Do good and you will be trampled upon.
This is a government project.
And this is your chance.
Like your tar, it still sticks.
The plate of kindness is in front of you.
Take a bite and put it in your cheek.
Ariel was in his hiding place.
I heard it with my own ears.
He tells you about the government's projects.
One-third of it is sucked.
His son is Salam.
Going to the market, standing.
One fan is eighteen arials.
Put them in the budget.
And eighty dirhams, each one is silent.
They said, "We didn't do anything."
You need it with you.
Seek refuge in Allah from Satan.
Oh, but I feel like his head is starting to hurt a little.
Inshallah, Lord.
He is the head of the committee, and everything is under his control.
The most important thing is don't forget us.
You're saying
"ولازم" translates to "it's necessary"
This government project is an opportunity.
Sure, Ali.
And we can't do without you.
We need your recommendation, Ali.
And hopefully, everyone who is part of the project team.
This is definitely something.
Last night, me and the guys were sitting and reminiscing.
From our side, you are...
As members of the project committee, we are reassured.
Afraid of the benefits of this committee's chairman.
They say that
I have good news for you, Ali.
And reassure the group.
Truthfully, Allah knows best, O Abu Fahd.
God bless you, but you didn't tell me.
Don't forget later, Sa'ud.
No no
Inshallah, things will go as well as possible.
I agree that it might be beneficial.
May I ask you?
I don't know between yes and no.
"ايصير" me
As long as you're with us in the department, you're a contributor to the project.
The most important thing is that we have a mutual understanding.
Bake the bread and meat in front of you.
It's necessary to eat.
Here and healthy
There's something in you.
If every time you do this, it looks like this.
We won't finish.
In this case, we'll never finish.
They said they would get back to any inquiry.
We help each other.
How can we take our share?
Reasonable family
What did you write on it?
After all, it's not just us who are taking it.
Everyone who contributed to the project is entitled to their rights.
Why not?
Without this fear, O Saleh.
We're the ones who set the budget.
And he cut the land that he bought today and registered it in his name.
Meet her later.
He tells you to buy them.
Where did you get this stuff?
Connected to me today
He tells me to call my brother on the phone.
Tell him well.
Tell your brother to hurry.
See the second earth
Whoever wears the land that I bought for him yesterday.
They agreed to sell it.
Tell him to call and tell him if he wants it, then register it in his name.
He wants to devour her with his whole soul.
And our right
And we consider ourselves contributors to it.
Even if we're not contributors.
The biggest bite you can take, you swallow with your soul.
You are depriving your brother and your mother of their rights.
I didn't come to argue with you.
We are also contributors to the project and we have the right to demand our rights.
Tell her, tell her.
He was indeed right yesterday when he said Sultan and I rejected him.
But I didn't let him.
It's a mistake if you don't allocate a budget for the project.
The first phase
You are no less than anyone else.
Members of the committee with him
I hear him telling them over the phone.
They brought in their brothers and kinsmen.
I know that this government project is a way forward.
If we don't want a fixed amount and leave
Capital flow
If my brother Sultan wants to join our meetings, he can.
Because the committee members
Project budget
Just what's needed.
You didn't disappoint.
May Allah protect you and keep you safe.
Your brother-in-law
Do you like it?
He serves us in the project.
Just remember some of it.
We distributed the tasks fairly.
You, Saleh.
And I am made of plaster, bricks, and concrete.
And the rest of the things are electric and water, they leave it to me.
Guys
Determine your share.
By God, I
Sometimes I say take a flat rate.
And I say hours
Make it proportional.
It's not a problem, it's fine.
Take what you want and however you want.
The most important thing.
After all, we are still here.
Icon in this week
Each one determines the amount they want.
For example
After a few days, he regretted it.
He wants another ten like his mother.
What do you mean by that?
Or what do you think?
I am with you.
Even after contributors
Turn your plunder into work, nothing is on you.
You have orphans' halal.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, increase the budget, increase it.
See the deliciousness, wide and Allah's blessing.
What's this?
What is this? This is not your money, it's mine.
Any sultan
O Sultan, o brother.
means after that he will be considered a contributor
This is the last name.
Your friend Saud, list the most names.
Aizid aizid names says they will help them.
So, put it in any set of ratios or the fixed amount and
Don't put it with the trash.
How much do you put in for him, putting in twenty thousand.
Just so.
Even in a note here they write
We are the children of our neighborhood.
But this list, simply put, is no longer than King Abdulaziz's list.
All of them are included in the first phase budget.
Jackie is just so amazing.
All the little things my mother has been telling me.
The one who calls every two hours and adds people at will.
May God prolong her life, hahaha.
The translation of
And whoever turns you away, you will see them sick, poor, and miserable.
She's back, but she has nothing.
Oh God, guide you, this is the last one I'm telling you.
Tell him to grow a pair.
How many moments like this does it take?
A jam of stomach, housing, and hospital is all I need.
Means eight hundred and ten thousand rials.
You are very beautiful, you have extracted (or cultivated) a great deal.
You're just too precious to me.
Oh God, guide you, put her name on the list.
Husseinah, the daughter of Ahlal.
Give it to her from your own pocket.
Reassure him and tell him that there's nothing left from phase two.
I AM A WOMAN OF EIGHTY YEARS.
Oh, son of a pure heart, they are breaking her new heart.
Tell him, tell him to give me more than 2000, then I'll buy gifts for girls.
I'll tell you a million.
A thousand riyals for me.
Any Hussein is a daughter of Ahl al-Bayt.
I might fail you in front of your friends.
Do not delay.
See, I have a lot of work.
I'll talk to you later.
They added more to those eating from the Chinese dish.
The infrastructure endures.
Don't forget me again.
Write down the number you want.
He returned home.
You and your conscience.
I am the chairman of the board of directors.
And I say you deserve a million.
They will set the start date for the project tomorrow.
And we hope that the batches will be down for us first now.
We need to know how many.
You give it to us once or in installments.
Why does this mean more than us?
In a round of sucking, it's important to stay quiet. The committee is waiting for them, let's just wait.
Come on, he said, come on, come on, he said, shut up, that is, shut up.
Are you serious? Do you not even imagine?
If you hear one of you
To silence him, silence.
Yaaah, make the group longer.
You know, this isn't just about going bankrupt; it's like this.
Before, it was beautiful.
Fifty million
You're not much of a young man.
In the end, you are the president.
We don't want a headache.
We rely on the budget.
Through your talk about the project, Professor Saleh, it becomes evident that it is both vital and significant.
And this, by God, is not just for this generation.
Yes, yes
I am looking forward to the launch of the next phase of the project.
We would like to thank you for coming and congratulate you.
And I welcome
On this occasion
United Nations
Where should we go, where should we go for the project?
Where are we?
Where are we supposed to go?
This is not the case.
You can see the officials being applauded as people cheer for them.
We are at the official opening, what now?
It means that if you are going to complain, it means we are in the project.
Where are we in the project?
And the sweat fell.
And this box, I don't know why they put it here.
What's the job in the box?
This sandbox, may God protect your infrastructure.
The official opening of World Beaches
Heal us for the third millennium.
God, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Alhamdulillah, the greatest is beautiful.
I know why you're asking me.
Just stop his car.
I was surprised, Hallie.
But when she told me...
No one has sent me anything.
I saw her with my own eyes, and she was wearing a large skirt.
Thank God, you're comfortable.
And the jack arrived while you were comfortably seated in your home.
Why the harm, no, father, don't let anyone play with your mind, oh wise woman, Manira.
Praise be to God, for you have brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Saqr.
They are concerned about your share and invest it for you.
There is a portion for my friend.
Her brothers don't give her a single share of her father's inheritance.
We don't know these things.
This is a legitimate right.
This is a matter of trust. You don't trust us.
I don't know how.
I didn't like what my brother Rashid said.
He goes and comes back with this every three months.
Okay, this is mine.
He told me everything.
You don't trust us.
The talk about inheritance and money needs clarity.
And I've been pretending to be okay, but I'm not.
You know what to do with people.
And this is how the poor one is safe with you.
I can't believe she's a heiress to millions.
Blame it on his brothers.
Poverty destroyed the world.
But the truth is the truth, and this is God's law.
And then what does that mean?
And we are building the company.
We invest in land, real estate, and money.
No problems, no headaches.
She said she was walking on the earth in the desert.
Just a little bit too much.
To be in the know about the whole story.
What's the matter?
If your sister seems to be snooping.
This is the story.
She intends to tell us stories.
We should give her some money.
The translat
We need to find a solution, Rashid.
In my head
What's this?
My share of my father's inheritance.
Those who donate to me every three months.
Everything is known.
Forty thousand, nothing has changed.
They don't invest money.
Hollow, hollow, hollow, hollow.
Why now?
It needs some thinking.
They said add some sugar so you'll be happy and quiet.
Correct all your speech
They're giving me the cold shoulder.
If I could see their women.
The painkillers come in various shapes and colors.
And it's a sin for me to live even half their lives.
We are hoarding our father's lawful share.
To perform the Hajj
This is your right.
Legally and by law
I feel like they're taking advantage of me and lying to me.
I'm not comfortable with their method anymore.
By God, mother, one never knows what happens in this world.
Humiliate me, oh my mother.
They know not that there is an account and a punishment.
And verily, Allah will punish them for eating forbidden wealth.
And bear, O mother, the tale of their court appearances.
They really are multiplying, by God.
The more we are, the better, or the more our population grows.
That's why I say to you, "O mother."
Give it a try.
Everyone has a building that you would call skyscrapers.
I want nothing but my rights.
I want my son to pray before I die.
And my father gives charity to these poor people.
Oh, mother of Salamine.
Keep your naivety in Tangier, mom.
And do not help them with their court proceedings.
And do not take it as false.
Do you know why?
In this time
She deserves her share.
Ask the accountant, Yay.
You're the one asking the accountant.
Reply to them
I am fine, it means that God keeps you safe, it means that I am coming for my sister.
The door you entered through.
Don't frown.
Open the door you've been banging on.
No, no.
No Falcon
Saad Haram
Don't make a mess.
We have no objection to revealing your share in the company and real estate.
You will be a thousand
She has always been quiet.
Sure, the translation of "اكيد هذي ريلها السوسه" into English is: "This is definitely her weak point."
Or, your sister is kind.
The genie is out of the bottle.
A known and defined legitimate share
I can't translate this phrase as it appears to
Forbidden for them
Expect anything, Manire.
My father's company
Eight buildings
Land and houses
I say, you have a thousand excuses.
What are you expecting in return?
No, Mirna.
Bear the cutting words directed at you and expect a compromise. I've told you this before.
You're your father's daughter, you know everything about land and money, it's not up for discussion.
But the company
You are their partner.
Now they're trying to get you out of the company.
I tell you, no one can stop me.
Look at what?
Your company is...
You're not seeing it clearly.
I'll just say let me in.
There's no need.
He has his mother's papers.
Yai, he talks too much, we need to cut his tongue.
We are sorry.
My brothers Saad and Saqr will come to my office. I need to explain to them, as they don't know what's going on.
Come on in, Allah willing.
See what Nasser is drinking.
They said, "May God protect you and keep you safe."
We are not TTTTT.
Tell us your story.
She discovers her true self.
He discovers that she is forty-five thousand, not forty.
Come on, let's do the math with me.
Ninety-nine months
And this story, I hit it in three hundred sixty.
Eleven million five hundred twenty thousand
"عادي خير يا طير" يعني "It's fine, go ahead, bird."
He held his head high in the storm.
Thank him by saying to him.
These are our funds.
All the young people are like this, the legacy of their parents.
Praise God who forgives us. Forgive the company, your company, nothing but good has happened.
We're present.
This accountant, Samir, is present.
Anything that brother Nasser wants to see should be made available to him.
The whole company is at your command.
I want to go in, take a shower, and relax. Don't ask about anything.
You're flawless.
May I ask you?
This phrase
Scan through all the files.
It is supposed to have more than ten million.
No one dares urinate on it.
She says she's poor.
If her father left.
Four buildings
I thought they had three farms.
And every land is greater than the second.
"Alhamdulillah, we trust in Allah and His power upon them, ya ayah (father)."
It's forbidden for them to do what they're doing.
I do not threaten them.
And I, what can I do, O Salman?
The only way to defend them is in court.
I feel so annoyed by these two pages.
Postpone the issue.
Bear with me, oh father Nasser.
Bring up the court matter for them.
You naughty, you've left your bed and the doctor is looking for you.
My people, be safe.
My national spirit is your stone.
What is the cure for the illness of Muslims?
What he told me
Forgive me from
Oh, I remember you, I know you, I know you.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Regarding what, brother?
And don't worry, you're safe.
Twenty people sacrifice themselves every day unaware of the millions.
"Atahqi means Inshallah Abdullah who sent this to them will be able to do it."
That means Rashid's friend corrected it.
He knows him just as well as he has known him for years.
Do you believe Mirna?
Even Abdullah advised me.
Leave them alone.
Do not touch them.
Try to take as much as you can from them.
You know Abdullah is clever.
It's rare for people to live to seventy or eighty years old.
Our courts are built by people who have lived on the land for two hundred years.
May Allah have mercy on her (Um Salimin).
She used to say (as Allah has mercy upon her)
Our population has reached forty thousand.
The case will take ten years or more.
We need to be represented in court.
This is it.
Here's the translation: "Hey, you're with them."
God bless you, Inshallah.
I see an old friend from school days.
The world isn't worth it.
And I will speak to you in good things.
And you, by God, you are a well-known and large family.
And the children are the original.
Ava ya Rashid, ahna rab'a (We're friends, Rashid)
Do it with a good heart.
Or speak now, or never.
Come on, come on, stop all this nonsense, it's not a big deal.
Are you going to do it or what now?
She bought a set of jewelry for ninety-one thousand rials.
Where did she come from?
They piled up the money on their wives.
And we deprive our sister of her rightful share.
You still have hope, Nasser.
You and them, fight with you.
Yesterday when I spoke to him in the mosque
Leave me as I told you.
Arab children and well-known
Maybe not.
But after that, I say.
God, make our gathering blessed with these radiant faces.
O Allah, enlighten our hearts for what is beneficial to our religion and our world.
Listen, you.
You have another issue besides the issue of the inheritance from your sister.
He is scolding.
Go, Lala, have some tea.
I don't owe you anything.
I've been begging and pleading with you for months, and you're just ignoring me.
No, I don't need you.
Tomorrow morning, I'm going to court.
Hollow, hollow
Hello, hello
You don't have to worry about them.
You won't go to court tomorrow.
Later, later
So we can give you a chance to see what you're doing.
Goodbye
We come only with a red eye.
If I heard them getting hurt
Let's see what they decide.
I'm busy tomorrow.
He decided to sue us in court.
I'll give her a day, but I'll go see her tomorrow.
What is this?
May God bless your tongue.
You told me how?
You need to go to court to file a complaint against us.
To take your share of the inheritance.
She said.
May your world become sweeter.
Your world excelled.
Why, I told you tomorrow.
First, when you arrive, park your car in the parking lot next to the court building.
Jawedine device for security and safety.
Go to the eighth floor.
This role has the judge.
The most prominent lawyers in the country
You definitely need them.
You're making fun of us here.
We want her to file a complaint against us in court.
My spirit in court
Enlightened my hearing.
What are you expecting us to give up?
It was enough.
Trace the path
Trace the path
Let's go, brother.
I forgot to give my sister Manira something important.
This is today's Al Raya newspaper.
It's a nice article.
Only he who writes is a doctor.
Please give me your gift from him.
Let him get out of the situation he's in.
It's forbidden, by God.
He has four children, but he doesn't have a proper house.
He's not to blame for what's around and beyond him.
Poor adventurer in this project.
The one I never expected to start a business is Bou Walid.
Eat, eat, the children of the new merchant, Bouleid.
My dear, I want to give you something.
Just just just
Come on, get up, get moving! Take some fruits, fruits.
Mom, I want the game that Hamoud has.
Health and happiness
Mama, Walid is going to put the sweets for your uncle.
Congratulations on the project, Abu Walid. You deserve it.
My managers are an excellent accountant.
Hand over, hand over, dad.
Now we've become big traders, father. Make a room for me in your heart.
Joe doesn't have any financial ambition.
Inshallah, I'll get you a BlackBerry from the big brands.
Let's get rid of your requests.
We are like humans.
Instead of this chaos that we live in
Before anything, let's clear our debts and then things will get better.
Wow, you look so happy, Abu Walid.
He's been eating more than before.
A trader from his village
My father, the merchant, lives.
Blessings of the project
Leave the right of the quarter.
May God protect you and keep you safe.
I met one of them from Japan.
I put my feet on the table and gave him my seat, he gave me a gift catalog.
One quarter dry
Don't tell me a chance.
Multi-purpose halls
It's always like this.
These rooms are computer labs.
Hit the cinema.
They suddenly wanted a sports field.
This is magic.
They were amazed and agreed right away.
My bank overdraft is a bit, and my in-laws a bit, and a bit from me. I sold a piece of land I own, thank God.
You are the committee's permanent chair.
John placed the order with the factory, and the ministry approved it.
And along the entire factory email.
Lin will reach out to you.
In za'atar
There's nothing, God, I'm sitting in Ali's office waiting.
The secretary called me, brother.
And ten, a traveler.
You and your luck
Now my treatment is completely finished.
The committee has approved it.
Why do you mean that nothing will happen?
You are not the complete manager.
Why don't you go and get it for yourself and be done with it?
He had nothing in his hand.
That's how all employees should be.
Each one wants his hat shaped in a way that you would say, "Let's start the project."
Thank God.
By God, brother, I was reviewing them while I was worried.
Inshallah, I'm done.
And this is what Bu Fahd rarely knows, when he persists, when he persists on his own terms.
What should I do?
And then he started spending money recklessly.
I need to hurry up and finish the transaction, God, I don't know what to do.
God, I'm afraid the manager will ask about you.
His saying is weak, his saying is anything.
Even I am waiting for Bou Fahad.
So, if you're the secretary, what does this mean, what's the solution?
Give me your number.
The secretary said, "Sit down, sit down. What's wrong with you?"
Don't call, the group is panicking, they thought of the secretary.
Layn, we're still waiting for Bo Fahd.
I don't know the exact meaning
This one is free, this one is busy later.
Moment by moment, guys.
Silence, silence, profound silence.
So he said, "Just be calm, man, and grab it."
I have to go to the airport now.
How did it come out?
God willing, God willing, God willing, God willing, let's catch up to him at the car, God willing.
Snow problem here
May God help you.
Wait for Bo Fahd.
I don't blame your father, my love.
It's just not normal at all.
And if the goods are received.
He's going to spend his money on it.
But now I need it.
Where is he sitting now?
What's your problem?
There's one in front of you.
My phone is connected to my nightstand, waking me up from sleep.
I told you, brother.
I'm telling you.
Eternal gift, father.
I don't really know, but nothing happens.
Classes start next week at the university.
And if I don't get accepted with them, I'll have to wait for the next course.
Don't waste three months, it's forbidden to be absent.
It means, "Father, please forgive me for my mistake."
I return them every day, I return them every day.
Wait for the lion, wait for the lion.
And I'm finishing up at home.
You see, you don't understand.
Don't call except tomorrow.
Hi, this is the fourth time you're calling me.
You don't understand, my friend.
I know you need the money.
But hopefully, Boufhad will sign the deal this week.
They will pay him the first installment.
To be honest, I don't know what to tell you, sister.
He was roused from his sleep.
And he walks through the long night, talking to himself.
And if something happens to Fahd.
God forbid.
That's why.
It's necessary for Fahd to sign the deal this week.
Abu Fahd, this is the final draft for the contract signing.
Bo Fahd goes to school every day.
And travel for a year.
And neglecting the affairs of people.
Yeah yeah yeah how?
Do your best now.
They told me two stories.
This ethereal strange heat pulls me in.
What's up after that?
He heard that I go to review.
For my treatment
I will show you the rights of employees.
The deadline is almost up.
Give me the phone. Give the phone.
You have a secretary with Fahd.
And I wanted to tell you.
I hate Fahd, God willing, I will keep coming for sure.
As soon as it reaches you.
Come to me right away.
With the
Man, you've never been like this.
I need to talk to you now.
And give me your phone.
I said it's forbidden.
At least so I can feel.
And if you become balanced
I return to my oath.
Fifteen boxes of prints
Fifteen boxes of printing paper
My heart is broken, by God.
The manager punished him.
And I, and you, and him.
I heard about the factory from you.
He will lose a large sum if he doesn't complete his transaction today and they don't sign it for him.
If the manager leaves and the deputy takes over.
Wow, there's a human!
And if the manager asks about him
I'm not afraid, we're just acting, but let him go, it's wrong.
Bou Walid
I'm leaving, but wait for a call, Allah willing.
Behold, humans.
May God help him.
Guys, hold on, hold on, hold on.
And how would I know that he came to the office to take some things and left?
Look at the lion.
As long as it moves
Don't sit down.
Look at Bou Fahad
Until forever
Wait for Bo Fahd.
Look at the lion.
Look at Boufhad
Let's go to Dorah in Pakistan.
House by house
Street by street
We crawl to you here, millions strong.
Contact the hospital immediately.
You don't speak about the hospital.
Wait for Bo Fahd.
I feel like I've lived a whole lifetime as a reporter from those years to today.
By God, Omar, father of Saeed.
How are you?
He can be forty years old.
And I am a reporter.
Fix it yourself.
Sweat droplets fell after the air conditioners of those years.
And you think that the bicycle is as easy as those days?
There is a yellow seal.
And by God, you've tired yourself out, O Busaid.
May your toil be fruitful.
But what can you do, son of man?
Abu Sa'id
Come on, forgive us. The manager has just arrived, so we'll wrap up our affairs, as he said.
The manager has arrived, sweetie, let's go!
Congratulations, Bou سعيد.
They say your son Khalid has found work.
How can I help you?
I told you, God willing.
The coo of doves
I told you, God willing, I will be the last one of my children to retire.
Graduated and employed
Alhamdulillah, I am now going to finish my affairs.
I edited the message perfectly.
Thank God, we didn't fail, thank God.
Don't change it, O Saeed.
And you deserve it.
I haven't been remiss, God forbid, O Abu Abdul Aziz.
I haven't been remiss, God forbid, O Abu Abdul Aziz.
It is it.
We did what we had to do.
The rest will also complete the journey.
HK
After all this time and effort
It means "all is chaos in chaos."
You need to rest, Abu Saeed.
After he left your place, my wife invited me over.
On the occasion of retirement
Pour him coffee and mint, hello.
Get me out of here, dad.
You look like you're in a hurry, Abu Saeed.
And don't worry.
The scarab is ready.
Yay yay, goodbye from my eyes, God willing.
The spider is waiting for me, woe to me.
I'll finish all the paperwork for you, God willing.
Your chance is there to take it today.
Their manager told me he's going to travel.
And I have no desire.
Even just moving feels exhausting.
Silence is golden.
Officially, drawing like this is considered free.
God bless you.
Now, I'm all set for relaxation.
You haven't been short, O Abu Abdul Aziz, goodbye.
Bless me, my father.
There's no work.
It means "You're not related, dad."
For your sake
Human resources
Thank you, thank you, goodbye.
Sure, here is the translation: "She organized a party yesterday to celebrate her son's success."
And I'm
I can't afford my yacht.
I have a matter with my father that I need him to resolve.
Venus is angry.
Mom, I'm done.
My father retired from work.
May God help him now.
He worked a lot, so let him rest now.
Let him rest.
He told me to make him a soufflé.
I made it, washed it, and prepared it.
I have made a mistake.
Fear God in this old age, have mercy on him, have mercy on his age.
It's your turn now.
It will be eaten tomorrow.
The poor guy just wants to rest.
You messed up that beard.
This is the one who returned.
He is tired.
Do not tire yourself out in their affairs.
They don't order me around.
I was planning to go to the bank on my way to work.
He threatens, and if anyone is late, woe to him.
Thank you for me, dear.
Trust in God.
Here comes this Chinese woman with this nose and these small eyes, goodbye.
Bu Sa'id
This is how it rains every day in your place.
Good luck, happy new year.
It's forbidden, just by its smell.
There is something in my mouth.
Ant and antlion
Main component
I don't care about the branch that goes to the market.
And go there
I can't go to the branch in the market anymore after they told me it's not there, for sure.
Inshallah, ya Allah, ma'a al-salama.
He is burned by the sun.
The sun sets.
I entered my neighbor's house.
The maid introduced me.
She asked me, "What's wrong?"
May God guide you.
La la la, I can't do it anymore, this happiness is suffocating me.
Dad, where are you now?
I am from the Loihé.
This is what any bank would say after that.
They told him the papers were incomplete.
Tell him to take a taxi.
We had a meeting with the manager, mom.
The important thing now is how my father is, hopefully he's fine.
My eyes fill with tears and my head feels heavy.
I tell you, he is in front of me.
Let your father rest.
Poor happy Yaam Saeed
They need to adhere to the schedule after these reports are written about what they will do and so on.
How are you?
Hey, father of the falcon.
You can say I retired, but I didn't.
What does it mean?
The first of those years
It is written that we suffer.
Your children are adults.
We are obliged to help them.
And they say to me, "Poor us."
God, you have no clue.
Now, young people who don't have parents won't be able to complete their transactions.
He returned to his old job, which he had left because of the difference in pay.
In his job, leave means allowing you to leave.
May God reward you well.
La la, I'm just waiting for my coffee.
Where is Abu Saeed?
I'm going to finish the deal and my son is happy.
This ministry, which I am here to serve, is like a cup of coffee.
After God, it's the land that gives us sight.
Goodbye
Mom, I'm fine, okay, I'll see you later.
It's better for you.
I have warned you.
Because I heard you say something about Saeed.
Your father is sick.
I don't need you.
See what your parents say if they complain to you.
Don't let him remain silent.
And what he speaks
You ruined him, you made him poor, fear God in this life.
You woke me up with your shouting, what's going on over there?
Ah, you were a government employee, and you know what it means to be audited.
Hahaha, they write this first.
Now after all this time, what are they doing?
The last day for submitting loan applications at the Rural Development Bank is tomorrow.
Lalala from those who say.
Enough, father.
I told you two words and he believed me.
He tells you he has a committee to review.
Shablag
Yaaah, how are you?
Go and chase him away, and finish his treatment.
There's nothing, there's nothing, there's nothing.
He returned from the back, silent.
I speak to him, but he doesn't respond.
Neither life nor shame.
You can't blame your father, he's just standing up for himself.
If this pleases you, so be it.
May Allah reward you with the best for what you have done.
He was supposed to call you.
His eyes are stuck shut.
Dear and precious, oh father.
And for as long as you've been with us, you've never been short.
Wipe me.
Let it be on me.
And that's it, dad.
Honor and respect your mother.
Crickets, crickets
Hand over to you (or) Turned over to you
Please accept my respect, father.
May God reward you well.
We've decided from now on.
If we handle our transactions ourselves, we will be fine.
You didn't disappoint, may God reward you with the best, thank God.
Just and the one who guides you, O father.
Consider it the last one.
But I can't make it happen.
Call me now.
I'm not going to see the minister, dad, I'm not going there.
The minister is angry with you.
He's angry, so he has to leave, but before he leaves, no, no, no, this can't be said. Everything except the minister.
What I mean is that I don't want to bother you, I don't know what to say.
No, don't tell me, and I won't tell you.
Treat this as a clean slate, ready for you.
Say hello to your way and while you're going, settle the happy transaction, my brother.
And whoever guides you, O father.
Consider it the last deal to get rid of it for me.
Whatever you command, father.
But your son had to sign this paper.
It means "take it, give it to her tomorrow."
Frankly, I advise you to get it today.
And if the transaction is not entered into them.
You'll be waiting for me in two months.
Lalala, even now I'll make him sign it.
Lalala, no need.
Call him, but give him two minutes.
And deliver it to you.
It means you don't know what happiness is.
No need for permission.
And he will not leave but at sunset.
No, everyone in the group has it.
Where are you?
I say I am with Saeed.
I am waiting for my shift to end.
Alright, dad.
Yay, take care of your own paperwork.
John has raised his children.
Do you have any children?
I feel something in my heart.
Please, Uncle.
You didn't disappoint.
There's no use.
I will leave you.
And go to the old people's home.
I don't want to tell them where I'm going.
What do you say to them, Abu Sa'id?
I write something else for them.
By the grace of God.
He was released from prison yesterday.
No, by God, my sister.
We're done with these things.
I told him never and ever to speak on the radio or TV.
I wish I could just ignore all the nonsense.
God willing, may he be guided and reformed.
By God, my sister, farewell. May God protect you.
Is it a prison?
I was traveling yesterday.
My dear sister, what should I tell you?
Call once in the program this one called "the mess"
And so, my sister, he spoke to the king.
Khaled Jasim
He just says stop nonsense.
I'm back, listen to them, they're talking about work.
My brother was talking about the government.
Wipe out the oil stain.
I don't really know what's happening to this boy.
Not one of his four.
The ones who were happy with him and kept saying 'do this' and 'do that' to him.
They all disowned him.
He is God, who guides him.
And I said, sister, allow me to go and see the cook.
May God help you.
Come here, dad.
Come, sit down.
We've had enough of your nonsense, my child.
Oh, Dad, I'm exhausted and sick.
This is where she fell in the hospital.
You don't deserve it, by God.
I don't want the same thing to happen to you.
Yo, I didn't tell you.
What, mother?
And he kept shouting.
I won't stay with you.
This time, I've come again, O father.
Here is
Please excuse me, mother.
Forget about it.
We've had enough nonsense.
Why did the poor manager get fired?
"حرام" means "it's forbidden" or "it's wrong" in Arabic. The complete translation of the given text would be: "Forbidden or wrong means, after all these years, you come today to tell me to stop."
Don't you understand what I'm saying, Saleh?
We've had enough nonsense.
Give us just one unit.
Command, O Saleh.
And you, as a human, are prone to such matters.
You are indeed a follower of general affairs and you criticize.
It's easy.
It just means we crossed out one person.
And you are one of them.
You're not the one meant.
Goodbye, take care.
A good brother
But hopefully, Uncle Bou Menire doesn't know.
In your spirit, O my father Amshir.
Where did I learn this?
If you ask
Tell him to work.
I'll make you disappear if not.
I asked her mother, and she said that he works for God.
Any necessary.
She needs to go in.
What should we do with her now?
Our son got involved with them.
What you're ordering
Give him a two-week deadline.
But if he works, by God, I won't put up with any more of his nonsense, I'll take him to court and make him release me.
Have a coffee now, you.
You're not like a fly, something's in your head.
Mom, frankly.
I want to see.
What comes out
I know you want to leave.
Your heart will eat you up over coffee.
I want to talk and get lost in conversation.
Go away, your nuisance, and sleep.
Go look for a job in the morning.
Inshallah, I will get up in the morning.
Mom, I've told you, I've really given up this habit, by God.
Alright, God willing.
Mom, honestly, I feel a bit uncomfortable.
I don't even want to talk about it, it's just nonsense.
Be quiet.
We don't need those old tricks.
Where are you, man? You look lost. Give us one of those old-time guys, man.
We have heard, we have heard, we have understood nonsense. We have heard.
We've had enough nonsense.
We've had enough nonsense.
Salih is present.
Saleh Raqad
My son did something wrong yesterday and I didn't know.
All we need is for our purpose to be served in the coffee.
I cannot
Oh, mom, fix it properly.
Because there were people present
Just call her.
Don't waste your time with me.
If a couple is at the door, they are seeking a place to rest.
But the blame isn't on you.
It's his fault that you didn't stop at that.
My son and the bread of my hand, I know you well, as well as I know myself.
You're like those cigarettes.
Whether you study or not, I'll say something or not. I'll just say, "Enough of this nonsense" or not.
Here is
If you broadcast it on the radio
Or else, enough of this nonsense.
Professor Saleh, you are a man with a very high national sense.
We can keep you busy.
But what can we do?
Come on, forgive us.
Hello Saleh, how are you?
Don't exhaust yourself, you're precious to us.
No, by God.
Brother, I wait for you every day to say enough of this nonsense.
Brother, you are a brave human being, you don't fear.
And whoever guides you once, say it.
I am God, I will protect you forever.
Tell him to stop talking nonsense, it's enough with all this nonsense, God.
Come on, man, the guy is really begging you, just give him one chance for his sake.
Awesome, bro!
The important thing now, if I may say so, is...
Regarding the job
The job is the opposite, you deserve it. You are a patriotic and valuable human being to us.
We were trying to reach you to inform you.
John exposed your shame in front of all creation.
Are you serious?
Everywhere I go, they tell me there are no vacancies.
Poor them, they want to employ me, but there are no jobs.
Now, how do you and your mother manage the household?
And don't forget afterward.
Four children have it.
God is kind.
Don't despair, my love.
Have hope.
And I do not stop
You need to go look for a job.
So my dad won't cause us problems.
I'm here for you, Allah, I'm ready to do anything, Manire.
And repentance, after I say, "Enough of this nonsense."
Stop nonsense
Do you know what he's been up to these days?
I'm telling you.
Just hope Allah guides you, Abu Fahd.
You're not listening.
I'll go and tell the minister about the problems he's causing.
What does the minister think?
Sure, the translation
You're right.
But this is something.
What's left unsaid.
You know the rumor that they're replacing you and that you're being strongly promoted.
I am looking for a way to keep an eye on it.
I don't want anyone to feel that I have a hand in the matter.
Your idea is correct.
What are you thinking about?
The way to remove a sultan from your path.
You've heard about Saleh Saleh, stop all this nonsense.
May God protect you, this is from our neighborhood.
I build upon it.
You deprived us, brother Saleh, of your voice.
No, Saleh.
And I am one of your biggest followers.
Not valid, thank God, after what is needed.
Inshallah soon.
He comes back and you hear his voice and you're happy.
Bu Fahd itself asks about you.
Say, O Saleh!
Why did you stop?
And God, it's like some problems and mental and physical health issues here and there.
Just to be honest.
You are a fighter.
We haven't heard from her in a long time.
Oh Allah, oh Allah, oh Allah, I call upon you, O Saleh, return.
Just once, for my sake.
I want to hear it on the dance floor.
Saleh tells you "It's done."
La la, guys, it's hard, God, it's really hard, honestly.
What's wrong with you?
The real one is waiting for you.
Abdulrahman, I'm cutting off.
Later, you didn't tell me you were looking for a job.
Okay, this is your chance.
Let the real you be heard and appreciated from day one. Go to the office and apply for the job.
The inner part if it troubles you.
See, I want what's best for you.
Do you know how?
But really, we don't want to go, just let us stay at home.
La la la, we don't want it anymore.
Alright, brother, calm down, be patient, let them talk it out.
Just enough, we don't want any more.
Zain, zain.
Well, if I really went back, like I did the last time, of course I would cut it off, but the last time...
For example, a she-camel says "bo bo bo boom" and a male camel hears it and also says "bo bo bo boom".
What Iansah (or what's going on) means is that there are a lot of problems and a lot of mess.
What's the best thing for him to hear, I mean, does he like, for example, protests or what? You tell me.
According to the contract
Judge his responsibilities.
Eighty-seven centimeters
"اتخرب الشغل" means "The work is ruined" in English.
Until he cuts me off.
Why did they treat the employee like this?
Where is the seventh seventh?
Until he cuts me off
Seventh, esteemed Minister.
Why is the employee?
When the ministry moved to its new location
Sell your brother's cars.
Guys, enough of this nonsense.
And we hope that you return to us with your voice, we don't want you to leave us again.
The people who matter to me, it's the last time.
Or else, frankly, I've cut it off.
Mom, you said it's finally over.
And it was you who prevented it.
Oh, my daughter.
This is what they call "making a scene" and I will expose them on the radio.
I just heard what I did, they told me.
I suspect that someone in the ministry is leaking the information.
How harsh is the weather now.
The harsh atmosphere
The minister is present.
I don't care.
All my time is at the service of the ministry, God preserve you.
I heard it, God prolong your life.
Oh, I said it just for you.
He didn't give me his back.
He talked to me.
Abdrahman Yigulro Weli be shaglek
He talked to me.
God, you are poor, Saleh.
Truly, a breaker of my heart.
I am a secretary to Buhfad.
And I know the whole story.
The group exploited you for a specific purpose.
Unfortunately, they reached him.
And you know what's behind this story.
Abdulrahman ولد Frijjam
It's him who planned all of this.
It's impossible for Bufahd to employ you.
One day, I'll do to him what was done to Sultan.
Madam, it is well-known about you.
It's impossible to focus.
I need to go to court to be released.
I found the solution.
We are the best society in the world right now.
Flawless
We don't have it.
We have no flaws at all.
We're comfortable.
I heard the intermediary.
Even if someone knows you, they might tell you to wait your turn.
Because it's the system.
He takes his rights more than a stranger.
We do not rely on strangers.
We don't have it.
Your effort is your work, we don't have flaws, we have shortcomings.
Or one of the elders
He will make you stay at home.
There's nothing like that here.
And with my regards
Saleh Rashid Rashid Al-Bahahiri
The famous one as Saleh is a mess of nonsense.
I don't want dinner.
I was running, then I saw a shirt tear.
The new dress you're wearing looks great on you.
He saw a boy wearing the new shirt that we just bought together from the village.
This means "He is pulling him into the sea, meaning to drown him."
And this is good, what he argues.
And I put it in my responsibility.
When I saw how handsome your son is, I respected him.
It's up to him.
Why is the T-shirt for a child so expensive?
He's only wearing a new t-shirt, his pants are falling down. I respect your choice to ask your dad to buy you a new pair.
Encourage yourself.
Why did the t-shirt tear on Walid?
Until I tell you
Don't leave me, carry you close to the raft.
I say, my brother Sultan.
Why after you hit him like this and bend his face down?
Don't do this, you little child, you're not ready for this.
These are children, these are children.
Oh, children
Or else, his people will honor and respect him.
Don't enter.
The price of your words, O Sultan, and of your nonsense.
My schoolbag, oh my, I am a child.
You're always so arrogant.
Nurture your children with justice.
And if you are not capable of education and not worthy.
I'm respecting myself right now.
I can't make a mistake with him and shake him in front of his wife.
O my dear brothers
By God, if you don't enter quietly and take care of your child again, we'll do something to him.
I only blame myself.
I'm wasting my time with you.
Respect yourself, okay?
Let's go see her, take me there.
I cannot respond to them.
Where are you, old times?
Pure intentions
God willing, with forgiveness and safety.
My brother, you don't have anything more than this.
Lalala da akbar haq (This "lalala" is the greatest truth).
Give it your all and come hurry.
The depth of the trouble that has befallen us.
Just Dad, tell me exactly what happened.
I need to ask Ahmed for forgiveness, as what he did is affecting our home, and I have to leave.
The pants are going to be adjusted.
This is an act of a human with a sick heart, filled with hatred and malice.
This is the action of his sultanate.
Where can one cut all these clothes?
My new clothes have not brought me any comfort; I have not enjoyed wearing them. I am content with God's help.
I need to show it.
Sit down and I'll tell you.
If you go at a time when he is drinking, he will say "Ah, young one" and similar things.
What do you think?
You, my dear child, know how to ride a bicycle.
I know.
Waleed Habibi
I say
Just say
Where did you put the scissors, Mama?
Under the bed
They destroyed it; may God destroy their lives.
But I have doubts about it.
I will not keep quiet about it.
This is a crazy person, not sane.
The most important thing now.
And what has changed?
But this computer thing, it's a promotion where I'm involved.
Bravery is the key to success.
Let our son be as wise as a child, who broke their computer, while we were unaware.
Call my soul, call my soul, let's see what's beyond, him or nothing.
Stop talking nonsense, you lions.
Go, go, take a walk, go laugh at someone else.
I'll tell you to change course.
Go laugh at someone else, you foxes.
I need you.
The time of calm hearts
Pure intentions
In Yahal
It's not me who goes to look for his friends.
Laughter at others, oh Sultan.
To falsely accuse me of lies and slander.
The scissors are missing.
Respect yourself.
Come on, Abdulrahman, hurry up, dad!
You are right about your brothers Fahd and Sultan.
Every day, they argue, oh father.
I don't know.
A session like this
We should sit her down.
In order to study our works.
And the works of those who preceded us.
And to what we will become.
Let's learn from this.
And we learn
The translation of "مو جلسه صلح جنكم يهالو" is: "Is there a peace meeting scheduled?"
As big as a camel
Do you have children?
He understands nothing.
His father is his role model, not you.
His role model is his father.
You, O Sultan.
And you, O Fahd.
And I am your older brother.
For me
By paying for the computer.
Now, when you stretched your hand out to him, what did you want?
You have made peace with each other.
No, it's just like that, I don't have the strength to get rid of him.
Get rid of Abdulrahman's chatter; it's driving me crazy.
So, where are you off to?
By God, I won't leave him.
You did it yesterday.
Look, don't be afraid.
If you're the real door hero, I'll call you the door hero.
You said that Abdulrahman is good for some of you.
But by God, if he doesn't enter his room and break it, it will break itself.
Your brother who
It's not normal.
Your brother is quite normal.
Now, take a seat and have some tea.
Falcon on his head.
Shut up, shut up, kids. They're just flirting, they're not ashamed.
You're young, but Dad, just a little bit.
My God, I will quench you, I will show you, my God, I will show you.
Take it off, take it off, oh mom, take it off and throw it away.
Mother's blood
My heart skipped a beat with this scream.
God willing
Let's take care of our situation.
By God, that's a shame.
This, while I am gathering you and arranging your affairs.
It won't be short with them.
On a night, he will reconcile them.
He didn't have time, mother.
And therefore, upon him.
And Allah has blessed him.
"Haji Fa'ih"
But, oh, Mom.
God guide you.
You're supposed to calm down.
Without fire, there is no wood.
With God's will, things will turn out well.
May God be with you, Abdulrahman.
Where I need help, I became a pharaoh.
Oh, wise father, may God guide you.
Two behind each other
Spread out, spread out.
You have exposed us, may God guide you.
There's our neighbor Saad who comes to look at you and laugh at us.
Oh, the officer is insistent, we want it, and we're telling him.
What you have to do is to avoid it, the officer says.
The most important thing I deleted them all
Please.
Brother, don't come to me, I won't come to you.
The officer banned it. Believe me, I understand them from up here.
He heard the officer forbid him.
"من فوق يعني ابعيد" translates to "From above means far away" in English.
My brother's truth when he speaks
Please understand that by signing this, you are agreeing that your children will not do it again.
Thank you, thank you.
Welcome brother, welcome, please come in.
The officer prohibited them from walking. Believe me, I'm certain.
Hear me
I didn't want to tell you that in front of them.
This is Abdulrahman, their older brother.
Assistant to the Minister
And the second is their middle brother, the manager of the body.
Go take two pills of the pendulum and relax.
The officer prohibited the pendulum.
You have two pendulums here.
Oh no, I trust in God against the enemy.
"My trust is in God against the enemy."
"My trust is in God against the enemy, they played with me as they wish."
Oh oh oh, what's all this talk about?
Yah hal aiy yosall min ahnaa li ahnaa
This is an old hand like his father. He made a flat (object) and is deleting it.
Do you believe it?
He is a respectful and well-mannered person.
And he says, "This is the daughter of the poor."
Even if
Now you catch me.
He hasn't taken his eyes off you.
And be kind to yourself.
He's done all this, and until the opportunity arises.
It means: "So, why did you turn around and look at me when you passed by?"
"صدفه" means "coincidence" in English.
You turn around and she turns around at the same time.
No, but surely there's something.
I see that I notice when I look at you.
I feel she's happy inside. There's joy and happiness within her.
Bro, go tell her to give me a pen.
Take my notebook.
I swear, I don't even know her name.
Romanticism is excessive.
You're not getting it, you're in the 21st century now.
And God, you're in for it big time.
"تبي الصج"
Since when have we had this conversation?
Do not hope.
And from today, I intend to dedicate myself to you.
But really, you need to rest a bit now.
My father returned especially yesterday after an external shoot in the desert.
We won't perish, by God, brother. I told the secretary, "Look, I don't want any press or TV meetings, nor any contracts."
Let me focus on my family for a while.
God be with you.
Even when you're busy.
The first thing that comes to my mind.
And I have her sponsor's number, I'll call her today.
What have you been delayed for?
They bought the villa and moved in a few days later.
Cave in series and acting
Um Abdulaziz says they are poor people, as much as they can make do.
Their share is none of our business.
God bless you in the morning, Uncle.
Good, may there be no evil.
Every other day, this planet is hitting us.
The apparent battery of your father.
It's no problem, I have the medicine and I'll prepare it for you now, Allah willing.
May God reward you well.
Present, present, Uncle.
Peace be upon you.
"صح كلام وليد" translates to "Wolid is right."
I'll leave tomorrow, I won't disturb you anymore, and I'll stay in a nearby place so I can come see you every day.
Get rid of us, what's the matter? What do you want?
The transla
Please save
Just what is Walid's problem?
Rashed Abdullah
The same name
He returned to his father's estate.
Have you believed your mother?
I was so happy when I found out that Rashid Abdullah, the actor I love, is our neighbor.
Everyone praises him.
They say he is modest and kind.
Before the home, the friend, that is yes.
I'm just taking a picture with him.
So that my colleagues at work believe me.
I can't believe our house is attached to the actor Rashid Abdullah's house.
Say it to him, word by word, so he believes.
The depths of the earth
What we see on TV.
And I hoped to see him.
Our friend has come, thank God, thank you Lord.
See, if they want a beautiful dress, then I have this here.
I'm here, but guys, take it easy. You see, I haven't gotten used to it yet, I haven't fully adjusted to it.
The news reached you.
By God, he didn't disappoint, may God reward him a thousand times over.
Peace be upon you.
They confirmed that some employees are being transferred to the new branch of the ministry.
What they told you, come back from.
I didn't hear the names.
No, but what I heard, for sure.
An Bu Ali's name is with them.
My name is me
But we don't yet know exactly who they are transferring.
I am Winnie, and Winnie is me, and Winnie is who I am, but God's will cannot be denied.
Dad, can you or can't you do this?
The committee is still studying the issue.
But if you are chosen.
We've been visited by a blessing, Abu Walid said.
"Take care, Abu Ali."
Return, please, my brother Rashid, you see the furniture.
We are neighbors today.
His people think so.
These are from your good roots, Abu Walid.
May Allah reward you well, brother Rashid.
I've heard a lot about your kindness.
God is the source of love.
Just, my dear child.
And I'm ready to offer you a thousand solutions to find the most beautiful and affordable furniture that suits you.
When I'm being honest, the furniture is really old.
We need to change it.
Inshallah
I told you before.
If you need anything.
Consider me like your sister.
May my eyes never weep.
Where did you go, my love?
She called me yesterday and I forgot to say goodbye.
La la, my love, it's not about exhausting yourself.
No more.
God willing, I'll be in touch later.
Frankly, I was talking to her.
But these people are not like us.
The rich get richer, where are we and where is that?
Mama, you don't have to worry.
How are you, mom?
Just wait on me for a bit.
And I'll give you the signal when you should propose to her for me.
I told you.
Don't worry, it's nothing.
Tell me and I will marry you.
If I put dinner in the living room
If you feel like having dinner.
Now I'll have the driver take her to the university, God willing.
And afterward, we agreed that we are relatives.
Leave me alone.
Soon, God willing.
I called to thank her.
They help each other and love good things, yes.
By God, you're right, dad.
Even if our relatives don't do this.
And my name is with them.
Are you sure?
Oh, what a blue sight, these misfortunes that have befallen us.
I don't know what to do now, my head is spinning from this news.
Go, go, go, go, go. You're doing great, God willing, it's all good, thank you, may God reward you well, may God reward you well.
Good luck, Abu Ali.
The committee met today.
And a list of names that they are transferring appeared.
My name is with them.
Add your name to the manager's list.
I don't see any benefit in it, Ali. I don't see any benefit in it.
He needed it, but he told me there was no hope.
The great artist
Consider your name to have fallen down the list.
You did a great job, Abu Salem, and God bless you.
Come back if you please.
I'd like to take a picture with you so I can show them to the kids.
Oh, my children are playing now.
May God keep them for you, God willing.
Can I have a picture of an artist?
God is your command, may He keep you safe.
Please please
Please, please, I'm here.
You and whoever is dear to you
Say a day or two before, it's better.
Hurry up, mom, get ready.
Get ready, get set, what's the catch?
What's wrong with you, Inayt?
She said she has no objection.
Come on, mom!
By God, I'll go to them.
Just come on, son.
I don't want to feel like we're poor and limited by our circumstances.
You need to dress up.
Where should I buy clothes to wear and look good?
Your appearance got me into trouble with people.
What are these jewelry? It's the first time I see you like this.
That's not right, I am.
My right
Um Ali is speaking up for her son.
She wants some clothes that fit her and she wants to buy some jewelry.
As she said, she wants to show them that the most important people are still here and they have good intentions.
Oh oh, Allah's will.
I am her height.
By God, she's amazing. This is my order, it took a long time and it's blue.
"Masha Allah, your treatment is something I can't put into words."
May Allah bless you, you are a queen.
You still need to prepare.
Because they say let my father come and meet her father.
I definitely won't go in these clothes.
The first time I met them, I was so impressed by their new style.
Oh come on, mom, take it easy on the woman's desires.
"Am Walid means she didn't hesitate to give them what they desire, a little at a time."
AI AI
Now we must all become like them.
Why didn't his mother go and arrange a marriage for him?
Just those women
Now I need to go see the men later.
By God, may you remain as you are.
The rest is up to God, as long as you keep the coat.
The good people didn't disappoint.
They didn't disappoint, we stayed in the basement.
I will take it back from you to complete the period.
Everything is for you.
Brother Rashid, how am I supposed to do this or give up this path?
Just look, come first.
This needs to be closed.
Ah, it's weighing on me.
Burn a piece of wood, but look.
This is God, may He keep you safe.
The left hand inside the coat.
Threatened with such a fate.
The patch of skin under the buttocks
God, God
Wow!
The walking, the walking, is a heavy burden, it's getting heavier.
The text "يا
Attract a millionaire.
You'll have seconds, God willing.
The left has degenerated into the right's praise.
I know my friend is alive.
What's wrong with her life?
Do you know how to tell me?
Tell me, because you're my friend and I don't want to part ways.
Saying the truth to my brother will make him propose to you.
Don't say anything about your sister's private affairs; it would embarrass her.
Hollow speeches have been abundant towards you these days; just a few days ago you were telling me that Sa'ad wanted you to represent her uncle, and today, her brother.
They want to take my beloved.
And I was watching.
The most important thing they know is the relationship between us.
They don't know, we're just colleagues.
Alright, family.
They need to know tomorrow.
Why did Walid refuse?
I am screaming.
You reject my son, Walid.
The actor is more honorable than you, you hypocrites.
But you
Do you live a long life?
Perform your roles.
Serve the people.
You attract people.
You wear the costumes of acting in the life before God and His creation.
The traditional vest I wore on TV.
You and me.
You wore accessories, gold, and jewelry.
I played a role.
You are getting married.
What a sight!
One man walks in front of his wife.
He took off his hat and held it towards them at an angle.
He does not look to the right or to the left.
Bro, remind me of that old friend we used to talk about, the one who's with you at the office.
Come with a son and a daughter.
Why does he walk like this?
As he says
May God help him, oh Real.
Walk majestically, do not stop.
Poor guy, he has no personal life at all.
He laughs after getting excited.
Tell us about his clothes.
La la la, this way is not nice while you're sitting.
His gait is attractive while walking, stand still, stop, stop, stop.
I need you, Thursday, I need you.
Where are you going?
Come, I want to grill it.
Where are you going to sit with us and have some?
He changed his wife.
Are you enjoying this?
Ah, Thursday.
Turn off the TV and if a presenter appears.
I am afraid you will cause me problems.
And by God, it's true in work.
I'm sitting, God, I'm sitting with Salem, my colleague at work.
Thing
The line is blocked. I want to call.
I keep getting phone calls that cause problems at home.
When you say "I didn't leave, my friend came to join us," it means that your friend stayed with you instead of leaving.
It means "Well, now it's time, maybe now I'll get the package."
And she expels you afterward.
You're not the first one to release it.
Lalala, I can't hear you.
Sweetest mother, rest in peace in your grave.
My mother entrusted me with this.
She told me not to let go.
Lalala, I can't, it's impossible.
Looking for something you have.
La la la ha ha ha keep laughing
You're not at all normal.
Do not come with you.
"Saying 'tell me' means I want to understand what's going on."
La la la, mom, I mean, I don't allow you to say that.
Salem is particularly considered one of the best of our young people in our region.
As he tells you to divorce
He told me, "It's over, really over, which means I've become a bull and they're goading me."
There is no Thursday, it seems you are dressed formally.
Hold me close and the one who delivers you.
Let's tell him stories from our childhood.
God guide you.
The poor have a tender heart.
I want to give the message from the minister's office to my father, it's important.
"You give from God, if He guides you, you give from."
Ha la la nothing at all
Here are the words translated into English: "Here, I'll give them to you."
So that we can meet tomorrow with the female delegation that came.
Women's delegation
What's wrong? Why are you awake today?
In peace
I am your brother Khamis.
No, and by God, I'm speaking to you sober, by God.
Bro B
Delete my name so I don't get banned, bro.
How does deleting your name mean?
The only one who can strike your name is His Excellency the Minister, and that's it.
Brother, this is a meeting at the ministry.
Formal meeting
I need help.
Salm Salm Salm
Say the truth.
Who were you talking to while you were hiding behind the tank?
Safe, safe, healthy, God willing, healthy.
As long as you're healthy.
She says, "Otherwise, how?"
On me
It's not me, Khamas.
Means you're saying the truth, right?
No, I don't want to do it casually anymore.
You doubted me, brother, that I was talking to a woman.
Back to normal life
And whoever delivers you safe, deliver yourself safe.
And whoever guides you to charity.
It's him who told you to call.
You're not doing any work.
Don't interfere in what doesn't concern you, or else you'll see what I can do to you.
I complain to you.
Oh, it's you.
How do you live with a woman like this, with such a long tongue?
Let's start the meeting now.
May God prolong your life, Hassan will call on Thursday.
Alright, let's discuss the real estate budget first.
Please save
Saying "Inshallah I'll find it again" in English.
I tell you, as soon as he saw the women, he was afraid.
I've been circling around the ministry entirely while you've been hiding here.
Come on, come on, the group is waiting for you in the meeting hall.
I can't sit with women.
How does your wife know, Thursday?
I'm afraid you'll call.
You're always suspecting me, even though I'm trying to help. You just don't understand.
Iron and Michelle will take me back home.
Your wife won't call but at this time.
Of course, you are a large company.
This project that your company is implementing for our ministry.
The largest projects in the history of the ministry.
Hey guys, what's up with the table shaking?
This table, your highness, is not for sitting.
Save my reply
Who is with me?
Sorry, I can't
My phone is for you.
Moment, moment, I'm telling you.
He actually fainted because he was afraid to go home.
Oh, her brother!
She said to you, "If you finish your work with the women, don't come home."
That's why he submitted a request to the ministry to transfer from our department.
He exactly said to me that the minister agreed to transfer it, so do whatever you want.
What's with your wife, brother?
This is a noun.
I'll tell him, Thursday, talk with whom.
I tell you, you're not awake.
And now, what are you going to do? Your wife and children are coming tomorrow.
And God, I don't know what to do.
And you fulfilled her request, why didn't you let her go back home and see her children?
So she wants to ensure officially.
Give her the papers.
So this is what I did. I sent her brother to give him the paper.
So that she could see the minister's signature and be certain.
Inshallah, if we agree, and inshallah tonight, we might go home.
My sister, and this is the minister's signature.
After our argument
Tomorrow, he will continue in the new department.
That means I hate my office and the work I used to do.
May Allah protect you in this direction.
May God protect you, and here is the minister's passport.
Nothing, nothing is in your right hand.
Any yes, any yes to God's peace.
Please keep this desk neat and ready.
Saad, Abdelkader, and Mashallah mean a big office, yes.
Goodbye
How do you request a transfer?
Damn, the whole section is women.
Madam yes
No one but the minister himself can make that decision again.
You have to persist if the minister doesn't return.
Bro, you agree with your classmates.
And call them by their names secretly so that your wife does not recognize them.
And I left it for you after two additional rights for the newly hired employee.
The new employee intends to be a new staff member.
I've been working as a secretary for the minister for about a year now.
Are you serious?
And his appearance is amusing, imagine a real mercenary among five women, his appearance is antique.
They just tell their wife that he's jealous of others, she's crazy.
Blindness
Poor as he is
He asked us not to talk when his wife called, so we respected his wish and remained silent.
Any Abdulqader who is with you at the office.
This one doesn't cost too much for you, you can afford it, can't you?
My son called, he says my wife wants me to come to the office.
What are you doing?
Right side of the main door
This is the care office.
With five women
Hello, six employees.
It translates to: "It exists, I have attacked that it is continuous."
I'm not used to these movements.
My wife is jealous of me.
Because I am sweet.
Now, may God guide you, O Sultan.
All we want to know is where we've gotten to.
What happened is that my brother and I, Falcon, were at the bank yesterday.
See, from this perspective, the project.
Peace be upon you
My brother, I have an important meeting at work.
Come on, I have to go to the kitchen right now.
Now that I'm wearing this, I'm going out.
It's actually supposed to be your kitchen.
We don't have women, we don't obey men, by God.
And if a scorpion angers Allah, its sting is enough for a misfortune.
This is a necessary right for rain, look, look.
Look at my uncle.
Live and the one who resigns, call the secretary and tell him to inform the employees.
He tells them that Ameneer has postponed the meeting for today to tomorrow.
Inshallah, it will be fine.
They issue these orders.
Woe unto us if we do not carry out
They should know that it's a big responsibility.
The text translates to: "There are associated relations and responsibilities."
For them, the most important thing is that she's just a servant.
I've never seen people despise women like them in my life.
They're still alive from those old times.
Don't go to work, come into the kitchen and make us some tea.
Where are the maids?
And the second one has been missing for a week.
Even the servants did not escape their insults.
They have every right to leave.
God help you.
The notes from the bank are simple.
The wor
My uncle said something that I don't understand.
A villa complex without a garden is like a cake without sweetness.
The garden is beautiful now.
Before I leave, I want to hear your opinion on the matter.
My dear Fatemah, I need to leave late for work.
Alright, here's the translation: "So, Allah willing, tell me what's up with you."
Do you say "Go" or "Shall I go"?
Play it in school.
He returned to the Women's Union committee.
The school chose me to play with them in the selected team.
You're crazy.
Now you're telling me you're going to the selection committee.
You know if your thought says to your brothers and uncles, "What are they doing to you?"
You can only blame yourself.
This is what we warned you.
Just say hi when you see her, give her a hug. I haven't seen you in a long time, dad.
Think about it, it's a new year, a new chance.
They married him or not at all.
And God will guide you.
Whoever takes one, is not educated, does not have a certificate, and does not know anything, may God guide you.
La la la, it's not a fault of the real (person) that they are uneducated.
And then this is Khamis, the son of the scorpions.
He was bitten, he caught him.
No, we only take what is at our level.
His needle is like it.
God help you.
What should I do, Ayisha?
The minister traveled, and all transactions are transferred to me.
And the truth is that Mustafa, the director of the Ministry of Resources, will be in need tomorrow.
Just so you know, the ministry officials arrived today.
Your program
And now I'm free for you, Aysha.
Here Mary.
Okay, let's go, come on, now let's go.
Say to her, Ayisha.
We can only come from these brothers.
I don't know what's happening.
You need compresses, my love, so the swelling doesn't occur.
We warned her and said to her, "Do not tell them."
She casually told them, "Hit her and kick her."
You know, if I told them that I hate it.
John has been bothering you for a long time.
You play Ava's ball.
Next time, break his neck.
Know who is speaking.
The scorpion (or old scorpion)
Halakber Ji
Oh, Dad, I didn't hit Sultan, he's the one who hit me.
Stop talking.
I chose Economics and Political Science.
I honestly chose graphic design because this specialization is in high demand these days.
Architectural engineering
It's your turn.
You've taken your chance.
Greed is not good, and I'm your father.
Tamer of the Scorpion
Break it, and you break her teeth, expose her secrets.
Guide me towards it.
Something is placed here, so I walk.
You go on missions.
What have you specialized in, architecture?
Take your time.
To ensure
Sultan and Sa'id, I spoke to them.
They have no objection to your marrying Amineh.
Wait a moment
No Thursday-born son deserves it.
Arrange the appointment with them and inform you, Allah willing.
Your nomination is part of the delegation.
I understand your circumstances.
But give yourself a chance tomorrow.
I'm telling you honestly.
You are interested in her a lot.
And your nomination is from above.
His words are true.
My brothers, I know them.
It's impossible for them to agree.
I am surprised by them.
Divide their payments according to my salary
And it's me who supports the household.
No, I wish you wouldn't say you're going to travel without me.
We've decided to marry her this week.
What do you say?
Stupid Thursday who doesn't even have a high school diploma.
Marry him and travel with him.
With knowledge, O God.
It is forbidden for them by God to do what they are doing.
If you keep it, they will kill them.
Ya yabe, I've told you several times.
Behind what you go
Inshallah, tomorrow after tomorrow.
Don't worry, I'm a scorpion, and scorpions give birth to scorpions.
Even if it's not perfect, it'll do.
I don't want to get married on Thursday.
And off I go to the kitchen.
Put them in the living room.
Tonight's match is between Real Madrid and Barcelona.
Inshallah, we won't be defeated in Valencia.
I'm speaking to you from reliable sources.
The conclusion and desire of her work.
What do you think about what's happening now?
We made a mistake, let's fix it.
Against our will, we endure.
Please stay in your seats.
Thank you, may she live long.
I am very tired.
Focus there
The minister's effort.
May God protect her and prolong her life.
Please, live long, please.
Good evening, dark minister.
Yes, you're getting old.
I washed the plates.
Pour some coffee for Captain Emad.
And once again
We're traveling to China tomorrow, we'll play a match there.
Captain, let me introduce you to my sister, Maryem.
Where is Uncle going? He's going to Abu Amalj.
You are a donkey.
I don't know your business from mine, but you need a minister.
Inshallah, stay safe.
Here is the translation: "Here is my aunt."
Be the change you want to see in the world.
Actor connections
You believe it? Before, my mother used to talk to me, Mashael.
I will do it later.
It's forbidden for you to spin Nov's wheel; it's not suitable for Mashaal.
Noor is a ten-year-old girl.
"ومشاعل يتراولي يعني عشرينات" translates to "And walking with torches means the twenties."
Why don't you take on the role of Mary?
It fits better.
The role of Nov is thirty.
Get rid of this useless stuff they've put in the committee for us.
This is a problem, I'm sure nothing will silence him.
And it stops us from unity.
He talks to you about art, family values, meaningful art, and maternal protection.
This is the one who put this in the committee for us.
The minister is the one who formed the committee.
You, I, and Hamd can affect it, but like this.
Lalala impossible
There is no proof that it belongs to her or Al-Hamad.
Even if he goes to the Ministry of Economy and asks.
After we find our names
God has kept you safe. The company is registered in the name of Hamd's wife.
In this regard, I am not concerned.
Later, make sure who the committee chair is, it's not me.
The last, decisive word will be mine.
La la yabe, everything is fine, thank you, thank you.
I talked to them and agreed on everything.
Peace be upon you.
Upon you be peace. Hello Professor Rashid, may I help?
And as you know, you know that this meeting is dedicated to approving a series of mental rape.
Oh, how wonderful it is to produce contemporary art at the Modern Touch Institute.
Sweet, Strange, Bold Action Series
I am with Hamdan.
Frankly, the series' story is very nice.
I'm with you, Hamad.
And what I liked even more was when the mother took the gun and killed her neighbor.
And she wanted to put the gun in the car's side pocket.
You don't know that this car belongs to a kid who got into some trouble when the police checked him out.
She is picking up her child from school.
He shot the cartoon with his rifle.
John gives him that strong shot, flies the carton, and throws it through his mother's window.
Congratulate the surprise
Oh my god, this is the moment, this is the scene, and the cartoon is in the mother's room.
It's a beautiful thing that a local company has reached this level of business.
We need to encourage them and take their hands.
We haven't heard your opinion, brother Rashid.
You've made him, Brother Rashid, a part of it.
With all due respect to your opinions and impressions of this series, which is called "Rape of the Spirit."
The rape of human values.
And surprises he endured.
A man and a half in every circle.
The text is for the next episode.
A written series without social awareness.
It does not carry a meaningful message that raises the audience.
Tears streaming means you have to cry out the scenes.
Rashid, if you please.
You said your opinion, he expressed his, I expressed mine, let Professor Rashid say his opinion after.
It is clear from the silence.
It means "I smell an agreement between you."
Arrange matters
Some people understand this and it's their area of expertise, while others have no interest in the subject.
I save this series.
I'm afraid they'll get us involved and cause us problems.
Don't bother about it.
What should I do and I can't do anything.
I stand by my word.
John gives me the keys and says, "These are from Mom Samir."
I don't know what's going on.
Don't believe it, Nasser.
This is the new series that we're going to start working on.
The ones who know have their daughter raped.
The more good that comes between us, the better.
The first good thing, of course, is this beautiful ring in your hand.
I'll tell you how.
In the name of Hamd's wife who sent me the ring.
Of course, your husband's role was to sort out matters and issues.
He has a five percent involvement in the work.
Sweet role
I haven't seen an example of a role like this before, I really enjoyed the series about the rape of Amana, it was very good.
By the way
What rape, what rape, oh Lord?
The rape of dreams
Why are all these names so similar?
For example, last year most of the TV series featured female characters.
It means meeting up with a series that has more than eight and ten girls.
Dورج Mastmoun
We have many torches here.
Oh oh, your luck has changed after our fight.
Hello Omar
Whatever is on my mind, it doesn't matter.
I'm sorry, my love, but I have to go to work. What's going on?
Pour and spirit
He says he has an urgent and important matter to discuss.
I need to go there.
What I know is that Rashid went and met the minister.
He says he talked to him for half an hour.
They said to him, "We will betray you."
I tell you, he complained about us, you say, "That's fine."
What happened now is that the minister's office called me to say that they need me.
And they feared after the minister believed him.
The minister, I meet him.
He expressed his opinion about the series.
No more.
This is right, long live you.
But first, I, as the minister's assistant, would like to clarify a point. This is not in my nature to speak about a fellow artist who is not present.
May God protect you, Rashid, and everyone knows this quality about you.
He resents everyone around him.
All material interest
But he is a specialist after all.
But thank God, it doesn't mean that anyone who comes and takes over will automatically be good at technical matters.
Especially TV shows.
The series of the suppression of conscience, may God protect you, which we are working on.
A bold massive work
At the level of the Gulf, God keep you safe, we will have a media advantage.
And a terrifying spread
You are, of course, experts in this field and know more about it than I do.
The hollow condition of the serial number of the IP address.
And let our names be lifted up.
However, what the journalist Abdelhamid wrote, listen, listen, listen.
Indeed, one of the actors commented saying
The series contains unethical calls.
He laments the decline in moral and artistic taste in work.
By God, it's bold speech and strong criticism.
They'll get your group in trouble if the journalist Abdulhamid follows them.
And if their words reach the authorities
These people are smart, they know how to get by.
These are a gang.
They want us to create a special website for ourselves.
We put all the company's activities in it.
The company told me what its name is.
From today on, you are the media advisor.
And the series "Rape of the Soul" that is supervised by the production company Mercury for artistic production.
It's a qualitative leap in Arab drama.
Because of the noble thoughts and values it carries.
It's a series aimed at developing the community.
The journalist Abdulhamid is the very same one who has been criticized for a few days now.
It's reasonable to turn 180 degrees like this, as his mother did.
How can Abdulhamid accept himself like this?
Journalist Abdulhamid and his likes.
Reassure me, Professor Hamd.
He asked for my opinion about the series, and I told him that the series will hit at the level of the Arab world.
May God hear you.
My artistic instinct tells me that our series is a masterpiece.
That's what we don't know where to look.
And this is how he puts his bag and goes.
At the beginning, I am not encouraging.
You're all talking about these things you see in TV shows, but we've never seen or heard of them in real life.
The written is revealed from its title.
Their authors' explicit statements are all hallowed.
What would happen if it didn't happen?
Your show is boring.
What do you think?
It seems like it's going to be a very cold day.
We just measure ourselves against trivial series.
No one can understand or grasp it on the first try.
In threads and hidden dimensions, it requires focus for one to comprehend what he intends to say in this work.
By the way, this work is quite political.
It is forbidden to expose it to people.
What's wrong with you?
If you see them like this, they say they're not eating meat.
Yesterday evening, Ali and I were standing in the market.
We're sitting in a coffee shop.
He didn't give me anything.
Nen Nasser, what do you think about this issue? You know, if the minister gets angry, this is a big problem.
In one week, we will all be confined to our homes.
God, and the series is just as bad as everyone who has seen it says he is a failure.
I hear that Rashid is planning to go there.
And he definitely tells him, "I told you this series is a failure and a flop, and it doesn't have any action."
Damn it, guys.
Leave the matter to me.
And with the voice of Nasser, he spoke.
Hear me, Eli.
From now on, I don't want any posts on your page criticizing the series.
Eli, please.
A few days ago, I realized that there is no criticism of the work, only insults.
Please don't make me angry at you.
Seam him
But one day, I was an opportunity.
I would never say such a thing if I weren't in this situation.
To be honest, I didn't receive any messages of appreciation for the series.
What a remarkable success!
Goodbye
Brother Rashid, allow me.
I'll believe you or believe the newspapers.
The rape of conscience in television acts
May I ask, this is a journalist we agreed on?
Listen to the second newspaper's complaints.
After agreeing with people, read, read on the readers' page.
My heart stopped.
They say, "Cook it, but don't tell me."
How can I, a simple person, be compared to a minister who is pleased with you?
To be honest, Nasser.
Prepare for the seizure of conscience, part two.
La la la, but brother, I didn't want this to happen.
The first and last episode of the series I wrote.
An atom in my work is more valuable than this job.
Part Two Following This Blunder
And third and fourth
What's wrong with you? Don't you want the benefit?
Yani is one of the four sitting in his office.
This is where we are.
The wizard said.
Forward
We need a word to mark this occasion.
Praise be to God for the success.
To doubters, enemies of success.
I am surprised.
How can a mediocre and failed series win an award?
But these people are specialists.
They gave him the awards; he must have seen something we didn't.
Prepare a second part for the series for us.
God willing, long life.
They only called him a magician, a magician.
Reminding you of the rape of the spirit, part two.
I saw you standing next to the minister at the beginning of the ceremony.
After the TV festivals, we agreed to collaborate.
He hears them say, "Get ready" in a second part.
The same thing
Unclean money is deposited in banks to be laundered, so it comes out clean.
The series I watch are low-quality, weak, despicable, and trivial.
They participate in the Gulf and Arab festivals.
So they wash it, clean it, give it awards, and it becomes a refined series in people's eyes. They clean it.
It's reasonable, why isn't it?
As long as the judging committees themselves are the ones producing the series.
Peace be upon you.
And upon you be peace and mercy. Praise be to God that you have arrived.
They are right, we do have a contract with them, but they want to lower the price.
Come to the office.
We're just a small bakery, where we sell roti and bread.
We are the largest bakery companies in the world.
Not a single dollar is downloaded.
Either we agree, or we cancel the contract.
Sufficiency of the contract we signed yesterday.
With the European company
How to use DW (Digital Workspace)
What you see.
A big job is a job well done.
For the first time, I will launch a product that will be the first in the world.
This is the best roti baker in the world.
I'm telling you.
How did I lose my way?
Stop it or you'll have to go to the kitchen for an hour while I look for the prisoner, and sometimes you might even cut off your hand.
Mix this dough with a hook.
The icon was placed with the cheese and I clicked.
This is my roti, this is my pant.
No, you're the one who's wrong. How can it be like that?
How does Abu Nasser get rid of this itch?
When someone goes to work, they might say to their colleague, "I'm having a light breakfast."
Why didn't you go to the نور Mountains hospitals yesterday?
I know I'm asking why you didn't go yesterday.
The thing is, you old man, that the bakers and watchmakers who are in charge of the timepiece.
Reply to the bakers
That's what happened then.
The sun-like one is sitting there screaming at him like this.
Just deal with all this nonsense, whether it's useful or not, and don't mess up my work.
Do you know that your son loves football?
Healing her means if a few employees from the company take a break and relax with them.
You have four hundred employees in the company, right? And that's why you're taking it.
Ten of these individuals are considered key players.
And above them, after taking four substitutes and two administrative staff, he only took seventeen.
And the spokesperson for the team.
Sort this out with these messages.
But I'm making do until I develop, although the supporters, that is, the audience, consider the most important player on the field and player number 12.
Let them be happy as they see him succeed.
And we are people who have signed contracts with them.
Now, this is the day when your father said to you, "Play the first game. I miss it."
When you hear the sound of my voice and obey me.
We did nothing.
Now, so that he can show off a few employees, he made them play in front of him, he watches them and enjoys them, and he gets happy. Then, you get upset about it.
Don't hire employees.
Even if a quarter of your friends need employees, someone will lend them one.
Important bakers
Oh God, may He guide you, which path should you take after the important bakers have taken their share?
Second time if employees are taking, say.
No, no to this deal. Let Hamdi revisit this with me.
Hamdi is in the hospital.
Why hasn't anyone come to your aid, God bless you?
I finished work and as I was leaving, I got into my car.
Listen to Nasser, may God prolong his life, he is praying.
I walked on it.
The goalkeeper told me, "We can't find him; we have an important match tonight."
Saying no mission, he's looking for a goalkeeper, we've reached the field.
What are you going to wear? He said, "Wear a goalkeeper's uniform."
I've never played or touched a ball in my life.
This is a condition
What goes unnoticed.
And if you don't want to, we'll find you a job to occupy you, inshallah, without wasting time, without laziness, without nonsense.
Let me tell you.
Yebe, you want me to solve the team and delete it properly.
Yes, that's right.
Zain, please God, on this face, but I'm asking you.
Forbidden means to leave the team and disrupt the final match.
La la la, this one is the boy's right.
How did you hurt yourself?
Congratulations on the win.
Congratulations, Professor Nasser, on winning the cup.
We wanted to know how you planned to win.
Look, I'm the team leader, mentally, physically, and spiritually, and thank God the coach didn't disappoint.
Inside your hotel
Congratulations to all of you, and the party is just as I promised.
I say your father seems happy.
I fear he is embarrassed and accommodating.
Father Abu Nasser, in the beginning, and peace be upon the Prophet, we want to congratulate you on the great victory of your team, the International Bakeries team.
With this great victory
God bless you.
Picture without a vest Moment by moment Hold on, a little bit.
No, no.
There is no doubt about it.
Undoubtedly, your great care, attention, and creative ideas played a significant role in this victory.
And his coach's line.
But in the final, he played a 5-3-2 formation.
And as a great athlete, you know that changing the plan disrupts the players, yet the baker's team did not disrupt and provided a great match.
And his coach's line.
As the top athlete in international baking competitions, what advice do you give to fellow competitors?
To the end of time
Hello, hello
Long live
He greeted them along with Sultan Hamoud.
May God greet them, they honor us, they will have dinner with us tonight.
Dinner
God bless you, Abu Abdul Aziz.
And consider their contribution to the private sector.
The team is just now
Jealous of us, huh?
Neither does it mean
Bo Abdul Aziz
The agent for the machines we use in the factory.
Did you see how?
This is what you wished to know.
The ball introduced me to him, and I gave him a hint.
Tell him, O Abu Abdul Aziz.
And you've always stayed away from football.
And what does that have to do with you?
To put the ball in his chest, I see it between her and me, fifty centimeters means I'm closer to her.
Abu Nasser hasn't arrived yet.
No, by God, he hasn't come even today.
At the conference on sports injuries, as the platinum sponsor, his presence is mandatory.
I haven't seen anything yet.
I saw the building behind the bakeries that was supposed to be accommodation for workers.
Hello, it's drowning in the ball.
As we have become accustomed to doing before every match, we meet with one of the symbols of sports and have a conversation with them.
This man who inspires the bakery team with his great ideas.
How is the International Bakery Team doing? We heard that you are conducting a comprehensive development process.
Absolutely means definitely, in this context, referring to the desks and the hard work.
A paltry sum, it means all my hard work is worth just one million dollars.
Don't worry, just relax a bit.
Heidi was your mistake, not mine, my dear Shahin.
My mistake.
I made a mistake.
But you didn't tell me that the players are required in the Gulf.
Prices in the Gulf can reach fantastical levels.
It means the player who has 200,000 points.
They'll take him in the Gulf for three or four million dollars.
Understand me, Mr. Masoud, how?
Stable fax from me here.
I am afraid of men while they exist.
I'm telling you again, my dad bought four new players for the team, in addition to the new shipment with four players.
What a strange tree! It's like something from a story. All this is hidden in its branches.
This is written as "Deh
That's true, Dad, but this price... may God protect you, he got it from a Turkish club.
In the Emirates, they want him at a price of 2 million and 100 thousand.
What do you see in me?
Sure, here is the translation: "So, can we check the goods?"
Sure, here is the translation: "Of course, in front of you."
The man is drowning.
All done.
Lalala, I'll give you everything guaranteed.
God, you're so fat. This is a nice fat.
This is a pivot point. This is a right of support.
The contracted muscle
This strong muscle is the most important thing for an athlete; if it gets damaged, it's of no use.
I didn't fail.
I don't really know how to get them to us, my club, I just wish you could help.
Push it harder
By God, I'm grateful, let's go.
Thank you, thank you
This is Allah, may He keep you safe, the creator.
Yes, I will bring them from the jungles of Africa, what shall we do with them?
Roll them, train them, then really push them, and finally exhaust them on the fields.
I didn't ask for anything, I didn't ask for your anger, if I want it, I'll take it. There's space for it in the car or I'll carry you in the pick-up.
He was mad when he saw them putting pressure on us.
The attacker descended on me.
The kakakanoa makalali dindang la'i.
The defender descends.
Cashew macaca lulululu this forbidden thing that falls
Our coach is clumsy.
Inshallah on Mars
Neither Spain, God willing, on Mars.
I don't like the way he reads the match report.
This follows a line.
The match has rules.
Inshallah two days
Why is your voice echoing?
This phrase translates to "This place is Spain." in English.
He just won't believe that the coach is an idiot, he doesn't understand football.
Listen, listen, what Mitsu says, keep it to yourself.
He knows that the struggle's attacker, Silulotikaowa, is from the region of the partition, as Ahmed al-Tayeb said, and he knows where he is based.
No one hurts your head.
Stay away, you.
And I know how to deal with this coach.
Why did the team retreat?
The obvious that is happening now would make the well-trained team from the International Bakery Center consider changing the halfway point of the game.
Because the players are not playing in their positions.
And the player Takolamakakokulalalaw is not in his natural position, he needs to transfer to the place where he always plays.
The right coach's words change everything.
Kukonali pulls Hobowai Malalo
Inshallah, Inshallah, Inshallah.
La la la, what's going on in the stadium?
What's happening right now shouldn't be happening between the team manager.
And the team's coach.
If there's something you're putting off until after the game.
Now everyone is sitting and watching, and everyone is looking and the thing is in front of the camera.
The game is on in the saying, fourth goal for the success team.
He scores the fourth goal and he is the star of the match today.
This trainer is headstrong.
His saying "Enough", my uncle Nasser doesn't want you as his team's coach.
And after that, what?
I'm watching the match on TV while you sit on the bench. Do what I'm saying.
My child, don't do this to yourself, it's not good.
Now, tomorrow we have a match. How can we play without a coach?
What will your father do?
That's it, Rashid.
Heal me, mother, my heart is troubled; Heal me, tell me, what ails you.
Mom, divorce me, divorce me.
How did you shoot yourself?
I don't know, mom, I don't know.
How are you doing since you got married a month ago?
By God, I don't know, I really don't know what...
It means "I'm free for you and the way is open."
"ای یمه ای" translates to "Oh mother oh."
Oh my God, I suddenly realized, he said to me, "Get up, go to your parents' house."
I told him why, and he said, "I'll divorce you, you're divorced."
I'm at my wits' end and God, I have no idea what's going on.
A married couple separating, people say about us.
I am with you.
And God, I tell you the truth.
I didn't even know she was divorced until I heard it from you now.
Stay seated for a minute and breathe.
Her high morals
Barcelona Saturday
The look in Abdullah's eyes
Yani returned and his tear rolled down his cheek.
He says 'I'm going back to Barcelona, this is where I die, I respect this team a lot.'
You hurt him by insulting and hurting his feelings.
She told me, "I'm leaving Barcelona on Saturday," so I said, "It's fine, what do you want? Let it go, I'll find you another one."
I tell him that his daughter got divorced because she cursed FC Barcelona.
Just for this reason, I'm telling you the truth.
I don't need you.
Is it easy to hurt someone's feelings?
His wife stabs him in the back.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
A girl who doesn't respect global teams doesn't matter to us.
This time, she made fun of Messi.
Spouses have problems, and it's expected that we...
Replace the unit A
I have a lot of daughters and I wish I had just one.
"Oh daughter of men, listen to my words."
Just honestly, I don't want to hear anything.
And I told you, please, don't enter this, my son, and I know him well.
We told you not to enter.
I'm getting angry with you now.
Don't worry, mom, don't worry about it.
Replace the unit A
Just why am I so stressed?
But every time her name comes up
Real Madrid is better than Barcelona.
My dear present.
Poor her, what's wrong with her like this?
The girl's name is Manar.
I married last month and got divorced.
And even if I go there just to see, why did you look, you'll die laughing.
We don't need your interference.
What's the point, mom, with a guy like this? He just left his wife for a soccer team.
The hairdresser knows them and told me the whole story. Mother, don't get me involved with him, I don't want to get stuck with someone like that.
Just you wait, you're going to be sorry for these useless haircuts.
You know how to tell them I don't agree.
Let it get mixed up and say whatever it wants.
Goodness, oh dear.
Tell her, tell her, my daughter, don't cut off your livelihood.
If it's about her livelihood, give her a push.
But if we cut off her (and our) livelihood.
This building.
He says no.
"My God, I rely on Him against this filthy, talkative woman."
Just by hearing them and spreading them.
I don't have to do that.
Understand it and tell her to not close the door of good that's opening for us.
He knows how to convince her.
It's not right that you believe him, meaning now you believe he divorced his wife because she left Barcelona.
Stop daydreaming and don't act crazy.
Don't let the opportunity slip away.
And you taught her the reason, and there was something or a flaw that made him let her go.
Listen to me, daughter of men, do not be excessive in your love for both.
What is the distance between the two towers?
But they were about to discover that they were two towers.
That's why they named his father Shahin al-Barjin.
God keep you alive.
Oh, nonono, sweet thank you goodbye.
Thank you very much.
May I ask, since you have already placed the order and signed, and the money has already been spent, what's done is done.
Your schedule is not focused and it's clear that you have a lot of commitments. That's been the case for you since last month.
That's from the first month of the wedding; this is a new wedding for Abdullah, he's divorced.
He was previously married and divorced.
By God, this is the third wedding I'm attending now.
Just this is the story, my brother, take a deep breath.
This is a difficult generation, oh Real.
The opinion and the other opinion
Blessed, blessed, oh mother.
Mom, don't forget, the fur coat you put on top of the bag.
So you can hold it in your hand while you're on the plane.
When did you arrive in London?
Hey, are you not planning to go to London?
Hello, mom
Any way out?
So she can come with us and do some shopping while she's at it.
Malaysia Malaysia
Malaysia, take the fur with you.
Goodbye, mother.
Heal her now.
And how should I know?
This is right in front of your eyes, ask her and I don't know what's going on.
Go ask your father what's happening.
I did what I could for her.
My daughter is from there.
That's the month of honey that she's supposed to look at you with her eyes, serve you with her hands and feet.
It's reasonable, it's a rule, and you're just learning.
No, don't lift the cup to your lips and drink.
He's badly brought up.
John told her that my mother raised me and she used to feed me water with her hands.
Heal her like this.
She looks very sad.
And this is what she has from whom?
Her name is Mashael.
Poor her, she looked worn out during the honeymoon.
I won't regret if you leave me.
God bless you, Auntie, you're welcome.
Will you recommend your aunt to me after?
Oh, but I don't know where my mom booked for us.
Oh, hello mom!
Mom, where did you book for us?
Because she will leave with us there
There is no strength or power but by God.
I burst into tears like this at the airport and I took the kids with me.
What's going on between them
Now you're asking me what's going on between them.
And by God, his departure.
Where is the light?
She's in her room talking to this crazy person.
She's been calling him for two days now, but his phone is turned off.
We just caught him.
This is what we're waiting to see what's going on.
He's a tired young boy from outside, he needs your help to rest.
Every day, I tell her to bring me an apple, peel it, and not peel it. It bothers me every day.
Later, you'll know that I don't like apples with their skins.
"أي ما اتقشر التفاح" translates to "What's the matter with the apple peeling?" in English.
Oh, I'm telling you.
You are divorced.
And if necessary,
Go, my eye's delight.
I love you.
Here, my dear Manire, what's up?
Heal yourself after you've endured suffering.
Call him three times and say "divorce."
Shut up and leave me alone.
I don't know if I've been ignored at the Spanish disco and he told me.
He doesn't have a clue.
It's true, he has no clue.
She dances three dances for her.
After that, no one will ever live who can take my daughter away from me.
How do you say it?
Come here, where are you going?
Wherever I go, I'll be colder than this place, where no one has any shame.
It has a tail like a peacock.
Adorned with gold, rubies, coral, and diamonds.
The daughters of people are a plaything for you and your son.
They don't have a single mother to burn for them.
The ones you've humiliated.
And we let them go as we pleased.
I didn't give you water, she left Barcelona, she left it all behind, let her take care of herself.
The one going to the dance floor.
No shame, no embarrassment
A minister's agent is an Arab and a Muslim.
His reputation and his children's reputation accused him.
Stay put and don't move.
Have a little bit of humanity.
My father's right
He's back, the kind of guy who sells land like this.
Bo Saqr take it from my father by force.
Why did your father sell them?
"Allah guide you, Bo Saqr. If you set your eyes on something, anyone can tell you no."
Leave it to God, man.
Welcome welcome knock knock
Yalla yalla
How is your project going, Saad?
Put your hand down.
You said last week you'd go to the office.
I'm telling you, for your project to succeed, you need to hurry up and get moving.
Bo Saqr, the veteran millionaire.
There's no one in this world who doesn't eat.
This isn't a problem, as I'm his brother, I'll feed him, water him, and take care of his stomach. The problem is how do we reach him?
You need to know the key to Bu Saqr so the doors will open for you.
He passed away with him during his umrah and I have saluted him several times.
All I need to know is that as long as you are casting your net, you will behave in a certain way, but you need to recognize the right opportunity.
I'll tell you what the secretary said first: "Bo Saqr is waiting for you for dinner."
I hit the snooze button repeatedly.
This Bo Saqr (a name), may God protect him, every day he makes dinner.
"يا ريال الواحد" translates to "Oh, one rial" in English.
He loves this group and gathers his friends.
How lovely it is to sit in this farm at night.
If you're asking about the location, this is Bu Nasser car agency, it's located behind the mall.
May I have the pleasure of knowing you, sir?
Get a license.
It was my son who got the license.
May God bless you.
Congratulations on your license, Falcon.
God bless you.
Long live the Eagle, may you live long.
I beg you, do not hesitate to say yes.
Just say 'done', you've been talking for a long time.
A gift from me to him.
And whoever guides you, do not turn away from them.
My affairs are in order.
It means: "So, like this, you met him and said, 'What's up?'"
You won't become stupid after all.
No big deal, Abu Nasser.
Understanding me means how the method is, what did I do?
Circumstances have served me.
And we were sitting with him.
Good, his son Saqr has obtained the license.
The gift of the falcon is in my possession.
If on the car
Possible
Go, go, and leave him.
What happened?
Left the hospital
Remove my tonsils.
He's definitely making dinner.
You deserve the safety of the boy, O long-lived one, peace be upon you.
Health and healing, Inshallah, I won't see any harm, Inshallah.
We met at the shop selling candles.
I think, God willing.
"Ya Real, We've Forgotten That We've Grown Up."
They said, "The room where we found you and your son Shahin was empty."
I returned, I said, to visit you.
And I congratulate you on the safety of Shahin.
You're a good person, God forbid. Listen up, old man, we're only going to leave after we've had dinner with you.
I'm in the mood for it.
You said yes before.
On the occasion of our beloved son Shahin's discharge from the hospital.
The tower I have on the corniche
"قول تم خلاص" translates to "Job done, that's all."
Oh mother, don't set your mind on it.
I don't like trading and I have no inclination towards it.
Whoever gets an opportunity in this time can start their business without capital.
In the vehicle and truck agency, he just says "anything".
Love from God and from people, you will be loved in return from the love of your father.
Even at university
All the doctors love your father and recommend him.
And three-fourths of them every night are with him at the mils.
May God bless your father, there is no one who does not love him. You just need to show him respect.
Oh, mother, people take loans from banks to start a company or business.
I am a member of the association.
Open the rental shop.
Something new with depth
This is a falcon. He looked me in the eye yesterday and said to me, "Just try them."
He just came back yesterday from their agency.
I saw how.
And after I said, "O my mother, all the merchants love me," may God make His creation love you, O Lord.
Yes, old man.
And I'm on my way to the office now.
I saw a new supermarket.
They're getting it ready.
I really liked it.
I don't know who he is.
Congratulations, congratulations, Uncle Falcon.
May God protect you.
In the name of God, In the name of God
What's he coming in to do? He's taking it cold, ice-cold.
You are now able to say no.
So, what's the story?
What he says is "I'm back."
"دش معاه"
You don't know who his father is.
Whoever follows their father.
I told him, "I am Qasim, the son of Abu Sadiq," he said, "You are in the business."
I have a baker, thank God, I make a living from him.
I don't like that name.
I didn't notice it.
No, brother, the name is not nice.
Well, that's a suitable name for Iranian bread.
I met him by chance.
We will finally call it Grand Bread Bakery.
Wait a moment.
Peace be upon you.
Peace and God's mercy upon you, long-lived one.
Excellent, excellent! Is there something missing? Do you want something?
Thank God, everything is fine.
I say, Ayad, this is a new employee with us.
She just sent her car for repairs and came to take mine because she's a representative of the advertising company. I'm glad to tell you that she doesn't plan to get rid of the car anytime soon.
You might still need your car.
No, actually, I don't need the car today.
God willing, it won't be a problem.
This is the time for science, knowledge, and study.
I agree with Dr. Rashid that humans must arm themselves with knowledge, regardless of the subject matter.
Well done, Dr. Sami.
Long live you, O my lord.
Studied and unstudied
You are listening to us like dogs reading books.
No lesson, no trade, no economy.
He has never read a book, so he has never even held a newspaper in his hands, let alone read it throughout his life.
You all know who the eagle is today.
Even though I didn't want to, I got into this trading field, but...
Uncle Bu Nasser, this is him, alive and well, right in front of you.
From the memory
There are only people who are naturally inclined towards business, they love business.
Your words are correct, doctor.
Hopefully, you'll be back, Shahin, and see your brother.
God is kind, hopefully.
You people
Of course, this depends on upbringing.
Don't hurry, doctor.
You want the truth.
How did the falcon come to represent such ease? He hated trade, yet reached this great economic awareness.
If you counted a hundred billionaires in the world today, one of them would be among them.
Do you know, O Seagull?
Saker chose the market for the knight's honor.
Peace be upon you.
How are you, Nasser?
Mohammed called me and told me that Bou Nasser is in the hospital.
I heard that Saqr bin Bu Saqr is planning to take over the car dealership from his father.
The agency flew from you.
The world is vast and never satiated.
The father is the one who helped him so he could go to the market.
It's what made him open his eyes to trade.
Frankly, the doctor says his condition is very serious.
That's just not how it works.
There's nothing that can't be done.
I'm hurt, but it's not my business. I'm telling you, leave her, leave her, that means divorce her.
In this era of the twenty-first century
And we meet, dear viewers, with one of the men of good and giving in this country.
A man who knows the path of the righteous and the needy.
Of course, we have the founder and owner of the charity association, Falcon Charity.
Of course, if you were to talk to us, old man, about this association.
We all know your noble goals that you strive to achieve, of course for the world and of course for everyone.
Without any pretense, or desire for fame, God forbid.
And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. Recently, we were able to deliver thirty sheep to our brothers in Africa.
Also now, praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds, we are preparing to deliver.
Seven cartons of sweets for our children in Gaza.
May God prolong your life, may there be more like you.
We left the house, me and the lady.
But the lady is taking half an hour to open her new project.
And I'm waiting for her.
What's the harm?
I really love spending time with you, I love counting the moments we spend together, it makes me happy.
And provide for my family.
All my life
It seems like you want to waste my time.
And stay away from problems.

In this era of the twenty-first century
Whoever wants to dive into the depths wants to endure the effort.
I want men.
Al-Suq al-Waqif is alive.
You deserve it, congratulations, congratulations.
God bless you.
God willing, everyone loves you, O Shahin, because love comes from God.
I just want to say one word, but you have to say "ok".
On the occasion of his license, my son Shahin will go to the agency and choose the most beautiful and most expensive car as a gift from me.
Let the wind blow upon us from the fig trees of the valley.
Oh my heart, love has taken me away from my homeland.
Hi Fadi
How are you, Anoud?
No no no no no
Now you're telling me the dress will be ready in a week, but yesterday you sent me a message saying it would be ready in ten days. What a fool!
You want crystal, it needs to be taken a little and more.
Inshallah, now I'm going to chat with Anoud and ignore you.
Why are we so dim compared to her?
La la la, the world can't make you angry, not even stubbornness.
Don't worry, Fadi, they're just provoking you.
Wow, their words are intriguing me, not like our group, they are jealous of you.
The important thing is don't forget the topic.
My dress is ready.
Please save Fadi.
Thank you, brother Fadi.
My dear Fadi will visit you next week to pick up the dress, bye for now.
How can I serve you?
Just send me the house dress.
No, I didn't like it.
Alhamdulillah, I went to Fadi's shop today and everything was in order. The girls were coming and going.
Thank God, we succeeded in this project.
Afterwards
Bo Nasser is my cousin.
Heal him later.
Look at the jealousy.
We've never heard of such a successful project in this bankrupt's portfolio; where does he get the money from?
The pump sucks.
And the first thing I started in trade
Are you sure?
Listen to him.
And Allah knows best, are you planning to keep quiet about it?
Seven in the morning
I'll bring you breakfast.
Don't give up, I'm curious.
I just wanted to tell you.
I heard that you...
I plan to enter a business project.
But where am I and where are these things? May God guide you, my nephew.
Our women's clothing design, we design something like, for example.
I was telling you.
I am a trader.
Lalala no, lala but I
I'm available if you need advice. If you want me to help you with something.
"Take care, nephew. Take care."
Please forgive me, Allah, I'm leaving.
Please, Uncle.
He's the first to tell me if you need more.
Come on, Fadi, organize the store, it's crowded and I'm tired.
The shop is not enough.
I said you'll take the place I'm sitting in, so rely on God and take it.
I wish.
This shop where you are sitting is owned by a merchant.
There is a man named Khalf Sultan al-Saif who is not your cousin, Bu Nasser.
No, there's nothing.
I'm from the Ministry of Economy, I saw his name in a transaction with a friend of mine named Osama, he's handling his documents.
Women's fashion design
Sure, the
I see the lease agreement, and it's written on it.
Healing her means healing her, healing her.
Heal her, heal her, heal her, there's a pain in her.
Your wounded heart refuses.
My project was successful.
I said, "I'll only ruin it."
This is an open market for everyone.

The shepherd who says (or has said)
And when you calm down, I'll tell you what they say: "You're planning to start a business."
Yabe, ma ajabta 'alayk.
And seek help in fulfilling your affairs through secrecy.
And you and your things, may you be cursed sixty times.
But what brought you here?
Oh, these are destinies; everyone takes their own fate.
Reach out your hand.
May I ask you, oh people?
Lalala, he's back to his old tricks, Bou Saleh.
In Bitby, stretch out your hand.
Open to all
You are brothers
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
He is a Lebanese designer.
"I am asking you again."
Know our women's just emotions in the Lebanese idiom.
Madam, this is a bad omen for you, lala la la, there is none of this in Doha at all.
Yee, Madam, what do you think of this and all this lovely stuff and the piece they're selling for thirty-four thousand?
"He is like him."
The translation of your text is: "Tell me about the depression I went through last year when I hired the Lebanese carpenter."
Madam, I will make you a wardrobe that has no equal in Doha.
You've got to succeed.
What exactly is it?
Why don't you know?
The term "سرء الزباين" translates to "deterioration of customers" in English.
What do you think, Uncle Nal, let's do something different.
Ah ah, Fadi.
And they play as if their souls were at that hour.
It means "It means we have lost."
We need to face it.
And our customers came back against their will.
Alright, you pay.
What am I paying for?
I'm ready to do anything.
But the most important thing is that I don't get overwhelmed.
This dress that you chose turned out to be 60,000 rial.
Sure, here is the translation: "Definitely without the constraints mentioned in the text."
Here is the translation: "This is a gift from me, designed by me."
And I put on it a crystal seed, there are only fifty seeds like it in all the countries of the world. This is a unique seed from many.
Sure, here is the translation: "Of course, there are no discounts; our prices are globally known and fixed."
No, definitely not, who would even do that?
Moment by moment, what exactly happened?
Oh Saad, oh Saad
That's how they do their work.
Kill us, we have no more customers at all.
Heidi is a name of war, O Nasser.
And we're not keeping quiet about them.
We have to fight them as they fight us and retaliate.
Tomorrow I'll take out a loan from the bank.
Set war against them and show them your might.
She is bringing them from Port Nasser.
Look at the ad.
Look at the ad he/she posted.
We're offering two evening gowns for free with every wedding dress.
He has four evening dresses, each with a wedding dress.
And we're running a half-page ad.
Jofi is a tool that hides a text within a page.
I don't know what he intends to do.
Do you believe it, Mother Nasser?
They've been there for six days, not a single word from them.
No, and today in this age, I bring you good news: they didn't just open it once, they sealed it.
If you hear that a property in his neighborhood is for sale.
With every blow
They can't even sit outside.
Just drink your juice and go.
Where is God guiding me? I don't know where I am or where I'm going, this is a problem.
Are you a stranger to something?
This is God, may He keep you, someone who deliberately comes to this place with this smell.
These are chemical materials.
Are you sure someone smells in the store?
You're all grown-up kids, not little ones, fighting like children.
"Yai (smells) bad at night in the store, which means this is right."
I didn't spray this, you did.
About the mistake
You have written a commitment to the police on yourself.
Do not forget.
I am tired this time.
He has devised a diabolical plan.
No one is holding anything over my head.
No, God, everything is fine.
What's this that's confusing me?
I don't know what's going on, God. This is the fourth day, not a single regular customer has come to the store.
And this second place made me reveal my face, may God guide you.
And what did the doctor say?
I see the store is empty, with no customers.
I don't know, they say he has a charm.
Women and girls don't come near the shop at all.
What you're saying is that the designer's template, Saad Waad, is a magical shape.
It's not far-fetched to exclude nothing these days.
Magic is real, and that's after all.
Zain is either sleeping or sitting now.
Go on in there, bro. I'm afraid the ceiling might collapse.
You lost, O Sultan, you lost.
I don't know anything about it.
A wild beast
Calm yourself, brother, you'll never bother me again.
I don't know what they did.
My love taught me, they say his friends all came together, they gathered money for him and settled his debts.
The designer who has
Lebanese
You told him, you said to him.
What, what, what, what, do you know where he went?
The stars, the stars, they are there, and the cosmic dance goes on.
Call Real again, he might have a solution.
Hey hey, Uncle Ahmed.
Hey Ahmed, why are you sitting here and letting the troublemakers disturb me? I mean, what are we supposed to do? I just wonder where the extras you said you'd get today are.
Get away from me, it's better for you. I've called him, and my head is aching so much that I have to ask Professor Abdullah.
First, don't shout because we're actors and we need to stay calm and focused on our roles. Second, the real person called me several times, leaving messages.
Shit, shit, shit, what do you say, Professor Abdullah, what do you say?
Mr. Abdullah, what should I do? This scene-stealing character is going to ruin everything for me.
Come on, guys, come on, beautiful ones, the one after, the one after that.
Oh, oh, oh, sir, we need to finish, but this camera that's supposed to capture the scene... it's not working.
I don't want anyone to scold you like this.
Organize your work, simplify it, and do it without shouting.
And this is our whole situation: screaming from the morning, we need to focus.
I found a solution for you.
What do you think? Prepare yourself for a scene like this, God willing, I'll get you an actor who does the role well.
That's right, I want to work on just one scene.
But this scene is the most important scene in the series.
Just excuse me, sir, to take some pictures.
But if you're not ready, I'll leave today.
Above the youth, God willing.
What would you say to a Filipino person to help?
You don't know Walid, he always says he needs someone from the cabaret, someone from the cabaret and from Qatar.
Sir, we'll put a keffie on him, and he won't be noticed.
Alaa, are you serious? You just want to do this. This is disrespectful. Respect people's feelings and intelligence.
Since Alaa put everything on your shoulders, distribute the tasks and you'll feel more relaxed.
Donate so we can see if my thoughts align with yours, Rym. Maybe you remember someone from these times.
Who am I?
Remember a man named Saud Aknar in our neighborhood.
Saud Aknar, no one else.
Saud Qawati says: "Keep quiet."
The drill says you want a rich and powerful one, and the saw says 'cut the cans.'
My love, in the end, a companion means bringing a rich and powerful person and giving them a role as a companion.
But some makeup, a nice dress and a clean car - that's the way to go.
Inshallah, it will be beneficial.
So how do we get there?
I guide them home.
Peace be upon you.
Saïd Ouaty
Who are these people?
I cannot transla
Yes, thank you, dad, you didn't disappoint.
Now, Mom, there's nothing else but this stranger who came with my uncle from his trip.
Yabe, all you have is that which you wear.
Ah, it's definitely inside the cage under my clothes.
The group is waiting for me at the door, complaining.
God, God, may you be successful, O father.
Today they're going to interview you and film you on TV.
They said that they're going to show me on TV, which means I'm one of the adults.
Sit down and shut up.
Come here, this is for you.
Spray spray
His mother
The speed is overwhelming, it's all a blur now.
Inshallah, ya yabe.
No, God willing, God willing, but they just give you money.
God bless you, Inshallah.
God willing, pray for me.
I brought you Saud's cans and Saud's laptop.
Peace be upon you.
Upon you be peace, mercy of God, and His blessings.
This is not the son of Fatima, Abud.
Hello, hello
Hello Saud
This is what's making the scene.
I hope, Allah willing, he will do a good job and yell a lot so they give you a longer role, right?
Tell mom how she is.
That's not the one who caught the first fish.
Fault, fault. Go, cry, Saudi.
You've started wearing glasses.
The slave has grown old.
I don't regret nominating you, but I wish things had been different.
The brother who is standing by to play the role of Abu Abdul Aziz.
Whether it's a connection or a father, here comes Allah, welcome, welcome, welcome.
The white way is this our exit, dear absent-minded professor.
The most important thing is that you're not afraid of the camera.
My brother, I only fear my Lord.
Just relax and listen to the director's instructions; he'll guide you, Inshallah.
Brother, brother, please, you're going to play one role from the cabaret of the rich, do you understand or not?
Come here, son, come here, son.
I am talking to you.
This is really light, actually. The job needs someone heavy.
Everything is acceptable to some people.
Ask me why I protested.
"Hey, sensitive camera owners, listen to me. I'm going to take a makeup brush and follow you to the dressing room."
Fault, fault, fault
Come, please.
We got to know her habits.
Just just just you you
I've come, by God, to get you. Please, come in.
My teacher, the car you want for the scene is ready.
Saoud cleans up everything and puts it in order.
Any delay, apologize again, and ask the assistant director to listen to you and go check on it.
Imagine yourself as the old merchant.
You are saying this.
"AI, I'm telling you, be patient, be patient, don't rush. I didn't expect that from you, Abu Abdul Aziz. You, Abu Abdul Aziz, say..."
About our rights
Sweet and know.
Come on, bro, let me clean my teeth.
It cleans and completes the full name Buabdulaziz Falh Al-Marzouq, nice.
Keep going, keep going, and learn from it.
And consider your daughter divorced.
Why don't you just divorce her?
Your daughter is divorced, she is sweet.
It's really sweet, continue and consider yourself not chosen.
Why should I say f*ck you?
You're amazing, Allah, you're truly amazing. May Allah bless and greet the Prophet (peace be upon him).
I clean my teeth.
How come what?
Sir, the owners of the house have blinded us and want the hall in the back, disrupting the views of those in the hall, and then we will protect the attachments outside.
How does that mean they don't want it?
Yes, they want to, but they're delaying a bit to shoot a different scene. We'll be right behind them, God willing.
Make them come to you.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you.
God wake you up in good health, may your life last long.
Hello, who are you, young man?
I am, as you wish, a healthy and conscious communist.
And indeed, the common people are well-known.
You deserve it.
My anger subsides, I return after the storm has passed here.
Come on, my brother, those who have weak noses are stronger now.
I wish I were (or I would be)
If someone else had laughed, they would have died.
I would like to grill.
Oh my god
My mother is tired now, I need to go see her right away. Bro.
The moment you take off your clothes like this
I can't tell you that my mother is sick and tired, she says.
Listen, you can go like this, but as soon as I call you, you need to come back right away.
And as we watched, we realized we couldn't pinpoint the location.
Just find me a taxi, please.
If you look for a taxi here and wait for a year, you won't be able to find one.
You know, this car is just for the scene.
As long as she stands, her spirit lives.
Oh God, brother, please, I wish you could give me a switch. My mother is sick, God, please give me a switch.
In the car
I want a chair.
Get up now, send me a chair right now, O Sheikh.
I tell you, I tell you.
I tell you, my mother is tired, Allah, in the car I wanted a chair, may Allah protect you.
Where is the driver in the car?
Ah ah, oh oh, it's happening.
Be quiet and don't argue inside while you're silent.
Peace be upon you
There's nothing, but your aunt is having an asthma crisis, God help her.

Thank God, Rashed.
They finished our son Rashid.
Please come with me, Professor Rashod.
Please keep it with you, Mr. Rashid.
And I will take the teacher Rashid and do what is necessary.
This is a trust from you.
I'll have the nurse monitor your vitals and see what you're drinking.
Please, Professor Rashod.
About your zinc
We are few but waiting.
The problem is that no one is giving us time.
Sir Snow wants to leak the location of the coffee shop.
Ya, you're the first one to take a picture of the security guard at the hospital taking a break with a Filipino woman.
And who told you I refuse?
Just no one is giving me a chance.
Don't overthink it.
Unless he has a certificate, I don't want your mother. What don't you want your mother? Go look for your quarter.
There is one person at the hospital that I liked.
Ya, I'm done giving you attention, go find someone else.
My heart cannot bear this attachment.
Your brother is a doctor and he loves it. Believe me, I matched them.
I would like to gift a present to Dr. Mohammed.
It's the same snow in the end.
Go ahead!
By God, what a wonder!
May God grant you a long life, Auntie, in the best of health.
You're a professional actor, Saud. Come on, guys, let's go!
Oh, salutations to you! I saw how they clapped for you and praised you.
Come on, now go change your clothes and wipe off your makeup.
Son of a good person, leave it and come here, sign here first.
Yes, from today, my name is Falah Al-Marzouz.
Forget about that stuff and write "Saud"
Saud died.
From today, my name is Falah Al-Marzouz Bu'Abd Al-Aziz.
God bless you, my love.

Sweet two
Until I heard one of the bride's relatives say, "These people are very refined; I don't think anyone could have done what they did at the wedding."
Okay, my dear, goodbye then.
Here, mom
I need to get them something for the graduation.
What, mother?
See your brother who is making us fail.
His stitching is poor, you can see through it.
Just as we can manage.
This is for the maids to eat.
He wants to let us laugh.
Say that what you saw was beautiful.

No, we don't want something ordinary. We want something unique, something that not everyone can buy.
Forgiveness, O wise one who does not know you, is an order from a long-lived one.
Just shut up, shut up, you don't know anything.
I'm afraid my money won't be enough.
Don't fail, let's withdraw with the card.
Oh oh oh, such a beautiful thing, God!
The safe haven yesterday.

Rejoice, rejoice!
Good news, Abha, your turn is coming.
Booking the small hall and food for the event.
Ferry port
The "L" in what she said about the wedding of the house of Sa'id.
Sure, the translation of the given text into English is: "Of course, everyone says the same thing."
It's not that which scares me.
My dear sister
I'm just making some money.
"ولا هامه كلام الناس" translates to "People's talk doesn't matter."
He wants to let us laugh.
It's only natural that we do what we can, according to our means and circumstances.
You know that some people borrow money and sell their homes and cars just to have a grand wedding, and they don't want people to question them.
Just get out of this situation, that's enough of the unnecessary drama that almost made us fail.
You said yourself that the manager was impressed by the Chinese and took her home.
The bride's family said, "You choose the hall and the stage, and prepare everything according to your wishes."
And Allah knows best, may we choose anything.
It doesn't mean much, but I'm saying the place we went to was really affordable, meaning the price was very reasonable.
This is the store where my father's wedding was held.
Someone used it before.
God, to be honest, it's really hard.
Marry a long-lived daughter, congratulations.
La la la, we don't want anything used.
My couch, we are the first people in the world to use it.
It means you want to stand out.
Raoni, what's up?
This couch is the first time I've entered Qatar.
Inspired by the informative sura, meaning Facebook and Twitter.
It's very modern and innovative.
The price of this couch with its fittings
How about that, but not the one with twenty-five thousand.
Oh my, oh my, this is so beautiful, but it's beyond our budget. Everything is more expensive, better, and unique, but it all costs money.
Everyone does this.
Shut up and let him who saves you.
What are the reasons?
What did you like about this?
This is Noah's ark.
They bought two grandfathers, but at a price of twenty thousand times more than the ark of Noah.
No, and why should God bless your parents? I'm serious, a cat is much better.
Be silent, you are not Noah's ark.
These weddings and their costs, and we consider ourselves average people.
That means a deposit of fifty-five thousand and a suite for fifty-five, this is what you booked at the Royal Hall, as you said.
We didn't say it's magic, but the appearances are deceiving, everyone wants to look at the other and everyone wants to do better than the other.
Only the owners of wedding halls benefit from the current situation.
Those who know that everyone wants to stand out exploit us and cut us short.
And I know a friend of mine whose brother has a party hall.
The couch says it doesn't cost 2000 arials.
Do not push him, I have not given my approval to her father, may God make him successful.
It's time to act.
Just as your predecessors did, young people like you get married and start families.
Greetings, Sheikh, may your life last long.
How are you?
I know you love standing out.
And that's why I'm doing this.
For the first time, Qatar will host a design from global artist Peter Salmo.
Its formation is independent of the nine planets.
From the solar system
With the ark of Noah, something very beautiful will emerge.
Never throw away what's in us. You'll be the first in Qatar to use all nine planets.
Alright, family.
Her age was fifty thousand and now...
Any solution
May God give you peace.
Please accept my humble offer.
These are expenses and I'm your brother.
In general, I really couldn't manage to arrange all eighty of them.
All I could do was take sixty-two thousand from my brother.
No matter what I do, God, brother Fahd.
Any gathering, Fahad, any gathering? As long as we boast and show off at the wedding, we're in deep trouble.
Without pretensions, without ostentation.
You will surely receive the cards you want.
Inshallah, this week we will start with the cards.
If our wedding is more beautiful than theirs.
Mom, look at the cards that your son is making for the wedding.
Where is my brother living?
People now travel to countries just to get wedding cards.
His family went to Italy, designed and printed the cards, and brought them back to Amineh's house.
Even people who don't have much money go to France, but they go to Lebanon, they go to Lebanon and bring their cards.
After visiting the country, we realized we were breaking the rules.
Why and which country do you want to travel to, God willing?
It means "We've made some really great cards."
It's really expensive, but...
But it's unique, and no one else has done it before us.
The button is not nice.
I say gold shines better.
Brother, it seems he can't afford the wedding expenses.
He tied himself up from the very beginning.
And leave us this nonsense and the noise of the wedding, and the losses that serve no purpose.
And the only ones who benefit from our mental illness are the hotels and wedding halls.
There goes a poor fellow.
Let me go drop him off, it's forbidden, maybe I won't find anyone to take him.
Welcome your connection.
You're not short, Nasser.
Brother, the bride's family should naturally stand by your side.
Even, just once, just once.
Saying that, it's not necessary to have a grand hotel hall.
We found our daughter on the street, and she's not better than her.
This problem is that everyone is looking at everyone else.
And who told you that I got married?
At least some people don't have this kind of bravado.
It's just a simple party and the expenses are within our means.
And then, come on, these days people are holding wedding parties on Facebook.
Cheaper and less expensive
It means you're not married to your country.
Don't forget to show me where.
Return journeys
If I don't manage to arrange a wedding for my son Abdullah Arwish and Nawal.
She might turn out better than me.
I say, my love.
Madam, he has your emergency number, give it to us so we can call you.
Alright, my dear, you didn't do anything wrong, goodbye.
We had agreed here that I would do the DJ, but you've changed your mind.
Am Nasur's mother thinks I'm not as good as she is.
You forgot who she is and who we are.
Those who are below us become better than us.
The matter is not like this, but as you can see, my brother Saleh is breaking my heart, and we don't want to put pressure on him.
It really broke my heart.
Wow!
In the hospital, which hospital?
Suddenly, a tree fell on us.
I heard that saying, "It's raining on us."
He doesn't have a clue, you can't blame him, everything was ready and people were saying they didn't want to attend the wedding.
He wants us to fail.
How are Dr. [Name]?
He's trying to cancel the wedding, he's making us fail, sister.
And God willing, only good things will happen.
Don't break her heart.
Mother, you're the real one who brings the money.
The spirit of the spirit of her heart.
By God, if I say this about Yusuf, it will break his heart.
Do you know why the minister is still keeping Yusuf?
By the way, you should know that he is retired, maybe three or four years ago.
It doesn't hurt, it helps me.
No, by God, you're not sane.
You understood, I'm tired of it now.
And let him keep the papers and statements until you return the money.
This is called a cooling delay payment.
John, why didn't you speak? I don't know why, it means you're afraid.
There's nothing to it, and anyway, I'll eventually return the amount.
Do you know what they call me? Do you know who I am?
The translated
Uncle, uncle, I tried but there's no other way.
I gave you a warning after the review.
And their situation to God is such that the scrutiny does not allow me to do it quickly, quickly.
Count it grain by grain
I have eaten the bean completely.
La la, Inshallah, we will be in the hall from 7:30 so we can receive the guests.
La la, we will never be there.
I will make my son's wedding a topic of conversation for the whole of Doha.
Surprise
Honey, Fatima, I want to talk to you.
I'm worried about you, my son. They will envy you if you confront them like this in the morning, dressed like that.
Here, its length is the beauty of the vest.
The police came to us.
God make it good.
Six policemen, stay here, I'll come to you.
"Al-Hamdu lillahi 'alaik, Ya Saluh" Translation: "I rely on God against you, O Saluh."
Your marriage is dissolved.
A cage for spouses is now a prison cage.
They found the papers I had hidden for the loan, and now they've caught up with me.
And why are you making yourself uncomfortable?
You're hearing about bigger problems than this.
Shenqol is back.
Respectable and dedicated employee
The ministry loves its work. The ministry has contracted a company to do the maintenance.
The employee, out of concern for his work, went to inquire about the materials.
He found it for 40,000 riyals.
It saves the ministry one million and six hundred thousand.
If the minister goes, he will be punished, I can't believe this talk.
Why don't you donate?
This is Saad's number and it's working.
He definitely has all the news.
Fire him from the job.
What's happening in the world where are the values?
Unless he tells you to contact his office manager.
And he said, "Let this one take the place of Uthman."
And after that?
The daughter of the company manager who I am presenting the maintenance offer to.
And what Osman revealed them
La la la, that's not reasonable.
You're all confused, Saleh.
Who owns that company?
Who has it?
That's how we became
What do you say?
This employee, poor Osman, what's he doing now?
His fault is that he is a trustworthy and diligent employee.
The manager is in his office now.
What's his availability?
Heal the world.
We saw strange shapes.
I'm with you, Osman. It's not worth it, but there's nothing we can do.
He has seven children, may God prolong his life, but he doesn't have an ID.
The more he tries, the less he succeeds. Where does he put his head? Where does he go?
Did you see what happened?
The new employee appointed by the minister.
I went to Osman's office and insisted that he take his belongings, but I stopped him. She told him, "Go, and I'll send your belongings with the maid."
Where is he now?
The scales have tipped, O Uthman.
These are the last ones.
"Whatever God wills, will be."
And all praise is due to God.
God is kind, O Uthman. God will never abandon you, Inshallah. Goodbye.
I hope there's no harm in your voice, it doesn't sound normal.
I know, I know you're very sensitive.
I can't keep going, God, I don't have the energy to work anymore, I'm giving up.
And after I visit my mother, I'll go get the things for you.
I don't want you to be like this anymore, it's suffocating.
Why are you screaming at me, my mother?
I am not shouting, I am asking.
You should normally listen to your father's advice regarding traveling with your wife or sister.
The world has changed, where are you living?
How shall I know, mother?
Are you awake?
People have liberated the universe, it has become a small village. Where do you live?
But Shachol
Stay two steps ahead and make the most of your time, don't fall behind.
Descend your desires quickly, God, stop talking, you're just looking. Close it properly.
May there be no harm, O Saleh, what ails you?
You're not yourself today.
Therefore, I screamed at the maid, who had no guilt.
You really don't know that it was forced upon me, God forbid.
La la la, I have no breath.
So I can forget the troubles I've seen.
My love, there is no need to hurry.
Dad is really angry today.
We are delighted, may you live long.
Thank you, thank you, you didn't disappoint.
Working hard, with diligence and perseverance.
Correct, salutations!
The most important thing.
The most important thing for me in this ministry.
Correct, old man.
Tell me, what are the benefits of an honest employee who doesn't take bribes?
What good is it?
That's why I want all of you.
There is no place for us here for the loyal, the principles, and the old values.
If I ever discover
I only blame myself.
We didn't take the wrong path, blame lies with no one.
That's why I want you to cooperate with me.
Even if you doubt.
Notify me immediately.
Thieves and the children of thieves, and our sisters, of course, they don't bear any responsibility.
If Nurah doesn't take a bribe even for one day, she'll be pursued by the government and she'll be going home.
"Mashallah, mashallah, you did a great job. This is what is expected from all of you. I don't want this from you all, but I wish everyone of you could do the same."
May God bless you.
That's why I want you to leave the procurement department and become my office manager.
Frankly, you've chosen the right thief in the right place.
Enough, O Mother of Saud, enough, do not torture me any further.
I didn't take you to jail.
But I will leave it to God; it was Satan who tempted me and made the trust seem attractive to me.
He told me to be careful.
You are a real father to your children.
Act with honesty and loyalty.
You've always lived a life of a thief, comfortable and at ease.
You've become honorable.
Let me talk to my dad.
Bear with me, let me do it again.
One walks in the shadow of his master, he is rich, he is content, he lives at ease.
My father is in prison because all his money is illegal.
Just just
This is the dress you should wear.
We are a respectable family.
It's not a fault of yours.
Where is Tangier?
Why isn't it exposed?
You have neither shame nor modesty.
Shy away from wearing my brother's clothes.
In these days, she feels ashamed.
What's wrong, you're screaming?
Her daughter lost her way.
In a respectable unit, she wears this kind of dress.
Inshallah, you'll be able to walk down the street without anything showing from your body.
I can't make her listen.
Or else I'm not at fault in it.
Oh, she looks great in that transparent clothing, she doesn't need anything else.
Be careful, my legs have been wearing this for days below the knee.
He who is warned is safe.
We come to Allah, if He wills.
Inshallah, but quick and concise.
Look at his father.
As you see before you
Frankly, where can we find something like this?
I don't care what my father thinks, I am black and proud.
And indeed, my honest opinion is that my daughter Sarah is very precious to me, and I am concerned about her future.
Doesn't it mean that they've heard about it?
Thank God, by the grace of God, I heard it was bad.
I enter the house at 3:30 in the night.
Wow, Allah, you enter at 5 a.m.
Aye aye, what's the situation?
Come and take me from the bar.
Start your car's engine and come pick me up from here.
I've never seen a father not listen to his son.
Come on, dad, stop with the movements. Start your car, wait for you.
I love you
I love you to me I'm already gone gone gone
Basically, essentially, my father, my fatherland, is here.
Where is he?
I can't breathe, my father's breath is suffocating me.
Meet my boyfriend Majed.
Abdulaziz doesn't care about that boyfriend he had before.
Welcome, take a chance, a chance for cannabis.
And the Arab and Israeli satellites
I discovered that many Palestinians had never cut their nails.
In accordance with what the State of Palestine has committed to in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement
Generally, the United Nations meets today to consider Israel's request to send special teams to inspect the fingers of the Palestinian people.
If their nails are long or not.
There was a condition that nothing in Palestine should be irritating, painful, or causing blood to flow.
The state of Palestine
I invite the entire international community to visit Palestine.
Comprehensive Peace Agreement
We make them from cork.
And the zonates, man.
We press the olives this way, this way we press the olives.
We, along with our Arab brothers, demand from the international community
Conducting inspection teams on Palestinian nails.
And now let's begin the voting.
La la la, you've reached that level?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Salih Saleh, what's wrong with you?
I dreamed yesterday.
I dreamed of the upside-down world.
O Rashid, your personality must be strong.
Now, brother, what's the number of the school I'm attending tomorrow?
I am like you, a teacher.
Why didn't I change my school since I started teaching?
Any character, bro.
But the problem is that his character is weak.
By the way, the teachers with him are the ones who objected to it most.
To that extent, brother.
We're not seeing him silent.
Afterwards, he explained.
You don't actually need mayo with this.
Bro, we're not saying this to make you upset.
We're telling you this because this is your last chance.
He told me I accepted Rashid even though his personality is weak.
And trembling and overly kind.
No matter if he is a native of this country.
Why are you silent now, brother?
So that what you're saying is all true.
Your words are all correct.
I will hate
Professor Rashid Al-Yadid
Professor Rashid
May God bless your tongue.
Forget it already.
And whoever repents
What kind of justice is this, then?
Here is
I am a teacher who does not like mistakes.
You must repeat what the boy told you, just as he said it in elementary school, and the inspector is sitting there.
Take your bag.
Slowly, slowly, I broke the door.
One learns from their mistakes.
From the first minute
Here is
I am nervous.
How am I?
Shut up, Zen.
Jannah said, "Be quiet, well done."
I heard you.
His teacher, Rashid, kicked me out.
She said, "Oh, that's fine, but I can't look at you here in class."
Professor, I don't know who this child is.
Born of
There is a teacher named Rashid coming.
Here's the translation: "Here, we passed by you."
It's a problem, teacher, if he says what his father said.
So, you usually seize opportunities, right? Where do you see him taking advantage? He's sitting there.
You can get it towards the chairs sitting.
Above the chairs
The translation of
In the end, Adam is just a human being.
But you shouted at me.
Play around and have some fun with me
My father is traveling and will be back next week, so if he comes back, I'll tell him.
La la la, Abdulrahman, and whoever delivers you.
We are a quarter, the strawberry ice cream is very delicious, you might not have tried it yet, it's really great.
Come on, go get it as fast as you can.
All he's afraid of is telling his father the truth.
You said his father was traveling yesterday.
Any female traveler who does not want her father's permission, her father means that they have taken away the straw, they told her to travel.
God forbid, but God helps.
Take his bag, bring it to him, and give him your phone number. If he needs anything, call me; I'm his friend.
Just so.
Just what?
You're the ones who told me.
Shout and believe in your strength.
Bathroom bathroom bathroom
O Rashid
Sleep, sleep, sleep, there's no need for you to sleep.
The teacher is Nasser, Nasser is in the bathroom.
One juice and
Come, come, come, come, give me.
God speed!
Put them on the table.
All people are equal.
That's why I've gathered you all to hear your ideas for the party.
No one guarantees children.
"Baal Jan Sweety laanaa muqablat, yeh woh connect ho raha hai."
Three o'clock
He's joking, you know.
Faster, faster
Peace be upon you
Stand up for the inspector, sit down.
Yes, command.
Come here, teacher, come here, teacher.
I've made him angry.
I wasn't mocking you, man, I was just asking if you're done speaking.
I finished it or not, where is the teacher's fear? You are shaking your own self, you are humiliating the teaching profession.
Zen zen halal halal
Raise your voice even more.
If I raise my voice, the first thing I know is that this boy is a son of...
Faster, faster
Just two cars.
La la Arabic words, I want four four five cars, God make it wide, wide go go go.
To be the owner of this neighborhood
Abu Nasser used to do this and not do that.
May God make it easy for him.
I am the manager here.
Bonasir is not widely known.
He was giving all the teachers extra lessons.
But me
I am the manager here.
You are the manager, God keep you. What's the matter with you?
Descend your train.
Put it on your head in the chair, brother.
What does "شش" mean?
There's no need, God, honestly, I really want to make you comfortable.
What's his name?
You're the last one here now.
Respect yourself, it's better for you. You'll take additional lessons whether you like it or not. You've agreed, or else it's up to you.
Later, I'll be with you. Get up, get up, get out.
Hopefully, we'll get out soon, Allah willing.
How are you, we said to you, son of men.
We need to stop him in his tracks.
Guys, hold on a moment.
Don't blame us, Abu Salmin.
O Bonayef, you are the leader of the neighborhood, and you must set boundaries.
I am not my father's son.
I am showing you myself in it.
Faster, faster
Goodbye, may you live long.
Inshallah, when will I be able to drive this new car?
You're the one who didn't believe me.
His beard and face have turned red.
I believed him when he said it would be a difficult day, but I only knew for sure when I heard his voice.
You know that I will come next week.
He is responsible for eight co-educational schools.
The magical story tells you the secret that was lifted from the depths.
I told you this from the very first day.
And as I explain what I hear, there is no sound.
And we do not know
Respect yourself.
After you reply, come to me; then we'll go out, hurry up, hurry up!
As soon as your appointment as a minister is announced, I'll look for a nice job for you.
Come on, really? Don't tell me to go take this job.
He doesn't care about so-and-so, give me some options for jobs, and I'll choose the most suitable one.
My brother, the minister.
By God, I haven't rested from the calls I've been getting.
Machallah, everyone is congratulating.
They say, "O God, guide her."
This is a normal job; every minister comes in and automatically takes care of their team and associates.
In this regard, don't worry, I won't let you die with this.
We obviously know that I'll become a minister.
Paint the floor.
Good things come to those who wait.
The return land
Alright, everyone has gone to congratulate the new minister.
God willing, God willing, God willing.
Congratulations to the minister on his efforts.
Blessed, may your age be long, congratulations.
Congratulations on the minister's clock, it deserves it.
You deserve it, Minister.
Oh brothers, responsibility is great. May Allah enable us, if He wills, to bear it.
As they say, the choice hit the nail on the head.
I just noticed that you've missed a call from Bouzid, shall I call him back for you?
He was a bit far from him.
You don't have to worry about it.
What kind of love did he receive all at once?
It is not easy to be a leader.
Sure, here is the translation: "I did open the car door for him."
Well done, you didn't disappoint.
We're waiting for our brother to become a minister.
I told you, mother, that you didn't believe me.
You say to me, "Talk to me about coffee, talk to me about coffee."
After she died, she said it was me who fought her.
God forbid, God forbid.
Whatever you have to say, you have nothing.
Mom, let's go, I'm about to explode.
What do you mean by "no one has a monopoly"?
Relax, you.
I just gave them a piece of my mind because they annoyed me.
They're right.
I just didn't want to say that in front of my mom, you know? She'd embarrass us.
Publish anything you hear, they call it 'gossip'. We don't want a scandal.
They will replace you with something better if they take you away.
Because I asked.
And if you are chosen, you will be the first one selected.
So, what's even the point, they're going to remove it anyway.
I'm not sure about this.
I can't believe how you're dressed, it's just like I see you now.
You're enchanting him.
But the plan in my head is solid and effective.
His plan is to burn and destroy.
Make him ban all activities that take place in the country.
That hour is burning, and whether it's the fire or the smoke that comes first, once the smoke comes, the burden is lifted.
And God, brother, I don't know how to tell you.
Your spirit, called "participation," reflects the depth of your love for the country.
It means "So you're seeing it like this."
You are a man of the state today, you must be in the picture.
I need to contribute to everything. Forgiveness is a long-lasting virtue, forgiveness, forgiveness.
Before I forget, thank you for the lamb you sent me yesterday.
Long live him, he's a simple sheep, not in your league. Go with me today, will you?
The real awaits you outside.
You know, the truth is...
I don't want to go.
I am tired of flirting.
You adjusted your statement today, as a minister of justice, and just as you said, you are a social personality who has lived a long life.
God has made this good person a mockery of you.
Take, give, take.
I do not imagine myself
Ahh ahh
Today I took him out for dinner and a wedding, if it doesn't work out, it will be with a picture.
I'll get you a nice task, I want you to do this.
I heard that I've arranged a very nice educational activity for you.
What makes it shine, I want it to sparkle, sparkle, sparkle until it's polished, I'm looking for this shine.
The shopkeeper, thank you, congratulations, congratulations, blessed bicycle, may God bless you, picture, picture, the minister gave a picture, I, no, I, do not distance myself, give him.
This cycle
Congratulations on the opening, God willing. May his efforts be blessed.
Picture picture, she's so fat, so fat, the whole of your life.
Nothing, may God bless you.
Go to page 2.
No, he doesn't know.
National participation
Remember God.
This is the fourth friend of mine who has called me today.
Everyone praises your activities, Khalid. You are indeed an active social activist.
Yesterday, I heard a word that hurt me.
Yesterday's party that Sultan took me to.
The celebration of the young swimmers' victory
One is telling the truth to his friend.
They think I don't hear them.
He says the minister
I want to buy a birthday gift for my sister's son.
Hello, hello
I will read the newspaper every day, dad.
Absolutely correct
This is difficult, but here is a possible translation: "This is easy, come sit with me, there is much light. Papa, you are old, let me do it, papa."
I hope you pay, because if you don't, there's no problem.
This phrase translates to: "This doesn't make any sense, your minister won't understand or blame you for this."
I am the Minister Bousalah.
My sultan didn't come to take me where I need to go, I'm waiting for him.
He sits me in the first row and goes to his car to rest.
I don't want anything from him, it's God who guides you.
Come on, you stupid woman, may God have mercy on your parents, listen to me, I'll talk to you later to make sure.
And from yourself, you became connected.
People are offering us discounts.
I'm telling you.
The job is really cool.
He came back, this is what he did to me.
The minister's efforts are in vain, God help him.
Hello, hello, the minister's time.
No, I'm a bit tired today.
Alright, if you have that enthusiasm, go ahead.
Don't worry, my brother Saad will take care of you and he'll find a nice party for you, Inshallah.
A lot of parties
Today, we have no plans.
No, there's nothing.
Where did the family get separated?
Thank you, thank you.
I say, there's no one to ask.
May God guide you.
I'll tell you to rest and relax.
Moment of happiness
Inshallah, we will do anything.
How beautiful!
And later, at some point.
It's just a thin layer in the compartment and just a hollow space with a camera inside, and let it take a picture of his face with just a few shots.
By God, it's beautiful, God grant you safe travel.
You humiliated him.
I have a match in the reserve league, I hope I can go to the field.
This minister has decided for us.
Sweet means reaching the peak.
The end is near, if this is what people are saying.
May I live to be as famous as you are now.
May I suggest you go somewhere and take some advice with you?
Long-lived one
His star shines bright.
We turn it off by restoring its normal size.
The minister arrived, the minister arrived, the minister arrived.
I can't imagine, I can't imagine, God, if one of you took my picture, it wouldn't bring you down, I'm not that important.
Brook broke your camera, it can't take pictures.
I greeted you a lot.
As they say, I've missed the train.
This is my brother's eternity.
There is no strength or power but by God.
Why like this?
This is the first time I've heard it.
The first time you see him
I heard it for the first time after many years.
Wahay
This is my meditation.
It's been a while since I've seen you, come on, my love, come here.
What can we do to get used to it?
Ah, there is no strength but by God. You're back to the same old thing.
Get out, I'll tell you to get out and stop blowing my mind. I'm going back from the wedding at 3 in the morning.
Just let me rest, this isn't a big deal.
Your brother has sons.
By God, I must say the truth about what my father did to you; you've become like his son.
It means "He was playing and playing."
No matter what he was playing, I would tell him to put away his makeup kit.
But this Saudi, I don't know what to do with him.
Khulood returned and I wish all kids were like him.
On these advertisements and nonsense that he puts out for his brother.
Come on, my loves, come greet me.
Hey my loves, how are you?
I'm not going to Spain this summer.
Whom do you need?
Fennec Foxes from Kuwait
Hi Hamada
Listen to me, I tell you.
There is no strength or power but by Allah, the Most High, the Great.
I'll let my love choose.
Just honestly, how do you feel?
I say that the one by the sea is more beautiful.
In the near future, we will buy a yacht to sail from our home to the sea directly.
Us and our children
Come on, set a wedding date already.
It's been a whole year and a bit.
Instead of saying "بل شنو هذ
I honestly notice that my brother Khalid, I don't know how.
But it's completely different from your brother Saad.
He's changed or he hasn't, it doesn't matter. He's free to act as he pleases.
Later, your boyfriend is backward; he doesn't know that there are unisex perfumes.
I say let your fiancé keep his opinions for himself.
I don't care.
Khaled didn't believe it.
You don't just use perfumes like women do.
You even use their colors.
Why are you doing this, Khalid?
Oh, you're right, you don't have a clue.
Mom, why don't you want to see anything? You don't notice his movements and actions.
This time, perfumes for both.
You heard me, be careful.
Have you seen Bluetooth?
I hear that they are talking in the streets about its spread in Doha.
I heard about it from Rauna.
You'll see later, then I'll tell you.
Oh, how these holes dance.
Blah blah blah blah, the atmosphere of movement.
These girls with hollow hearts, it's them you're talking about who dance properly and do moves you know, this one, she's Khulood, she's Mohammed's cousin.
The dog is my uncle's nephew's wealth.
But here, I'll show you.
Look at my brother Saad coming.
Why let me and I'll show you, let me send it to you via Bluetooth so you can see it.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, Hello, hello.
Defeated for sure.
The distant cousin with the hollow stare is sitting alone.
I'm not saying anything, but I'll tell you that your Bluetooth is open.
I won't send you anything.
Thank you, Sheikh.
Be quiet, I'm thinking.
Are you intending, Saad?
And the traveler will be tomorrow.
I won't see them again in the country.
Where are your manners? Where are your manners?
What do people say?
They say their son is a disgrace and he has traveled, you want to do us a disgrace.
Wow!
What I've done is a source of pride and honor for my son.
The real shape of his age is not a disgrace.
Who told you that this is my sister's husband?
Say he traveled to get treated, to study, to work, to commit suicide, or anything.
The important thing is that I live in a place where the scandal chases me every day.
Where are you going back to?
Go to hell.
This is the final outcome.
That's what we don't know where to look for and this is how he puts his bag to travel.
Even we don't know where he wants to go.
What do you expect to happen?
What are you doing now? I came to see you to ease my pain, because what you said hurt my heart.
I was telling you to take care of him.
Do not leave it to the servants.
You didn't know about it, nor were you aware.
My father is absent-minded and he's preoccupied with his work, leaving the responsibility to you.
You are absolutely right, my dear.
There's no hope because of your sister.
You're right about this.
The only thing that separates us from eternity is that we all belong to the world among people.
I can't see anyone.
Did you tell him something?
This is my father's greatest mistake.
We're in the fucked-up, weird case of Khulud.
I didn't tell him.
Put it on a CD and give it to him.
And I'm on my way to the airport.
I'm afraid it's too much.
Our house needs to get to this level or else.
Do not be surprised.
The eternity and its forms were not accused by the reputation of their families.
They heard from their brothers and sisters.
Whatever religious values call them
They go to dance and celebrate.
In the pit of his evil.
You and God, father, confuse me.
Goodbye, dad.
Take care of yourself, dad.
I have a small gift for you, dad.
It's a gift for me.
Now I have the CD in my laptop, I'm afraid of what's going to happen. I'm going to walk with it.
God help me
It's reasonable, Mom, my dad is still listening to the CD; it's only three minutes long.
It can be revealed/shown
Where will he go and how will he be able to leave?
Answer me, what's wrong, Abu Saad?
Dad
Sorry, Amal.
And if I search a lot, I'll get tired.
To find someone with integrity like you.
But forgive me.
God bless you.
I say, you've come out onto the roof.
My love
We are in an era of freedoms.
In the age of human rights, we have no limits.
Whoever has a shekel takes a thousand by the eye.
Of course, this phrase translates to: "Of course, God will make America my beloved."
The horse is gentle in its stride.
I understand and accept the two conditions.
"I rely on God at you, and you are the one who stopped with Adryol. I asked him, 'How much is your salary?'"
Mama, I'm bored. I have a lot of free time.
My father keeps complaining about his salary, but it's no use. They're fed up with him, they've taken his license and added more responsibilities. What's next?
Tell him I'll increase your salary when you complete your year.
He seems greedy and is messing us up.
Just stop it, just stop. You're being obnoxious, just shut up, leave him alone, and let us have peace.
It's easy for you, this word, it's easy.
It means: "You're going to make me get in the car with him, even though I hate it."
Leave it be.
You said the whole story to me now, I'm the head of the house, I insist on keeping quiet. You're the one who was talking, now you've kept quiet, so let the one who's spending do it.
Go, I need to go out.
Come, stop.
What did you say?
He says, "What did they show you in their migration?" He says, "Or what did they say?"
Father, this one has no companion, he is a relative of mine, he is my brother's father, he is my uncle.
I will be there in five minutes, God willing.
Five minutes
Keep it inside your beautiful mind.
You don't deserve an increase in your airfare every time someone says so.
Everything within the realm of the weak is precious.
After a few months, eight hundred will be given.
Papa, I am in a lot of trouble in the country.
This driver is inside a box in a hushed and tranquil environment.
In a breeze, one can see thirty doors, more than the thousand doors of Papa.
Be patient, I will think about it.
Look, I've said it before and I'll say it again, I've had enough. That's it, I'm done talking.
You are what you say and do; act with integrity and excellence in your work.
The tra
I can't translate "انا
There's no use trying.
Two hundred miles is no distance.
Shashi, I am afraid.
Not like Kov
Very kind of you to say.
It is hoped that he will return with three thousand four hundred.
Snow is a problem inside the house, no use outside, just spend his money.
I am very afraid.
The wool of this is very soft.
How much in?
Five hundred
In fear of this law, I come to you, I go to prison.
There's nothing to it.
I am your companion.
I'll tell you, I'll wear my best dress.
I vote for someone who answers me.
His room is a prison, except for the empty silence.
Her servants have aged a year.
I can only say, "Al-lahi 'ala hu" (God is sufficient for me).
Alright, I'll come see you.
I went to the police to report.
Since you have informed, you are no longer responsible.
We will not fall short, Allah willing.
And after you look around the alley from there, maybe you'll see him. Let us know.
He's always short on money, but when he has enough, he surrenders.
I spend a lot of money on them, I buy them clothes, I feed them, I train their car.
It's up to him.
The match starts now, step by step in the best way.
Yes, we were afraid to tell you.
These are the fox teams, and the foxes don't get tired.
Do you know if we scored more than three with their meaning, we didn't win, we need ten fifteen.
Obvious mockery, obvious mockery, let's be honest, obvious mockery.
This level, if it brings more than three goals, then the team of foxes will win this match.
I'll tell you, take them.
In the soul, in the game, and in the performance.
He has nothing to be grateful for if they see their parents or even less than three years old, they will be grateful to God.
Our team's slogans so far have been suffering. This is the team of foxes, get away from us, son.
You scored an easy goal, you're relaxed now.
I expect more words later, or is it over? I've already reached the end.
This is a valuable tool that enhances this, this is in your mind, from me, from me, there is no generosity, you are in the role of capital, this is a tool to eat chicken.
La la, there's no car.
You are a friend to me.
What he says is intriguing.
He tells you this is a very tricky fox.
You are in the best of health.
Yes, sir.
You don't know, or what?
This is the tricky part of the tale of the cunning fox.
He spends hours on a chat show.
You will be defeated today.
By God, you are a formidable team, there is no defeat at all, you are the undisputed champion.
The hyena will say about the result today.
What does he think of this as a result?
The result of this class is in the foxes.
This theory is coming to take away his livelihood, whatever he does.
Let's be realistic, right? God, don't tell me the foxes won and flew away.
These are Papa's foxes.
This is a fox taking a chicken to eat.
Oh, may your age be long, what he's doing here on the stands, I've never seen anything like it.
The audience is killing themselves with laughter.
Zahir is inside your clothes and your wealth is his.
A true fan means someone with genuine loyalty to the club.
This is with the big Qataris who go to malls and all that stuff.
The love for coffee has compelled me to cappuccino.
See the world, brother.
The first thing he did was to pay 5 riyals in front of my eyes and settle the bill.
Hear the poem I wrote about our match against the frogs.
The safety of the Arab tribe is present.
You are in a frog.
You can't lead a team if you don't even know what you're doing.
Go go the club and the team, see what's happening.
There is no saying.
One day a fox was expelled.
What's the reason for this and why have you given up?
Slowly and steadily win the race.
I made this game name from how we do things.
Peace, peace, peace, the four tribes of Hazreens.
Every month, we meet to choose the perfect fan.
Machallah and from those chosen this month, Inshallah for the award.
The members of the association's board are the ones who make the most important decisions.
Hello, and each of you is as big as a camel.
I am a fox running this big club.
The tribe, the tribe that left us, they put him on TV. Tribe.
Now this is it
This one is just right, that one is off.
If he doesn't have a pen, he'll say "I wish I had one."
Now I know how to get to him.
Oh God, let the audience come out.
Roll it up
He is from me.
He is hasty.
We lost it now, it's fine.
Sweet
Shut up, it's decided, I'm the head of the house, I decide.
We dispel doubt with certainty.
Majed Abdulrahman Al-Sabiqi
Name, name, name Allah. Allah sleeps on this wealth, you are the most generous.
I am from the city of Sabj.
Buy a record in my name, Name Lalala doesn't want to live in Andy's house.
I just want to make an investment.
God's grace is above all your generosity, may God keep you safe.
Order the beauty what do you want.
There is nothing but praise for Allah, may He bless you and grant you kindness.
Come, ladies, let's have some coffee.
God keep you. You have no business here, you don't command anything. May God bless you.
Tell me, are you sure this is the right way? I want to fail with the cabaret.
God forbid
Mother, mother, I am a mother.
Now, what's your father going to do to us? Who knows?
I didn't mean it, Mom.
Please, mom, don't say anything about my father.
Your father is turning the house upside down.
He's definitely going to kill you now.
Oh my God, I'm not breaking it with work.
Why don't we go get some glue and stick them together?
She sticks her tongue out at him.
Where can we find anything like it? I don't know, where did my uncle get it from? He brought it as a gift.
God, I'm worried about you because of him.
Mom, I'm afraid dad will beat me.
Lock the door until I find a solution to this issue.
Go quickly, go to your room.
My uncle, my uncle, my uncle, you are my uncle.
My uncle broke the vase, uncle.
Mother, give birth to our child.
No, mom, nothing's happening to you.
I ran away from home, my mother is worried about my father.
This is forbidden, mother. Fear God in your child.
Oh mother, this is not upbringing, God guide you.
What should I do now, mom?
I don't know how to act.
I don't know, but I'm afraid for him on the street with the cars.
God will protect him, Inshallah. I say, maybe he will go to the shop or to his neighbor's house to play with the children.
Oh, my dear son, you are the most beautiful and sweet, and you are loved, oh mother.
La la, mother, seek refuge in Allah and do not doubt that only good will happen, Allah willing.
By God, mother, goodbye.
Where is my son?
My father is beating me.
My father is killing me with his behavior.
Do not fear, my eye's view.
Don't be afraid, my love.
I won't let him lay a hand on you.
Against my will, I broke.
Come on, dad, come sit and have a drink, have some tea, and relax in my room.
Your skin is turning yellow.
God will fix him, but God will fix him. Come, Mom, come.
God willing, O generous one.
I'm afraid my father will come here.
Just don't worry, dad.
No one interferes in the upbringing of my son.
This is my son and I raise him the way I see fit.
But the boy shudders, terrified by something that isn't him. Please, embrace your father.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
Open it
The bag accidentally knocked over the vase. Believe me, he didn't mean to.
You need to defend him.
You shouldn't say anything to him for my sake, I'll forgive him this time. The boy is heart-breakingly afraid.
But where is he now? Where is he sitting at this time?
It's not here with us.
Where is it located?
Take a shower in Qom.
La la Bodhiha has the right to her inheritance today.
Sure, here is the translation: "So Jan has only the primary one."
Come on, let's take a picture, brother, we need to play.
They said that you are studying.
Come on, let's just finish this game and then we'll study.
Why don't you have an exam tomorrow?
The translation
Alright, dad, don't mess this up for us.
Come on, dad, we've had enough, let's stop this. We'll study later, let's just go now.
How dare you utter such nonsense?
If you do, you'll see that I'll be in touch with you soon.
Lalala don't say anything about my uncle, don't say anything about my uncle.
I don't owe you anything.
Tell him not to listen to the words.
Go on, everyone, take your books and study.
Alright, dad, put your phone away, let's study, alright? Don't tell Uncle.
By God, I'm so confused, I don't know how to act.
I fear if he finds out, he'll give us trouble.
Of course, here is the translation: "I'm sure you'll ask me how his condition is at the hospital."
So what's the problem that you're telling him about?
If he knows that Walid is infected with Ebola, he will kill him.
Oh, mother, it's all his fault.
Oh, mom, this is in a psychological area.
The boy is not small anymore; he is twelve years old.
Don't worry, mom.
We're having tea at our place, mom. I'll just tell him.
And Bajov bought a share.
Her mother is going to Bahrain to buy an abaya.
Mother, a journey and a need.
And it's enjoyable and worth buying.
He says every night, "Ibol is in his bed."
I wake up every night in my bed and you never tell me what's going on.
He said I need to take him to the hospital so they can treat him.
Her train of thought has no connection to the topic.
They understand nothing.
His words are correct.
Mom, he needs to go to the hospital to find out what's wrong.
Wadior has a dry mouth, just right.
He waited until the last one in the alley heard the screams.
Sit down
Eat, my mother, eat.
I don't have anything to say.
I'll do a quick wash and I'll bring you your clothes right away.
Please do as I ask.
It is necessary to respect their manners.
Do not interfere, you.
This is what you call success.
And eternity is forty-nine of fifty.
This is success.
But their signs are just decorations.
Saying to them, "Woe to you, if you do not wake up fifty times out of fifty."
Please don't take them to your brother.
They need to be disciplined.
These are my children
"That's it, God, my uncle, that's the last time."
Why don't you bring fifty from fifty, fifty from fifty?
Increase it alone
I tell him not to go with us to public places.
Yesterday we went to the hospital, they admitted him, but they told him not to come back as he doesn't have a right to.
You're coming along, not leaving with us.
But when I call my brothers...
"My uncle is dying, for real, he's dying for real, for real, for real, my uncle is dying for the last time."
Let's start, God willing.
Be careful, this isn't the weather you'll see at the end of the year. If one of you doesn't get fifty, you'll be in for a surprise.
The roughness of the swimming pool
And fear turns into oil.
Where is your diploma? Where is your diploma?
They told us, "Tomorrow."
Khaled Abdulrahman
Well done, Khalid.
Faisal Abdullah Rashid
Excellent, Faisal!
God bless you
Machallah, you're smart. You're second in the class.
The teacher is yelling because he got 49 out of 50 in the test.
The teacher is afraid of his father because his father wants him to fail in every way.
I am not talking to you, Japanese person.
Call, call the person who is with him in class.
He says he saw her at the school gate.
Call, contact your program, maybe your grandmother is at home.
No, I won't go there.
Where did this go, where did it go?
There is no strength or power but by God.
What the hell happened, bro?
Oh family, of course I'm failing and afraid of him.
May God guide you to the superior child who comes second in the class.
He's just afraid to go home.
Because he's two grades behind in math.
May God have mercy on him.
Walid Walid
Walid Walid
Come, Walid.
Eighty-four ninety-four minus two degrees is not equal to what you say, it's not even close.
Peace be upon you and the mercy and blessings of God.
Nuclear energy
It accounts for 60% of the world's oil reserves.
And the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia leads the global reserve with a rate of twenty-four percent.
Then Libya, the United States, and Nigeria.
Three hundred percent for each of them, then the rest of the world combined at fifteen percent.
and therefore
Similarly from production
And perhaps this is one of the secrets and reasons behind the competition for this region and its countries from the major industrial nations.
And at the top is the United States, the world's largest consumer of petroleum energy.
However, oil prices are on a continuous rise.
And simultaneous with a drop in the dollar's value against the US dollar.
The price of oil as a unit of measurement.
Where the barrel price reached yesterday.
This has led to an increase in the revenues of producing countries, and at the same time
to increase its inflation
Where inflation in some of those countries has reached fifteen percent.
The most important source of energy in the world
In the prices of life and goods.
That was in a live interview with the Deputy Prime Minister.
Qatari Minister of Energy and Industry
Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiya
And for our viewers who wish to participate, they can contact us on the program's numbers and phones.
The deputy's office hours: Hello there.
I'd like to start with the unprecedented prices oil has reached.
Where can prices go?
Of course, where prices can go is a puzzling question.
Or what is commonly known as market force.
Not OPEC
and not the producing states
And neither the producing countries nor OPEC have any say in oil pricing.
Is it just the relationship between price and supply and demand?
And not now, even if the offer and demand are not greatly affected.
What are the factors if...
Other factors besides supply and demand.
For investors.
They felt immense pressure and turned to oil, gold, or what is known as commodity marketing.
Investors have lost confidence in stock markets.
And gold as well
We have seen gold prices rise from $350 in recent years to $1,797 now.
As of today, it's still around ninety-one dollars, as I mentioned.
But they are all in excess, and if there is a slight decrease
Let me remind you that in the first quarter of this year
The second quarter, as expected, should see a drop in prices due to a decrease in demand for oil.
But we saw the market in a thrilling and strangely volatile state.
In the second quarter and at the beginning of spring, it rises above $100.
But that means the previous factors that determined price increases in relation to winter and consumption have changed now, and there are other factors.
And economic growth
At the same time, we see that oil prices are rising to this extent.
I spoke about political factors and said that political tensions play a role in this.
Do you expect Falon's resignation in light of the political complexities regarding Iran?
Its owner, and today it topped most of the American and global newspapers' headlines, could affect oil prices.
Buy 2 get 1 free today.
Today, we are in the era of globalization, and influence comes quickly.
Non-real factors can affect
And they create some kind of disturbance in the market.
Also created some political rumors.
He said there is no plan, but he did not deny that other options could also be pursued regarding Iran.
The stoic always interacts with the markets.
Of course, it is not certain now that the United States is at war with Iran.
And I am one of the people who, despite not believing in this scenario, still sees it.
Valon will be, and perhaps there will be things we haven't seen. What will it be like in the future?
But we are the ones working in the sector of the tyrant.
We see that all these political tensions...
In the world's oil supplies
And conversely, there are very comfortable amenities.
What does it indicate when there is oil going to storage?
There is never any shortage of oil supplies.
Perhaps preparation for the upcoming war.
Under this reassuring picture you speak of supply and that there are no obstacles to supply.
If U.S. President Bush and the United States decide to implement their plan.
This is something else.
Prices rise to record levels.
Oil prices could reach
Oil reserves in the world
You are here, this here, for today, the Gulf represents the most important.
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and other Gulf countries.
They represent more than 60% of the world's oil reserves, so it's no wonder.
You are today
If a very minor incident occurs.
Therefore, it indicates
That means that in the event of a war with Iran, it is impossible to guarantee how high oil prices will go.
God knows, and perhaps we will arrive today, while we have reached.
Wars from $170 to $110, and it might jump to $120, God knows.
Today, oil, as I told you, lives under psychological and political tensions.
And the tensions between the protesters escalated.
Just an oil investor.
He's not really an investor, of course. True investment is future purchasing or leasehold marketing.
It is called oil paper.
And all of these are fights on paper towels.
All its production is approximately 300,000 barrels or less.
These may drive further purchases, and thus further increases.
I hope April's fool is a lie.
I hope there isn't
Jenny is coming to the region and it is said that this is on his main agenda.
My gel is the owner of this project, as many politicians and media personalities have said.
I didn't know what was in Jilly's bag.
I cannot predict what it will mean.
Will it ignite a war?
America is in a transitional phase.
And why doesn't the son do something else?
Let's see what happens if we talk about April; April is just a few weeks away, and we'll be in April soon.
And the world may pay
And America is a major consumer nation.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the tough number.
You can't throw this number away.
Its production costs are low.
Comparison to West African countries, most of which are dependent
The Gulf cannot be compared to any other country in the world.
We have heard this talk from the West and the United States for many years.
Help is greatly appreciated.
To its end, and the Caspian Sea War remembers the story...
Whatever these dreams may be
When you sit with relatives in a closed circle
You hear them speaking in a different way.
What do they say?
About supplies, the importance of the region, and the importance of precautions.
When I asked one of the European officials, I said, "It's strange that you speak among us in closed rooms during the Hajj."
In a way different from how you speak in front of
The media said no, for political reasons.
And of course, there's what's called standard defecation or, more accurately, two-time defecation.
The silence that everyone knows is the role of the Gulf countries.
Today, Qatar, for example, is as important as Saudi Arabia.
The largest producer and supplier of oil in the world.
and entering into
Despite all this
Leader of the central square
Declare war on Iran.
Even through an aerial war or an aerial strike, as they say.
In the supplies
You're not late, you're actually early.
I don't agree with you, we're not in the same page.
We do not interact with Westerners.
With America, we deal.
Where are the good prices?
Regardless of this market's nationality
"نظع" means "non-renewable energy" in English.
For the sake of (generosity)
Arab generosity
Please give me it.
Observers say the true price of oil is...
And the reason for the rise in oil prices.
You are the Gulfis, OPEC and the countries.
You are very generous with Americans, insisting on using their currency.
You said that the price of oil should be seventy dollars.
The real price against the dollar's drop is sixty to seventy.
Okay, now the price is 100.
90% because the dollar has fallen by 35%
And now over one hundred dollars.
If we take into account the ratio and proportion
No one denies that.
One of the main reasons for
Compared to the dollar's decline.
If we took, we took
If we take this comparison
If oil prices
Because the United States of America
Of course, it's in our interest right now for the dollar to decrease.
Weakness or stagnation in the American economy is something the United States cannot afford.
So, what happened in this period of economic weakness and stagnation?
You too have become
The United States maintains the 1% interest rate on the dollar.
Why do you insist on linking the price of oil to the dollar?
Let's talk about why the price of oil is linked to the dollar.
The first one over 100 years old.
The first barrel of oil exported was from the United States of America.
And is priced in dollars
And it has been since the beginning of the 20th century to today.
Dollarization - Pricing oil in dollars.
Historically, it has become
And for a hundred years, the whole world has been learning, interacting, and evolving.
And Norway, which today is considered the third-largest oil-producing country.
And its source of oil.
Russia is the second-largest oil-producing country.
And the production of the North Sea field in Europe
It is priced in dollars, not in...
Everything is changing in the world; there are other sources and information pointing to something else besides this.
You are the Gulf States.
There are secret agreements between you and the Americans.
And oil became the true cover.
Is it true that this is the case and there is no other?
And that these agreements
It rests on oil being the cover for the dollar, in exchange for the United States protecting these systems.
This is not correct and there are no secret agreements.
Today, let's take OPEC's organization.
You have 66% support for the deputy.
From twelve countries
From the fifty-eight, eighty percent of OPEC's quota.
There are many and very large countries in oil production.
Outside of OPEC
What are the barriers that prevent pricing from working in another way?
See, because the price is making me do others.
Not all adults decide the same way.
You are Saudi and from the Gulf countries.
Today is the OPEC meeting as a whole.
There are sixty percent
Even if hypothetically OPEC wanted that.
There should be an agreement among all oil-exporting nations to
Is there a trend or intention to change?
The attempt failed.
But now, these countries are not able to change the pricing currency.
Unless there is an agreement between
What is the effect of frequency?
Let me mean, if I speak now, it's about the Europeans.
Why don't they release their oils?
From the North Sea or Russia and Norway in euros or rubles
Because it is in their interest to keep their currency expensive, high, and elevated.
On the contrary, not on the contrary.
Here is their loss.
One euro buys half a barrel.
You're the ones who are losing out, because your currency has depreciated as it's linked to the dollar.
And it is also losing a very big loss.
The connection of these currencies to the Gulf is a historical one.
In the 1970s, the dollar was the strongest currency in the world.
And now you're connected when you speak of disengagement.
This is like marriage when you get married.
And when you bring up divorce, divorce is not that simple.
No here
Or else you're playing a casual game with the dollar.
And the costs must be studied in a way
Study professionally and study by
Kuwait also converted 25% of its currency into dollars.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Qatar
They may adjust their exchange rate.
The phrase you provided translates to: "We're avoiding the topic, but that means you have no intention of studying or thinking about it."
The study obviously differs, Prime Minister stated.
The Qatari rial is undervalued by two percent, according to the World Bank.
To enter as part of this study
There is no clear direction; you are alone in this topic.
Why doesn't Kuwait take the next step?
Economists say that it is more profitable for countries and their people than the loss.
But us
And nothing else.
These four Gulf States declare
Everyone means a believer.
And I, personally, am one of his supporters.
You will support her.
You must be part of this study.
In itself
What was created from what was created, one or two states.
Until the time comes to work.
You won't jump out of the situation.
Of course, a suitable translation in English would be: "This will, of course, be studied by specialists."
And they will be the owners.
They are not specialists; this requires political will.
Let's wait and not rush now, let's see what happens today.
"بدات الناس" translates to "People have started" in English.
Of course, in a collusive situation.
The deputy's efforts mean that the inflation rate in Qatar for 2007 reached 14% and will increase to 15% in the coming year.
It eats people's salaries and devours people's salaries. Here are the salaries of the workers here.
People living in Qatar have seen their salaries eroded by 35% to 40%.
We will be back to you shortly to know the extent of the increases that will be made in salaries.
Staff in Qatar, at least for the near future, stay with us.
Welcome back, without boundaries, to this episode where we host the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy.
And Qatari industry Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiya discusses the huge price increases.
The oil, which generated tens of billions of dollars in revenue for the Gulf countries and producing nations.
About oil, and my question was regarding the anticipated increase in employee salaries, but before this increase, I would like to share some important information with you.
The United Arab Emirates has 79.82% of its $10 billion reserve and is allocating 2.6% from that reserve.
Just read and report on the Kuwait Times economic report, the revenues of the Gulf countries are among the largest.
Saudi Arabia's expected revenues for the year 2008 are 190 billion.
And it was
Last year, the United Arab Emirates had 68 cases, and 57 cases are expected this year.
Kuwait was 46 and it was 54.
One twenty-one units of oil, excluding fifty-five billion.
I am gas, as other reports say, God, no envy, that is, I don't envy, O deputy.
Iraq is forty-seven billion.
One and a half trillion
The areas of expenditure were one and a half trillion dollars.
The Gulf countries imported a trillion dollars.
Dollar was a multiple import
Investment in the United States totals a trillion.
And nine of every ten billion.
There are three in a hundred in Bahrain.
In 2007 in Oman, 6.5 will increase to 7. In Qatar, 15.75 will rise to 15.85 million.
People living in Qatar can expect more inflation in goods, prices, and life in general.
Life is being devoured and prices are rising at high rates, and more so in Qatar.
We feel empathy for everyone.
They must be processed.
And treatment means aiming to control inflation.
It means you'll increase salaries by fifty percent.
They don't say you're against salary increases.
This is not correct and in any case...
The ministers are against the increase in salaries.
There is a problem, and the solution must be the optimal one.
It's not a quick fix.
There is a balance between the two.
And this is how it will be.
The main thing is to address inflation.
And here in Qatar, in the committee.
His Highness the Amir issued the formation of it.
And you place
"لح وتظع يعني قواعد" translates to "To put and set means rules" in English.
Strong in solving problems and controlling inflation.
The most important thing is to control inflation first.
The inflation
Oh, if you don't control it.
Be the deputy's assistant now.
The specialist in market calculation, published at the end of last February, just a few days ago.
Do not enter among them, for...
Now you're going to be stuck with inflation and let inflation devour these people's incomes.
Many of them are now
Entering other countries
Increase our salaries, then let's see how we deal with inflation, and lower them again.
I'm saying that the words they're saying are parallel in topic.
But now
And it is not a temporary treatment.
And the problem increases in a greater way.
Therefore, here.
From attempt to limit to the extent of inflation.
Boredom will always
Because the increase was enormous in the past year, compared to the previous one.
The salient point
And the beautiful ones also work with the government, not just with the private sector.
The private property is completely neglected.
The issue of the increase must also be viewed justly now.
I don't know where you got these notes or how you got them.
We live in Qatar, the deputy isn't living in Germany.
I'm telling you the opposite today; the private sector is starting to pay.
Most of
Many Qataris who were working in the government sector have moved to the private sector.
Because of the high salaries
He faces a problem.
They move to the private sector because the private sector is vital and dynamic.
And he provides good salaries.
We are connected to what is called market force.
By the strength of the market
They do not come with highly specialized skills.
They won't come to Qatar because Qatar is the least expensive, meaning lower salaries or lower costs.
They come at the cost.
Okay, with our full understanding.
I do not anticipate events nor do I say there is an increase in salaries.
There's no hope either.
To control this inflation
Let's give some time.
Controlling this inflation
And Allah knows best, this is what the report says, that Qatar in 2008...
Inshallah means to say that "God willing".
We see that these numbers will decrease.
Sprinkle some on the people.
It means being a professional process.
Of course, with professionalism and everything, but...
From inflation
Because of the spending
The phrase "الكبير على المشاريع المختلفه" translates to "Large-scale for various projects" in English.
Allow me to answer some questions from the viewers, and I hope each of you asks directly. Abdul Aziz Mohammed from Morocco, your question, please.
This is based on the assumption that the ruling families in the Gulf are...
I would not be surprised if the justification for that is the lack of agreement among OPEC members.
Secondly, all oil revenues go directly to the ruler.
Then the ruling family and the rest is spent on development.
In the absence of accountability, things will remain as they are.
Peace and God's mercy
God bless you, brother Ahmed.
I, my brother, will not elaborate in the discussion regarding the role of brothers in the ruling systems and the issue of linking the dollar to the rial or the rial or the Gulf currencies to the dollar, but...
America seeks to globalize the world under its banner.
The US trade deficit with China reached $88 billion.
And the European Union added up to $86 billion.
This means that all global policy trends are against the dollar.
And we are bearing the consequences of this now as Arab countries and oil-rich Gulf countries.
It may end in a confrontation with America.
Between the first world countries like China, Russia, and others, the issue may become...
Purely military
The explosion of Chinese, Russian, Japanese bombs, and even American bombs.
Many thanks for this clarification and information.
Your question, O Muhammad.
Welcome, your question.
Can you turn down the TV and ask your question?
Well, your question is...
All I see is that the deputy's efforts are determined to avoid cooperation.
The topic of not being linked to the dollar because the dollar is declining.
It will, God willing, reach its lowest point.
He is a good-natured person.
It is to be expected that he will not follow the style of the Arab brothers.
Thank you, brother Mohammed. Thank you. Thank you. You're asking for another intervention from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar.
God keep you in good health.
Thank you, you didn't disappoint in the nice interview.
"Increase in salary, God willing, things will improve. We don't mean that's what's intended."
We're totally facing issues with our entire system, not just salaries.
Salaries, God willing, the matters.
Okay, I'll answer your question quickly.
I stop when I stop communicating with you. If you have a question, ask.
All of them are at low prices, everything is cheap. All of the goods are imported.
I am from a European country.
Well, we have all the Arab world with factories and workshops.
Thank you, Ahmed, thank you, you took your time.
Now, the issue of rising prices is an important issue.
The matter of the poor with the humble, stay with the poor, the deputy's journey.
The ones who don't have a billion here are the poor ones.
Here means we are for each other, of course.
Those who don't know Qatar.
This is not correct in relation to the state of Qatar.
When one comes to Qatar today, they will see what the significant indicators are.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar and what are they?
Top growth indicators in the world
Where is this tremor leading? What will you do with it?
What is it within the framework of responding to?
He means when he speaks, he's asking the brother from Morocco to speak in a certain way, which means it's not the truth or reality.
The person who does not see with his own eyes
If the person who means "he" comes and sees Qatar, what huge developments will he witness there?
In growing significantly, you indeed ask.
And everyone has the right.
And you, how will you find people like this?
Actually means will you perhaps import perhaps surplus from China perhaps?
We won't import, God willing, and...
The state is built on a plan and on
With the optimal independence from these funds coming from oil and gas, and everyone knows that oil and gas will eventually run out.
To be a state of Qatar
It is considered one of the greatest historical achievements in the Arab world.
Today, it is also the same.
The text "ال ات ال التركيز على" translates to "The focus on" in English.
And what will have the effect
The large ones after oil and gas
It means "Dubai is not expensive."
Every country, every country, every country has its own characteristics; every country has its own peculiarities.
In the State of Qatar, we have focused on education.
On the basis of the fundamental components
Here, there is a medical city where people can come to heal and recover.
It will be a city of communication that will host
Of course, the translation of the given text into English is: "Naturally, today is the world, today we must build."
We build a vision.
Post-Petroleum and Gas: An Overview
There were fatal mistakes.
And unfortunately, we did not take advantage of this opportunity as we were caught by surprise.
And yet, we were not ready for it, neither in terms of human resources, nor technology, nor education.
Today has changed after thirty years.
Also, the most important thing.
The day here has turned into night here imagine
And vision
And vision
"Many thanks to the deputy for his efforts, and also to our esteemed viewers."
We hope that we have provided you with the information you needed, on the premise of your continued interest.
Qatar's foreign policy appears murky to many observers.
Qatar enjoys distinctive relations.
While Qatar was establishing relations with Israel, it was and still is...
The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas
Qatar presented.
They have started.
The largest Arab country
What angered the regime in Egypt?
He accused her of conspiring against Egypt, fanning the flames of anger.
Qatar was not far from important files.
Like Darfur in Sudan, the Houthis in Yemen, and even an Israeli soldier captured.
The Qatari foreign policy extended its reach to her, angering larger Arab nations.
And what is the force that puts you in this position?
From these achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
They can write to us through our website www.aljazeera.net
Your Excellency, welcome.
On September 22, 2007, to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
The visit marked a significant turning point in the relations between the two countries, at least in recent years.
Re-plan boundaries
Wash what is stuck.
This is what I mentioned.
Al-Haqaz newspaper or magazine
The agreements you made with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, through which you restored relations, and the Saudi ambassador returned.
To Doha
In the beginning, your introduction was long and it seemed to require many answers without your last question.
The one I believe in my campaign
Especially regarding the topic of Saudi Arabia.
What is flour?
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is an important state in relation to Qatar.
موجود بين البلدين **Translation:** Existing between the two countries.
I spoke about silencing Al Jazeera.
I spoke about a revolutionary movement.
I believe these matters are clear from both sides.
And we accepted clarification.
In the country of Qatar
The dispute with Saudi Arabia.
He was always confined to a narrow scope.
Perspectives
And all praise is due to Allah, these are the teachings of the leaders.
King Abdullah and His Royal Highness the Prince
In the Gulf, to a large extent.
More than a hundred years
They were always bright and honorable relationships, relationships of trust.
I want to attribute it to a misunderstanding between the two parties.
This topic is complete and there were no conditions.
In solving any problem
But there was understanding, and there was sincere intent from both sides.
To solve this stuck issue.
It is not a seasonal job, but a strategic relationship.
We wish for her not permanence but evolution.
Beautiful diplomatic language
Until Saudi Arabia withdraws its ambassador from Qatar.
I'm not used to speaking diplomatically, otherwise I would have avoided many problems.
I always said what I believed in.
Saudi Arabia, and therefore it is not diplomacy but faith.
The topic of Al Jazeera falls under the media topic.
Between the two parties, and in many countries, they had been brought into the equation.
In her belief, it might ignite or she might gain points at the expense of other countries.
At the expense of Qatar
Or at the expense of Saudi Arabia.
Let's resolve the dispute within the Gulf family.
It means the opposite of what it was before.
He prostrated himself due to political agreement.
No, no, there was no agreement except an agreement of love and an agreement of interest.
However, if anything contradicts this, this issue is asked about by Al Jazeera administration: Did you build a strategy for excellence?
There should be a dialogue between you and Saudi Arabia to avoid what has happened before.
The relationship was originally based on a close strategy.
We can translate it as "One, two, three, four".
There must be solidarity.
Some disagreements were resolved on this basis.
Between some Arab states, we seek to resolve other disputes.
Because if we observe the differences in the Arab world today, they are differences in points of view.
When we have an opinion on a specific policy regarding a particular action in a specific case, and another country has a different view.
This is considered two points of view.
Some observers believed that you were enjoying criticizing Saudi Arabia.
By criticizing her
Have you become exhausted and decided to turn in a different direction, and then headed towards a larger country, Egypt?
He means the same, the same idea.
La la, first, we don't enjoy and we're not idle.
If we deal with any other party in this manner.
That means the reasons for the dispute with Saudi Arabia have ended.
Between them, and I know there is understanding.
Very big, and you know, we founded...
And there will be some kind of model.
But Saudi Arabia, but but Saudi Arabia.
Let me put this under two lines.
You began your assault on Egypt with the newspaper Al-Ahram in its issue of April 18th.
The official Egyptian newspaper
This in a comprehensive investigation, she said that the expanded investigations
In the Hezbollah network, a subversive plot was uncovered.
Egypt, with the participation of three countries, Iran, Syria, and Qatar, is the target.
And Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood.
and a well-known propaganda tool that serves as a tool of manipulation.
Qatar is the smallest Arab country.
You are conspiring against Egypt.
We respect.
And struggle throughout the years
I'm not saying it to hurt your feelings.
I will complete what you have started.
We can.
And the Egyptian president
Eager
On Arab relations
First point
Gaza issue
As they say, and as we admit
The state of Qatar
Its size is smaller
You can participate in a scheme like this.
Because we've suffered from interventions by countries in the past, and I don't want to go back to that.
I sold some countries' interventions in the Qatari affair.
Therefore, the policy of the government of His Highness.
Now that they've discovered, they say it's a conspiracy.
Also, add the name "Syria and Iran defend themselves, I won't defend them."
Stability in Egypt
And why does Qatar want to change or intervene in a matter of this type?
And the pyramids do not speak of desire.
Duale said Qatar sought to undermine Egypt's role and its relations with Turkey and the European Union.
We are capable of hosting a parallel conference to the Arab Summit, with minimal distraction.
And you use a propaganda tool that is called Al Jazeera channel.
Oh, please go ahead.
With Hezbollah
And we're not comfortable with touching, means.
I can confidently tell you.
If we
It's not our policy to interfere in such circumstances.
What forced our brothers in Egypt, and this is what we hold the Egyptian officials accountable for.
The dispute or sensitivity that exists among some members of the Egyptian government.
But some officials have a sensitivity.
What is it?
I'm here to address the issue.
The days of peace and the dawn of peace, and if we
And a meeting had taken place before it in Egypt.
And after that, a meeting was held with us.
Because Israel
We have a disagreement with her.
You have no dispute with Israel.
And now, since the conference and from that day on...
Any Islamic or Arab conference is a sensitive topic for them.
Why this sensitivity?
Sit with them and
Let me finish for you.
And we always hope for the best.
This sensitivity we discovered.
"او او ثلاثه" translates to "he or she or they" in English.
The Gaza conference that took place.
Egypt will not be held in Qatar.
It's not Arabic.
In Qatar or even in Kuwait, we told them, "Guys."
The Palestinian people are going out to strike.
More than two weeks
But we organize it before the scheduled Kuwait Conference, where we were the first to attend.
People kill and
And "W" and "B" means procrastination.
The dispute began.
No smaller nation has stood against this battle.
Of course, I know that some brothers in the government also harm Egypt, not for anyone else but for Egypt.
When they said "after"
Okay, so you're on the island.
The Israelis were informed a day ago that there would be a meeting to stop the fighting before any ultimatum or anything.
What is
My brother, they enter medicine and food while they beat our brothers.
They sometimes say the gate is narrow.
What did the trucks do?
They often tell us that God has an agreement on the other side and they must come.
Now is not the time for us to bring in Fatah or Hamas.
I don't care if it's Fatah or Hamas; what matters to us is the one and a half million, or the 650,000 people who are being bombarded.
They have no medicine.
When we started talking about this issue and discussing the Gaza conference.
And Qatar's involvement in the issue causes sensitivity in the Egyptian system.
It's none of your business.
We don't discuss how Egypt handles the situation because that's Egypt's jurisdiction.
One of the officials said, "We've discovered a major conspiracy behind the issue."
He hasn't told us what the conspiracy is yet.
If we mean this official
He tells us that Egypt is a great place.
Well, brother, we understand that Egypt is a major Arab country, and we always say that Egypt is a great state.
Therefore, we always ask the great powers for many things.
Because Egypt is to us
And you invited them to a conference as well, which was provocative for them.
We have been invited to a conference.
The age of Gaza
And we coordinated, and our position was unified.
People are suffering in Gaza.
"ممنوع" means "Prohibited" in English. The sentence translates to: "Prohibited means I know Turkey has been introducing things through Israel."
I will be happy to see her enter through our brothers in Egypt.
Us and among us
And if Egypt wins or does a good political move
This is in our interest in Qatar and the interest of the Arab world.
Egypt's stability is important to us.
If you do a good job, that's important to us.
Let me finish answering your question, it took me 15 minutes to formulate both your question and introduction.
The case is that you have lost me now but
No, I am not like that, I am like this, I am now, that is to say, from anger.
If the Egyptian system's officials are angry with you, you should...
We are the ones who failed the Doha Summit.
The second thing is that they are the ones who failed the Doha Conference.
King Abdullah had a wise rule, he desired
He wants to make amends.
Therefore, some countries do not allow (or restrict)
And this is what I said to our brother in Saudi Arabia because we...
We have no dispute with Saudi Arabia, even on this point.
The limit is because the apparent is in internal forms.
He or she is one of the officials.
The officials have the power
In a large country, one person is responsible, and in a small country, workers do these tasks.
That means there, it was for you.
She does any role.
Darfur is part of Egypt's national security and Sudan.
The five great nations read and
If any country other than Qatar had been possible.
All these sensitivities only make things worse. Why do you stick your noses into everything that's none of your business?
We want to solve the allergy. We take anti-allergy medicine. They tell us what allergy is.
Why is there sensitivity?
Some of the brothers in the government
They want internal failure there.
They want to draw attention to a conspiracy in Gaza, a coup.
It means, as the English say, "this is Italian food."
Everything I do is something.
Recipient not only for instructions but also for analyses.
I know what happened, it's fine because it's fine.
The issue must be addressed locally.
It's not being treated.
No, by God, my priority is my country.
My priority is to do the first thing, considering the issues that concern my country.
And then check if I have enough time.
Considering the issues concerning the Arab nation
Or otherwise, Qatar tried to fix.
And consider every Arabic moment you can contribute to with our best efforts.
Why provocative? Why not take it in good faith?
I can't treat you.
I can express my opinion.
What you throw at me.
And we, in our opinion, are...
What came from his heart.
Let me finish for you.
When the peace initiative was announced and the leaders in Kuwait heard it, we hoped for the best, and I expressed my warmest welcome for this topic.
In spellings
Of course, the Egyptian official who revealed his achievements.
In his article, in a TV interview or something, I won't respond to it.
Because I have an answer to every point.
But I preserve the minimum level of relations that bind us and the Arab interests.
Also in response to the call made by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
But all I advise is for him and others.
And they try to rectify their mistakes, internally or externally.
In politics, economy, or any other field, there are always mistakes. No one is immune to error.
Because they are accusing Qatar of these accusations.
You deny Qatar's involvement in anything related to Hezbollah.
This is a funny topic.
To distort Egypt's relations, fail its role and connections with Turkey and the European Union.
The first thing is that we are few in number.
If we are able to perform this role.
This is incorrect speech.
There are accusations against you personally.
To pay money to Shalit's captors in order for Qatar to secure Shalit's release and to take over Egypt's role in the matter.
He always accuses us of paying first, but we haven't paid and we haven't talked to anyone about paying.
But this issue
We believe that Egypt has been resolved, just as we supported Egypt and still support it in resolving the Palestinian issue.
God hopes that the Palestinian president will stay until this issue is resolved.
We were present and the first to support the State of Qatar.
Power remains in the hands of the Palestinian institutions until the dispute is resolved.
And we said, "Here it is."
The Arab University says no, we've already gone through it, because we believe that there are people who don't want this topic.
But we passed it cleverly.
Does it mean that he is addressing his boss?
His Prime Minister
Bro, I don't know what the problem is.
From us, from them, I don't know.
On April 12th last month, the newspaper Al-Sharqya broke the news exclusively.
The political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a news satellite to counter the media megaphone known as Al Jazeera and to put an end to...
It's just a matter of time, and things will come to an end and be resolved.
But do you fear that the island will become something of the past?
Now means living through a political adolescence.
As you conceded to Saudi Arabia, the Emir of Qatar sat with the King of Saudi Arabia.
We did not surrender, and they did not surrender to us.
We treated them as brothers.
A small country is surrendering to the large country of Egypt.
Saudi Arabia is at a crucial point, one that needs to be clarified.
Qatar's relations with Saudi Arabia differ.
So, then we'll talk.
"Qatar's relations with Egypt"
And we rely on them a lot.
Let me be frank with you, is solitude a choice?
The opposite of the main policy is...
Because we don't have a personal dispute, I told you that we respect the Egyptian people.
If I asked you right now, what are the two main problems in Gaza and what else?
And this is a matter that has deeply affected us.
We want to address this from a psychological perspective, meaning we want to solve these issues.
Published in some newspapers
Minister of Foreign Affairs
The presence of Prince Saud al-Faisal.
We talked about everything.
It's obvious that the situation worsened and didn't improve.
No, no, there was a look in the "no"
That means I can't tell you about our relations with Egypt.
They have a grievance and it's our right to them as brothers.
And we have a grievance against them as younger brothers.
In a great state, we do not want to compare ourselves with any other great nation.
Egypt means more than just satisfaction.
It's not a matter of life and death that I mean, but for the solution to come from the sky.
For us, if someone is waiting to be pleased.
No one is waiting for a style.
Qatar has
You treat him not as an equal or a brother.
As a major state, yes, we are proud of Egypt as a major state.
But if someone deceives another...
This means that I know Israel is following us.
And also, the previous American policy under the previous administration was either with or against me.
I don't think they want to imitate either Israel or America on this issue.
And afterwards, they also, if they take any policies, they are also pressured from external sides.
In several cases, let me finish for you.
We also understand and know that there are still gaps in spelling even for the largest countries.
The outfit controls your policy.
We don't have any movement; our movement is one thing.
The internal affairs of Qatar are its internal affairs.
And in any field we can assist in the Arab world, we will assist.
What are the sources of power for the Al-Jazeera channel and its extensive base?
You can say this isn't strong.
Belief in God and trust in ourselves.
His Highness The Amir's Vision
We do not want to hurt anyone.
Let me finish for you, we don't want to interrupt.
And we don't want to compete with anyone.
They say what they say, whether it's the Greater Qatar or anything else.
But we have a point of view.
We first expelled the Israeli office, we closed it down.
"Praise be to God. Initially, they used to say, 'Close the office, we closed the office.' They got angry and then they started saying to the Americans, 'Look at these people.'"
They went and lined up with what they call the Devil's team.
What do they say?
Americans and Europeans are not our friends, and we know how to deal with them.
The conspiracies
That which was given
It means, "So, we've reached the final stage, what now?"
Now is the time
What is your vision to solve the problem with Egypt in one or two points?
And considering that Egypt has a significant role in the Arab world.
We believe it's important that you attend.
And I'm sure President Hosni Mubarak is keen on this.
But some of the crew
He needs to leave.
Engaging the Egyptian public, governmental, or other opinion in trivialities.
And focus on Egyptian and Arab interests.
Are there any steps?
We are not behind them, but in front, because they are a great nation.
In the foreseeable future
And God means that I believe that this issue, I can't even imagine how it will turn out.
And I know that it's time for the mind.
And it's time for those who are from us.
If it's me.
He is from them
Their interests bring them together.
We will one day realize that this issue
The world is still far away.
It means we don't follow the Egyptian style you have.
If someone extends their hand to us, I extend mine a meter.
Now with His Excellency the Sheikh
It means we've never gotten used to running.
Only on a solid basis are we ready to run to Egypt.
Stand with Egypt
There are many rumors circulating about the harm suffered by Egyptian workers in Qatar as a result of this issue.
And there are contracts for Egyptians working in jobs, whether on Fridays or in major positions.
Are you aware that it's not in Qatar's character to cancel jobs and dismiss employees?
Because these people have nothing to do with what's happening.
This is a market where the demand for one changes, and they cancel one and bring another.
It is vast and demanding, and in other nationalities, they are subtle in a nationality that increased.
Okay, answer quickly.
The office existed.
We've worried the office, so I need to leave now.
We teased them during the days of their aggression that all our losses in negotiations with Israel were because of this office.
Hi, we closed it, let them solve the issue with Netanyahu.
He was a guest.
And it was among our customs that we would invite all the ambassadors accredited in any foreign country.
There was no formal invitation to L'Krama Gabriela Chell.
No, God forbid, we didn't honor her before when relationships were as good as they say. Now, it's a bit difficult to honor her.
There is no reason now to reopen the office during this period.
The office opens if the reasons for its closure disappear.
You're the one who raised him.
It means "The size of Egypt".
Egypt is the one that imposed this.
Our relationship with America is a strategic one. Let me make this clear to you.
In some matters, this one
What are the most important things?
In some matters in our region, in the treatment of certain issues, we disagreed with the previous administration.
Now, we have great hope in our administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe there is a great hope that this administration
The road to peace is in motion. The road to solving the Palestinian issue.
All our friends, and this we deny not.
What is happening in Iran and its impact on the Gulf and on you.
This is a matter that the Iranians decide how to solve their problems.
Amongst themselves
In their usual ways, and I'm certain their importance will surpass this crisis.
Iran's stability, as mentioned by His Highness the Prince.
It is important for our region, the Gulf region, and we share a common border with Iran.
Of course, we have unique relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because we, as a country, seek peace and stability for this region.
And we would intervene every time there is a party that wants to change or alter the Doha Agreement.
I thought that Saad Hariri said...
Now, the strategic dialogue between the president has come to an end.
And between the Lebanese groups
How to see
Regarding Yemen, do you have a role, or have the Yemenis taken a stand against you?
First, we are known for supporting unity when almost the entire Arab world was against Yemeni unity.
We are a single Arab and Gulf state that has stood with the Yemeni unity.
And regarding the southern issue, we have spoken with Yemen, and I was sent by His Highness the Prince twice to meet with the Yemeni President.
I clarified to him that our goal is stability in Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arab Peninsula.
This agreement was not respected, and I don't want to say that each party did what?
But what really hurt me
The fact that Qatar has been accused of funding the Houthis and senior officials is damning.
Yemeni people because we do not interfere in these affairs.
He who stands with unity does not stand against it.
And for another purpose in the interest of Yemen, whether political, economic, or otherwise.
This is a topic we have no objection to, but to be honest, I was shocked.
Because I have gone more than ten times during the days of fighting, His Highness the Prince sent me between the Yemenis in Yemen.
I'm sorry, but this accusation is strange.
Time is up, but to sum up: will the problems you've foreseen from your efforts to solve them change your policy of interfering in other Arab affairs?
By God, if His Highness were to hear my words, I truly believe there's no need.
And he showed us once a great sum of money.
More than five billion dollars at that time means if we invest it, it would become fifty billion, better than all the headaches.
I just say it and I believe it because maybe the time in the Arab world now means
What is allowed under these circumstances
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
And perhaps even exceptionally with the State of Sheikh Hamad.
The Doha Agreement
How did the Doha miracle happen?
With the approval of the committee and providing it with all support.
In the context of Lebanon, following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
When there was an Arab consensus
And we went to New York, and we were able to make the decision somewhat balanced.
And we noticed in Doha that both parties were keen.
We tried as much as possible not to listen to him or have him there.
Because we knew the committee, we knew.
Face reality and know what the problem is after sitting with the Lebanese for long hours.
And I believe it's a shared success.
But there was persistence.
I believe that Lebanon's problem is directly affected by the regional atmosphere.
Whether peaceful or not.
Lebanon is destined for this location.
To be like that
And unfortunately
External reverberations
I can say that the problem between Lebanese people is there, even if there is a problem, it's not the number one problem.
Well, State Sheikh, I know that perhaps the time isn't too early to talk about the behind-the-scenes, but
What do you mean, why did you come here?
You, if I may say so, stopped the engagement on the field.
You didn't delay even a moment, right?
What exactly was going on? I know very well; even the Lebanese leaders at that time were telling me what had happened.
No, I wasn't from the beginning.
When I spoke with His Highness
Tell him if we come to Lebanon.
I am proposing this idea, and His Royal Highness the Prince has endorsed and supported it.
They are all the Lebanese leaders present there.
Since you are here in Beirut, check out everyone in their respective areas.
And you are all staying in the same hotel and in the same place.
And on the same plane, you met and spoke to each other.
So we created this atmosphere, but from the beginning, we had thought...
And this was the most important decision of all.
Of course, in Cannes.
And this is what I felt at the Arab University.
We will be honest intermediaries.
And I believe, thank God, that this has proven to everyone that Qatar has made an effort.
On both sides
To reach a mutually satisfying solution.
And even if there's no one losing out.
Before you take your step.
Consultation was held at the Arab University and we found support.
What we've done
And I spoke to him while we were there.
If we succeed in Lebanon, we will transfer them to Doha.
And he had commanded me to...
Close the door on them and take their phones away.
We were able to reach them there, and also the brothers in Syria supported the position.
And I told you from the beginning, if it weren't for Arab support, the committee wouldn't have been able to do anything.
They wanted to know why they wanted the solution.
I believe the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that has taken place.
And this tension
There is tension in Somalia. There is tension in Sudan.
In several issues, it surrounds the Arab world.
And all that extinguished the fire.
It is in the interest of the Arab world to be free from foreign interventions.
And we try as much as possible to be in
Sends forces
Even if militarily
In such a way, I believe in the subject.
In the state of Sheikh.
He was always saying "solve the Lebanese side and the Lebanese file".
Saudi-Syrian agreement
If the "قاف قاف" (Qaf Qaf) is correct, then "قاف" in Arabic means Qatar and the Arab League.
Can what happened in Lebanon lead to a serious reconciliation between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Syria?
In the Arab world, we need a self-review.
Because of Arab disputes
And any agreement between two Arab states
And this we've tried.
In the war of thirty-three
When the Arabs agree to solve a problem.
I believe this is in our interest.
Saudi Arabia and Syria have an important role in Lebanon.
Both parties
They overcome wisdom.
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because we in the Arab world face huge and great challenges.
Everyone plays in our court.
And we have no power nor strength.
And how do we stop the game in the arena of Arab countries?
As Arabs, at the very least, we have a minimum of agreement.
Unfortunately, we complain.
And we are spectators.
Our lack of agreement and trust among Arabs results in a missing trust between Arab countries.
And then the Arab countries.
It's not treason, it's a kind of...
The session, what do they call the session?
This is a situation that needs a pause from everyone, I believe.
So, with this desire, will you materialize it? Will you actually demand an Arab summit?
We hurt when they hurt, and we rejoice when they rejoice.
I mean, it goes with the flow.
Can you play a role in repairing the situation between Damascus and Riyadh, even if just indirectly?
We are keen to find solutions, and I am sure that with their wisdom they will.
They may reach an understanding.
They are among many issues.
And there was harmony in politics, and I am certain that, by the grace of God, this is...
Relations are improving.
Both parties need to want to take a step forward.
But I can't be certain that this is what's happening now.
I am certain that if Arabs focused on resolving disputes between Arab countries and the problems of some Arab states that I mentioned.
My state of optimism and my state of pride among citizens is that there is a general Arab awakening.
But I can't connect what happened in Lebanon.
"يمكن ان يترجم عالارض" means "It can be translated on
There is a possible American-Iranian escalation, or perhaps other issues.
Are you still afraid of them in the coming months?
We, as Arabs.
We can only order food and medicine delivery.
And electricity for people
We are ready in Qatar, always under the leadership of His Highness the Amir.
Over one and a half million Palestinians are trapped.
We do not want them to have weapons, nor do we want their victory, nor do we want...
They do all of this.
And electricity
And we will give it, Allah willing, to the Red Cross to reach it to the Palestinians.
And with the Palestinians, food and medicine have reached them.
And our dispute with them continues.
And I wish for the Palestinians on both sides to prioritize national interest.
And they leave illusions behind.
This Palestinian rift means a deep wound.
On the solution
And they neither did nor committed.
This is a serious matter, they must adhere to the Mecca agreement.
And they must request that even if they go again to Mecca or to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
And they shall resolve this dispute.
They will not benefit.
Oh, promises from which side?
I hope there is a solution, but...
Our position on this matter is clear, and we have communicated this to all relevant parties that we...
We will not be a party and will not accept to be a party in any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with her.
But most importantly, we are a sovereign state and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone sees their own interests, but these interests will neither harm them nor us.
We believe that the Gulf is destined to have a clear agreement among the Cooperation Council countries.
And Iran on cooperation and peaceful coexistence.
But when the Sheikhdom of Qatar says that Qatar is not a party,
Is there any detail or clarification?
Just a hint
Never ever
Well, I would like to return if you allow the Lebanese file.
Frankly speaking, the Sheikh's country meant that we were facing a major blockage, but in the last hours we have reached a solution.
Some linked what happened to what was announced.
Perhaps it's information that may be scattered and unrelated, but what happened?
Until you reached this conclusion.
What happened in Istanbul, I know, had specific dates set before.
Oh, you were aware in the negotiations.
Continuously in the subject of solving
And there is no doubt that supporting the Kingdom is very important.
And change the tactics of the negotiations.
The discussions led to...
To a positive outcome by bringing together so many parties from so many different angles.
And we began to speak
This paper reflects an Arab and national perspective.
Tell me what's wrong with this paper.
And we started talking, one substance after another.
In the last moment, to overcome the obstacle, there was only one left.
But the prince passed by the edges
And remove this obstacle.
And there was a solution.
We heard the word of the Emir of Qatar in the opening session in Doha.
It means you don't consider your role now.
The most important thing is to keep this issue out of the spotlight.
We have no regional ambitions.
And by God, if we had control over a country or something, because we are a country.
Our size, we take pride in ourselves, we believe we can contribute to solving matters with our other brothers.
But in the Arab world, it is very important.
The given text "ان
We want her to do something, and this is very important.
Some small countries are allowed to play this role and are supported in doing so.
It means: "In some things, it's excellent, in some things, it's good, and in some things, it's less than good."
The last question is about the state of the Sheikh.
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority?
The translation of "امنيه اصلاح ذات البين" into English is: "The desire for reconciliation."
What is the alternative to facing Israel?
We stopped playing in the Arab field.
We fix in the Arab world our problems.
They conduct an active role in Iraq.
To calm the situation
Regionally and internationally
But if we put our heads under the table
It means any victory is before us or we have no hope.
Thank you, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, for this insightful interview.
And the international effort to put an end to the war in Gaza.
And we begin with your request for a meeting of the Arab University Council at the level of ...
Ministerial and as if you had turned a blind eye.
Regarding a request for an emergency Arab summit
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. At the beginning, I am happy, brother Hassan, to be part of this program.
Even if the circumstances
The humanity our brothers in Gaza are facing.
Circumstances demand that we do a lot.
Qatar did not ignore the Arab summit.
We were the truth when we went with the idea of the Arab Summit before.
Unified is not just from a Security Council resolution but also from
Never be trampled upon and taken for granted.
And let me put it in another sentence.
And we are being disciplined.
The street can no longer bear it if it endures it as the street's responsibility in the Arab street.
Does not bear/tolerate
When we were in Cairo.
There were ten to eleven written agreements.
Some of them spoke at the meeting, and it was possible to hold the meeting.
If we make it as much as there is Arab consensus.
And I don't blame those who think that what isn't in a meeting can be seen by them.
How can he solve the problem?
Because it is resolvable
This is the important issue.
Because our goal is not promotion or advertising, our goal is to find.
It means you didn't turn away from the summit.
And some of us ask ourselves.
I'll go so we can pressure the poor other side.
The previous and subsequent events, and the decision of the Security Council, but let's stay focused on the Arab Summit. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
He clearly stated that the situation may require holding an Arab summit with those present.
We found that most of the brothers support holding the summit.
With whom did he make a covenant?
And I don't know what they mean by moderation.
That means we are the only chosen nation.
Only the Arabic nation means if we go to any nation in Asia, Latin America, etc.
And without a solution
Countries classified as moderate.
And what is moderation in our view?
Are we giving up the Palestinian cause?
Because what they like is not us.
Should we intervene in the Palestinian affair?
It means that no mother allows the good or bad to interfere.
I don't know if another party like Hezbollah or Hamas will emerge tomorrow.
Is she a student?
And can we truly be a part of the Arab body?
It was planned for us to enter into an Arab internal conflict.
Okay, let's go to the Security Council.
There is no resolution by the Security Council.
I hope after Israel completes its mission...
The second Arab Ministerial Meeting, which you have invited to, is fine.
Which was dominated by discussions, disagreements, and sharp confrontations.
He is at a crucial point.
You get, but that's not the important part.
If we hold a meeting
From the crossings
There is no peace anymore.
Are the ministers ready for that?
Because there's one side saying we need to wait.
Well, we are an Arab initiative.
Peace talks with Israel were frozen.
We say that we are at one end, they say that we are losing on this issue.
In a loss greater than what we are losing now, we have always been respectful, polite, and committed to decisions since the truce days.
Saada Sheikh says that the frequent arguments are not important.
There were those who wished for the passion and such to fade away.
This means an expression of a political stance rather than a confrontation between one minister and another, etc.
Unfortunately, this is a situation that occurred.
But not everyone
We don't want to speak for others.
It is very important that we be the men of our own countries.
We conduct the politics of our countries.
Whoever acts on her behalf for things like this.
"اعتقد" translates to "I believe" in English.
I don't think we'll be respected in the end.
Yes, are there people who play roles on behalf of the West?
No, thank God, I won't accuse anyone. I don't want to accuse anyone in this matter.
After the Security Council's decision
What will his agenda be?
The situation began with the decision in the Arab effort.
And here lies the dispute if Israel were to implement the decision immediately.
We can say in a decision
But Israel did not implement this decision.
Now, are we ready to go and request Chapter 7 in (I know there's of course a difficulty).
Do not question who is responsible before the international audience, and if you ask.
Hesitantly
The current situation
They believe that their most important task is to do justice to the Jews or Israelis.
They will take their rights.
This current Arab situation
If Arabs did not go to the Security Council.
And they agree on a summit and make difficult decisions.
And the Western countries will seek us out.
Because we are in the heart of the Arab world, and you are witnessing how the Arab street is moving on this issue.
But this decision is important.
Call our leaders one after the other.
In the end, they said, "Well, it turns out there's nothing and he's just lying."
Well, if we were like Germany or others, would we demand?
They don't have to pay compensation for the attack on someone who provides false information.
And you kill hundreds of thousands.
This is because you are a weak Arab side.
We, as Arabs, have hurt each other.
He testifies to its quality.
Remove the topic
It was inevitable, it was already written in fate and destiny.
If the Arab nation says that you send forces to Darfur, we will also send forces to Darfur.
The Arabs considered or perhaps someone considered the decision 860 to be valid.
The group struggled to make the decision.
What the Security Council issued
I don't want to say that God is a victory or that it's not a victory.
Things as they come to an end.
Let's assume a victory.
What are we doing?
We assume that the final decision is one we don't have to commit to.
But I assure you, we will abide by the decision.
Unfortunately, you will have to abide by it, but you should not be bound by the decision.
Even if after the Israeli rejection, Israel returned and accepted.
That means "we are" in English.
Will you have an alternative, or rather, are you the ones calling for a ministerial meeting?
I don't think the Arab nation...
In the current situation, it's ready for any alternative.
And I do not think the Arab world is ready.
In implementing the Gaza blockade
For other political goals
To overcome one faction over another in Palestine, we should fix their differences among themselves, not impose one over the other.
We started trying to plan
They once held a gathering, I don't know, some kind of Arab-European intelligence without mentioning names.
And once they said, "We are sharing."
In implementation
What is required of us from the West
But if we go
This means that I want there to be sorting in it.
I mean, of course, I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about...
Consequences because this issue started two years ago, the Gaza issue, it's not over now.
I spoke about the topic two years ago, but specifically about the decision-making process.
Do you have any objections to its clauses?
Issued and executed.
We were called
They might think we have a different perspective.
It was required that everyone be on the same page.
We don't all have to share the same opinion, but I believe those who went put in an effort.
And we thank them for it.
Regarding what is happening in Gaza for the past two years, I said that parties
The predominance of one faction over another participated in the topic of the blockade of Gaza.
Indeed, you agree with the statements, hints, or accusations that have been made here and there.
About genuine Arab complicity in everything that is happening now in Gaza.
That means we're aware of the details.
From the context, let me say this: "Since it's the topic, let me tell you, we're not aware of everything."
But I know
The Palestinian-Palestinian dispute
Inflame Arabically and Internationally
And if they had not disagreed, it would not have been a concern.
And after the elections that took place.
The atmosphere is charged with a desire for power.
In most cases
We should give them a chance and see.
They want to reform or are they still revolutionaries in the sense of revolution? They only know the gun and fighting.
But on the day inside
Some of our brothers believe that this radical movement should not come to power.
Now they say that some are committing aggression.
Hamas or the Palestinians from Gaza broke the ceasefire.
Ceasefire
The Palestinian people in Gaza have been living in hunger for two years.
This is forgivable.
For Israeli security reasons
Clear, okay, I don't want them in power, this doesn't concern me, I'm in Qatar.
But what crime has the remaining people committed?
What next? And who decides?
Not all states have the sovereignty to make their own choices.
Governments
He is the root of the problem.
But I'm sure it's possible to treat it.
If we testify, we testify to the fact that we have differences.
But it's clear that if we're expected to defeat one class over another, then this class...
We consider it a terrorist category or, put it another way, we consider it.
What's happening, all of this has led to...
And even the promises made by the party that will live up to them are suitable.
They didn't do anything for him.
We return to the international and Arab efforts made to put an end to what is happening, as you mentioned.
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has rejected so far.
And there is the Egyptian initiative that
Egyptian in Cairo
On those Egyptian efforts
It is not a loop at all.
She is expected to play an important role.
Egypt also shares borders with Israel and Palestine.
If we
And now, we must stop the chaos.
In Gaza and Anjib, people stop the chaos in Gaza because...
This is not the way to peace.
There must be
And therefore we always ask her for a bigger role.
We announced it.
It means that the initiative cannot be implemented now.
Or to give the possibility of success or study.
I believe in the chance of success.
If the brothers in Egypt can
Approaching Palestinian perspectives.
And those discussing the initiative should consider the affected party in Gaza.
Because he is the one who decides, he can say yes or no.
And this is an important point.
When decision No. 1860 was issued
We have a Palestinian Arab problem.
If we don't want to hear anyone's side.
But I wish that when the Palestinian delegation left...
When they went to the university, they asked for someone from Gaza to join them.
Even now, they show the Israelis that these are our brothers, we are one with them.
This is an important point.
Let's not make authority.
She is our goal, our protection, and we build our policy around her.
"على البقاء ف السلطه" translates to "Power requires staying."
The sheikh now.
That means I don't know if the Egyptian initiative can be discussed since you haven't reviewed its clauses, but...
Do you believe in principle that it is suitable for him to implement International Resolution 60/1, as some have stated?
Balanced role
Not now or later because
Every day passes.
In the blood of our brothers, there is bloodshed.
So we do not want to delay or for the Israelis to delay this issue until they finish their mission, we will start proposing this initiative.
And I'm sure that the brothers in Egypt know this and are eager for it.
And what I want to make clear is that everything I say...
The matter must be solved now.
It's not what Israel wants.
Noteworthy is Turkey's role since the beginning of the crisis.
Does it mean is it an expression?
About an Arab vacuum
And there was no doubt that the position was striking.
And it has an Arab depth.
Her entry is a lack of Arabic expertise in Arabic expertise.
We know there is an Arab deficit.
Part of it is due to disagreements.
Part of it is due to each person's perspective, I believe that my perspective is the best.
Flan believes that his perspective is better.
And neither in consensus can we make people respect us and know that there is an Arab decision.
And they do not distinguish us, one by one.
One says, "No, let's give them two or three extra days to calm down and bring the group so they can be at their level, and the issue will be resolved."
We must rise above this and not accept this.
Their enthusiasm may have mistakes; we hold Hamas accountable.
Arabically, Arabically
But now
At least, I'll tell them no.
In the context of the situation, the required diameter is also as we hear, we will return to this point but...
In the field at the same time, you also heard.
Khaled Meshal is the former head of the Political Bureau of Hamas movement.
First, it's not necessary to agree with everything that brother Khaled Mashal says, with all due respect and appreciation for him.
Why don't we sit down with Khaled Mashal and talk to him as Arabs?
Send it to the Arab University and translate it.
This is important talk.
I am excited.
Israel's conditions are also imposed.
Let them impose conditions, meaning they are prohibited from imposing conditions, and Israel should impose conditions.
First, what do you think of this Arab popular gift?
If it's a mob or these crowds, we shouldn't listen to their words. They say things that we don't hear.
He completely differs in saying the first thing is to liberate his country.
With allies and without, he liberated his country from Nazi occupation.
Now, we're the ones we're talking about.
The Arabic uprising is something we must prepare for.
The elected presidents represent the views of their people.
The Arab peoples in all those demonstrations we have witnessed.
It can be met from these rows of demands.
Many who criticize Qatar in this situation also demand
Despite what's happening, the office and its representatives remain open.
They are speaking with the same logic.
By cutting ties, we align with all Arab countries.
To cut off all relations, even if someone has a treaty with them.
They want Qatar to just disappear.
If we
And this is more important than the relationship.
Not just in this decision, but in this one and even harder decisions.
From this decision
It means that we must have a unified Arab position.
For others
No one sells to anyone else unless they gain some spiritual, material, or reputational benefit from it.
Yes, that means before we close this file on this topic, there are also countries that have taken individual steps.
Good, Chavez's position on his job differs Chavez has a dispute with America.
Our peoples do not need us to summon them.
Five permanent ambassadors presented their arguments. These are films.
We've finished it; the street is smarter now.
With the highest roof, happiness to the sheikh.
He calls on the resistance forces in Lebanon to confront the Israeli aggression, and so on.
Do you think that if this matter were framed within one Arab context, it could succeed?
But we call for an Arab stance that respects us through which people will honor us.
I don't think Arab countries are ready for combat.
And neither are we motivated.
How can we achieve Syria, achieve Lebanon, and achieve other countries, while in some Arab countries people don't even speak to each other?
It needs to be there.
It translates to: "It's a qualitative shift in Arab relations."
This is the current policy among Arab countries.
It's on the list, but I think its validity has expired.
In the goals
The important issue
And we know how the Lebanese composition is.
Lebanon There is no doubt that
She gave an example of returning her lands.
The situation in Gaza is different from the situation in Gaza. They are still...
Surrounded from all sides
And this siege
The nature gives a difference.
Yes, I mean here the goals regarding Israel, that is, the goals of the operation regarding Israel.
The day you punish someone, you will be rewarded for it. The day you show mercy to someone, you will find satisfaction in it.
Therefore, the example of what happened in Lebanon is not a good example for them.
The model of the solution that was achieved in Lebanon
You consider it suitable.
For Gaza
Look at the problem in Gaza, or, the Palestinians' solution is easier than Lebanon's.
Different in some ways, whether we return to our lands today or return them tomorrow.
Our disagreements are about power.
On the distribution of power
And this differs because their fabric is closer to some others.
From the intellectual fabric in Lebanon
Therefore, that solution is easier.
And here lies the problem.
Sheikh's happiness
It means that we only have a few minutes left to summarize this topic to where we can go from here.
And a diplomat means:
How can this process end?
For the Palestinians in Gaza
Let me tell you.
He may refuse.
And help yourself.
The one who didn't join us.
Failure is not an option for us Arabs.
As a strategic matter
But on the Palestinian side
There were some efforts, but we didn't see a comprehensive initiative.
Neither before nor now, why?
It's not a matter of initiative, as much as we feel.
The one who solves the issue, we will assist without mentioning Qatar's name, as it might offend some people due to their sensitivity towards the name of Qatar.
And our goal is not to respond with a peak, because we have the peak in March, it will be held.
If we take the initiative, will we be better than our brothers? I don't think so.
We do not put pressure on them.
Because history won't forgive us if we push them.
That means in this initiative, we've seen all parties alive; there was a meeting on the 4th that was postponed due to going to the Security Council.
We hope, Allah willing, to make progress. We invite our Arab brothers to assist us, as much as possible, on this issue.
We aim to distance him from the topic of competition.
Arabic Arabic
In its management due to a dispute with the Sudanese government at some point.
And these are also our problems, so okay, we might fight or disagree with each other.
I don't want to delve into this topic.
In Kuwait on the 19th of this month, as far as I know, of course, the Arab situation is as follows...
As you know, as I mentioned and detailed, your capabilities.
Does the Arab world as a whole help it become the first economic peak?
His Highness
And of course, no matter which Arab sibling, we always attend.
And what we always prevent is the presence of any summit.
But isn't there a fear that it might turn into a political peak?
Of course, given that time imposes itself.
It's too late, even if it means in ten days.
We talk about Palestinians after they've endured twenty-five days of bombardment.
means bacon
It is not said that the Arabs could not meet.
This is what we said.
This is what we said.
With all due respect, this summit is programmed, and we are committed to it.
That means I think that we
The Arab street is upon us.
In our way, the way we're going.
And therefore it means I
And we submit.
And he says, "Enough, this is secure."
On this meeting
Thank you, viewers, for watching.
And until we meet again, continuous coverage of the ongoing war in Gaza. Until we meet again.
A few days ago, the World Disability Day was celebrated.
Shaikha bint Khalifa al Thani
In Doha, contributing to the preparation of the draft law.
I have also held membership in numerous local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
As well as delivering over seventy-five lectures, workshops, presentations, and published articles in Arabic and international journals.
Let's agree on the currently used term at the outset.
For the reference to people with disabilities, are they people with special needs or, as you said, people with disabilities?
Now, first, Good evening.
Because people with disabilities have been taken from the legal perspective or from the culture of human rights.
Because she treated people with disabilities as people first.
Human
And thus his disability resulted from his attempt to adapt to society.
Then, the medical concept prevailed.
Then, the approach moved from the concept to the notion.
Special education and private education emerged
This category has become
And so we started calling them "people with special needs".
They are the standard rules from which it was derived.
The role of the Special Rapporteur in monitoring the implementation of this document
Then the pace quickened until the international agreement emerged, legally binding and distinct from the rules in this regard.
And I set a fundamental condition or basic rule for this term.
Who treats these people as humans, as people, as individuals.
With the change in terminology as you've suggested, is there a shift in the perception of this segment of society?
Yes and measured in
Different from one region to another
But the special thing about this topic
The Arabic world has distinguished itself or differed.
However, the legal trend in it contains a culture of human rights, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but perhaps the reasons are due to a lack of financial resources, not so.
Of course, here is the translation of the given text: "Obviously, that's what I wanted to say: culture exists, but sometimes there is a lack of resources, and sometimes a lack of political will."
Sometimes legislation, but...
But unfortunately, awareness is very low, and legal culture is also non-existent.
Ten percent of the world's population have disabilities.
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities in developing countries are of working age.
And they suffer from unemployment.
Means through my visit to Darfur
Despite the mines and weapons.
For males, better by a degree less.
People with disabilities are often in remote areas far away.
Therefore, there are many trends among organizations working in this field that aim to raise
Consciousness of achieving justice in education.
Instead of creating many religious centers, to put it bluntly.
He realizes that she establishes rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
And this is one of the things that, thank God, we've been able to accomplish through our work at the office.
I tried with the organizations present in the State of Qatar.
Set an agenda for action
Ensure the work agendas of these humanitarian organizations include these centers.
In light of the deteriorating situation of people with disabilities worldwide
I cannot agree with you that there is a retreat.
If there is a decline in the Arab world, it is due to the issue of disability.
Within the context of society, within the context of politics, within the economic context, we cannot expect that the conditions of people with disabilities will be...
And they are from marginalized groups.
In a country like Gaza or Darfur, for example.
On the contrary, I cannot absolutely assert that there is no improvement in the situation.
And indeed, it has been translated on the ground, for example, if I could give an example.
In a similar vein to the Qatari Red Crescent.
We agreed that the projects would enter.
For individuals with health-related disabilities, this strategy includes them, and there are other projects.
We also tried to introduce them.
The work of organizations based on the land
We are happy to have you with us, Kamal, just like a complete circle from Syria.
Good evening, Suleiman of the village.
Solomon, please go ahead.
My best regards to you and to the respected Mrs. Hafsa.
First, are there any intellectual disabilities incorporated within the laws of the United Nations?
Intellectual disability means a person who was healthy resulted from some pressure became a pressure victim and developed an intellectual disability.
His disability, a result of torture and imprisonment, has led to intellectual disabilities that he is still being treated for, six years later.
I know, I know, around four hundred people between children and disabled adults as a result of prisons.
Is there a law at the United Nations?
The translation of the given text is: "In reality, it means that I."
Understanding means knowing that they know, as they know their children.
"And every means intends purpose, without without without without making themselves named."
And there are values in the West.
Agreed, but people
It is not appropriate to deny wisdom to people who may have strayed from or turned away from Islam, according to understanding.
Many thanks to Naif Al-Said for sharing news from Kuwait with us.
I return to our guest to comment on what has been said in
Communications Suleiman wondered if there was a mental impairment.
Yes, it's included in the classification.
The global term for disability includes intellectual and mental disabilities as well.
Among these disabilities, there are sensory disabilities, meaning visual or auditory, and motor disabilities.
Of course, as I mentioned, the disability is...
An action and a reaction occur within a specific social context.
In the Arab world or in any other regions
It is certain that the fight against disability has taken a long time.
And even at the level of the United Nations
For instance, during my experience and work as a Special Rapporteur, there are certain issues that I have tried to address and work on.
Means right for all
Until they are prepared
Various qualifications to ensure their entry into schools as well as organized work.
It works on professional qualification, which includes people with disabilities.
I made some significant improvements to it.
Especially after the reform.
In general, it exists in this international body.
I am also meant as a special rapporteur.
My reality is my work, and this has been positive for me, even if it's not directly related.
And those who supported this position.
I saw him at many meetings, for example, the international convention.
For the rights of persons with disabilities
This means that she is restricted or limited by these constraints or shortcomings.
For example, regarding legal capacity.
And this is one of the most fundamental points in the world of disability that does not
The United Nations unfortunately suspended a great deal during the preparation and drafting.
Regarding organizations and agencies
For example, use this.
The world includes governments, non-governmental organizations, and the major states of the United Nations.
We directed another survey.
For the United Nations organizations and its agencies in the various regions.
To know to what extent disability programs are on their agendas.
If budgets are allocated and there is participation by people with disabilities.
Human rights
And not just development cases
Alright, we are now receiving more calls from us. Nagi, a buyer from Algeria, is on the line. Please, Nagi.
And upon you be peace.
I'd like to ask my sister about the exact location of Algeria.
I'd like to ask, I'm originally disabled.
Alright, let's pose this question to Nagi Mashri, who spoke to us from Algeria. Thank you very much, Ahmed.
Ahmed, from Aleppo, prefers the Greeks.
Good evening, madam. Good evening to your guest.
Health care, seasonal housing, clothing - even taking them on seasonal tours, and this is what happens in Europe.
Is a mental patient considered disabled?
Especially, perhaps they might cause harm to others or to themselves.
All we're talking about falls into the realm of unproductive discussion, and thank you.
The sister, Haza, mentioned the financial neglect.
In particular, in poor countries like Africa and Latin America, and I demand it.
Establish an international support fund for disabilities and allocate one percent of the net profits of every institution worldwide to it.
And this shall be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
It will be a shame and a pity that many disabled people, war victims, and others will remain neglected.
Thank you very much, Ibrahim Abdullah. You spoke to us from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Mashri wonders and reviews his problem, he is disabled.
At the local or national level, it means through Algeria.
The needs within the local community must be met within this community.
It is the same rights that should be given to any other person.
In other words, first comes the right to life, then the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education.
So, I am actually calling from here, from this platform, governments, and Arab governments in particular.
For the benefit of this citizen and this individual.
To ensure
Those needs and rights are part of the existing agendas.
No, there is no need to create any devices.
New to meet the needs of the disabled person or no need if this state
She is able, and indeed must, be committed to achieving.
I would first advise him to return and go back to the responsible authorities at the governmental level if possible.
Because it falls within the national scope and this scope must be ensured.
Your mention of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is noted. Many countries have signed it, but not all are adhering to it.
And here we pose a question from one of the callers who said, "Why aren't there any laws?"
It's a certainty that we are part of a human, humanitarian society, which means there will be many mistakes and also many correct things.
Sure, here is the translation: "Certainly, many agreements and surely many charters do not have a literal commitment."
It is an ideal commitment that many countries have joined, such as the CEDAW (Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women) and others.
But there are breaches and violations, and we are aware of that.
But the issue is to adopt an agreement and join it.
First, we will ensure at least that there is awareness.
This awareness starts from the top of this pyramid, which is the decision-makers.
And then the responsibility escalates to reach the entire community.
The issue is also our commitment to prepare reports, and these reports reach the United Nations.
The issue of knowledge, understanding, and increased awareness and consciousness.
For the reports, have you worked as a rapporteur at the United Nations?
Yes, from what I saw and recorded there, there is interest.
Therefore, there is a relative advantage to the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
So I advise, encourage, and call.
It is also important for people with disabilities to...
And we will hear what he tells us Ali Abd Al-Senari, who is the president of the Qatari Association for the Deaf.
The deaf speak of it, Mr. Naji Sagerna, welcome to you, Mr. Naji and Mr. Ali as well.
Peace be upon you
And upon you be peace.
With me is Mr. Ali Abd Al-Senari, the Chairman of the Board of Directors at the Qatari Deaf Cultural and Social Center.
And which is ruled by the happiness of Sheikhah Hessa.
The former UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities
I am from the State of Qatar.
And the fact is that Sheikhah Hissa had a long arm.
And the international agreement you are talking about now is the real thing.
It is a great benefit for all people with special needs around the world.
And especially in the Arab world.
And I, and I wish as Kazem.
For these states to implement this international convention.
Which are designed to serve people with special needs and which is essential that
Indeed, there should be someone activating this agreement in all countries.
Abd Al-Senari, he is the president of the Qatari Association for Deaf-Mute People.
We stop at
Here we are, let's continue our conversation, but after a short break, stay with us.
Send and share your opinions on important political, sporting, economic, and other diverse issues.

Dear viewers, welcome back to our show today, with our guest, Sheikh Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani.
For the disabled, an international fund for support.
"Disability should be a binding obligation for all countries to provide funding. What do you think of this proposal?"
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Fund.
And unfortunately, those contributions are very weak.
The monitoring mission for the implementation of standard rules.
When I worked for these six years, there was hardly any support.
Except for China and Austria.
It always means that I thank this state for this support.
The main supporting country is my country, Qatar.
Which established the office through which we were able to implement many activities and projects, thank God.
Yes, this lack of support indicates what?
It means just as we posed at the beginning, and this point is always raised.
The conditions of ordinary people
And how should we care for people with disabilities or attend to the disabled?
It means that there is a genuine, genuine, and serious commitment.
In all cases, in all categories.
People with disabilities, children, adolescents, migrants, refugees
All of us will indeed reach a level where what is called
Equality of opportunity, participation, and equality
And there are those voices that always demand, never tire, and never cease.
In the Islamic and Arab regions, why don't they allocate a part, pardon me?
In favor of these programs and projects
As I presented the truth, I thank him from this platform.
Islamic Bank for Development
I included the balance in the allocated budget.
This non-compliance you mentioned regarding the payment of financial dues.
Does financial aid for people with disabilities only include developing countries and Arab states, or is it broader?
Even advanced countries do not provide.
It means the person who was before me, who is Swedish, yes.
Some other countries in the European Union
And certainly, there are many countries, especially in the Arab region, that might not have...
You are even aware of the existence of this special rapporteur.
In my case, it means what happened.
And so Sweden and China
And unfortunately, the Arab world too had many promises, but unfortunately, it was only one state.
We will talk about the Arab region, but...
We have more connections. Hamad Al Mari from Qatar, please go ahead, Hamad.
Peace be upon you.
And upon you be peace.
Dr. Hello, Sheikh Hessa.
Almost ten years
This girl, now we notice, has a mental disability.
So, what role do you play, in terms of this kind of girl, in her suffering?
She is with her colleagues.
"مع" means "with" or "together", and "يعني احيانا حتى لو بقينا" translates to "it means sometimes even if we stay".
So, what is your role in relation to Qatari girl children?
Thank you very much, Hamad Al Mari. You spoke to us from Qatar, Kروان Bahjat from Kuwait. Welcome.
As they say, "Sheik, a lesson."
Why don't we keep our oil in its crude form?
Arab people with special needs can be counted.
We can help them.
We have immense financial capabilities.
We can break the psychological barrier between us and them.
Reviving the moral spirit of the individual
And use it for this noble purpose.
This if we are indeed believers.
Thank you and appreciation to Sheikhah Hissa for her efforts and what she has done during her terms as the Special Rapporteur.
With our gratitude and appreciation to her, and thank you to the State of Qatar for all it has done for the special needs.
Thank you very much, Aisha Mohammed, for telling us from Qatar.
Peace be upon you, Professor Waseela.
And peace be upon you.
And on your kind hospitality
Happy Sheikhah Hessa
My question is about prevention.
As they say, prevention is better than cure.
There is a higher level of disability beyond wars and traffic accidents.
At the genetic level, perhaps the result is due to a shortage on the part of families, that is, marrying relatives.
I believe this is a significant percentage.
They lead to disability.
Thank you very much to our flag bearer, Sharif from Tunisia, who shared his story with us, and I'll be back to you as a guest.
The first caller, Hamad Al-Mari, wondered about...
He has a girl with a mental disability.
He wonders where he is heading.
In every country
Sure, here is the translation: "Certainly, there are services provided for all types of disabilities in the state of Qatar."
Due to these disabilities, whether mental disabilities like what we mentioned or any psychological disabilities.
Regarding schools
In the past, there was
Is it the private education, I mean the Ministry of Education and Training, which has now become the Supreme Council?
The flag bearer, Sharif from Tunisia, pointed to a very important point.
and scientific papers and other materials
"B is a program for organizations that work with disabilities only, but even within the campaigns that..."
Programs for teenagers
All of this has led to many campaigns and reproductive health programs.
I spoke about this aspect.
Adopt health strategies
You raise awareness.
The risks of marrying relatives
and genetic factors
And he believed in his country, Qatar.
And by custom and tradition, but it takes time for sure.
Especially in traditional communities
But over time, there will be a response to it, but it is necessary that it be under legal obligation, meaning...
Yes, Kروان Behjat questioned and suggested that one percent of the Arab states' budget be allocated.
To help the disabled, let me start first.
Yes, there is the statistical appreciation that the World Health Organization has applied to the whole world.
There are forty or approximately forty million disabled people.
Half of them are women.
But these numbers are doubling
There is a study in South Africa that observed and proved
Certainly, the statistics that have emerged about the war in Iraq are similar to those about the war in Gaza.
Every victim met three disabled people.
And since our Arab region has become an undisputed region of conflicts.
Even the proposal made by Bahgat Krouan
One percent won't be enough.
To assist people with disabilities in the Arab region if...
The issue of proportionality regarding disabled individuals or other marginalized groups.
Sincerely and truly, I don't think they agree.
which demands addressing their problems and needs
You confirmed that people with disabilities are the most neglected.
The censuses conducted by governments generally do not account for people with disabilities.
Correct, this is also linked to societal culture and sometimes to restrictions.
"المجتمعيه" in this context translates to "social" or "community-based" meaning when a population census is conducted by the government or a relevant authority.
The relevant devices
About having a disabled person in the house.
There was only one question asked: Is there anyone disabled or not?
The relevant section for this subject, and through the concerned parties there.
Cooperate in preparing a questionnaire.
We recommended more details.
First clarify if this person with a disability is male or female.
And whether his assistant is awake or not.
In fact, even with the number, as I understood, why didn't we reach the exact result?
To have such interest in Fatima Al Dosari's progress with us from Qatar, welcome Fatima.
And upon you be peace.
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a child with a disability.
And I offer my thanks to the ruler of the country, Sheikh Hamad.
And his wife, Lady Moza, has forbidden him from keeping this category.
Indeed, I am proud to boast of the care and attention I have received.
On its important role
Kindly travel, please.
Because they represent a major disability in society without education and without treatment.
Thank you very much for your kind words, Al-Mesifri from Qatar. With you, we have a breeze.
Abdelkrim from Jordan, please take a seat.
Please, we would be honored to hear from you.
And upon you be peace.
Thank you, to be honest, I have a comment.
First off, I am an audiologist and I have worked in the state of Qatar for approximately four years.
And we had a month of awareness for hearing and speech problems and
We were holding conferences, lectures, and awareness campaigns for the deaf.
Now I want to talk about Jordan. I have been living in Jordan for almost three years.
Frankly, it offers new and great services.
Frankly, you are offering new services, both material, immaterial, and spiritual.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education and Higher Education means in the sources.
The one that falls under the Ministry of Education and Training in government schools.
Similarly, we as private institutions
We receive wonderful and beautiful support.
Well, cream of kindness, do you have a direct question only due to time constraints? I apologize to you.
Do you have a direct question?
In the country of Qatar, in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan offers excellent services and in my opinion, they are truly exceptional.
Commenting on what was said in the viewer's communications
It means a person who works in this field.
Regarding the subject
I will also return to the issue of the agreement.
Which become binding upon ratification and accession.
And it is a duty on this state or on these organizations.
Because it stems from the issue of rights for these individuals regardless of
Frankly, what exactly?
The actions taken during that period for the disabled and not
And you wish now that it would come true.
Of course, I wish from either...
I hope that this research or survey is used as a benchmark and that more qualitative research is conducted in this field.
Also, this experience made it clear to me.
His six-year experience is
And coordination among Arab countries as well.
They also have a role, it's not just about rights, they are the recipients of rights.
I thank you, Sheikh Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, the former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
We welcome the elegant presenter from Al-Doriya and Al-Kass channels, Lana, Good morning.
I am also delighted to welcome the brilliant captain, Ali Qasim, to the Al-Ahly Club.
Welcome, Ali!
Welcome to you.
Good morning
I'll leave you space to congratulate each other; everyone will congratulate in their own way, because I've saved some for myself.
I had a five-hour open studio session and, frankly, I had two hours of unproductive time today.
The State of Qatar, its land, government, and people, definitely deserve this global achievement.
I was given the opportunity to congratulate and congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
He and his heir, Sheikh Tamim.
Yes, of course. Since you are from the mathematical field and work in this area and have a great deal of knowledge in these lines and this field.
Because even we
And we competed, meaning we deserved it when we took six votes between us and America, fourteen for Qatar and eight for America.
I'm not tired because our file is rich, comprehensive, and backed by many ambassadors. Let's focus on the fields.
Some people were afraid that there might be something like America.
And perhaps in some countries, these things are already ready, so they don't need to prepare stadiums or any special projects for this event.
Because the Urdu scripts are ready.
But they were just afraid of this point.
Captain Ali, you are incredible. I expect this to be a very important achievement for the athletes.
It is expected to fall under the realm of political economy, health policy.
Just criative
What does this quantum achievement mean?
Of course, it's a great achievement, especially for us athletes. Even non-athletes can see how happy they are.
Inshallah, let me know that right at the moment of the announcement.
By God, I was leaving the gym and we were listening to the radio.
We used to wait for him, and I was with one of my friends.
We're in the car, with the radio on.
The first time they announced Qatar and W
We both screamed and, of course, we failed to open it.
My friend went up through the opening.
Shouting, the world watches, our dangerous work and the march of our souls.
We swept the path from the beginning.
Thank God, it wasn't a very special day as I expected, and all channels perhaps focused heavily on this event.
Lana, you are surely present within this topic.
And especially the channels dedicated to sports.
How did they celebrate this event and what was their reaction?
So there were media with many channels from around the world.
The main teacher has indeed become clear on the map, a well-known place in Qatar.
Certainly, "أكيد علي أيظا يعني وجود اللاعب في المنتخب" translates to: "Of course, it also means the presence of the player in the national team."
And expect this to be a responsibility largely on his shoulders.
What do you think about this specific point?
Well, Captain Ali, what are the qualities that this player should possess to be part of this team?
Now, in more than one athletic event, the way is coming.
And now, we need to raise a strong generation.
He means and has basic rules and mathematical techniques for the sport of football in a studied way.
What are the rules and fundamentals that must be present in this player?
I believe that professionalism encompasses everything.
The desire for exercise, consistency in exercise, discipline.
Hey, all these are essential things to help the player put all their effort into the games or practices.
Every stage has its own unique character.
She has her own quirks and senses.
From various programs, from variety shows to sports, where do you find the most beautiful? Where do you feel most yourself?
By God, it's sweet.
It really makes you take care of yourself, you know how I take care through sports, that's the most important.
Later, you have football, the beloved of the masses, followed by everyone, whether you like it or not, when you miss the opportunity, you will have to love it.
The media's bias towards one side harms us.
What confines you like this, puts you in a specific side.
It's not a condition, just a matter of time.
Both sports and medicine are so sweet, what a sport!
Ali also means that in several important things, we should talk about them.
I didn't expect you to come back looking like this; it would be like you're ten years younger to reach 2022.
I didn't wish for this.
Of course, one would definitely wish for such a thing, especially since the World Cup means that any player now...
If watching a World Cup match makes one happy, then imagine how one would feel playing in the World Cup.
I hope they live up to expectations, God willing, and this is their chance, God willing.
What word would a professional player like to say to you? What word do you want to say from the bottom of your heart to them?
We'd love it if you could be present with us during this period.
And God, it's just like what we currently mean by permission.
He returned to the Gulf Cup after an absence of 16 years.
You definitely mean that you have a beautiful mark from Qatar TV and sweet memories.
"Mashallah, it means that Qatar's TV has now become like a university graduating a large number of media professionals."
Our team is a strong one, God willing, it will reap many different awards.
Let's talk about this in relation to the club's mission of revitalizing communities.
What's your job there? How are things there, God willing, are you comfortable?
Sure, the translation of the given text is: "Definitely, thank God honestly, or originally."
Yesterday, of course, he was with us in the studio, and we talked a lot about the players.
I expect that some of the younger people who are following us still feel like they belong to this group.
Desirable
It means a natural state in the traditional professional league and the transfer of players.
I have hoped that I would have the opportunity to restore my honor, either as a witness or as a victim.
I was able to take the Asia Cup place with the team, thank God.
And thank God, all is well with the team.
How can we make sports a social issue?
And in Qatar, how can we introduce sports for women, children, and youth?
Connecting them all means that everything complements the sport.
You have to acknowledge the significant role women play in various fields of sport.
There is a growing awareness of sports among all individuals, from young to old, in this community.
It takes about a year, or even up to 10 years, to reach this occasion. I think that's enough time.
Because the new generations keep emerging and staying updated.
In the generation we are living in, we are growing up, but for the generation after, we also need to establish a sports awareness from a young age.
We aspire. Aspire is something we cannot deny. It's a big statement from a great founder.
One number for the new generation of athletes.
All we have to do is set our intentions and take off.
They particularly love football.
How do I engage the audience to stay connected throughout all the different matches, even between different clubs?
And God, this honesty is a problem for us in the Qatari league, which is the lack of spectators.
But here's the problem, attendance means that the Qatar Football Association has not yet found a solution to attract spectators.
What is the style we need to attract them to follow these matches?
It depends on the person, some don't like to be restricted, some prefer to have the freedom to act as they please.
Media plays a crucial role in the public's disengagement.
And now they have created a system of tickets or a points collection system.
Lala is the union in the sense that it has a number of steps to attract the masses.
Some clubs have facilities like Al Rayyan that attract audiences. Of course, Al Rayyan is rich, meaning it doesn't need audiences.
Some clubs need some of their management to organize activities and events.
The public's right to be informed is a fundamental principle. I believe these are the means to achieve that.
The term "العيبه" means the new generation.
Their love for their work is their belief in their abilities, not just financial support, but also moral support, which is very beneficial.
We certainly mean to thank you for this pleasant meeting, Allah be praised.
We'd love to take this opportunity to quote your final words on this amazing win, where Qatar naturally won the 2022 World Cup file. Feel free to start.
We return to our initial argument that Qatar has not only kept its promises but exceeded them, consistently fulfilling its commitments.
With God's permission, Captain Ali will now deliver the final words he wishes to share in this meeting.
And I say to them, "Congratulations, and hopefully forward!"
Thank you, Captain and player Ali Qasim, and we wish you all the success, God willing, in your athletic career and in your life as well. God bless you, Lord.
And let us love sports more and more.
The topic of the episode is young talents.
Some young people think that these songs are just popular now, but they have a deep and rich history.
A group of young people sing Arabic or English words.
Today, we will continue this topic with a group of rap enthusiasts.
And we will get to know them intimately through our meeting that will bring us together on air.
Welcome to all our viewers, wherever you are.
A new type of singing has spread in the Arab and Gulf scenes in recent years.
Coming from the West, specifically America, it's rap music.
And before diving into the topic of rap singing
There is a tendency to use any word without any restraint.
Anyone can sing rap.
Regarding writing lyrics
Almost all rap artists write their own lyrics.
Generally, all these details are numerous and important, and we will learn about them through two people deeply involved in this field.
They made a beautiful division.
Welcome Yusuf Al-Na'imi and Salman Abdullah Yusuf. Good morning.
Welcome to you, Salman. Good morning.
Good morning, welcome.
I am very happy to have you with us through this program, of course.
And also, of course, through the subject of rap singing.
What's your business in this, Yusuf?
We realized that rap art wasn't just a thing that existed in the streets.
Because of its sweetness
By the tongue of the citizen
Some of them include joyful, sad, and political topics.
Yes, I am the original rap.
And these songs are an art form, just like visual art, where an artist paints a picture, or a poet writes a poem.
The singer can sing, the player can play any instrument.
You sense acceptance from the Qatari society and the Gulf society for this type of song.
Two thousand and ten
There's a growing trend where people enjoy owning CDs of rap music.
Different ages
And there are families, and there are, in fact, a lot of people who have started listening more than in the past.
So it was like a website
And how many of you are in this team so far?
Everyone can say words, write poetry, and deliver them in a rap style.
The rapper, and God, just as you say, you can say that he who sings himself is the one who sings.
He's the one who plays sometimes, and he's the one who writes the words.
Oh okay
Listen to it, and God, I recorded this song.
Okay, so all these songs that I've produced, are they from Salman, or Yusuf, or anyone else from the same band?
Didn't you think it would be on a specific CD sold in stores?
But you know that when you're a character, it means I go make an album and put it on the market, which is a difficult commercial record and procedures.
Well, why didn't you think that with twenty-five of you, one hand can't clap all the time?
You all have twenty-five hands, God keep you all safe as brothers and youth.
You can promote this CD through more than one website on the internet.
You have Facebook, you have YouTube, you also have it through local newspapers.
There are twelve songs, as far as I know.
Registration is at the same time.
A little foggy, but it was meant to be clear.
The quality is a bit weak, but it's not the same as before, it's obvious.
And he has almost fifty CDs.
It means that I can't express what there is not to say, because some young people might know this art form for ten years.
The registration is no longer active and I expect distribution in this period, now it's different.
And especially that there is a large collection of music, a large collection of techno music genres now.
These are young people or these are artists who produce a large collection of beautiful songs.
We should also talk about the parties you've attended.
And by God, look at the party that means in Doha, we participated in just one party.
Of course, our Al Sadd Club organized them, so they didn't join us.
Look at the audience.
See something that we didn't expect.
And what surprised us is that the families, the families themselves, are more numerous.
Families are more numerous than young people.
"It was as if the organization was a masterpiece."
We were quite confused and it was kind of our first time in Doha.
It means we expected no demand.
But the audience's response was amazing.
And it was a long period of benefits of songs, i.e.
Alright, let's listen to a part of one of the songs I composed, for example, that was released to the public and received approval from young people in particular.
For example, let's hear some words so that they also become clear to the viewer.
And we can hear it on the radio.
At your convenience, please proceed.
Stay safe.
The problem is that "a few words" means.
Let's listen to it.
I don't know.
We're currently airing Doha Morning Program.
One wakes up in the morning with an open mind.
Salman has been like a mountain for five years, standing firm in the face of adversity.
Even if one doesn't accept it, they're still poor.
I brought a lot of people together.
I need a few words
Okay, the songs that you sang, for example, give me a sentence from one of the sentences you said, for example.
It's not random, not all songs are. The ones he just mentioned, they're called "Free Style" in English.
It means the same weight.
But when we sing a song, it means that the words come together and form a meaning.
Thank you, let's continue it.
We can say "Good morning, my country, Good morning, Qatar" with the Doha Morning program.
Stay visible, present, and direct with the viewers.
They see one, two, three, and they do a little bit of art.
With us is the Doha Morning Program.
Of course, the beautiful song that you saw.
I'm insisting right now that young people need to be present online and everywhere.
I greet you truly, when did you record it?
It was a shared space.
Each one of us is accustomed to his own rights.
I feel like Joseph can't quite accept my words, or he takes them but can't act on them.
So each one takes words.
We certainly mean to expect that every artist, every painter, and every poet is always
It is also possible to write about the love for sports.
In love with the homeland itself
You definitely participated in the national day through the parade.
Through your beautiful songs, you also represent Qatar, as you are young Qataris.
Doha is decorated to welcome the Asian Cup, of course, and there is a grand parade on the Corniche.
To receive this event
We're sharing these clips with you for obvious reasons.
Doha welcomes the Asian Cup
From Doha Airport to now.
And we continue together these live clips.
The presence of such audiences, just as the presence of these students, is essential.
And arrived early this morning at Doha Airport, Qatar Airways, to complete.
Preparations for hosting the major continental event
We return to our guests, Yusuf and Salman, who are illuminating the studio.
His perception is that Arab rap from the Gulf, particularly from Qatar, is a distinct genre.
We can say this about you.
And God knows best, it means that currently, we mean...
I'm not sure I'm ready for a party.
But now you're working on a specific party, and it will be announced, God willing, Yusuf.
Inshallah, but it's not certain, that's just the beginning of the journey.
At the beginning of your journey, we wish you all the best and be assured that our program, God willing, will be your supporter with all our hearts.
Also, where do you all meet as young people, 25 people?
Where is the meeting held and how do you share and write down the ideas?
Sure, here is the translation: "There must definitely be collaborative songs."
It's not necessary for one person, whether it's Salman, Yusuf, or anyone else, to sing a complete song.
There should be some harmony between you, and when and how you listen.
By God, it's hard to gather twenty-five people all at once.
So, I'll start by talking to Youssef, then to someone else, and to them, so that maybe we can all meet in one place today.
To understand the idea behind the song and the lyrics.
And on his second attempt
Register what is on me
Blindfold him while he continues.
This is it, Yusuf will finally register and send me the wire when he's ready.
See the various experiences that exist outside
Taking (or acquiring) means owning several CDs by major artists.
You'll gain some experience, if you learn from them, that means some techniques.
Hey, for sure we're always meaning...
Artists who have been in this field for years or who have experience and a position in this field.
One hears them and observes their methods and ways, trying to create their own style, meaning they don't imitate them.
It means that I don't care if I use the same style, the same tone of voice, and the same level of words.
I am just imitating, I am not doing anything new, I am just doing something that is special to me.
It means we rely on them a little.
Yes, I also expect there to be a large number of young Gulf Arabs in the Gulf itself.
In a primitive style, we follow this report together, benefit from it, and also enjoy watching parts of it.
The enigmatic still surrounds that talent some people possess.
Using very primitive means
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah Al-Daail
Which is located a distance from the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
One hundred and fifty kilograms
He has exceptional ability and extensive experience.
And the discovery of shallow groundwater sites
And in depths that exceed 100 meters
You know that drilling wells is expensive.
But with the expert's presence, he can determine the appropriate place to dig the well.
Of course, the translation of "طبعا طريقه اكتشاف او" into English is: "Certainly, his discovery method."
Locating water
She has been like that since ancient times.
And they were the elders of our fathers and our ancestors of old.
They use experts to locate the wells.
For digging
Abu Ibrahim's methods for discovering water.
Not modern devices.
An analysis of soil in scientific laboratories
He relies only on God's grace in his work.
And its channels beneath the earth.
They are either pomegranate seeds or raisins.
A branch of pomegranate or a branch of fig.
Now we practically apply the process of watercourse discovery.
Now you begin to see the end of this stream's course.
Go back again.
Go back, go back.
The current root returns here if anyone goes back, we will put a mark.
And here the watercourse ends.
His experience requires a great deal and much patience.
In order for the discoverer to reach the sensitivity of the movement of tools.
I went to more than one region.
Means a success rate of 95%.
Of course, here is the translation: "This is, of course, the method and the method of using copper bars."
Of course, a more literal translation would be: "It does not, of course, have a precise scientific interpretation."
In this way
It is astonishing to see the success rate of those who practice this primitive profession.
It exceeds 95%
In the discovery of shallow groundwater sources
"Praise be to God, who taught man what he did not know. This is a report, of course, that we have taken, of course, from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."
They created a special division and they have more than a CD of it.
It means whether it's online or some of them on the phone.
There are sometimes competitions between the Gulf countries: between Qatar and Bahrain, between Qatar and Kuwait, between Qatar and...
You can download a stronger song about a stronger topic.
About a problem, about, means... up to many topics.
Follow his example, or if I aspire to be like my role model, it means I realize that there is nothing.
Inshallah
At the same time, we also need to do this.
It also means a large collection of songs.
We try our best to transmit it.
We'll be in touch with you again soon.
Even we know what the news are first and foremost for this band.
But I insist on the band's name.
Rapers Qatar
We'll go back again, and if we're lucky, we'll find our hosts still there, and we'll return to the corniche and the beautiful atmosphere that...
We are definitely with you live through the live link we are currently sharing with our viewers.
Wherever you were on the corniche and the Asia Cup reception.
We certainly take pride in them and in the various arts.
It treats many social and psychological problems among youth.
But Yuna is in the studio with two people.
They will definitely finish the twenty-five.
We welcome you again, Abu Yusuf and Salman, may God welcome you once more.

So we tried to reach the company, not knowing where the company is, and no one answered us.
She needs to develop herself, at the very least, the one who is outside.
Facebook YouTube
This means sites like these.
In the name of the band
We, as beings, are always evolving.
Organize like we saw with some of you, Allah bless you, you did this work.
You use these songs to set a mood for a collection of images, your own personal pictures.
Download it on YouTube, download it on sites where there might be videos one can follow.
And by God, we have stayed in a similar place before.
And in songs, wide means
The obstacles you're currently facing are that there's no place that needs a company to adopt you.
You don't really need a place to bring you together as a team.
What are your aspirations such that you truly wish for them to be fulfilled and attain the high level you aspire to?
That means "We've finally caught up."
We'll tell you when we're ready, we'll organize for you, we'll drop the album for you.
Icon means something, means something formal.
Because it means it's a five-year period now.
It means hobby only.
Yes, we have shared things, we have shared programs, we have shared series.
If I wish to evolve into an icon
If it means something, it means it supports us, which means we're always with it.
Yes, we also need to know your wishes, Salman, not just Yusuf's. What else can you say?
The only security is mostly music videos.
God willing, we wish you all the best, hopefully through this team.
We wish you always have your songs present in the Arab world and around the globe.
Indeed, this is a refined art, an art that is largely heard.
And there are messages like what you said.
May you always be fueled, God willing, and we wish you all the success, God permitting.
Say hello to the whole group and good luck, God willing.
We will conclude this meeting with the song they made for the program.
With you is DJ KiD and DJ Mr. Bobo on the Doha Morning show.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Mr. Bobo and his SKT1 hot to be.
We can say "Good morning, my country, Good morning, Qatar" with the Doha Morning program.
Stay visible, present, and direct with the viewers.
And don't forget, the program airs at 9:30 AM, so everyone should be sitting in front of the TV.
They see one, two, three, and they do a little bit of art.
With us is the Doha Morning Program.
With us in numbers, Hassan Neama is with us in presentation, Shima Al-Hamadi.
With us in the end, Nasser Al-Maliki, guests of the episode, rappers from Qatar, for sure.
"تعاد" translates to "again" in English, and "يستفاد منها ف البيت" translates to "it is utilized at home." So, the complete translation of the text is: "Again, it is utilized at home."
There is in this cart or shopping trolley.
You can put anyone who shops at the supermarket or elsewhere there.
What kind of products do you put in the cart? Anything you want to buy?
A large screen appears in front of you, showing the components of this product.
This is also a great idea and feasible.
It just means that a simple parachute canopy makes an item visible in the vehicle.
And it makes the purchase easier for you at the buyer's end.
It takes full details on a special screen.
I expect that it will be like this in a healthier awareness.
When you have a device with you, whether it's the same cart or not.
Most of the components
And the dangers, what harm could they also cause?
"اتكون تفاصيل كامله فيها" translates to "be complete with all details" in English.
He is ambitious, for example, he has a number of projects, maybe four or five.
Treats traffic-related problems
It addresses traffic congestion and other parking problems, and it was also very creative and nice.
God willing, it is also the cultural center for children.
Let us, Professor Abdullah, also talk about the various activities that we will hopefully see in the coming days.
Yes, of course, there are surprises, but it happened so quickly.
If you love, I'll mention them from some of the projects I've seen.
This translates to: "For example, this navigation under the earth. Its main clever or creative idea is that..."
Every time someone leaves their home, it means a step forward.
They gather at a certain point.
These are, of course, all the pictures that the viewers are looking at; I expect they will enjoy them.
Innovations of children
Exactly, this is, for example, like the same cash machine.
For example, for women, I have a card.
Insert this card. For example, I need a black t-shirt.
For example, now some stores or, for instance, I have some missing things at home, a key, I don't know what.
What I understand, for example, is that the office keys are keys to...
Of course, the translation of the given text into English is: "Our main goal, naturally, is what Sheikh Moza wishes."
Haram of His Highness the Prince
At an early stage, which is of utmost importance in project design.
He was also selected from among three hundred children.
Then we also have promising orators in Ramadan.
Yes, she was the one who presented the closing ceremony. She was a host.
Indeed, it means we love to open our hearts and doors to all children who wish to present their programs.
And then they set off.
Our need for support and their presence is at the top of our priorities.
These projects and programs serve this main idea.
Despite the diversity and varied skills of children.
to self-development
Well, do you have such cooperation with some of the different clubs in Qatar, especially for the youth?
Also, there are scientific institutions in Qatar.
Of course, all our programs are built on partnerships.
That means all our programs are specialized partnerships.
With a set of specialized institutions providing community services, this organization focuses on developing these skills.
He is in partnership with all institutions concerned in the field.
The association is the Association of Photography.
The Girl Innovation Center, under the general secretariat of the Council of Ministers, also played a very significant role.
Yes, he played a significant role in explaining Qatar's vision.
Training children in it
Their polarization and encouragement of children, for all our programs are built on institutional partnerships.
According to the specialization of these projects and institutions.
What changed you?
Of course, our presence in Katara has given us a strong push and significant support.
And form faster
Currently, there are several projects in partnership with Katara that are being prepared for launch, hopefully within the next two months.
Of course, there is cooperation in many programs.
Especially what concerns reading.
Head of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
And we're in it now, especially since we're in a preparation time.
Building a promising scientific future for all children, future generations, and the coming youth, God willing.
The message I would like to convey to parents, the youth who follow us, and the children who wish to be part of the center.
From what we give now
Our children sometimes have ideas that we should not underestimate or belittle.
We must pay attention to it, no matter what these ideas are.
Because actually, if someone is interested in this idea, they will develop it, at the very least, by nurturing the child's love for thinking.
It is very important for me to pay attention.
I spiritually connect with him, I connect with him now. Our big problem is that most parents...
He provides him with support.
Encouragement is offered to motivate parents and educators.
The more they give attention to their imagination, the brighter our future will be. Today's children are the foundation of this future.
We actually lived while wandering through this exhibition among their projects.
He was living in a dream.
It means in a dream, all the thoughts are vast imagination.
And now, dreams definitely become reality. Many dreams have come true and have become a reality.
And praise be to God. We wish, God willing, success to our children who were present.
Our hope is in you, Inshallah.
In the name of God
Of different ages and genders
I have reached seventy projects.
They are pioneering and new projects in execution.
To talk more about this exhibition.
National and also from the Cultural Center for Childhood
Professor Abdullah also, at the beginning, means this: briefly tell us about the exhibition.
What lies within it brings together many events, undoubtedly. So, in brief, what can we say about this exhibition?
It became a new pattern of expression for children to convey their love, loyalty, and sense of belonging to their country.
Of course, it came under the patronage of the Minister of Education and Higher Education.
In the midst of the display, this display came about.
It grows with him until it reaches twenty or thirty.
Of course, we started training children to see 20-30 with its five axes.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, and environmental development
The first thing he knows now is that Qatar will reach twenty-thirty (20-30) in the future.
Then he begins to think about how his way of thinking is.
How does one foster creativity and generate innovative ideas?
I expect that means his field is wide, indeed, praise be to God.
But when we give it specific codes and assist it
I expect his thinking will grow even more and more.
Professor, you have launched the exhibition under the slogan "Such as the dreams of generations, the realities of tomorrow."
It is the flag of the dreams of today's generations.
He will be a part of Qatar's tomorrow, Qatar's future.
We actually felt this while walking with the children, when the child says, "That's right, Minister of Happiness."
I want you to launch my project. I invite you to visit my project in twenty-three.
The child thinks after twenty years.
He expresses his love for his country and what he means by his field of passion.
It definitely involves various activities, events, and competitions.
And among them was the winner of the Science Stars Award.
And among the winners of the first prize of the Arab League University.
Of course, all the children
On the sidelines of the exhibition, there were various displays according to a scheduled timetable.
Displaying their projects they have done means during the exhibition.
And Allah's blessing is upon the distinguished attendance.
Science Stars
Some of the winners of the projects that participated in the exhibition.
She also won one of the main awards.
The equivalent in English for "اللي اهيه الغابه او المحميه" is: "What is the forest or the protected area."
We also don't need to talk about the colored ball.
And the colorful future, of course, we are also part of the vision and the dream of children for Qatar's future.
Also thinking about twenty-two and twenty-three
How can a child contribute to a creative project for twenty-two and twenty-five years old?
Its main idea is to have a slice present in the ball.
Judging by color.
If, for example, you go to a match, everyone will be watching the referee's movements with the ball.
He controls the movements of the players on the field and the changes through this electronic slice.
What's inside the ball
Of course, the ideas are creative, naturally. The main idea is that people might be surprised and ask us many questions.
And these projects.
We always say we've come a long way with the children.
At this stage of skill formation or development, it's about expanding their horizons.
I gave them an idea for expressing love for the homeland through these projects.
By giving them confidence in how to present their project to an audience and explain their idea,
In the realm of his interests, something he loves, all of this is an achievement, an accomplishment.
And provided support that was support meant to be valued and appreciated from me.
Now enters the stages of development and
With the support of several officials, the support of the committee, and expecting the support of the public as well.
The forest was not the second forest because of this child.
**Method for Subscribing Channels: The pipes that currently allow visitors to enter under the ground**
It is a large protected forest.
The visitor strolls and sees animals, or more precisely, reptiles beneath the earth.
And there are sensors on some animals and a research center at ICIS that monitor the condition of the animals.
And in the marine environment and entering it in a creative way as well.
Her victory is also due to her wide and detailed imagination.
Of course, the translation of the given text is: "This, of course, is the people's way to..."
Of course, the English translation of "في طبعا من يتكلم عن عن عن مدينه سياحيه تحت ال تحت الماء" is: "Naturally, there are people talking about an underwater tourist city."
Who speaks of a city for butterflies?
Who speaks of a forest, a forest on the earth.
About whom is it speaking about many tourist ideas?
It means exciting.
Maybe this is something that children's minds need now, in the years 2350-2500.
And in the future, perhaps these things will indeed come to pass.
It means in three projects.
The scientific club adopted them, these projects, I need them now, I want to work on them.
For example, a project that deals with air conditioning water systems.
Let's take a look at the Arabic newspaper now.
And the news says that Qatar University celebrates graduation.
In the presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al-Mahmoud
The Minister of Education and Higher Education is the Secretary-General of the Higher Education Council.
Dr. Sheika bint Abdullah Al-Misan, President of the University.
A good achievement definitely means a lot to the beautiful university.
Qatar Society is also a Kaligari Society.
And also these sweet news we're reading about our students.
A pioneering academic achievement, God willing, and we wish you success in all fields, God willing.
He is considered one of the young faces that are strongly emerging in the Qatari drama scene.
And for how long, categories and colored threads?
And artist Abdelhamid Al-Sharshani is among the artists who shaped their own identity.
If it were not convincing.
He would not have been chosen to be part of the projects being implemented inside Qatar.
And currently, artist Abdelhamid Charshani is participating in the series 'Deadly Feeling' and the classification of the second part.
We are delighted to have you as our guest this morning.
Let's discuss with him his participation in these two important projects and his overall experience.
Welcome and hello to you, good morning.
I am honored to be a guest on Doha Morning Program for the first time, and it's a first for you to be with us in the Doha Morning.
And thanks to the people who are working hard on the program.
And you are Lisa's sister.
Welcome, let's begin our dialogue.
Let's see!
I am a responsible and administrative man.
And apply the laws.
All I can tell you.
Take the coat.
Later, listen, why did I come here?
Go see them if someone agrees that you didn't return the coat.
I had another question, of course, but since we've seen this clip from the first season of the series...
Referring to Khalid ibn al-Walid
Some historians attribute the great poet Amru al-Qais to the city of Al-Mada'in.
Many affairs and information related to this city in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
And for more, we continue with this beautiful report from colleague Abdulrahman Marashid.
We continue with some others.
It is indeed a testimony of one who knows neither flattery nor favoritism.
And as a confirmation of the antiquity of this or that city.
And as much as we see from its traces and hear what has been said about it by its narrators and poets.
Their old and new, for that is a rich record added to the city's record.
And Medina is one of the cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
It is an ancient country historically established in the pre-Islamic era.
And historians differ in the reason for its naming.
Some attribute it to 'Amr al-Qais al-Kindi, the famous poet.
And the spring (al-Ghadir) attributed to him.
Its date of establishment is unknown.
Pre-Islamic era
The most famous thing in the city of Marath is Mount Qamiat, which is often used in proverbs.
Because it exists in the city and is attached to it.
These places are also archaeological sites.
It is very common, as this landmark is considered a tourist attraction in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Her municipality has made tremendous efforts several times to do the work.
I am a park on top of this mountain.
And sessions for parents and all residents of the kingdom.
It is named after the distinguished companion Khalid ibn al-Walid, may God be pleased with him.
To fight the apostates and the false prophet.
From her traces, too, is the Well of Kamit.
It is a flood plain that stores water for a long period.
And it was one of the most important water sources in the past era.
And among its legacies is also a clear house for heritage.
The city's history dates back to pre-Islamic times.
She is renowned for her poets who ignited their poetry.
By its beauty, its ruins, and its famous mountain, Kites.
Abdulrahman Al-Marshid on Doha Morning Program
The city is located several times north of Riyadh.
We return once again to our dear guests.
It would be great if we could inform and educate viewers about these methods and tools.
As I mentioned initially, our infrastructure team has a very specific infrastructure.
We open a page where it is registered and has a special file on our system.
His father's email
This manipulation includes an increase in focus, writing speed, glue speed, and overall distraction.
The authority figure has a complete deception.
This deception is a good addition to the student's file.
Through the internet on his son's file
And he sees how much his son has progressed.
And he sees his grades and also his attention with the teachers.
Even we actually enjoy the intelligence of this beautiful girl.
We took most of the children present at the center and sent them our warmest greetings.
I entered this center as a willing student through this center.
And we recognize her intelligence and the level she has reached, of course, from her entry into this center.
Of course, the year.
I focus on work after Ramadan.
But of course, that would be unfair, as it would judge one work based on others. Always.
And there are people who only watch TV during Ramadan.
He watches TV and people have turned the month of worship into a TV show.
"Lighten up on the series, ease up. Let it be done in two years, it's better."
Of course
Inshallah, they will accept me during Ramadan.
But hopefully, I'll send you all my greetings.
And Allah knows best (Inshallah)
Also in the plays that
Of course, from the art of drama to the art of fashion.
A fashion show was held at the Katara Cultural District.
We definitely continue with you with all the love and truth.
And it develops children's capabilities and skills even more.
Different from the various schools existing in this generous homeland.
We have a certain model, we've discussed this with our guests who were with us.
We have with us today Professor Ibrahim Hussein Abdul Salam. Welcome and good morning.
How are you, Amine?
Praise be to God.
By what page are we currently on?
Professor Ibrahim, at the outset, let's get to know the materials that are presented through this center.
And as an example, the security concern.
He also went with her the method or way that the teacher, Nasma, spoke about.
He feels like something has changed in his mind.
You feel that these skills and these methods
Things were changing regarding his skills in relation to his mind, even to the point that his educational level would change.
Scientific methods
One of the things I do first is conduct a global test called the Tony Test for children before starting anything else in my program.
I started working on the second part of the new test as well.
We can measure through it the level or the difference in level of the student.
A quick math test or questions will be conducted now.
She will calculate and respond over the air all the time.
Of course, Amnie has no clue about these questions at all.
We are in their shoes on this issue.
Of course, I had another question at the beginning.
We ask about your participation this year in the second round.
What is your contribution telling us?
Of course, after we have presented one classification series.
Of course, the translation of "طبعا الحمدلله الله وفقني في عده ادوار" into English is: "Of course, thank God, Allah has guided me through several stages."
Professor Ganem
Roles are distributed, of course, with the executive producer Ashraf Shatah and the great professor.
Of course, an opportunity from Tar Company for artistic production.
Frankly, youth have the right.
Professor Ganem, of course, this year nominated me for a position.
Of course, each ring is different.
I have a few rings where I will make engravings.
And on the other hand, these experiences are sweet, of course, because they exist in work.
A pyramid among Kuwait's pyramids, Professor Saad Al-Faraj
We have artists from Bahrain: Abdullah Malik Ali Al Ghareer
Like Ali Mirza, we are like...
With you as well is a group of young people, Abdullah Adham.
We have another young man, Abdullah Al-Asem, with us.
We've been doing two jobs a year since last year.
Maybe this is why your husband asked you if you've been smoking since 1979.
But I didn't know that achieving your thing or dream through art was possible.
Praise be to God for all things.
You are either studying art properly or it's just a hobby.
I didn't take it as a talent, I am not.
I took art as a talent, of course, the one who supported me in my beginning was the artist Abdul Aziz Jasim, of course.
The artists who consider me as a person like their son.
Anything I should tell him?
Of course, we're all watching the series.
We went out, put in our best efforts, and thank God.
Now, if it weren't for Tara, a great thank you to Professor Abdelrahman Al-Sulti, a great, great thank you to Professor Abdelrahman.
If you compare us to Kuwait, in Kuwait, every year from twelve to thirteen new representatives emerge.
They have it.
Certainly, "الشكر اكتير اكبير" means "very great thanks," and "تعطي فرص" translates to "you are giving opportunities."
Just let's talk.
We talk about the series "Al-Sani Ta'nif" (The Second Category), We've heard some ideas about it.
The deadly feeling too
And the foot is also the foot of a man.
With us is a sure model, with us is the processor, Professor Abdul Aziz Al-Maeouf Al-Tamimi.
In order to complete this process live on air.
And let's see how we can work on the personality. For example, first let me greet Professor Sabih Abdullah, may God greet him.
Welcome to you. Peace be upon you and the mercy of God.
If we're starting with you as our teacher, please go ahead.
With God's permission.
In the name of God, of course.
Hold the hand
Let's see the nerves.
It was as if it was a drawing or a message from God, Almighty, revealing all the members of your body.
Inside, her problems.
I get headaches sometimes.
Headache and dizziness
Relax your hand, calm your nerves, yes.
That's how Professor Abdul Aziz will discover his specific condition through his hand, as he suffers from a particular illness.
The person on the left side has a mild inflammation of the middle ear.
In the exam, it says "Good luck. What does this mean, Professor Abdul Aziz?"
You have a problem with your ear.
Who created me when I was small?
Here I feel a pain too.
Nasal cavities
The pain in my nose is giving me a headache here.
I have a headache here.
He has a problem with his nasal sinuses.
She has a headache between the eyes.
Weight increases without eating.
It means that the person with hypothyroidism feels a bit tired, has constant lethargy and feels heavy in the body.
Too much sleep
He is always feeling heavy due to excessive sleep or body laziness.
Chronic tonsillitis
There's a tremor that you can feel.
He's stressed and of course you don't walk barefoot all the time, maybe the last time.
My brother is from Tunisia.
Man, you've told us things about him.
Does this massage also work for children?
Pain is a right, the pain of God, measured by the child's belly.
What do our children usually sleep on?
When you take it off, it's not because he loves to take it off; people think he loves to take it off because he has a bloated stomach, may God bless you.
As soon as the mother puts her lips together, the father stretches out his thumb.
An icon in the child's belly
The hands are opposite the child.
Let's just see, every mom can learn this move.
It seems like you're describing movements, possibly for a game or a dance. Here's a possible translation: "Press right, left, right, left."
This is about the child, and about how sweet the child is.
Well, regarding discoveries, do you have specific ones, especially for women?
It means, "As we said, ninety percent in every house, praise be to God, may He protect them from women."
First thing and first warning: ceramic and equalized flooring.
When we walk barefoot on ceramic tiles, of course, our problem is that we can't always keep doing that. We might be able to do it on an even surface, but it's dangerous.
Walking barefoot or proof that the absence of ceramic flooring in homes has increased health problems.
Because the land is cold and even.
When they had carpets, they had problems complaining about asthma.
Increased more
The girl is careful to focus on walking barefoot on her heels.
Now, the part that is translated is the heel area of the foot, which is the back of the heel.
This foot is here, now at the heel.
These are the first and second discoveries, respectively, that are making childbirth easier.
Just focus a little.
In the seventh or ninth month
As soon as you enter the city of birth, in general
It means "They came in the eighth hour, the most dangerous thing is that she is walking barefoot."
The pregnant woman should be careful while walking barefoot.
If you enter during the time of birth.
I seek refuge in God from the accursed devil. Shake yourself, and the palm tree will shake down ripe dates upon you.
We know that Mary (peace be upon her) was granted her sustenance directly.
"So, look, even the scholars in the field discussed this. They said, 'Why has the interpretation of Ibn Kathir changed?'"
I won't give you the idea that God has put in this science, He inspired me with it.
Shake a palm tree branch as the palm trees shake, of course, how come?
Sharp like a needle or a screw.
When the palm tree swayed, it gave commands to the wombs that had once been heavy with children in the midst of this.
The organs, or more specifically the uterine lining, have given us commands to facilitate childbirth through fetal positioning and modification.
The baby's head height or something adjusts throughout and comes out normal.
"Spare the Lord, how much benefit this fruit has."
Grip the hand, begin and guide it.
Some of them have made it a habit, and some of them know that it is indeed science.
They're afraid to tell you what they really think of you.
Yes, Professor Abdul Aziz, your discoveries are truly important.
I just wanted to know, what does the last question mean? Time, man, it flies!
One wants to communicate with you, any person who wants to communicate with you, a specific email. Are you...?
Alright, the mobile phone is in the control room. Anyone who wants to communicate with Professor Abdulaziz can contact us after the program.
Of course, here is the translation: "Please find Qatar TV's numbers so that they can contact us and take this number."
I was created only to serve people.
If we believe this, God will bless your work and keep people safe.
Sin as humans do, and act according to what any normal human would think.
We only aspire to good more than
Always think of good things.
Our viewers, God willing, also enjoyed this segment, of course, through reflexology and hand massage.
Also by foot
We witnessed a live demonstration on air where the person with us discovered what diseases he had.
What does that mean if we ask for your assistance, and whoever wants to can certainly reach out to him or her and also read about it online?
How can it be applied if it involves more schools in the coming days and years?
Good morning
How can we make this experience?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
The obesity problem in the Gulf countries has become a major problem.
We feared that Qatar is leading the fifth state with them.
And this program means that she has indeed become the First Lady of New York.
Their visit to Doha had a schedule for this.
They offered it to us, and we accepted it, no problem.
It means our students with students in New York with students in Spain with students in England.
So, let's even look at our brothers, our students in Qatar, how are they standing with countries around the world, and this is something we need for our future.
Because we encourage fruit consumption among students.
He stops playing sports.
Of course, the fifth week includes your family meal with the family.
Of course, these two birds with one stone.
Of course, the sixth week is about saying what we learned from this experience. Today, thank God, we are at the conclusion.
We are happy with the students.
They were three independent boys' schools, Abu 'Abideh.
Advanced independent daughters
Our morale is high.
It means that the family is aware, their siblings got excited at home, they started eating this food like them.
It became a multi-faceted interest among students, even extending to his home and his family.
They say I am like this or that's how they taught me.
The training staff or the one who provided this information to the students.
How were you chosen? How were the students contacted through whom?
Yes, we are indeed grateful to them, may God reward them well. It's a matter of several entities that have brought us joy.
And here, our brothers in the diet center teach them about healthy eating, too.
And learn good dining etiquette with sister Aisha Al-Tamimi.
How they organize themselves means how they eat, how they arrange things, and what their priorities are.
To teach cooking, sports, or awareness of the benefits of healthy food.
They were in the form of separate lessons, neither a curriculum nor
How to convey these ideas to the students?
In various ways, some of them were inside the school.
We started the program at the beginning of the semester by gathering all the students, boys and girls, in the Aspiration Zone.
Because this is not a matter concerning a specific individual, it concerns all of us, for these are our children.
How did the students start their work with?
That means you are saying the results were satisfactory.
But is it enough to have three specific schools or classes from these schools?
Now, of course, it's the first experience in the world. When things start, they don't start on a large scale right away.
It starts on a reasonable scale with all the qualities of independent boys and girls, especially.
In order to align with, for example, our culture, our environment, and the conditions of families, families, for instance, accept things for their children that they wouldn't accept for themselves.
"Fibon means they are actually involved in it, and it is truly important."
A student who is twelve or thirteen years old at this time is old enough to know about his health.
This means that this suffering means that many people, and God knows this, are weak, but they imagine that it is an impossibility.
It means that some heroes we see in movies with such powers and weak bodies, it's like something magical, not real.
We talked in detail, but unfortunately, there are many weeks ahead that we didn't realize we'd need to cover.
We can also remind them of it during the Doha morning.
And the fruits that contain vitamin B, that is, what you can get from fruits or vegetables.
The human being knows the benefits of fruits and knows that if he eats them, it means he is starting to improve his health, so it gives him motivation.
In the fruit section, they would go to the supermarket and pick their fruit.
For example, this point.
Diversity, of course, means competition. Each school distinguished itself through its teachers and innovative ideas.
The spirit of competition is the spirit of
We gave them the general idea, and each one added their own creativity.
The teachers here are the ones who train the students, and there's no special staff here.
We train them, we train them.
Just means that the teachers were adding, for example, some schools like Abu Abide said that we will do Saturday for student activities.
For example, on one of those days after school, they decided to adopt a high-end school. They said they would be able to make it happen.
We'll have a healthy cooking day as girls, okay, we didn't force the boys to cook healthily themselves; the girls' work means they had more skill in this area.
Of course, the thanks go to Al-Rayan Water for providing schools with water free of charge. Al-Rayan Water has taken action on this issue.
Of course, it means healthier water because he will need to purify his body from all those toxic substances that enter his body daily through water.
This week we said third.
It means his body is now moving.
They can play football or basketball, but they don't know that it's these sports that I love.
It's exactly right, and some might want other games, some might not want any group games.
How much is it live on air?
Professor Mr. Abdul Aziz Al-Jaber, the founder and manager of the Qatari Multiple Sclerosis Patient Association, welcome to you.
And of course, we try to focus on most important topics as much as possible.
We wanted to introduce ourselves and our dear viewers to the disease Multiple Sclerosis.
Because this name might also be somewhat unfamiliar to us, please proceed.
The number of women affected is greater than the number of men.
All the treatments currently available are preventive treatments.
The white blood cells that are supposed to protect us are starting to fight us.
We fought by striking the nerve cell.
Simplest for a public is an electric wire.
Covered with its soft layer, called the "matting" to shake it off, it is a nylon layer.
Of course, it generally leads to imbalance, to double vision, to blurry vision.
Leads to digestive system problems respiratory system problems
In its worst cases, it leads to quadriplegia or hemiplegia.
Of course, treatments
The most important functions in the human body can be severely disrupted.
He suffers from a disease called multiple sclerosis.
Theories say it's a viral transmission.
It is a non-contagious disease.
and does not transfer to children
Some consider it a disease according to the region.
But for example, the equator, for instance, is completely removed from this disease.
Currently, we have cases on the equator affected by this disease.
This disease still doesn't have a cure because its cause is unknown.
So far, scientists are unable to determine the cause of the disease in order to find a cure for it.
The current process is a reverse process.
They are trying to avoid the impact of the disease itself on the human body.
They are trying to start from the back, in other words.
And perhaps we should be a little afraid of this issue, which means we can say that this disease might come suddenly.
There is a specific group of people who feel this disease, meaning it is spreading among people of a certain age.
Globally, it was classified among the top 20 to 40 languages.
Currently, the international organization for the disease itself has reduced the age from twenty to fifteen years.
Because he has been hitting the target since he was forty years old.
But it does not heal the human being.
Of course, we are open as a connection to both alternative medicine and traditional medicine.
Yes, if it means through the Qatari relationship for multiple sclerosis patients.
What is the cause of this association's existence?
Indeed, it's a large collection, so I thought there might be a relation to this topic.
Of course, I'll give you arbitrary numbers.
In Kuwait, it is said that there are 12,000 infected.
One thousand infected
The remaining Gulf countries have a range of infections between 100 and 300.
I was diagnosed with diabetes five years ago.
My number is forty-six or sixty-four.
Are there any symptoms that clearly indicate to a person that they actually have this disease?
And since we don't have confirmation that it's a virus, that's why we don't want to adopt a specific theory. That's the point.
The second point is how do I know if I am infected or not.
This is very difficult.
I'm lost, Professor Abdul Aziz, in trying to find a specific point.
