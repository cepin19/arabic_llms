The lineage of Jesus Christ.
The book of the birth of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham:
Ibrahim is the son of Isaac. Isaac is the son of Jacob. Jacob is the son of Judah and his brothers.
Judah had Peresh and Zerah, sons of Tamar. Peresh had Serah, and Serah had Aram.
And Aram was the father of Ehud, and Ehud was the father of Asael.
And Salmon begat Boaz from Rahab. And Boaz begat Obed from Ruth. And Obed begat Jesse.
And Solomon the king begat Rehoboam. And Rehoboam the king begat Abijam.
Solomon was born to Rehabeam. Rehabeam was the son of Abijah. Abijah was the father of Asa.
And Asa begat Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat begat Joram. Joram begat Azariah.
And Hezekiah was the son of Ahaz. And Ahaz was the son of Jotham. And Jotham was the son of Uzziah.
Hezekiah was the son of Manasseh. Manasseh was the son of Amon. Amon was the son of Josiah.
And Josiah was born to Jehoiakin and his brothers during the Babylonian captivity.
And after the captivity in Babylon, Yehoiakin was born to Jechaniah. Jechaniah begat Serubbabel.
Zarbabel was the father of Abiud. Abiud was the father of Eliacim. Eliacim was the father of Azariah.
And Azur was the son of Zadok. Zadok was the son of Ahim. Ahim was the son of Eliud.
And Eliud begat Eleazar. Eleazar begat Metan. Metan begat Jacob.
Jacob, the son of Joseph, was the husband of Mary, who gave birth to Jesus, who is called Christ.
All the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen; and from David to the carrying away into Babylon, fourteen; and from the carrying away into Babylon to Christ, fourteen. The birth of Jesus Christ.
Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she found herself with child from the Holy Spirit.
Yusuf was her husband since he was righteous, but he did not want to make her public, he wanted to divorce her secretly.
But while he was pondering these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
He laid his sons to rest and named him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
And all this was to fulfill what the Lord said through the prophet:
Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel, which means, God with us.
When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him, and took his wife.
He did not know her until she gave birth to her firstborn son. And he named him Jesus.
The visit of the Magi
When Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea during the reign of King Herod, magi from the east came to Jerusalem.
Saying, "Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
Then he gathered all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and asked them, "Where is the Christ born?"
And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judah: for thus it is written by the prophet,
And thou, Bethlehem, land of Judah, art not the least among the rulers of Judah: for out of thee shall come a ruler that shall shepherd my people Israel."
Then Herod secretly called the magi and inquired from them the time of the star's appearance.
Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and search carefully for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and bow down before him."
When they heard the king's words, they left. And the star which they had seen in the east went before them, until it came and stood over where the child was.
When they saw the star, they rejoiced with great joy.
And they came to the house, and saw the boy with Mary his mother. And they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Then it was revealed to them in a dream that they should not return to Herod, but take a different road back to their own country. So they left and went to Egypt.
And when they had departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there until I tell thee; for Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him.
So he got up, took the boy and his mother by night, and departed to Egypt.
And he was there until the death of Herod. In order that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled: "I called my son out of Egypt."
Then Herod, seeing that the magi had derided him, was very angry; and he sent forth and killed all the children in Bethlehem and in all the region thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had inquired of the magi.
Then it was fulfilled what was said by the prophet Jeremiah:
A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and great mourning. Rachel wept for her children, and refused to be comforted, for they were no more. Return to Nazareth.
And when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
Saying, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel; for those who sought the boy are dead."
So he arose, took the boy and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus had the rule over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee.
And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, That he should be called a Nazarite.
John the Baptist is preparing the way.
And in those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
Saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
For this is what was said by the prophet Isaiah: "A voice crying out in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths straight."
And John was clothed with camel's hair, and had a leather belt around his waist. And his food was locusts and wild honey.
Then Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan, went out to meet him.
They relied on him in Jordan, acknowledging their sins.
When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "You offspring of vipers, how are you to escape the coming wrath?"
So make fruits befitting repentance.
And do not think that you can say in your hearts, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children to Abraham.
And now the ax is laid to the root of the tree; every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
He who holds the flail in his hand, and will thresh his wheat, and gather it into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with fire that is never quenched." (Baptism of Jesus Christ)
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
But John stopped him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?"
Then Jesus answered and said unto him, "Let it be now, for so it befit us to fulfill all righteousness." And he allowed him.
When Jesus had been baptized, he came up out of the water; and lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming on him.
And a voice from the heavens said, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
Jesus faces the temptation.
Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
After forty days and forty nights of fasting, he finally became hungry.
Then the demon approached him and said, "If you are the son of God, make these stones into bread."
Then he answered and said, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.'"
Then Satan took him to the holy city, and stood him on the wing of the temple,
And he said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written: 'He will give his angels charge over you, to keep you, and to bear you up on their hands, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'"
Jesus said to him, "It is also written: Do not put the Lord your God to the test."
Then Satan took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
And he said to him, "I will give you all these, if you prostrate yourself and worship me."
Then Jesus said to him, "Go, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him alone shall you serve.'"
Then Satan left him, and angels came and served him. The beginning of his service was in Galilee.
When Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, he withdrew to Galilee.
And he left Nazareth, and came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
As it is written in the prophet Isaiah:
The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, By the sea, by the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.
The people sitting in darkness have seen a great light, and those sitting in the valley of death and shadows have had light shine on them."
From that time Jesus began to preach and say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near." The first call of the disciples.
And walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
Then he said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men."
For the moment they left the window and followed him.
Then he passed by there and saw two other brothers: James, son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with their father Zebedee mending their nets, and he called them.
At once they left the ship and their father, and followed him. Jesus taught and healed the sick.
And Jesus was traveling throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every weakness among the people.
The news of his healing spread throughout Syria. They brought to him all the sick, those suffering from various diseases and ailments, the insane, the possessed, and the paralyzed, and he healed them all.
And a great multitude followed him from Galilee, and from the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and even from beyond the Jordan.
The Sermon on the Mount - The Beatitudes
And when the crowd saw him, they went up to the mountain; and when he had sat down, his disciples came to him.
Then he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are the sad, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are the hungry and thirsty for righteousness, for they will be satisfied.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be merciful.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.
Blessed are the outcast for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you on my account.
Rejoice and be glad, for great is your reward in heaven; for they persecuted the prophets who were before you, even as they persecuted you. Salt of the earth and light of the world.
You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how can it be seasoned? It is no longer good for anything, but is fit only to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.
You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.
They do not light a lamp and put it under a bushel, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.
Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. Fulfilling the law.
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to abolish but to fulfill.
Verily I say unto you, until heaven and earth pass, not an iota or a dot shall pass from the law until all is fulfilled.
For whoever breaks one of these least commandments and teaches others to do so will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does and teaches will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
You have heard that it was said to the ancients, "Do not kill," and whoever kills will be subject to judgment.
But I say to you, whoever is angry with his brother without a cause is subject to judgment; and whoever says to his brother, 'Raca,' is liable to the Sanhedrin; and whoever says, 'You fool,' is subject to the fire of hell.
If you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,
Leave your offering there, in front of the altar, and first go and reconcile with your brother. Then come and offer your offering.
Be a friend to your enemy quickly while you are with him, lest he deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the policeman, and you end up in prison.
I tell you truly, do not leave here until you have paid the last farthing! Adultery
You have heard it said to the ancients, "Do not commit adultery."
But I tell you, whoever looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
"If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away; it is better for you that one of your members should perish, and not your whole body be thrown into hell."
"If your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you that one of your members perish rather than your whole body be thrown into hell." (Divorce)
And it is said: Whoever divorces his wife should give her a divorce document.
And I say to you: Whoever divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. (The verse is from the Quran, sura 5, ayat 32.)
You have also heard it said to the ancients, "Do not break your oath, but fulfill your vows to the Lord."
And I say to you, do not swear at all, not by heaven, for it is God's throne.
Not by the land, for it is his footstool, nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
Do not swear by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black.
But let your 'yes' be 'yes', and your 'no', 'no'. Whatever is beyond these is evil. Retaliation
You have heard it said: an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
And I say to you, do not resist evil, but whoever strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to him as well.
And if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat, leave him the cloak as well.
And whoever makes you go one mile, go with them two.
Give to him who asks, and do not refuse him who borrows. Love your enemies.
You have heard it said: love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
And I say to you, Love your enemies. Bless those who curse you. Do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute you.
That you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven, the sun shines on the evil and on the good, and the rain falls on the righteous and on the unrighteous.
For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
And if you greet only your brothers, what good are you doing? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?
Be perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect.
Charity
Beware of performing your acts of charity before men to be seen by them, for otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.
For when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, to gain the praise of men. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward!
And as for you, when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
So that your charity may be in secret. For your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. Prayer
And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray standing in synagogues and at the corners of streets, that they may be seen by men. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.
But you, when you pray, go into your room and shut the door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
And when you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the Gentiles do, for they think that their many words will avail them.
Do not follow their example. For your Father knows what you need, even before you ask Him.
"Pray thus: Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name."
Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us.
Do not put us to the test, but deliver us from evil. For yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.
For if you forgive men their transgressions, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you.
"If you do not forgive others their mistakes, your Father will not forgive your mistakes either." (The Fasting)
And when you fast, do not look gloomy, like the hypocrites, for they change their faces to show the people that they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.
And as for you, when you are silent, anoint your head and wash your face.
So that you may not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in secret. For your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. Treasures in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust corrupt, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust corrupts, and where thieves do not break in and steal;
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
The light of the body is the eye; if your eye is simple, then your whole body will be full of darkness.
And if your eye be evil, your whole body shall be full of darkness; if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money. God provides for us.
Therefore I say to you, Do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?
Look at the birds of the sky; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
And of you, who, if he were to care, could add even one span to his height?
And why do you care about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow without toil or spinning.
But I say to you, not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of them.
For if the grass of the field, which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven, God does so, how much more shall you clothe yourselves, you of little faith?
Do not therefore worry, saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or What shall we wear?
For these are what the nations seek. But your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Suffice for the day its own trouble.
Condemning others
Do not judge, so that you will not be judged.
For with the judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, and do not perceive the beam that is in your own eye?
Mother, or how do you say to your brother: Let me remove the speck from your eye, and look, there is a log in your eye?
You hypocrite, take the beam out of your own eye first, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye!
Do not give Jerusalem to the dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them with their feet and turn and tear you to pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask and ye shall receive. Seek and ye shall find. Knock and it shall be opened unto you.
For whoever asks receives, and whoever seeks finds, and to whoever knocks, the door will be opened.
Would any of you give your son a stone when he asks for bread?
And if asked for a fish, would he give a snake?
For if you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
Whatever you want people to do to you, do the same to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets. The Narrow Door
Enter through the narrow door, for the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it!
How narrow the door and how difficult the path that leads to life! And few find it. The tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves!
You shall know them by their fruits. Do grapes grow on thorns, or figs on thistles?
Thus every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.
Every tree that bears not good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.
You will know them by their fruits.
Not everyone who says, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, "Lord, Lord!" Will it not be because in your name we prophesied, and in your name we cast out demons, and in your name we did many wonders?
Then I will declare to them, "I never knew you! Depart from me, you workers of iniquity!" The wise builders and the ignorant builders.
"But whoever hears my words and acts on them, is like a wise man who built his house on a rock."
And the rain fell, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and the house stood firm because it had been founded on a rock.
And whoever hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
And the rain fell, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and the house was struck and fell with a great crash.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowd was amazed at his teaching.
Because he taught them as one with authority, not like scribes.
Curing leprosy
And when he came down from the mountain, great crowds followed him.
And if a leper came and bowed down to him, saying, "Master, if you will, you can cleanse me."
Then Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I do will it, be thou cleansed." And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
Then Jesus said to him, "See that you do not tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded, as a testimony for them." The faith of the centurion.
When Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him to do something.
He says, "O Lord, my servant lies in the house, paralyzed and in great pain."
Then Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."
Then the captain of the hundred answered and said, "Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak a word, and my servant shall be made whole."
Because I am also under authority. I have soldiers under my command. I say to this one, 'Go!' and he goes; to another, 'Come!' and he comes; to my servant, 'Do this!' and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he marveled, and said to those who followed him, "I tell you the truth, I have not found such faith, not even in Israel!"
And I say to you, many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
And those in the kingdom will be thrown into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then Jesus said to the centurion, 'Go, and as you have believed, so let it be done for you.' And his servant was healed in that hour. Healing of Peter's mother-in-law and others.
When Jesus came to Peter's house, he found his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever.
He touched her hand, and the fever left her, so she got up and served them.
And when evening had come, many possessed people were brought to him. And he cast out the devils with a word, and healed all the sick.
That which was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, who said: "He took our sicknesses and carried our diseases." The cost of dependence.
And when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he commanded to go over to the other side.
Then a scribe came up and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Then Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
And one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, permit me to go first and bury my father."
Then Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead." Calming the storm
And when he entered the ship, his disciples followed him.
And if a great storm arose in the sea, so that the waves covered the ship, he was sleeping.
Then his disciples came and awoke him, saying, "Master, save us; we are perishing!"
He said to them, "Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?" Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
And the people were amazed, saying, "Who is this man? For even the winds and the sea obey him!" And he cast out demons.
And when he came to the other side, to the region of the Gerasenes, two possessed men coming out of the tombs met him, extremely violent, so that no one could pass that way.
And when they cried out, saying, "What have we to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before time?"
And nearby, a great herd of pigs was feeding.
The demons begged him, saying, "If you cast us out, let us go to the herd of pigs."
And he said unto them, "Go." And they went out and went to the herd of pigs, and behold, all the herd of pigs had rushed down the cliff into the sea, and perished in the waters.
But the shepherds fled and went into the city, and told everything and the story of the madmen.
For all the city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they asked him to leave their borders.
Curing paralysis
He entered the ship, passed through, and came to his city.
And if a paralytic is brought to him lying on a bed, when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
And if a group of the scribes say to themselves, "This is blasphemy!"
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Which is easier: to say, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Get up and walk"?
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralytic, "Get up, take your mat and go home!"
He got up and went home.
When they saw the crowd, they were amazed and glorified God, who had given people such authority. A call from Matthew.
And as Jesus was passing by, he saw a man sitting by the tax collector's booth, named Matthew. And he said to him, "Follow me." And he rose up and followed him.
And while he was sitting at home, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard it, he said to them, "The well do not need a physician, but the sick."
Go and learn what this means: I desire mercy, not sacrifice; for I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." (On fasting)
Then the disciples of John came to him and said, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
Then Jesus said to them, "Can the bridegrooms mourn while the bride is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
No one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment, for the new takes away from the old, and the patch would turn the rest bad.
Do not put new wine into old wineskins, lest the wineskins burst, and the wine be spilled, and the wineskins be destroyed. But put new wine into new wineskins, and both will be preserved." (Luke 5:37-39) "And a woman suffering from bleeding stopped flowing when she touched the cloth that Jesus had touched." (Luke 8:44)
And while he was speaking these things, behold, a ruler came and knelt before him, saying, "My daughter is now dead; but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus got up and followed him, along with his disciples.
And if a woman with a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind him and touched the hem of his garment,
Because she said to herself, "If I but touch his garment, I will be healed."
Jesus turned and saw her, and said, "Daughter, your faith has made you well." And from that hour the woman was healed.
When Jesus came to the ruler's house, he saw the musicians and the crowd making a noise.
He said to them, "Step aside, for the child is not dead but sleeping." And they laughed at him.
When he went out, the crowd came in and grabbed her hand, so the girl stood up.
And the news spread throughout the whole land. Healing of the blind.
And as Jesus passed by, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, "Have mercy on us, O Son of David!"
And when he came to the house, the blind came to him, and Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord!"
Then he touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith, be it unto you."
And their eyes were opened. And Jesus rebuked them, saying, "See, it is no one's business!"
But they went out and preached it in that whole region, and healed the mute.
And as they were going out, a mute, madman was brought to him.
And when the devil had spoken, the mute spake; and the multitude marveled, saying, Never was such a thing heard in Israel!
But the Pharisees said, "By the prince of devils he casts out devils!" The works are few.
And Jesus was traveling through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every weakness among the people.
And when he saw the crowd, he had compassion on them, for they were like sheep without a shepherd.
At that time, he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few."
So they asked the Lord of the harvest to send laborers to his harvest.
Sending the Twelve
Then he called his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every weakness.
And the names of the twelve apostles are these: the first is Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew. James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
Philip, Bartholomew. Thomas, and Matthew the tenth. James, son of Alphaeus, and Lebaeus, called Thaddeus.
Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
These twelve he sent forth, and charged them, saying, "Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and enter not into any city of the Samaritans.
But go ye rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
As ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Heal the sick. Cleanse lepers. Raise the dead. Cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth,
Nor staff, nor two garments, nor shoes, nor staff, for the worker is worthy of his food.
And whenever you enter a city or a village, examine its people for a righteous one, and stay there until you leave.
And when you enter the House, greet it.
If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.
And if they do not accept you or listen to your words, then go out from that house or city, and shake the dust off your feet.
Truly, I say to you, on the day of judgment, the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah will be less severe than that of this city.
Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; therefore be wise as serpents and simple as doves.
But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.
And you will be led before rulers and kings for my sake, to bear witness to them and to the nations.
When they hand you over, do not worry about how or what to say, for what you say in that hour will be given to you.
For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.
And a brother will deliver his brother to death, and a father his son; and children will rise up against their parents and put them to death.
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth unto the end, the same shall be saved.
And when they persecute you in this city, flee into another. Verily I say unto you, ye shall not finish the cities of Israel till the Son of man come.
The student is not better than the teacher, nor is the servant better than his master.
It is enough for the pupil to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the Lord of the house Beelzebul, how much more his household!
So do not fear them, for what is hidden will be made manifest, and what is secret will be known.
What I say to you in the dark, say in the light; and what you hear with your ear, cry out on the roofs.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Aren't two sparrows sold for a penny? And one of them will not fall to the ground without your Father's will.
And as for you, even your heads shall be numbered.
So do not be afraid! You are better than many sparrows!
For whoever acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge him before my Father who is in heaven.
But whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth. I have not come to bring peace but a sword.
For I have come to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
And a man's enemies are his own family.
Whoever loves a father or mother more than me does not deserve me, and whoever loves a son or daughter more than me does not deserve me.
He who does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
He who finds his life losing it, and he who loses his life for me finds it.
He who accepts you accepts me, and he who accepts me accepts him who sent me.
He who accepts a prophet in the name of a prophet receives a prophet's reward, and he who accepts a righteous person in the name of a righteous person receives a righteous person's reward.
And whoever gives one of these little ones a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, truly I tell you, he will not lose his reward.
John the Baptist and Jesus
And when Jesus had finished giving his instructions to his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities. Jesus and John the Baptist
But John, while in prison, heard of the deeds of Christ, and sent two of his disciples.
And he said to him, "Are you he who is coming, or shall we wait for another?"
Then Jesus answered and said to them, "Go, and tell John what you see and hear."
The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise, and the poor have good news.
Blessed are those who do not stumble in.
And as they went out, Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
But what are you looking for? A man dressed in fine clothes? Behold, those who wear fine clothes are in the houses of kings.
But what are you looking for? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet.
For this is what was written about him: Behold, I send my angel before your face, who will prepare your way before you.
Truly I tell you, there has not arisen greater than John the Baptist; but the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist to this time, the kingdom of heaven is taken by force, and those who take it by force seize it.
Because all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
And if ye will receive him, verily, Elias is he that is to come.
He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
And who is like this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling to their companions.
They say: "We called you, but you didn't dance!" "We came to you, but you didn't clap!"
Because John came eating and drinking no one accused him of being possessed by a demon.
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they said, "Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners." And wisdom is justified by her children. Woe to the cities that have not repented!
Then he began to rebuke the cities in which most of his forces had been made, because they had not repented.
Woe unto thee, Korzin! Woe unto thee, house of Sidon! For if the forces that were made in thee, in Tire and Sidon, had been made in Jerusalem and Ashkelon, they would have repented long ago in the dust and ashes.
But I say to you, the reward of faith and patience will be greater for you in the day of judgment.
And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the miracles had been done in Sodom which are done in thee, it had remained until this day.
But I say to you: The land of Sodom will be in a more probable state on the day of judgment than you are." Rest for the weary.
At that time Jesus answered and said, "I praise you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children.
Yes, Father, for thus it was fitting for the plan before you to unfold.
Everything that I have received is from my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and whoever the Son reveals himself to.
Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Bear my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart; and you will find rest for your souls.
Because my strength is small and my burden light.
Lord of the Sabbath
At that time, Jesus went out on the Sabbath among the wheatfields, and his disciples, feeling hungry, began to pluck and eat the ears of grain.
The Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, "Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!"
Then he said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?"
How did he enter the house of God and eat the bread of the offering, which was not permitted to be eaten by him or his companions, but only by the priests?
Or have you read in the Torah that the priests profane the Sabbath in the Temple on the Sabbath, and yet they are innocent?
But I say to you: Here is greater than the temple!
If you knew what it is, I want mercy, not sacrifice; for if you judged the innocent, you would be condemning yourselves!
"For the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath."
Then he left from there and came to their assembly.
And if a man has a dry hand, they will ask him, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" that they may accuse him.
Then he said to them, "Which of you, if his only sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it up?"
Man is better than a sheep! If only good deeds were in fashion!
Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and it was restored, like the other one. The chosen one of God.
When the Pharisees heard it, they conspired together to kill him.
Then Jesus, knowing it, departed from there. And great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all.
And he advised them not to reveal it.
As it is written in the prophet Isaiah:
Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, My beloved in whom my soul delights. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall proclaim justice to the nations.
He does not argue or shout, and his voice is not heard in the streets.
A crushed reed does not break, and a smoking wick does not go out until the truth comes to victory.
"On his name, let the nations pray." Jesus and Beelzebul
Then he brought to him a madman, blind and mute, and he healed him, so that the blind and mute man spoke and saw.
And the whole crowd was amazed, and said, "Can this be the Son of David?"
But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, "He casts out demons only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Any kingdom divided against itself is destroyed, and any city or house divided against itself will not stand."
For if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then shall his kingdom stand?
If I cast out demons by Beelzebul, then your sons by whom will they be cast out? Therefore they shall be your judges.
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the Kingdom of God has come upon you!
How can anyone enter the house of the strong and steal his goods, if he does not first bind the strong? Then he will steal his house.
He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.
Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven to men.
And whoever says a word against the Son of Man shall be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven, neither in this age nor in the age to come.
Make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for by the fruit the tree is known.
O children of vipers! How can you speak good things when you are evil? For it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks.
The good man is from the good treasure in the heart, and he brings forth good things; and the evil man is from the evil treasure, and he brings forth evil.
But I tell you, every idle word spoken will be accounted for on the day of judgment.
"For with your words you will be justified, and with your words you will be condemned." - Jonah 1:17
At that time, some of the scribes and Pharisees said, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from You."
He answered and said unto them, "A wicked and adulterous generation seeks a sign, and no sign shall be given them but the sign of the prophet Jonah."
For as Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights, so shall the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
The men of Nineveh will rise up in judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here!
The queen of Sheba will rise in judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the end of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, there is more here than Solomon!
If the unclean spirit departs from a man, he goes into places where there is no water, and seeks rest, but does not find it.
Then he says, "Return to my house from which you came." He comes and finds it empty, swept, and decorated.
Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there, so that the latter end of that man becomes worse than his beginning. So it will be for this wicked generation." Doing God's will.
And as he was speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, asking to speak to him.
Then one said to him, "Behold, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, asking to speak to you."
Then he answered and said to him that questioned him, "Who is my mother and who are my brothers?"
Then he stretched out his hand towards his disciples and said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers."
For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
Like the farmer and his interpretation.
That day, Jesus left the house and sat by the sea.
Then great multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered the ship and sat down. And all the multitude stood on the shore.
And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, the sower is gone forth to sow.
And as he sowed, some fell by the way, and the birds came and devoured it.
And the last fell on the places that were hewn out, where there was not much soil, and it immediately sprouted, for it had no depth of earth.
But when the sun rose, it burned, and since it had no root, it withered.
And the last one fell on the thorns, and the thorns pierced him.
And the last fell on good ground and bore fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.
"He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
Then the disciples came and said to him, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
He answered and said to them, "It is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. But whoever does not have will have what they have taken from them.
For this reason, I speak to them in parables, because they are seeing but not perceiving, hearing but not understanding.
For to them was the prophecy of Isaiah fulfilled, which says: "You hear but do not understand, and see but do not perceive."
For the heart of this people has become callous, and their ears heavy to hear. They have closed their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and repent, so that I might heal them.
But blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear.
Verily I say unto you, There were many prophets and righteous men who desired to see what ye see, and heard what ye hear, and saw it not, and heard it not.
"Hear you, like the farmer:"
Anyone who hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand, the evil one comes and snatches what has been sown in his heart. That is the seed sown on the path.
The seed sown in good soil is he who hears the word and accepts it with joy.
But it has no substance in itself, it is only for a time. If there is distress or persecution for the Word, then he stumbles immediately.
The word choked by the thorns is the one who hears the word, these are the world and the pride of wealth that choke the word, making it unfruitful.
But what is sown on good soil is the one who hears the word and understands it. And it bears fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold." Like the wheat and the tares.
He gave them another illustration, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
And while the people were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat, and went away.
When the plant sprouted and bore fruit, then the serpent also appeared.
Then the servants of the Lord of the House came to him and said, "Master, haven't you sown a good seed in your field? Then from where does this tares come?"
He said to them, "An enemy did this." The servants said to him, "Shall we go and gather him?"
He said: "No! So that you do not uproot the wheat with the weeds while you are gathering it."
Let them both grow together until the harvest; and at the time of harvest I say to the reapers, 'First gather together the weeds and bind them in bundles to burn, but gather the wheat into my barn.'" (Like mustard seed and like leaven.)
He said to them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field.
It is the smallest of all the seeds. But when it grows, it becomes the largest of legumes, and turns into a tree, so that birds of the sky come and nest in its branches."
He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until it had leavened all."
All this Jesus spoke to the crowd in parables; without parables he did not speak to them.
That which was said by the prophet: "I will open my mouth in parables, and I will speak things hidden since the foundation of the world." Interpretation of the parable of wheat and tares.
Then Jesus dismissed the crowd and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He answered and said unto them, The good seed is the son of man.
The field is the world. The good seed is the children of the kingdom. The tares are the children of the wicked.
And the enemy who sows is Satan. And the harvest is the end of the world. And the reapers are the angels.
Just as fire collects wood and burns it, so it will be with the end of this world.
The Son of Man sends his angels, and they gather all wickedness and the evildoers from his kingdom.
They cast them into the fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear. Examples are the treasure, the pearl, and the net.
The kingdom of heaven is also like a treasure hidden in a field. A man found it and hid it; and, in his joy, went and sold all that he had and bought that field.
The kingdom of heaven is also like a merchantman seeking for fine pearls.
And when he found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
The kingdom of heaven is also like a net cast into the sea, which gathers all kinds of fish.
When they had landed, they pulled them up on the shore, and sat down, and gathered the horses into the troughs, but threw the sick outside.
Thus shall it be at the end of the world: the angels will come forth and separate the wicked from among the righteous.
They cast them into the fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all this?" And they said, "Yes, Lord."
Then he said to them, "Therefore every scribe who is trained in the kingdom of heaven is like a household manager who brings out of his treasure new and old."
And when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence. Nazareth rejects Jesus.
And when he came to his land, he taught them in their assembly, and they were amazed, saying, "From where has this man wisdom and power?"
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother named Mary, and his brothers Jacob, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters here? Then where did he get all this from?
So they stumbled over him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own house."
And many forces were not made there because of their unbelief.
Beheading of John the Baptist
At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard of Jesus.
Then he said to his disciples, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and therefore the powers work in him."
Herod had John arrested, bound, and thrown into prison for Herodias, the sister of Philip.
Because John was saying to him, "It is not right for you to have it."
And when he intended to kill him, he feared the people, for he was like a prophet to them.
Then, when Herod's birthday came, Herodias' daughter danced in the midst, and pleased Herod.
He then promised by an oath that he would give her whatever she asked.
Since she had been taught by her mother, she said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist."
The king was satisfied. But for the sake of the divisions and those who sat with him, it was commanded that he should give.
So he sent and beheaded John in prison.
He then placed his head on a plate and handed it to the girl, who brought it to her mother.
Then his disciples went forward, and lifted up the body, and buried it. And they came and told Jesus. And they brought to him the five thousand, who had been fed.
When Jesus heard this, he departed in a boat to a solitary place, away from the crowd. But when the people heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus came out, he saw a great crowd; and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
When evening came, his disciples approached him and said, "The place is deserted and the time has passed. Send the crowd away so that they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Then Jesus said to them, "Let the children be fed first. Give them to me."
And they said to him, "We have here only five loaves and two fish."
Then he said, "Bring it here to me."
Then he commanded the crowd to sit on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, blessed, broke, and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowd.
So they all ate and were satisfied. Then they lifted up what was left over, twelve baskets full.
And there were about five thousand men, not counting women and children. The miracle of walking on water
And at once Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd.
And after the crowd had departed, he went up the mountain alone to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.
And the ship was in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves; for the wind was contrary.
And at the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.
When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were astonished, and said, "It is a ghost!" And they cried out in fear.
At that time Jesus said to them, "Be of good cheer! I am he. Do not be afraid."
Peter answered and said, "Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water."
And he said, "Come." So Peter got down out of the boat and walked on the water to come to Jesus.
But when he saw the wind was strong, he became afraid. And when the ship began to sink, he cried out, "Lord, save me!"
At once Jesus reached out his hand and took him, saying, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
And when they entered the ship, the wind ceased.
And those on the ship came to him and prostrated themselves before him, saying, "You are indeed the Son of God!"
And when they crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.
And the men of that place knew him. So they sent for all the district around, and brought to him all who were sick.
And they asked him to just touch the hem of his garment, and all who touched it were healed.
Pure and impure
At that time, scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying:
Why do your students go beyond the tradition of the elders, for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread?
Then he answered and said unto them, Ye also, why do ye transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?
God commanded, saying, "Honor your father and your mother; and whoever curses his father or his mother shall die."
And you say, "Whoever says to his father or mother, 'My offering is to the Lord' and does not honor his father or mother, he is void of the commandment."
You have voided God's will because of your traditions!
Hypocrites! Isaiah spoke well of you, saying:
This people approaches me with their mouth, they honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
And they worship me in vain, teaching doctrines that are the commandments of men."
Then he called the assembly and said to them, "Listen and understand."
"Not what enters the mouth defiles a man, but what comes out of the mouth defiles a man."
Then his disciples came up to him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees heard the saying and were outraged?"
And he answered and said, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up."
Leave them. They are blind leaders of blind followers. For if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Then Peter answered and said to him, "Explain this parable to us."
Then Jesus said, "Do you still not understand?"
Don't you understand that everything that goes into the mouth goes into the stomach and comes out through the exit?
And whatever issues from the mouth proceeds from the heart; and that defiles a man.
For out of the heart come evil thoughts: murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander.
This is what defiles a human. But eating with unwashed hands does not defile a human." - The faith of the Canaanite woman
Then Jesus left there and went away to the regions of Tyre and Sidon.
And a Canaanite woman, who came out of those borders, cried out to him, saying, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, O Son of David! My daughter is possessed with a demon."
He did not answer her a word. Then his disciples came up and asked him, saying, "Send her away, for she is crying out after us!"
Then he answered and said, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then she came and prostrated herself before him, saying, "O my Lord, help me!"
Then he answered and said, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
Then she said, "Yes, sir! Even dogs eat from the scraps that fall from their masters' table!"
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "Woman, your faith is great! Let it be to you as you desire." And from that hour her daughter was made whole. Feeding four thousand men.
Then Jesus departed thence, and came into the side of the sea of Galilee: and he ascended into a mountain, and sat down there.
Then great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, the blind, the mute, the paralyzed, and many others. And they laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
So as to amaze the crowd when they saw the mute speaking, the lame walking, the crippled jumping, and the blind seeing, and they glorified the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples and said to them, "I have compassion on this crowd, for they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."
Then his disciples asked him, "Where can we get enough bread in the wilderness to feed all these people?"
Then Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."
Then he commanded the crowd to lean on the ground.
And he took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, broke them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples gave to the crowd.
So they all ate and were satisfied. Then they picked up the remaining fragments, seven full baskets.
And there were four thousand men, besides women and children.
Then the crowd dispersed, and he got into the boat and arrived at Magdala.
Request a verse
And the Pharisees and the Sadducees came to him, and they questioned him, desiring to see a sign from heaven.
And He answered and said to them, "If in the evening you say, 'The sky is red,' is it not because of the wrath of God?
And in the morning: Today is winter, for the sky is red with anger. O you hypocrites! You know how to discern the face of the sky, but the signs of the times you cannot!
A wicked, godless generation seeks a sign, and no sign is given them but the sign of Jonah the prophet." Then he left them and departed. Yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees
And when his disciples came to the other side, they forgot to take bread with them.
And Jesus said unto them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees."
And they thought to themselves, "We have no bread."
Then Jesus said to them, "Why do you reason among yourselves, O men of little faith, that you have no bread?
Even now, do you not understand? Do you not remember the five loaves and the five thousand, and how many baskets you took?
And seven loaves of the four thousand, how many baskets did you take?
How can you not understand that I'm not talking about bread? I told you to be wary of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then they understood that he did not say to be on guard against leaven of bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter's confession of Jesus
When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say I am?"
And they said, "Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
He said to them, "And you, who do you say that I am?"
Then Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!"
Then Jesus answered and said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for what was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.
And I tell you also: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
"And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
Then he commanded his disciples not to tell anyone that he was Jesus the Christ. Jesus announced his death and resurrection.
From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer much from the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and on the third day rise.
Then Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far be it from you, Lord! Could this be you?"
Then he turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, because you are not thinking of God's things but of man's."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.
He who would save his life will lose it, but he who loses his life for my sake will find it.
For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father, with his angels, and then he will reward each one according to his works.
Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a child will never enter it.
The
And after six days, Jesus took Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain apart.
And his form changed before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.
And Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with him.
Then Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here! If you wish, I can make three shelters here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And as he spoke, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; listen to him."
When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were very afraid.
Then Jesus came to them, touched them, and said, "Get up, and do not be afraid."
They lifted up their eyes, and saw no one but Jesus alone.
And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, "Do not tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
And his disciples asked him, saying, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Then Jesus answered and said unto them, Elijah shall first come, and restore all things.
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but they treated him as they pleased. So the Son of Man will also suffer at their hands."
Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist. For he had cast out a devil from a man that was possessed with him.
And when they came to the assembly, a man came forward and prostrated himself before him.
Saying, "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is convulsing and in great pain, often falling into fire and often into water."
And he brought him to his disciples, but they could not heal him."
Then Jesus answered and said, "O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him here to me!"
Jesus rebuked him, and the devil departed out of him. And from that hour the boy was made whole.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and said, "Why couldn't we cast him out?"
Then Jesus said to them, "Because of your lack of faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; nothing will be impossible for you."
"As for this religion, it can only be achieved through prayer and fasting."
And as they were uncertain in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men."
