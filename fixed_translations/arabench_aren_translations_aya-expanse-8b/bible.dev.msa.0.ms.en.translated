Now the birth of Jesus Christ came to pass in this way. His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph her husband, but before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit.
But Joseph, her husband, was a righteous man, and did not want to expose her, so he decided to let her go quietly.
And while Joseph was pondering these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
And she will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
This happened so that what the Lord said through the prophet might be fulfilled.
Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel, which means, God with us.
And when Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did according to the command of the angel of the Lord, and took his wife into his house.
But he did not know her until she gave birth to the child whom he named "Jesus."
Wisdom from the East
When Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in the region of Judea, during the reign of King Herod, some wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.
And they asked, saying, "Where is the child who is born King of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him."
King Herod was disturbed when he heard this, as were all the people of Jerusalem.
Herod called together all the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
And they said unto him, In the city of Bethlehem, in the land of Judah: for thus it is written by the prophet,
"You, Bethlehem in the land of Judah, are not little in importance among the rulers of Judah, for from you a ruler will go out to shepherd my people Israel." »
Herod then summoned the wise men secretly and inquired of them the exact time when the star had appeared.
Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and search for the child. And when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and bow down before him."
Then the wise men listened to the king and went away. And, behold, the star which they had seen in the east went before them, until it came and stood over the place where the child was.
They rejoiced greatly when they saw the star.
And they entered the house and saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure chests and offered him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Then God warned them in a dream against returning to Herod, so they departed for their country by another road. Flight into Egypt
And when the wise men had departed, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, and said unto him, "Arise, and take the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell thee; for Herod will seek the child to destroy him."
So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother by night, and went to Egypt.
He remained there until the death of Herod. This happened so that what the Lord said through the prophet might be fulfilled: "I called my son out of Egypt." #from ... my son. 15:2 From the book of Hosea 11:1. Herod kills the children of Bethlehem.
And when Herod knew that the wise men had deceived him, he was very angry, and commanded to kill all the children in Bethlehem and in all the region round about, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had learned from the wise men.
Then what was said through the mouth of the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled.
A voice was heard in Ramah, a voice of weeping and great mourning. It is the voice of Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted, for they are dead. Return from Egypt.
After Herod's death, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream in Egypt.
And he said unto him, Arise, take the child and his mother, and return into the land of Israel: for those who sought to kill the child are dead.
So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus had become king over the region of Judea, where his father Herod had reigned, he was afraid to go there. And after being warned in a dream, he went to the region of Galilee.
He lived in a town called Nazareth. This happened so that what the prophets said would be fulfilled, that the Messiah would be called a Nazarene. #Nazareth. 23:2 Named after the city of Nazareth. It also resembles the Hebrew word for "branch," as in Isaiah 11:1, referring to the promise of the Messiah's coming from the line of David.
John the Baptist
In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
And he said, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
And this John is he of whom the prophet Isaiah spake, saying, In the wilderness shall a voice cry, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the wilderness a path for our God.
John was clothed in camel's hair, and had a belt of skin around his waist, and ate locusts and wild honey.
At that time, people began to come from Jerusalem, and from all the region of Judea, and from the areas around the Jordan River, to hear him.
And he baptized them in the Jordan river after they confessed their sins.
And when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to be baptized by him, he said unto them, "O brood of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the coming wrath?"
Make fruit that proves your repentance.
Do not boast that 'Abraham is our father.' For I tell you that God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
Here is the axe laid at the roots of the trees. Every tree that bears not good fruit shall be cut down and cast into the fire.
I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to loosen his shoe. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He will carry his seed in his hand and sow with his hands, gathering his grain into the barn, and burning his chaff with an unquenchable fire." - The Baptism of Jesus
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to be baptized by John.
But John tried to stop him, saying, "I need you to baptize me, why are you coming to me?"
Then Jesus answered him, "Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." And John allowed him to be baptized.
Jesus therefore went into the water. And when he came up out of the water, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming on him.
And a voice came from heaven, saying, "You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
The experience of Jesus.
And the Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
After Jesus had fasted for forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.
Then came to him a demon, #the demon. 3:4 that is, Satan. And he said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
But Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"
Then Satan took him to the holy city, and stood him on the top of the temple.
And he said to him, "If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here; for it is written, 'God commands his angels concerning you,' and also, 'They will bear you up in their hands, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'"
Then Jesus answered him, "It is written also, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
Then Satan took him to a high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.
Then he said to him, "I will give you all this if you prostrate yourself to me."
Then Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him alone shall you serve.'"
Then Satan left him, and angels came to serve him. Jesus begins his service in Galilee.
And when Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, he returned to Galilee.
But he did not stay in Nazareth, but went and dwelt in the city of Capernaum, by the sea of Galilee, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
This happened to fulfill what God said through the prophet Isaiah:
The land of Zebulun and Naphtali, by the sea, across the river, the land of Galilee, where nations dwell.
"The people who dwelt in darkness saw a great light; those who sat in the land of the shadow of death shone upon them."
From that time on, Jesus began to preach and say, "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand." Jesus chose some of his disciples.
And as Jesus walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who was also called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishermen.
Then he said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
They left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus went away from there, and he saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. He was in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them.
They left the boat and their father behind and followed him. Jesus taught and healed.
And Jesus was traveling throughout all the region of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom of God. And he was healing every disease and every infirmity among the people.
And the news of him spread throughout all Syria, and they brought to him all who suffered from various diseases and pains, and those possessed by evil spirits, and the epileptics, and the paralyzed, and he healed them.
And great crowds followed him from Galilee, and from the ten cities, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and from the eastern side of the Jordan River.
The teaching of Jesus
And when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up onto a hill and sat down. And his disciples came to him.
And he began to speak and teach them, saying:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Rejoice in weeping, for God will comfort you.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. #they shall inherit the earth 5:5 See Psalm 37:11. This could here mean a future spiritual inheritance.
Congratulations to the hungry and thirsty for doing the will of God, #for doing the will of God. 6:5 Literally: "To the righteous." For God will satisfy them.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Rejoice in peace makers, for they shall be called the sons of God.
Blessed are the persecuted for righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Rejoice when people insult you and persecute you and falsely accuse you of doing evil, because you are my disciples.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven will be great. For they persecuted the prophets who were before you in the same way. Salt and light.
You are the salt of all people. But if salt loses its flavor, with what can it be seasoned to regain its taste? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
"You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden."
And do not set a lamp under a bushel, but on a stand, that it may give light to all in the house.
Also, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven." - Jesus and Moses' Law
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law of Moses or the teachings of the prophets. I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them.
I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth pass away, not even the smallest letter or stroke will pass from the Law until everything written in it is accomplished.
Therefore whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever keeps them and teaches them to others will be called greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Because I tell you, unless your obedience to God increases beyond your obedience to my teachers of the law and the Pharisees, you will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Anger
You know that it was said to your fathers: "Do not kill." #Do not kill. 21:5 From the Book of Exodus 20:13, and the Book of Deuteronomy 5:17. And whoever kills deserves judgment.
But I tell you, whoever is angry with another person deserves to be judged, and whoever insults another person should stand before the court. And whoever says to another person, "You fool," deserves hell.
So if you offer a sacrifice on the altar, and remember that another has something against you,
Leave your offering there before the altar, go and reconcile yourself with that person first, then come back and offer your offering.
Quickly settle your dispute with him as you walk to court, or he will hand you over to the judge, the judge will hand you over to the jailer, and you will be thrown into jail.
I tell you the truth, you won't leave there until you pay the last penny you owe. Adultery
You have heard it said: "Do not commit adultery." #Do not fornicate. 27:5 From the Book of Exodus 20:14, and the Book of Deuteronomy 5:18.
But I tell you, whoever looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
Therefore, if your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away from you. It is better for you to lose one part of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better to lose a part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. (Divorce)
It is also said: "If a man divorces his wife, he shall give her a certificate of divorce." #If he divorces... 31:5 From the Book of Deuteronomy 24:1.
But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, is making her eligible for adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman is committing adultery.
You have heard it said to your fathers also, 'Do not take the name of the Lord your God in vain; but keep the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve him with all your heart.' #Do not break your oath ... to the Lord. 33:5 See Leviticus 19:12, Numbers 30:2, and Deuteronomy 23:21.
But I say to you, do not swear at all.
Do not swear by the sky, for it is the throne of God, nor by the earth, for it is his footstool, #his footstool. 35:5 meaning under his control and dominion. Do not swear by the city of Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king.
Do not swear by your head, for you cannot make a single hair black or white.
If you want to say 'yes', say 'yes'. If you want to say 'no', say 'no'. And anything beyond that is of the evil one. #evil. 37:5 Devil. Resistance to evil
You have heard it said: "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." #Eye ... for a tooth. 38:5 From the Book of Exodus 21:24, and the Book of Leviticus 24:20.
But I say to you, do not resist evil. Rather, if someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other cheek as well.
If anyone sues you to take your coat, let him have your cloak as well.
If someone forces you to walk one mile with them, walk two miles with them.
And if anyone asks you for something, give it to them. Do not refuse to lend to whoever asks to borrow from you. Love everyone.
You have heard it said: 'Love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.' #Love ... your enemy. 43:5 From the Book of Leviticus 19:18.
"But I say to you, love your enemies, pray for those who persecute you."
That you may be the children of your Father who is in heaven. For God makes the sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous.
If you only love those who love you, what reward do you deserve? Don't tax collectors do the same?
And if you only greet your brothers, what makes you different from others? Do not even the pagans do the same?
Therefore, be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
The
Beware of doing your acts of charity before men to be seen by them, for your Father who is in heaven will not reward you.
When you give to the needy, do not announce it as if you were blowing a trumpet, as the hypocrites do in synagogues and in the streets, seeking praise from men. I tell you the truth, they have received their full reward.
But when you give to the needy, let not your left hand know what your right hand does.
Even when you give in secret, your Father who sees in secret will reward you. Prayer
"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, so that they may be seen by men. Truly I tell you, they have received their full reward.
But when you pray, go into your room and close the door, and pray to your Father in secret. And your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.
And when you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the pagans do, for they think that their many words will avail them.
Therefore do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need even before you ask him.
Therefore pray as follows: "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name."
Let your kingdom come, and let your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our transgressions, as we also forgive those who trespass against us.
Do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil. #evil. 13:6 The devil (Satan). For you possess the kingdom, the power, and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.
For if you forgive men their transgressions, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their mistakes, your Father will not forgive your mistakes either. (The Fast)
"And when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites who make their faces sad. For they change the appearance of their faces, that men may see that they fast. Verily I say to you, they have received their reward in full."
But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face.
So that people do not notice that you are fasting. Your unseen father sees that, then your father who sees what happens in secret will reward you. God or money?
Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moth and rust corrupt, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up treasures for yourselves in heaven, where neither moth nor rust corrupts, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
The light of the body is the eye. If your eyes are sound, your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. For if the light that is in you is darkness, how great will be the darkness?
No one can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth. #wealth. 24:6 Literally "mamona," an Aramaic word meaning "wealth," in its negative sense, representing here an idol served by people instead of God. The Kingdom of God first.
Therefore I say to you, Do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will wear. For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes.
Look at the birds of the sky; they neither sow nor reap, nor do they gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they?
Who among you can add an hour to your life when you are anxious?
And why do you worry about what you will wear? Look at how the field lilies grow. They toil not, nor do they spin.
But I tell you, no one has ever been dressed like one of them, not even Solomon in all his glory.
If God clothes the grass of the fields, which you see today and which is thrown away tomorrow, will He not much more clothe you, you of little faith?
So do not be anxious or in doubt, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'
For these are the things that the people of the other world strive for, and your Heavenly Father knows that you need them all.
But first seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
Do not worry about tomorrow, for every day has enough trouble of its own; and tomorrow will have its own troubles.
Judging others
Do not judge others, or God will judge you.
For in the way you judge others, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
Why do you see the straw in your brother's eye, but you do not perceive the large beam in your own?
How can you say to your brother, "Let me take the straw out of your eye," when there is a large log in your own?
Thou hypocrite! First cast the beam out of thine own eye, and then thou shalt see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother's eye.
Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine; for they trample them underfoot, and the dogs turn to bite you. Be diligent in prayer.
Ask and it will be given to you, seek and you will find, knock and the door will be opened to you.
For whoever asks receives, and whoever seeks finds, and to whoever knocks, the door will be opened.
And which of you, if his son asks for a loaf of bread, will give him a stone?
Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a snake?
You, despite your wickedness, know how to give good gifts to your children. Is not God in heaven more worthy to give good gifts to those who ask for them? Golden Rule
"Treat others as you would like to be treated, that is the essence of Moses' law and the teachings of the prophets. The path of heaven and the path of hell."
Enter through the narrow door, which leads to salvation. For the door that leads to destruction is wide, and its entrance is easy, and many enter through it.
The door leading to life is very narrow, and the path to it is full of difficulties, and only a few find this path. Warning against false teachings
Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
You will know them by their fruits. For it does not gather grapes from thorns, nor does it gather figs from thistles!
Just as every good tree bears good fruit, so every bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.
Every tree that bears not good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.
Therefore you will know them by their fruits.
Not everyone who says, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but those who do the will of my Father in heaven.
Many will say to me on that last day, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name? Did we not cast out demons in your name? Did we not do many wonders in your name?"
Then I shall clearly tell them: I never knew you. Depart from me, doers of evil. The wise man and the fool.
Anyone who hears my teachings and acts upon them is like a wise man who built his house on a rock.
And it rained, and the floodwaters rose, and the wind blew and struck that house; but it did not fall, for its foundation was on the rock.
And whoever hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
And it rained, and the floodwaters rose, and the wind blew, and it struck that house, and it fell with a mighty crash!
And when Jesus had finished speaking, the people were amazed at his teaching.
Because he was teaching them with authority, not as a teacher of the law.
Jesus cleans a leper.
Then Jesus came down from the mountain, and a great crowd followed him.
And a leper came to him and fell on his face, saying, "Master, if you will, you can make me clean."
Then Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I do will it. Be made clean." And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
Then Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone what has happened to you, but go, show yourself to the priest. #Go...to the priest. 4:8 The priest was to determine, according to the law, when the leper was clean. And he offered the sacrifice commanded by Moses, to teach the people that you had been healed." The faith of a Roman centurion
And Jesus entered a city of Capernaum. And a centurion of the Romans came to him. #centurion 5:8 Literally, "a commander of a hundred." Repeats in verses 8, 13.
And he said, "Sir, my servant is very sick, bedridden at home. He is immobile and in intense pain."
Then Jesus said to him, "I will go and heal him."
Then the officer answered: "Sir, I don't deserve for you to enter my house. All you have to do is say a word and my servant will be healed."
For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under my command. I say to one soldier, 'Go!' and he goes; and to another, 'Come!' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this!' and he does it."
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed, and said to those who followed him, "I tell you the truth, I have not found such faith, even in Israel.
I tell you, many will come from east and west, and take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
But those who were meant to inherit the kingdom will be thrown into outer darkness. There they will weep and gnash their teeth."
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go, and let it be as you have believed." And at that very hour the servant of the centurion was healed. "Take away our sicknesses"
And when Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed, with a high fever.
And when Jesus touched her hand, the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve him.
And in that evening, people brought to him many possessed with evil spirits, and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all the sick.
This happened to fulfill what God said through the prophet Isaiah: "He took our sicknesses, and carried our diseases." Following Jesus
And when Jesus saw that there was a great multitude about him, he commanded his disciples to go over unto the other side of the lake.
Then one of his teachers in religion came to him and said, "O teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Then Jesus said to him, "Even the foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
And another of his disciples said to him, "Lord, let me wait until I bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead." Jesus calms the storm.
And Jesus got into the boat, and his disciples followed him.
Then a great storm arose on the lake, so that the boat was filled with waves. But Jesus was sleeping.
They approached him and woke him up, saying, "Master, help us, for we are drowning."
Then Jesus said to them, "Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?" And he arose, rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
But they were amazed, and said, "Who is this man, that even the winds and the sea obey him?" Jesus cast out evil spirits from two men.
Then Jesus came to the region of the Gerasenes on the other side of the lake. And behold, two men possessed with devils came out of the tombs, extremely violent, so that no one could pass that way.
The evil spirits cried out: "What do you want from us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before our time?"
And there was a great herd of pigs feeding at a distance from them.
The evil spirits pleaded with him and said, "If you let us out, we'll go back to the pigs."
Then Jesus said, "Go." And the evil spirits went out of the men and entered into the pigs; and suddenly the herd of pigs rushed down the steep side of the mountain into the lake, and they drowned in the water.
The shepherds fled into the town, and told the people what had befallen the possessed by evil spirits.
Then all the people of the town came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a paralytic.
Jesus got into a boat and crossed over to the other side of the lake, and he came to his hometown.
Then some men brought to him a man who was paralyzed and lying on a mat. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the teachers of Islamic law began to say, "This man is insulting God with his words."
Jesus knew what they were thinking, and said to them, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?
Which is easier: to say "Your sins are forgiven" or "Get up and walk"?
But I will show you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." And he said to the paralytic, "Get up, take your mat, and go home!"
He got up and went home.
And when the people saw this, they were filled with awe and glorified God, because He had given such power to mankind. When will Jesus come?
And as Jesus was passing by, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. And Jesus said to him, "Follow me!" And he rose up and followed him.
And while he was eating in Matthew's house, tax collectors and sinners came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said, "The well do not need a physician, but the sick."
Go and understand what the book means when it says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). I have not come to call the righteous, but to call sinners. (Mark 2:17) Question about fasting
Then the disciples of John came to him and asked, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
Then Jesus said to them, "Can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
No one patches an old garment with a new piece of cloth, for the new cloth will shrink and tear the old garment, making the hole worse.
People do not put new wine into old skins; otherwise, the skins will burst, and the wine will leak out, and the skins will be ruined. Therefore, new wine is put into new skins, so that both the wine and the skins may be preserved." Jesus raises a dead girl // and heals a bleeding woman
While Jesus was speaking, a ruler of the synagogue came up and knelt before him, saying, "My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Then Jesus stood up and followed him, and his disciples followed him.
And there was a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years. She had come behind Jesus, and touched the hem of his garment.
She said to herself, "I will heal if I but touch his cloak."
Jesus turned and saw her, and said to her, "Daughter, be of good cheer; your faith has made you well." And immediately the woman was made well.
And when Jesus came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, he saw mourners and a crowd of people in turmoil.
He said, "Get out. The boy is not dead, but sleeping." And they laughed at him.
And when the people were gone out, Jesus entered the chamber where the little girl was, and taking her by the hand, he raised her up.
And news of Jesus spread throughout the whole region. Jesus healed the blind // and cast out a demon.
And when Jesus had departed from that place, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Son of David, have mercy on us."
And when Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him, and he said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to heal you?" And they said, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes, saying, "May it be according to your faith."
And the blind received their sight. Then Jesus sternly warned them, saying, "Do not tell anyone what has happened to you."
But they went and spread the news throughout the whole area.
And as they were going, they brought to Jesus a man possessed with a demon, who was mute.
Then Jesus cast out the evil spirit, and the mute began to speak. And the people were amazed, saying, "Never was anything like this seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees began to say, "He drives out demons by the power of Beelzebul, #Beelzebul, 34:9 who is the name of a demon. The chief of the demons." The harvest is plentiful.
And Jesus was traveling through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom. He was healing every disease and every ailment among the people.
And when Jesus saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, for they were weary and burdened, like sheep without a shepherd.
Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
"Pray to the Lord of the harvest to send two harvesters to the fields."
Jesus sends his disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal every disease and sickness.
And these are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon, who is also called Peter, and his brother Andrew, James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus,
Simon, also known as "the Zealot," #the Zealot. 4:10 He was a member of a Jewish political group that resisted Roman rule, called the Zealots. And Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus.
And Jesus sent these twelve, giving them these instructions: "Do not go into Gentile territory, and do not enter any Samaritan city."
Rather, go to the stray sheep of the children of Israel.
They declared, "The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand."
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cure the lepers, and cast out demons. You received this power for free, so give it away for free as well.
Do not carry in your belts gold, silver, or copper coins.
Do not carry a bag or extra clothes or shoes or a cane. For the worker deserves his wage.
And when you enter any city or village, seek out someone worthy to welcome you, and stay with them until you leave the city.
And when you enter a house, greet its people.
If the people of the house are worthy, then your peace will come upon them. But if they are unworthy, then your peace will return to you.
If anyone does not welcome you or listen to your message in a house or in a city, leave that house or city and shake the dust off your feet.
I tell you the truth, on the day of judgment, Sodom and Gomorrah will be in a better state than that city. Jesus warns of tribulation.
Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents, and innocent as doves.
Beware of people, for they will deliver you up to be judged in their courts, and they will scourge you in their assemblies.
They will deliver you up to rulers and kings because you are my disciples. This will be your opportunity to bear witness to me, both to Jews and to Gentiles.
And when they capture you, do not worry about what you will say, for you will be given the words at that hour.
Remember, it is not you who will speak, but the spirit of your father who will speak through you.
A brother will deliver his brother to death, and a father his son. And children will rise up against their parents and put them to death.
And all men will hate you because of my name, but he who remains faithful to the end, he will be saved.
When they persecute you in one city, flee to another. I tell you the truth, you will not finish going through all the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes again.
There is no student better than his teacher, and no slave greater than his master.
Let the student be content to become like his teacher, and let the servant be content to become like his master. If they call the head of the house Beelzebul, #Beelzebul. 25:10 (a name of Satan), referring to Matthew 9:34, then what will they call the rest of the household? Fear of God, not of men.
So do not fear them, for nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing is secret that will not be known.
Whatever I tell you in the dark, say it in the light; and whatever is whispered in your ears, proclaim from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body, but cannot kill the soul; but rather fear him who can destroy both body and soul in hell.
Aren't two sparrows sold for a single coin? Yet, not one of them falls to the ground without your Father's permission.
Even your hair, every strand, is numbered.
If you are not afraid, you are worth more than many sparrows. To acknowledge Christ in front of people.
Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will acknowledge before my Father in heaven.
And whoever denies me before men, I will deny before my Father in heaven. First, Christ.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but the sword!
I have come: A man cannot part from his father, a daughter from her mother, or a daughter-in-law from her mother-in-law.
"His enemies are his own family!"
Because whoever loves their father and mother more than me, does not deserve to be part of my circle. Whoever loves their son or daughter more than me, does not deserve to be part of my circle.
And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
He who seeks to save his life will lose it, but he who loses his life for my sake will gain it.
He who welcomes you welcomes me, and he who welcomes me welcomes him who sent me.
He who welcomes a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward. And he who welcomes a righteous person because he is righteous will receive a righteous person's reward.
"And whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of my humble students because he is my student, I tell you, he will not lose his reward."
John the Baptist and Jesus
And when Jesus had finished teaching his twelve disciples, he left that place and went to teach and proclaim his message in the region of Galilee. Jesus and John the Baptist
While John the Baptist was in prison, he heard of all that Christ was doing, and he sent a message with some of his disciples.
I asked him: "Are you the one we're waiting for, or should we wait for someone else?"
Then Jesus answered and said to them, "Go, and tell John what you have seen and heard."
Behold, the blind shall see, and the lame shall walk, and the lepers shall be cleansed, and the deaf shall hear, and the dead shall live, and the poor shall hear the gospel.
And congratulations to those who do not hesitate to believe in me.
And when his disciples had departed, Jesus began to speak to the multitudes about John, saying, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, I tell you, those who wear luxurious clothing live in kings' palaces.
Why did you go out? To see a man wearing soft clothes? Those who wear soft clothes live in kings' palaces.
Then why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, you have seen greater than a prophet!
This is what was written about him: "Behold, I send My messenger before you. He will prepare your way before you."
I tell you the truth, no one born of a woman is greater than John the Baptist. But the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than him.
From the time of John the Baptist to this day, the Kingdom has faced violent assaults, and the violent have tried to take it by force.
Because the law of Moses and all the prophets prophesied until John.
If you wish to accept what the prophets and the scripture say, John is Elijah who they prophesied would come. #Elijah … his coming. 14:11 Elijah was one of God's prophets around 850 BCE. The Jews expected his coming based on Malachi 4:5-6.
"He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
What does this generation resemble? It resembles children sitting in markets, calling out to their companions, saying:
We played for you, yet you did not dance. We sang for you funeral songs, yet you did not weep!
John came, who did not eat like the others and did not drink wine like the others, and people said of him, 'He has a demon.'
Then came the Son of Man, eating and drinking, and seen among tax collectors and sinners; and the people murmured, saying, "Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!" But the fruit of wisdom is righteousness. "Jesus warns sinful cities"
Then Jesus began to rebuke the cities in which most of his miracles had been done, because their inhabitants did not repent of their sins.
He said, "Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Sidon! For if the miracles that were done among you had been done in Tire and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, and they would have been dressed in sackcloth and sat in the ashes."
But I say to you, it will be more bearable for the people of Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.
And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? Nay, thou shalt be brought down to hell: for if the miracles had been done which were done in thee, in Sodom, it had remained unto this day.
But I tell you, the case of the people of Sodom will be more bearable on the day of judgment than yours." - Jesus is the source of comfort.
At that time, Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned, and revealed them to the humble, yes, to the children.
Yes, Father, because you were pleased to do this."
The Father has given me everything. No one knows the Son but the Father, and no one knows the Father but the Son, and those whom the Son chooses to reveal him to.
Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.
Bear my yoke #myyoke. 29:11 A yoke is a wooden device placed on animals to help them carry heavy loads, and it is a Jewish symbol for the law. You, learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
"For the yoke I lay on you is easy, and the burden I place on you is light."
Jesus: Lord of the Sabbath
At that time, Jesus went out into the fields on a Sabbath day to walk. His disciples, feeling hungry, began to pluck and eat the ears of grain.
But when the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Behold, your disciples are doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath."
Then Jesus said to them, "Have you not read in the Scriptures, 'What David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him'?"
He entered the house of God and ate of the bread offered to God, though it was not permitted to him or to those with him to eat that bread, but only to the priests."
Have you not also read in the law of Moses how the priests on the Sabbath day do not keep the law regarding the Sabbath, and yet are not held accountable for their actions?
But I tell you, there is something greater than this structure here.
"If you knew what the book means when it says, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' #I desire... not animals. 7:12 From the book of Hosea 6:6. When you judged those innocent ones."
"For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath." - Healing on the Sabbath
Then he left that place and went to their complex.
And there was a man whose hand was withered. And he asked people, saying, "Does the law allow to heal a withered hand on the Sabbath?" They asked him this question, that they might have an accusation against him.
He said to them, "Suppose one of you has a sheep that falls into a pit on the Sabbath; will you not lift it out?"
And man is more important than a sheep. Therefore, doing good on Saturday is in accordance with the law."
Then Jesus said to the man with the withered hand, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and it was restored, and became as sound as the other.
Then the Pharisees went out and conspired together how they might kill Jesus. Jesus: God's chosen servant
Jesus perceived their intent, and left that place. Great crowds followed him, and he healed all who were sick.
He ordered them not to reveal his identity.
This happened to fulfill what God said through the prophet Isaiah:
Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul delights. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall proclaim justice to the nations.
He will not argue with anyone, nor will he shout, and no one will hear his voice in their streets.
It will not break even a bent reed, and it will not extinguish even a smoking wick. It will persist until justice prevails.
"And all nations will put their hope in him." - Sultan of Jesus
Then they brought to him a man who was blind and mute, because a demon had possessed him, and he healed him. So the mute began to speak and see.
And the people were amazed, and said, "Can this man be the son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man drives out demons by the power of Beelzebul, #Beelzebul. 24:12 a name that means 'lord of the demons.' Also in verse 27. 'The prince of demons.'"
Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "The fate of every kingdom that is divided against itself and every city or house that is divided against itself will be destruction.
If Satan is casting out spirits and fighting against himself, how can his kingdom stand?
For if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your disciples cast them out? They judge you.
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, it is clear that the Kingdom of God has come upon you.
How can one enter a strong man's house and plunder his possessions, unless they first tie up the strong man? Then they can plunder his house.
"He who is not with me is against me. And he who does not gather with me scatters."
Therefore I say unto you, Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven.
Whoever speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. The fruit reveals the truth.
To get a good fruit, plant a good tree. A bad tree will give you a bad fruit. For a tree is known by its fruit.
O children of vipers, how can you speak good things when your hearts are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
For the good man brings forth good things from his good treasure, and the evil man brings forth evil things from his evil treasure.
But I say to you, on the day of judgment, every word they have spoken will be asked for.
"Your words will determine your innocence or guilt." "Jewish leaders demand proof."
Then some of the teachers of the law and the Pharisees asked him, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
Then He said to them, "This evil generation seeks a sign, and no sign shall be given to it but the sign of the prophet Jonah."
Just as Jonah remained in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man remain in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
The people of Nineveh will stand against this generation on the day of judgment, and will condemn them because they repented when they heard the warning from Jonah. And now here before you is one greater than Jonah.
The Queen of the South will stand #QueenOfTheSouth. 42:12 The Queen of Sheba. She traveled over two thousand kilometers to hear the wisdom of God on the lips of King Solomon. See 1 Kings 10: 1-13. The day of judgment against this generation and she will condemn it. For she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And now here before you is one greater than Solomon. Empty soul
When an unclean spirit leaves a person, it goes through dry places seeking a place of rest, but it does not find any.
Then he says, "I will return to the house I came from." He goes and finds the house empty, swept, and in order.
Then he goes and brings seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there. So that man's last state is worse than his first. Thus it will be with this wicked generation." Jesus' disciples are his family.
While Jesus was speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers arrived, standing outside and asking to speak to him.
Then one of the people standing by said to Jesus, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside and want to speak to you."
Then Jesus answered him, "Who is my mother and my brothers?"
Then he pointed to his disciples and said, "These are my mother and brothers."
"For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
Like seeds
That day, Jesus left the house and sat down by the lake.
A large crowd gathered around him. So he got into a boat and sat down in it, while people stood on the shore.
And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, A sower went forth to sow.
And as he sowed, some of the seed fell by the way, and the birds came and devoured it.
Some of the seeds fell on rocky ground, where there was not enough soil, and the grains grew quickly because the soil was not deep.
But when the sun rose, it burned, and since it had no roots, it withered.
Some seeds fell among the thorns, and the thorns choked the growth of the plants.
And other seeds fell on good soil, and they bore fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.
"He who has ears, let him hear." (Hearing and Understanding)
And the disciples came to him and asked, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
Then Jesus answered them, "Have I not chosen you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?"
Because whoever has #possesses. 12:13 Perhaps it means "he who possesses understanding," for he will have more and overflow with it, but he who does not possess will have what he has taken from him.
That is why I speak to them in parables, for though they see, they do not perceive; though they hear, they do not understand.
And thus it is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: "You shall hear, but not understand; you shall see, but not perceive."
The mind of this people has become dull, and their hearing heavy. They have closed their eyes, so they cannot see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their hearts, lest they turn back to me and I heal them.
Blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.
I tell you the truth, many kings and righteous people have longed to see what you see and have not seen, and have yearned to hear what you hear and have not heard. It is like the seed sown on good soil.
"So listen to the explanation as if it were seeds:
When a person hears the message of the kingdom but does not understand it, the wicked one, that is, the devil (also in verse 38), comes and takes away the seeds sown in his heart. This is the meaning of the seeds that fell by the wayside.
But those that fell on the rocky ground are like someone who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.
But since it has no roots in itself, it endures for a short time only, and when tribulation and persecution come because of the word that went before, it quickly loses its faith.
As for the one that fell among the thorns, it is like someone who hears the word, but the worries of life and the allure of wealth choke the word, so it does not bear fruit.
"But he who has been sown on good soil, it is he who hears the word and understands it, and bears fruit. Sometimes a hundred times over, sometimes sixty, sometimes thirty." Like wheat and weeds.
And he told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
But while the people were sleeping, the enemy of the man came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and then went away.
And when the wheat grew and formed ears, the weeds also grew.
Then his servants came to him and said, "Master, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Then where did these weeds come from?"
Then the man answered, "It was my enemy who did that." His servants asked him, "Shall we go and uproot it?"
Then the man answered, "No, for when you weed out the weeds, you may uproot wheat with them.
Let them grow together until the harvest, and then I will say to the harvesters, 'First gather the weeds and tie them in bundles to burn. But the wheat, gather it and store it in my barn.' For example, mustard and yeast.
Then Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.
They are the smallest of seeds. But when they grow, they become the largest of garden plants, becoming a big tree, so that even sky birds come to it, and make their nests in its branches.
And he told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until all was leavened."
Jesus spoke all these things in parables. He did not speak to them without using parables.
This is what God said through the prophet: "I will open my mouth in parables, and I will speak of hidden things from the creation of the world."
Then Jesus sent away the crowd and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He said to them, "The Son of Man is the one who sows the good seed."
And the field is the world, and the good seed are those who have the kingdom. But the weeds are those who belong to the evil one.
And the enemy that sowed them is Satan. And the harvest is the end of the world. And the reapers are the angels.
"And as weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so shall be the end of the world."
For the Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all who do evil and all who do sin.
They then throw them into the blazing oven. There people cry and grip their teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Whoever has ears, let them hear. Like a treasure and a pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. A man found it and hid it again. And from joy he went and sold all that he had and bought that field.
The kingdom of heaven is like a merchantman seeking beautiful pearls.
And when he found a very precious pearl, he went and sold all that he had and bought it. Like a fishing net.
The kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea, and caught fish of every kind.
And when the net was full, the fishermen pulled it onto the shore. Then they sat down and began to sort through the fish, keeping the good ones and throwing the bad ones away.
This is what will happen at the end of the world, when the angels will separate the wicked from the righteous.
Then they threw the wicked into the blazing furnace. There the people cried out and held their teeth tight.
And Jesus asked his disciples, "Do you understand all these things?" And they said, "Yes."
Then he said to them, "Therefore every teacher of the law who is a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a head of a household who brings out of his treasure chamber new and old treasures." Jesus is going to his city.
When Jesus had finished telling these parables, he left that place.
And when he went into his town, he began to teach them in their synagogue. And all were amazed, and said, "From whence has this man wisdom and miracles?"
Isn't he the son of the carpenter? Isn't his mother Mary? Aren't his brothers Jacob, Joseph, Simon, and Judah?
"Don't all his sisters live among us? Then where did he get all that he has?"
And that was an obstacle for them to accept him. But Jesus said to them: "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own house!"
He did not perform many miracles there, because of their unbelief.
Herod hears about Jesus.
At that time, Herod the tetrarch, #tetrarch 1:14 literally "the ruler of a quarter," heard of Jesus. The Romans had divided Palestine into four provinces, so the governor of each province was called a tetrarch or ruler of a quarter. See Luke 3:1 about Jesus.
Then he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and for this reason miracles are done through him!" The killing of John the Baptist
Herod was the one who arrested John and put him in prison, because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
Because John said to Herod: "It is not right for you to take your brother's wife."
Therefore Herod wanted to kill him, but he feared the people, for they regarded John as a prophet.
But when Herod's birthday came, Herodias' daughter danced before him and his guests, and she pleased Herod greatly.
He even promised and swore to give her whatever she asked for.
But her mother had taught her what to ask, so she said, "Give me John the Baptist's head here on a plate."
The king was saddened, but he ordered her request to be fulfilled due to his oath, and in respect for his guests.
So he sent someone to behead John in prison.
Then he brought his head on a plate and gave it to her, who gave it to her mother.
Then the disciples of John came and took his body, and buried it. And they went away and told Jesus what had happened. Jesus fed more than five thousand.
When Jesus heard this, he got into a boat and went to a deserted place. The crowds, having heard this, followed him on foot from their towns.
And when He descended to the shore, He saw a great multitude, so He felt compassion for them and healed the sick among them.
And in the evening, his disciples came to him and said, "This place is remote and it is already very late. Send the people away to the villages to buy food for them."
But Jesus said to them, "There is no need for them to go away. Give them something to eat."
Then his disciples said to him, "We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish."
Then Jesus said to them, "Bring her to me."
And he commanded the people to sit down on the grass. Then Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish, and having given thanks, he raised his eyes to heaven and broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people.
So they ate and were satisfied, and they lifted up what was left over from the food, and it filled twelve baskets full of leftovers.
And there were five thousand men who had eaten, besides women and children. Jesus walked on water.
Then Jesus told his disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd.
And after sending them away, he went up the mountain alone to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.
And the boat had reached the middle of the lake, and the waves were crashing against it violently, because the wind was blowing in the opposite direction of the boat.
And a little before dawn, Jesus came to them, walking on the lake.
When his disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified and said, "It's a ghost!" And out of fear they cried out.
Jesus said to them immediately, "Take heart! It is I; do not be afraid."
Then Peter answered him, "Lord, if it is you, bid me come to you on the water."
And he said to him, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came toward Jesus.
But when Peter noticed the strong wind, he became afraid and began to sink, and he cried out, "Lord, save me."
Then Jesus stretched out his hand and immediately grabbed him, saying, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
And when Jesus and Peter entered the boat, the wind ceased.
And those who were in the boat prostrated themselves before Jesus, saying, "You are the Son of God, truly." Jesus healed many.
And when they crossed the lake, they arrived at the area of Genisart.
And when the people of that region knew of Jesus, they spread the news throughout the surrounding area, and they brought to him all who were sick.
And they besought him, saying, Let us just touch the hem of his garment. And all who touched it were made whole.
The law of God and the customs of men
Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law from Jerusalem came to Jesus, and asked him,
Why are your students breaking the traditions we inherited from our ancestors? They don't wash their hands before eating.
Jesus answered them, "Why do you break God's command because of your traditions?"
God commanded and said: "Honor your father and your mother," #Honor ... your mother. 4:15 From the Book of Exodus 20:12, and the Book of Deuteronomy 5:16. He said: "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." #Whoever curses ... shall be put to death. 4:15 From the Book of Exodus 21:17.
But you say, "If anyone says to his father or mother, 'I cannot help you, for I have given all that I have to the Lord,' he is not obligated to honor his father or mother."
And thus you have disregarded God's command because of your traditions.
O you hypocrites, you have been fulfilled in the prophecy of Isaiah when he said about you:
This people praises me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
Their worship is in vain, for they follow teachings that are nothing but human commandments. »
Jesus called the people to him and said to them, "Listen to me and understand the things that I say."
Not what enters a man's mouth defiles him, but what comes out of it, that defiles him."
Then his disciples came to him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard your words?"
Jesus answered, "Every plant that my Father has not planted will be uprooted."
Leave them, for they are blind leading the blind. If a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into a pit."
Then Peter answered, "Explain to us the meaning of this parable."
Then Jesus said, "Don't you understand yet?"
Don't you understand that everything that goes into a human's mouth goes into the stomach, and then comes out again?
But what comes out of a man's mouth issues from his heart. And this defiles a man.
For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander.
These are the things that defile a person, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person." - Jesus helps a stranger woman.
And Jesus departed from thence, and came into the region of Tyre and Sidon.
And a Canaanite woman who lived in that region came to him, crying out, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, O son of David. My daughter is possessed by a demon and is suffering greatly."
Jesus did not answer her a word. Then his disciples came to him and asked him, saying, "Send her away, for she is crying out after us."
He said, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
But the woman approached him and fell at his feet, saying, "O Lord, help me."
Jesus answered her, "It is not good to take the children's food and throw it to the dogs."
She said: "That's true, sir, but even dogs eat what falls from their owners' table."
Then Jesus answered her, "Woman, your faith is great. Let it be done as you wish." And at that moment her daughter was healed. Jesus healed many.
And Jesus departed from thence, and came into a place near to the sea, on the other side of the lake of Galilee: and he sat on the mountain.
Then great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, the blind, the mute, the maimed, and many others. And they laid them down at his feet, and he healed them.
And the people marveled, saying, "How is this? For even the mute speak, the lame walk, the paralyzed are made whole, and the blind see. And they glorified God of Israel." Jesus fed more than four thousand.
Then Jesus called his disciples and said to them, "I have compassion on this crowd; they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."
Then his disciples said to him, "Where shall we get enough bread here in this remote place to feed all these people?"
Then Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" And they said, "Seven loaves and a few small fish."
Then Jesus commanded the people to sit down on the ground.
And he took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to distribute to all.
So they all ate and were satisfied. Then they gathered up the leftovers, which filled seven baskets.
And there were four thousand men that ate, besides women and children.
And when Jesus had sent away the crowd, he got into a boat and went to Magdala.
The Jewish leaders questioned Jesus.
And the Pharisees and the Sadducees came to Jesus, testing him, and asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
Then Jesus answered them, "When it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'
And in the early morning, you say, "Today will be stormy, for the sky is red and gloomy." You are good at interpreting weather signs, but you are not good at understanding the times in which you live!
This wicked, depraved generation seeks a sign to believe, and no sign shall be given them but the sign of Jonah." Then Jesus left them and departed. Ununderstanding.
And Jesus' disciples crossed over to the other side of the lake, but they forgot to bring bread.
And Jesus said unto them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees."
And the disciples began to talk among themselves, saying, "But we have no bread!"
Jesus knew what they were saying, and he said to them, "How is it that you do not have faith? Why are you arguing among yourselves about the lack of bread?"
Have you not yet realized? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets of the leftovers you gathered?
Do you not remember the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets of the scraps you gathered?
Why don't you understand that I wasn't talking to you about ordinary bread, but warning you to protect yourselves from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?
Then his disciples understood that he did not intend to warn them against leaven in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter declared that Jesus is the Christ.
And when Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that I, the Son of Man, am?"
Then his disciples answered him, "Some say you are John the Baptist; others, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or some other prophet."
Then he said to them, "And who do you say that I am?"
Then Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Then Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven."
And I say to you, you are Peter, #Peter. 18:16 From the Greek "Petros" meaning "rock." On this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades #Hades will not prevail against it. 18:16 That is, the power of death. You will not be able to conquer it.
"And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
Then he sternly warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus spoke about the necessity of his death.
From that time on, Jesus began to tell his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and that he would suffer many things from the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law. He must be killed, and on the third day he would rise.
But Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "By no means, Lord! This shall never happen to you!"
Then Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, because you are not thinking of God's things but of human things."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me.
For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
What does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and lose his soul? And what can a man do to regain his life?
For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and will reward each one according to his works.
I tell you the truth, among those standing here there are some who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Jesus with Moses and Elijah
After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and led them up onto a high mountain to be alone.
And while they were there, Jesus' appearance changed, and he shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.
Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared to the disciples, and they were talking with Jesus.
Then Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good to be here! If you wish, I can put up three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And while Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, my Beloved, in whom I am well pleased; listen to him."
When the students heard that, they were terrified and fell to the ground on their faces.
Jesus came near and touched them, saying, "Arise, do not be afraid."
And when they looked around, they saw no one but Jesus.
And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, "Do not tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man is raised from the dead."
His disciples asked him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?" #Elijah… First. 10:17 Elijah was one of God's prophets around 850 BCE. The Jews expected his coming based on Malachi 4:5-6.
Then Jesus answered them, "Yes, Elijah will come first, and will restore all things."
But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they did not recognize him, but treated him as they chose. And the Son of Man will also be treated in the same way by them."
Then his disciples understood that he spake of John the Baptist. Jesus cast out a devil from a man that was possessed with a devil.
And when they had returned to the crowd, a man came to Jesus and knelt before him.
And he said, "Have mercy on my son, O Lord, for he is epileptic and suffers greatly. He often falls into fire or water.
"I brought him to your students, but they couldn't heal him."
Then Jesus said to the unbelieving and perverse generation, "How long shall I be with you, and how long shall I put up with you?" And he said to the man, "Bring your son here to me."
Then Jesus commanded the evil spirit to come out of him, and the demon came out at once; and the boy was healed instantly.
Then his disciples came to him privately and asked, "Why couldn't we cast him out?"
Then Jesus said to them, "Because of your little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; nothing will be impossible for you."
But this kind comes out only through prayer and fasting." - Jesus prophesizing about his impending death.
And as they were walking together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men."
They will kill him, but on the third day he will rise from the dead." So the disciples were deeply saddened. The burden of the temple
And when Jesus entered Capernaum, he came to Peter, who was collecting the temple tax, two drachmas a head. And he asked him, "Does not your teacher pay the temple tax?"
Then Peter answered and said, "Yes, it is." And Peter went home. But Jesus called him, and said, "Simon, tell me, from whom do kings of the earth collect tribute and taxes? Is it from their own children, or from strangers?"
Then Peter answered and said, "They gather it from the Gentiles." Jesus said to him, "Therefore the sons are free from it."
But to avoid causing them a problem, go to the lake and cast your fishing line. Then take the first fish you catch and open its mouth. You will find a coin worth four drachmas inside. Take it and give it to them for me and for you."
